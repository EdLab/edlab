As part of our design sessions for the project on adaptive learning applications, we will be creating prototypes of new infrastructure elements to support the research, development, dissemination, and utilization of adaptive learning approaches and tools. 

The most difficult aspect of this will be communicating what we mean by “infrastructure,” that is, those things that support the adaptive applications and approaches, not the applications themselves.

In the fifth floor space we will be creating four examples to jump-start the thinking of the design teams.  Each of these four will highlight one aspect of the development-research-dissemination-utilization cycle to be realized through a widely accessible online site:

Development — The “Make” Site — Here the emphasis will be on providing tools to scaffold the development of adaptive applications for learning.  Such scaffolding tools should allow both experienced developers and novice educator developers and student developers to create adaptive applications to support learning.  This could be a powerful educational site for all those interested in creating adaptive applications.

Research — The Test Bed — Here the aim will be create a community of educators (students and teachers willing to try new adaptive learning applocations) and to construct the means to collect data and share with Developers. If we can achieve a high degree of automation in the data gathering and reporting, this will also be a great example of our embedded research approach.

Dissemination - The Adaptive Learning Journal — Here the goal is to create an online publication reporting on all the latest developments in adaptive learning applications and approaches.  This could be part of a next generation TCR/Trends in Ed/EdLab Mashup.  There is a good deal of room for innovation in how we catalog and display the applications.

Utilization — The Exchange — Here we will create a sales and exchange site to facilitate the distribution of applications and to track their utilization and performance.  We might imagine a “stock exchange” for adaptive learning applications with a live ticker reporting on current popularity and even pricing if we include a bidding function.
