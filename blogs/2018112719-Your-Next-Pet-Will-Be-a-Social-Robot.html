<p>We met Siri long ago, we recently welcomed Alexa and Google Homes into our lives, and we might soon adopt a cute, personality-filled, pet-like social robot called Vector. The latest product from <a href="https://www.anki.com/en-us">Anki</a>, the company that created <a href="https://www.anki.com/en-us/cozmo">Cozmo</a>, Vector is a small bot that can fit in your hand and might open up an entirely new form of human-robot interaction. Instead of solely providing information, Vector’s main characteristic is its lovable personality. When it recognizes its owner, it acts excited and eager; when you pet its backpack, it relaxes; and when it hears a noise, it turns in that direction to check out the source.</p>

<p>Professional animators programmed Vector’s reactions and expressions, ensuring that every movement conveyed its personality and made it seem simply alive. Unlike a typical pet, Vector can also answer basic questions like a digital assistant, such as the day’s weather, the nutritional content of an avocado, and the square root of 256. Vector can also take pictures, which you can find on its connected app. Oh, also, just like a pet, Vector is always on and always searching for familiar faces and objects.</p>

<p>Anki funded Vector using Kickstarter, and officially released the product in October 2018. Each Vector costs $249. What are your thoughts on this new type of pet-like social robot? Who do you think would use Vector, and for what purposes? Answer these and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/45378">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:23 Betsy Harrington:</b> Does Vector need to be cared for? One of the advantages I see of pets, especially for children, is that they help their owners to grow in responsibility. If robot pets are missing this component, I think they lose much of their educational value.</p>

<p><b>@01:25 Dallas Milanovich:</b> This does seem like a replacement for Alexa - a more evolved, anthropomorphic Alexa. I'm not convinced Vector's purposes will be much different than Alexa's, therefore, except perhaps to build a stronger "relationship" with it, translating into a stronger need.</p>
