<p>Although many academic disciplines incorporate ethics education into their mix, there is no single established framework for how to teach ethical decision making. Yet it would be difficult to find someone who didn’t believe ethical thinking was an important skill to hone. It is difficult, however, to determine the best practices for strengthening those skills. This is particularly true because at times, ethical critical thinking might be best approached indirectly, such as in video game playing.</p>
 
<p>Researchers recently examined how well a specific role-playing video game, <a href="http://fable.wikia.com/wiki/Fable_III">Fable III</a>, tested players’ ethical decision making thought processes. They included 30 participants in the study, all of whom were males aged 18­–30. Of those, 20 were observed making ethical decisions in Fable III. The remaining 10 were given the same ethical decisions that the gamers faced but in written text. The researchers then examined the different critical thinking skills and thought processes that each group used while thinking through the ethical dilemmas.</p>
 
<p>They found that the gamers used just as many critical thinking skills to make the ethical decisions in Fable III as the participants did who were given the written scenarios. This demonstrates that video games can be a useful educational tool when it comes to ethical decision making. More than that, though, the researchers also used their findings to compile a list of four design elements that amp up ethical critical thinking in any gaming or written scenario:</p><ul>
 
<p><li><b>Enable the cultivation of relationships:</b> Researchers found that gamers used more critical thinking skills when they were forced to make a difficult decision regarding another character they had grown close with in the game. This was not the case with characters they barely knew.</p>
 
<li><b>Enable the exchange of ideas and perspectives:</b> Several of the gamers playing Fable III reached out to friends and family outside the game to help them think through the ethical dilemmas their character faced. Having these conversations can boost certain critical thinking skills.</p>
 
<li><b>Provide appropriate, meaningful feedback:</b> For ethical decisions to carry weight, players need to feel like their choices carry serious and important consequences in the game. In Fable III, this was accomplished by having ethical decisions affect the appearance of both the character and their surroundings. Players need to see tangible reactions to their choices to encourage more serious critical thinking.</p>
 
<li><b>Enable iteration:</b> At times, Fable III players wanted to replay their decisions to see the string of consequences that could arise from other choices. This could come in the form of allowing players to redo decisions or enabling them to step outside the situation and test out different choices before making one.</p>
 
<p>While these design principles apply to video games, they can also be used to create any ethical education material, including text-based scenarios. This study suggests that if instructors use these principles to design ethics activities, learners will practice more critical thinking skills and thought processes. That way, when faced with difficult ethical decisions in the real world, they’ll be less likely to run away and more likely to say, "Game on."</p>
