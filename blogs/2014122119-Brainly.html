<p><a href="http://brainly.com/">Brainly</a> is a variation on online tutoring that draws inspiration from crowdsourcing platforms like Reddit. Students of all ages can post questions about their homework on the site and teachers or more advanced students can answer the questions. Other students and teachers can vote on whether the answer seems right or offer a different response. Users who successfully answer questions (or answer uncontested), accumulate points that they can then use to ask their own questions.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Brainly asks students to categorize their questions by subject, which is helpful for students visiting the site with similar questions. It also helps teachers and advanced learners find questions to answer in their areas of expertise. The ability to discuss the answers, correct, and build off of various responses means that finding information on the site is an organic learning process. Engaging with others around asking and answering questions is fun and enhanced by the game-like element of winning points. The owl mascot and other elements of the design make the online community space comfortable and welcoming.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The process of answering questions to ask questions seems a bit uneven, especially if users on the site are polarized between younger students asking questions and advanced learners who only answer questions. In order for the site to work, learners of all levels have to be actively engaged in both asking and answering. In addition, the quality control could be better; some of the discussion strings have incorrect answers without reply and there is no way to tell these apart from correctly answered questions. Brainly prohibits users from pasting any external links, which might be a spam control measure, but it also prevents responders from adding citations to their answers. Though there are moderators, the volume and speed of questions and answers on the site and the fact that Brainly incentivizes even wrong answers means that answer quality will probably always be an issue.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Brainly is a great place for students to explore and ask questions. The idea behind the site is sound: building a community around inquiry.  At times it seems like the site is being used primarily for cheating on homework. Brainly might have to experiment with shifting the point system to help build the right kind of community. Incentivizing teacher and expert participation might work to inspire quality on the site and <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/760 ">there are ways to do this</a> without relying on gamification. Brainly is continuing to refine the product and the site is heavily used, so small shifts could have the potential to make this site the answer to some great educational questions.</p>
