            One of the most defining features of education is the yellow school bus. For most students, the yellow bus, in addition to been a means of transportation to and from school, also represents a host of things. Researchers from around the world are now experimenting with a concept dubbed “<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2011/08/25/2011-08-25_hop_on_a_walking_school_bus_to_cut_obesity_walktoschool_program_could_help_kids_.html">the walking school bus</a>,” in which students either meet up to walk or bike to school together under the supervision of an adult. A need to cut obesity rates among young people and budget cuts are some of the reasons behind the need for a walking school bus.

Whether the walking school bus can replace the traditional bus as one of the primary ways of getting students to school remains to be seen but there is data to suggest the concept is gaining momentum. In a study of 149 fourth grade students in Houston, Texas, researchers found that children who participated in a walking school bus program were twice as likely to continue “active commuting”-meaning opting for people-powered transportation rather than automobiles–and increased their daily activity of moderate-to-vigorous activity by seven minutes a day.

It is worth noting that most of the students in the study were ethnic minorities from low-income families who lived within a mine of their respective schools.
