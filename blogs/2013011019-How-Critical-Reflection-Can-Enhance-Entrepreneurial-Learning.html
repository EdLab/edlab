<b>Title:</b> Entrepreneurial Learning and Critical Reflection: Discontinuous Events as Triggers for ‘Higher –level’ Learning<p>

<b>Author:</b> Jason Cope (2003)<p>


<b>Study Design:</b>
Entrepreneurship has become a prevalent topic in recent years. Understanding how entrepreneurs learn can foster leadership among budding enterprises, which potentially could enhance innovation. One emergent theme is the importance of critically reflecting on learning experiences. Critical reflection entails not only questioning how to take future action, but also asking ‘why’-oriented questions that add insight into the reasons for and consequences of actions.
<p>

To add to this growing body of literature, Jason Cope wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how entrepreneurs learned from experiences while managing small enterprises. In his <a href="http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/34/4/429.full.pdf"> study</a>, he asked six entrepreneurs how they dealt with stressful moments associated with the initial stages of entrepreneurship. For example, one of the study participants described a conflict with one of his employees, which ignited a full- blown dispute across his organization. Another explained how he dealt with the realization that his enterprise was going bankrupt. The participants described how they spent hours deeply reflecting on why these discontinuous events occurred and how they could proceed. <p> 
<b>Findings:</b> While these challenges were initially perceived as negative situations, the findings of the study highlighted that critical reflection led to higher levels of learning that ultimately had important outcomes on both a personal and professional front. Fundamentally questioning how one makes sense of the world, higher-level learning leads to new assumptions and conceptual frameworks that affect how the learner takes action across situations. Upon reflection, the participant in the study who experienced conflict with his employees came to realize his limitations as a manager, which ultimately led to a fundamental change in his role within the organization. The entrepreneur who faced bankruptcy took action that led him to become "more acutely aware of trying to look after everyone and … [be] far more inclusive…it was arguably … a turning point." The findings suggest that when critical reflection is thrown into the mix, disconcerting challenges have the potential to lead to more profound learning compared to the accumulation of routinized learning that occurs through habitual day-to-day events.     
<p>  
The importance of reflecting on experiences to foster learning is not a new concept in adult education, but entrepreneurship offers a unique context. Considering that starting a new enterprise typically entails substantial financial and emotional investment by entrepreneurs, this significant "investment in the self" is what makes the study of entrepreneurs such a fascinating canvas for examining the process of learning.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward: </b>
If aspiring entrepreneurs could learn to incorporate critically reflective practices into their entrepreneurial journey, then they might be able to gain important insights from challenging situations. The ultimate learning outcome of these discontinuous events could enhance their capacity to be effective innovators. Based on the findings of this study, it would be beneficial for formal entrepreneurial programs to introduce learners to a variety of reflective methods so that they could utilize them throughout their entrepreneurial journey.
