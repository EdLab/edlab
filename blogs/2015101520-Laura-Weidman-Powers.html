Laura Weidman Powers is the co-founder and CEO of non-profit <a href="http://bit.ly/1KnHPYF">CODE2040</a>, which creates pathways to success in the innovation economy for Blacks and Latino/as. She has a background in entrepreneurship, nonprofit management, youth development, and technology. Weidman Powers previously founded a nonprofit arts education organization in West Philadelphia that is currently celebrating its tenth year, and another for-profit tutoring company. Weidman Powers is a 2013 Echoing Green and Open Society Foundations Black Male Achievement Fellow and a 2013 Stanford Social Innovation Fellow. The Root named her one of the 100 Most Influential African-Americans in 2013 and Goldman Sachs named her one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs of 2013. Her work has been covered by The New York Times, Forbes, NBC, Bloomberg, Fast Company, NPR, and other major news outlets. She has a BA cum laude from Harvard College and a JD and MBA from Stanford University. </p>
 
<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
Just before starting CODE2040 I worked at a tech startup where I held a variety of different roles from strategy to product management. This, plus knowing a lot of tech company founders and employees from my time at Stanford Business School, gave me a lot of insight into and empathy for the company experience. Before graduate school, I spent most of my time working with youth from middle school to college age. Those experiences really helped me to develop a model that first and foremost is about creating life changing experiences for young talent. </p> 

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
Post-secondary education is in the spotlight right now as folks challenge whether the model, the economics of it in particular, is practical in our current economy. At CODE2040, we’ve seen that even students who get a great academic education in computer science are often unprepared for jobs in software development. What we’re hoping is that our work can help colleges and universities see how to marry the academic and professional pursuits of their students. Getting good grades is wonderful, but the day you graduate those A’s matter a whole lot less. Students need to be prepared to get and succeed in jobs in the 21st century economy, which is an economy driven by technology.</p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The rising cost of college and the burden of student debt on graduates make alternatives look more and more appealing. We’ve seen some pretty impressive results from coding bootcamps like Dev Bootcamp, Flatiron School, Hackbright, HackReactor, Turing School, and more. In the equivalent of one semester of college, they are providing enough knowledge and training that graduates are able to change careers and land the entry level software development jobs that many four year degree holders can’t. I think the combination of the exploration of online learning and condensed, bootcamp programs challenging the traditional four-year university model will yield some interesting changes in how we view and who engages in post-secondary education.</p> 

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
I’m currently working on CODE2040 and expanding our impact is the next big project! Stay tuned for some exciting stuff in 2016.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I follow one of my former CODE2040 teammates, a young woman named <a href="http://bit.ly/1UVPWBN">Bianca St.Louis</a>. She’s always talking about the latest tech news and the latest on Black Twitter. I hear about a lot of trends first from her tweets!</p>
