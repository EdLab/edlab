          <p>
            The 2012 EdLab Basketball Tournament brought much fun and excitement and people participated with great enthusiasm. The 2013 session is beginning this week. We are going to have our first round in the coming Friday afternoon. Hopefully it will take place in the riverside basketball field around 109 street.

In last year's games, people were usually divided into 3 teams and they fought each other to stay on the field. Players on the field were actively involved and spared no efforts in scoring goals. There were a few players who stood out in the games with their unique performances. Some of them demonstrated good penetrating ability and some others boasted good leadership. The greatest thing about all these games was that everyone had a good time.

So don't hesitate and be ready to come to our 2013 session. Prepare your best basketball wear and try warm up during the following days so that you could enjoy the most of it. 

Anyone is welcomed to share his/her ideas about making it more fun!
