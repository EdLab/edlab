<p><i>"The News Literacy Project’s goal is to see news literacy embedded in the American educational experience as an essential skill, giving every student an appreciation of credible journalism and the skills to be an active participant in a robust democracy."</i> (<a href="http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org/about/our-mission">About the News Literacy Project</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Fighting Fake News with Education</b></p>

<p>Fake news is an epidemic. Thankfully, some groups are fighting it with a lifelong tool: education. One such nonprofit organization is the <a href="http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org">News Literacy Project</a>, which has been bringing digital literacy education into schools since 2009. Founded by Alan Miller and starting in Bethesda, Maryland and New York City, the News Literacy Project has now reached over 250 schools, educating more than 25,000 students. Journalist volunteers run each session for students, either in person or online, teaching them how to discern factual information from satire, opinion, or sensationalized stories. The News Literacy Project offers a virtual learning platform, student workshops, after school programs, professional development, and consulting.</p>

<p><b>Why We Need Digital Literacy</b></p>
 
<p>In 2018, digital literacy means learning how to think critically about more than just written articles; it also entails learning how to assess YouTube videos and social media posts. Although the current generation of middle and high school students use digital and social media with ease, a 2016 Stanford study found that many students are unable to tell fact from fiction online. With the internet, anyone can be an author and a publisher, but the News Literacy Project wants to turn students into editors with the skills to fact check, detect reliable sources, and reject false information. Students who complete the New Literacy Project’s lessons not only feel more confident about their fact-checking abilities, they also become generally more skeptical of online information and gain a better appreciation of credible journalism and its important role in democracy.</p>
 
<p>Especially now, at a time when the term <i>fake news</i> is being flung every which way and facts have had their meaning shifted (e.g., <i>alternative facts</i>), it is incredibly important to teach students how to actually spot what is fake versus what is just unpopular. Being able to critically assess news in whatever form it takes is vital for the next generation to make better informed political and social decisions.</p>
 
<p><b>The Project’s Newest Online Tool</b></p>

<p>The newest tool that the News Literacy Project has created is the <a href="https://checkology.org">Checkology Virtual Classroom</a>, an e-learning platform that teaches students how to critically assess news through a package of online lessons created by journalists from top news organizations. Checkology has skyrocketed in popularity since its launch in 2016. As of February 2018, more than 11,700 teachers from all 50 states and 86 countries had registered for the Checkology platform, serving almost 1.78 million students, and it’s only growing.</p>
