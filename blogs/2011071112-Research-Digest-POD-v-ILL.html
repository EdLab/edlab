<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1464905511000285">van Dyk, G. (2011). Interlibrary Loan Purchase-on-Demand: A Misleading Literature. <i>Library Collections, Acquisitions, & Technical Services, 35</i>(1), 83-89.</a> 

This article argues for cost evaluation before adopting purchase on demand acquisitions models over interlibrary loan. Mediated cost studies and data from the author's library are examined to determine if usage statistics justify the increased labor cost of processing and maintaining purchased titles. 

<b>Review:</b>
This article primarily examines the most recent studies on costs of acquisition and interlibrary loan which were taken in the early 2000's. Since those studies, both interlibrary loan and electronic acquisitions have experienced significant changes. There is simply not enough data on costs associated with the purchase of electronic titles and the change in interlibrary loan costs since the adoption of online systems like ILLiad for exchange processing. Maintenance and selection of delivery systems notwithstanding, the staff costs accompanying processing and collection preservation are likely significantly reduced for purchased electronic titles. 

Though these costs may not be as crushing as the article predicts, it does make a case for the importance of thoughtful collection development in a time of limited acquisitions control. The studies found that, depending on the costs estimated by the library, each acquired title would have to circulate 2-4 times to be considered cost-effective. The study from the author's library found that 58% of their purchase on demand titles had reached this threshold, relatively high compared to academic libraries of a similar size. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
While purchase on demand models are thriving it's important not to forget interlibrary loan as a cost-effective method of content delivery or lose sight of the importance of collection development and maintenance. I feel like the Gottesman does a good job of balancing in our current purchase on demand acquisitions system, but interlibrary loan is good to remember and should become even more viable in the face of increased access to electronic resources.
