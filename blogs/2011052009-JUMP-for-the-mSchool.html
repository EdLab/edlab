Anyone who has been following either the EdLab blog or the latest buzz in primary math education in the past month has probably heard about the buzz surrounding <a href="http://jumpmath.org/">JUMP</a>. For those who do not know, JUMP is a mathematics curriculum designed around the belief that math is largely a linear ladder-like learning process; one cannot learn a new concept without working off of previously learned concepts. Thus, JUMP seeks to break down ideas into several basic but separate concepts that can be taught to almost anyone who knows how to count and add. To their credit, the creators of JUMP have enjoyed success that can clearly be seen in the empirical evidence; nearly all students who go through JUMP see themselves achieving more in mathematics than they otherwise would. 
	Given the momentum JUMP has garnered and the evidence they have to back up their claims, it seems more than likely that JUMP will only be found in more classrooms with each passing school year. Yet what happens to those students who do not have access to a teacher who uses JUMP? This is where ideas pertaining to the mSchool (metaphorical school) could be of real use. JUMP strongly advocates for an active instructor in the learning process for a student. Unfortunately, such a scenario is oftentimes infeasible for a variety of reasons. The question then needs to be asked: can the core elements of JUMP be translated into an online course framework that helps students learn via the JUMP approach without actually having an active instructor at hand?
"The JUMP Math student workbooks are not intended to be used without instruction. Teachers should use the workbooks and accompanying lesson plans in the teacher's guides for dynamic lessons in which students are allowed to discover and explore ideas on their own. The careful scaffolding of the mathematics in the student workbooks make them an excellent tool for teachers to use for guided practice and continuous assessment."

JUMP sees the teacher's role as essential to its approach and its workbooks as merely formative assessments. Our goal at EdLab should be to think of ways to develop a teacher-less JUMP that still holds to these key features, as stated by the creators of JUMP:
- Confidence-building
- Guided practice
- Guided discovery
- Continuous assessment
- Rigorously scaffolded instruction
- Mental math
- Deep conceptual understanding

	The first three bullet points lie at the crux of the creators' rationale for having an active instructor in the learning process. Certainly in some settings, a person is better suited to empower learners and guide them during practice and organic discovery. Yet with the help of social networking and game dynamics, there is no reason why the mobile online classroom cannot empower and motivate students to go further and deeper in their mathematical pursuits. Guided practice and discovery in a mobile classroom setting, on the other hand, probably requires a mixture of automation and a human helper at all times. Needless to say, EdLab has developed products already that can be of much use here. On the point of continuous assessment, this is the granddaddy of them all. In almost all settings there is a need to make outcomes more observable. Only then can we make decisions that are well-informed enough to create a system of accountability. Continuous assessment in the mobile classroom will require effective incorporation of JUMP's own assessments as well as a mixture between quick and dirty testing and human examination. In order to achieve rigorously scaffolded instruction, the mobile classroom's JUMP curriculum must have that same degree of rigor and detail that a student would come to expect from receiving JUMP-based lessons in a physical classroom. With respect to mental math, the best way to incorporate tasks that involve memorization and rote learning should probably include some version of the SMS flashcard idea we are floating around. As the creators of JUMP state, mental math is crucial to gaining number sense, something that could certainly be furthered by everyday contextualization. In the following paragraphs, I will go into much greater depth in addressing each of the first six bullet points.
JUMP makes it a point to focus on incremental approach to learning math. This allows students to build off of previously learned concepts more easily and gives them confidence in knowing that they are making progress. This incremental approach can be leveraged within two game dynamics that Seth Priebatsch presented in his TEDx talk, namely the ‘influence and status' and ‘progression' dynamics. The ‘influence and status' dynamic relies on non-physical and non-monetary incentives in influencing behavior. This dynamic can be found in many games where ‘leveling up' becomes the primary goal in order to receive badges, medals, etc. Given the lack of necessary convention in the mobile classroom and the granular nature of the JUMP curriculum, we can bring the same kinds of ‘prestige rewards' that come with leveling up into the academic setting here. Mastering a set of discrete concepts can serve as a way to ‘level up'. This allows students to move at their own pace while there still exist objective metrics and standards to ensure mastery. Students only move on to a new concept once they have leveled up from the previous concept, rather than getting a B- on Concept 1 and then being forced to move on to Concept 2. The ‘progression' dynamic is equally valuable, as it thrives best in a setting where granular progress is achievable, precisely what JUMP aims to provide. This dynamic involves viewing one's performance through a progression bar, typically showing what percentage of a particular task has been completed. While Priebatsch's talk seemed to come more from his own opinions on games, his assertions have been shown to be backed up by peer-reviewed evidence in most cases.
‘Guided practice' and ‘guided discovery' require, by definition, a guide. In the physical classroom, this guide is clearly a teacher. On the other hand, in the mobile classroom, the guide can be anyone from an Ednode mentor to a fellow classmate (or should I say level-mate?). Guided practice can always come in the form of automated helpful hints but that hardly qualifies as a primary guide, at least in this project's inception. What seems most helpful is to have a human, or a group of humans, involved in these two tasks at all time. I can see advantages and disadvantages to a variety of mentoring systems, but in all I see the potential for Ednode to have a role. Ednode can serve as the foundation for whatever mentoring system we choose to create. Do we only allow those volunteer mentors in Ednode who have completed certain levels to serve as guides? Do we build game dynamics to encourage Ednode mentors to volunteer as guides? Do we make being a guide a mandatory step in leveling up? These are all questions to consider and questions I do not have the immediate answer to.
Creating the mechanisms to make continuous assessment possible at minimum cost to the learner or to the administrators seems very difficult. JUMP gives us a starting point with their workbook problems which can serve as assessments, but much of JUMP's continuous assessment framework relies on guides to be able to make quick assessments of a student's progress. Some of this can be compensated for by automated checks on a student's work at any given time, but that would be very resource intensive and probably only a supplementary measure. One suggestion is to use game dynamics to discover the top guides, and then give them incentives to become assessors/graders. As the incentives become more intertwined, there is a fear that collusion will reveal itself, but as Ryan Baker's seminar pointed out, there are ways to automatically prevent the formation of or break up cartels and cabals within learning communities.
Lesson plans might not be so clear-cut for the mobile classroom, where students might not be able to work on the same task at precisely the same time. However, in the case of JUMP, detailed lesson plans appear to be essential. JUMP lesson plans rely on groups of learners working together and teaching one another. This might not be feasible in the mobile classroom. Instead, we need an adequate substitute. Since the mobile classroom relies more on individuals asking questions to the community directly, the classroom, in some sense at least, will be flipped. There might not be another learner in the community learning precisely the same thing you are learning at a given moment in time. On the other hand, you will also have access to plenty of people who should be qualified enough to answer your questions and guide you through whatever exercise or concept you are working on. Thus, the mobile classroom might have one student instead of many, and many teachers instead of just one. 
On our approach to building number sense, this might be the first place to utilize an SMS-flashcard app outside of a vocabulary-oriented framework. Number sense requires mental math skills as well as an ability to contextualize and abstract. This goes back to Steve's original line of thinking for his app; the one benefit to applying it to math is that math is easier to contextualize. I'm sure there are still some roadblocks with regard to how the contextualization will occur but I think it is easier to contextualize 5+5 than the word ‘assuage.'
	I hope I have at least provided some clarity as far as how we can build a mobile classroom around the methods described by JUMP. There are still significant issues to be sorted out. Is there enough demand for this? Will JUMP even succeed? Are there flaws in JUMP's curriculum that we can correct? Even with these concerns and others in mind, I think it is worth pushing forward in developing a mobile JUMP, particularly because of the convergence I see between JUMP's methods and game dynamics, Ednode, and the potential flashcard app. I look forward to receiving feedback.
