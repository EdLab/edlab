            The adCenter Labs at Microsoft are working on a technology similar to that used in PocketKnowledge called <a href=" http://adlab.microsoft.com/src/SRCResult.aspx">Search Result Clustering</a>.  After entering a search term, SRC provides web link results (per norm) but also a list of related topics which can be intersected with your search.  Searching for "bob," yields hundreds of results, and 199 related items included “oklahoma city.â€?  Clicking on “Oklahoma cityâ€? narrows my result list to the only 3 items which intersect (oddly, 2 of 3 here reference auto sales)...<!--break-->

Sound like PK?  That's because it is!  But surprisingly, a crippled version of it.  PK allows for n levels of intersections (arbitrarily large), while SRC only goes one level deep!  (Did anyone doubt me when I said it was a difficult problem to solve?!)   This poses an interesting dilemma but also a great opportunity. 
 
Microsoft is clearly a big name and it could be a big deal if the EdLab were to beat MS to the punch line.  Furthermore, I think it reinforces the idea that this is a product with some demand.  BUT I put SRC in front of the 4 people and PK in front of 3 others and sure enough: SRC is "cool," and PK is confusing.  In fact, only one of seven people was able to recognize that the two products provided essentially the same service.  Clearly, if we release a product which no one understands, we will not be able to claim we won the race with Microsoft.  And if MS beats us to the punch we're just another group copying from the big companies. 
 
I also believe that we can learn a great deal from SRC's layout.  I had suggested a layout similar to this a few weeks back, but found no one liked the idea.  So how can we combine the obvious (and intuitive) layout with innovation and style?  Or, maybe we're not interested.
