<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

Many organizations and businesses mistakenly believe that if    they provide the tools for community engagement and interaction,    a community will form on its own and ultimately engage and    interact. Nothing could be further from the truth. A study of    more than 100 businesses with online communities found that 35%    had less than 100 members and less than 25% had more than 1,000    members, a clear indication that the tools are not enough.    Engagement is the holy grail of building successful online    communities and connecting with customers online and here's your    chance to learn from someone with experience. In "18 Rules of    Community Engagement," Angela Connor shares how she helped her    online community surpass 11,000 members in 18 short months.

This book is a definitive guide for those seeking to facilitate                                               and grow online communities and develop social media strategies                                               for themselves or their organizations. It is a playbook on                                               exactly what it takes to be successful, with insights from                                               community experts and practitioners.

After reading this book, you will have the knowledge needed to                                               drive user engagement and bring people together online                                               regardless of the age of your community or stage of its                                               development.
