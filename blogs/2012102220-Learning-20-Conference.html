<i>This free conference is being held online, in multiple time zones, over the course of five days. It is being held in conjunction with "Connected Educator Month," and will include an all-day virtual unconference on Monday (SocialEdCon online!) as well as a special educational start- up "pitchfire" event Wednesday evening (US Time).</i> <a href="http://www.classroom20.com/page/2012-learning-2-0-virtual-conference">Learning 2.0 site</a>

<b>Free, Virtual and Open</b>
<p>
Organized to correspond with the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2012/08/connected-educator-month-kicks-off/">Department of Education’s "Connected Educator Month"</a>, the <a href="http://www.classroom20.com/page/2012-learning-2-0-virtual-conference">Learning 2.0 Conference</a>, was held for the first time online this past August 20th-25th .  With the goal of helping educators to report on and share educational technology resources, the event was free, held online and completely open to participants from around the world.  "Attendees" engaged with one-another virtually through <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/launch/meeting.jnlp?sid=2008350&amp;password=M.9A538F3427722A2875139A9CF05F29">Blackboard’s "Collaborate" platform</a> and through the startup, <a href="https://mightybell.com/">MightyBell’s blogging platform</a>.  Hundreds of presenters from edtech founders and ed-focused bloggers to professors of education presented on topics ranging from "Group Projects with Google Docs" to "Gen Z - Curators of Social Media." All resources for each session were displayed in a dedicated window on the Blackboard platform and included real-time screencasts of presentation files, a live, moderated feed of participant chat messages and a webcam view and audio feed of each presenter.  Additional activities held during this "unconference" included virtual keynote presentations from such luminaries as edu-punk blogger Audrey Waters and <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/sugata_mitra.html">Sugata Mitra</a>, a "Pitchfire" event held on MightyBell’s blogging platform that was intended to create an opportunity to "pitch" ideas for new educational technologies and additional opportunities for dialogue on the <a href="http://www.classroom20.com/page/2012-learning-2-0-virtual-conference">Classroom 2.0 network</a>.  All sessions were also available asynchronously as audio and visual recordings after each presentation.

<b>Is there a better way to hold a virtual conference?</b> 
<p>
While the Learning 2.0 Conference, at the very least, had great potential to virtually connect educators from around the world, the platforms used to host the conference were a bit problematic.  For example, two educators who co-hosted a session opened awkwardly (after a healthy pause) with, "I hope everyone can appreciate the technical difficulties surrounding this presentation today ... but, you have those in your classroom."  Even the conference founder, <a href="http://www.stevehargadon.com/p/about-me.html">Steve Hargadon</a>, a leading voice in the "connected classroom" movement and the head of <a href=" http://www.web20labs.com/">Web 2.0 Labs</a>, wrote about these technical difficulties on his blog, "Over 225 people showed up, and while lack of familiarity with the unconference format and with Blackboard Collaborate (as well as some tangible hesitation to use a microphone or webcam) mean that we now have some specific ways to think about making this kind of event better..."  I agree.  My main question is, if the current, available virtual conferencing technologies have limitations, what will the next evolution of virtual conferences entail? A glorified Twitter Chat (check-out #EdChat)?  A series of Vialogues.com conversations? Google+ hangouts? What can replace the value and ease of person-to-person interaction, while still remaining accessible, free and available to the widest number of participants? Let us hope that the future will bring conferencing technology that truly fosters "connection" and is both effortless and available everywhere.
