          <p>
            To continue the discussion about the value of a college education, I thought it would be a good idea to point out that when it comes to entrepreneurship and education, you can have your cake and eat it too. This is going to sound like a shameless plug for Syracuse University (Go Orange!), but it's the only example I know well and I'm sure that there are other schools that have similar opportunities.

At Syracuse, there is a program called the Innovative and Disruptive Entrepreneurship Accelerator program which is a combination of "courses", incubation, and funding. The two courses help students figure out how to come up with good ideas and then help them to plan out how to start and manage their startups. After the second class, students can apply to have their startup housed at a place called The Tech Garden in the <a href="http://www.syracusestudentsandbox.com/">Student Sandbox</a>, which provides experts in various areas to act as consultants, office space, and various other resources. The university also supports student startups through grant money from foundations and resources through three of the colleges within SU. This program is open to anyone at Syracuse University and can even count as a minor (I will be starting the Information Technology, Design, and Startups minor in the fall!).

I hope that programs like this continue to expand. I think it would be a shame to have entrepreneurs skip out on college entirely if they have the opportunity to have the best of both worlds. This is the perfect bridge for the perceived gap between the educated and the entrepreneurial.
