<p><b>Title:</b> No Country for Old Members: User Lifecycle and Linguistic Change in Online Communities (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b>Jure Leskovec, Dan Jurafsky, Robert West, Christopher Potts, & Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil</p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
How does user behavior change in online communities over time?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Site-specific language is an important part of the culture of online communities and it is clear that language norms in these communities evolve over time. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488416">No Country for Old Members: User Lifecycle and Linguistic Change in Online Communities</a> investigates linguistic change as a way to gauge user engagement in online groups. The authors studied a decade of user and community-level data on <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/">RateBeer</a> and <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/">BeerAdvocate</a>. Both communities feature short text reviews of more than 60,000 different types of beers and include numerical ratings, crowdsourced ranking, and user discussion. These communities have developed a rich set of conventions and unique terminology.</p> 

<p>The authors observed a two-part user lifecycle in online community interactions. Users are most receptive to the norms of the community in the first third of their total lifetime on the site and use the most site-specific language at the end of this novice period. More experienced users gradually lose touch with community-specific words until they eventually leave the site. The authors observed this trend in action on BeerAdvocate; to describe the smell of beer, users circa 2003 tended to use "aroma" but between 2003 and 2007 this language was replaced by "S" (for smell). Users who joined prior to 2005 tended to hang on to the "aroma" terminology even as "S" became increasingly trendy with adoption by new users. This arc of language adoption and loss is so consistent across users, regardless of their time and effort investment, that the authors used these observations to develop the prediction framework for community membership. Data from 2001 until 2011 was collected from both communities and a series of language models were applied to get an image of month-by-month language use in each community.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors noticed several behavior changes in users and communities as they age and evolve. They found that as individual users post more reviews their use of singular first-person pronouns decreases, which is attributed to increasing identification with the community. The community as a whole exhibits the same behavior seen in novice individual users; posts as the site ages use more predictable and consistent language. The authors found, for example, that even controlling for a change in the distribution of the products reviewed, there was a significant increase in the use of fruit words to describe the taste and feel of particular beers. This indicates that, while the products do not change, the communityâ€™s language to describe them evolves over time.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Predictive models are gaining popularity and importance in educational data mining. This paper provides an alternative method for a culture model that could potentially flag user behaviors to alert online communities of user interest changes. This strategy could be beneficial for online learning communities and may help intervention strategies and retention rates in online learning.</p>
