<a href="https://microeval.com/">MicroEval</a> is attempting to revolutionize the performance review process and make this yearly event more efficient, participatory, and perhaps even fun. It seeks to move beyond the annual paper-based feedback model. With the growth of sharing platforms like Facebook and Twitter, feedback is instant and plentiful. MicroEval builds on this model by offering managers employee "profiles" with pictures, the ability to communicate with employees within the site, and the opportunity to give feedback throughout the year with the possibility of aggregating it for review time. 

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/microeval-launch/">Y Combinator</a> incubated site looks professional and seems ready to take on the challenge of a large company or school review process. The site offers a number of stock review templates for various types of employees, but the intuitive dashboard also allows managers to create their own questions and templates. An organizational chart feature keeps track of employee structure and sends regular reminders to evaluators.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
The site seems to have a pretty solid business plan and is currently offering subscriptions at $1 per employee per month, but it seems to have greater potential. At this point the system is fairly structured, but it would be interesting to offer more styles and flexibility for employers. An instant  feedback "feed" that operated like a private Twitter stream or an evaluator browser extension that asked managers to rate employees quickly at random times throughout the year and spit out analytics for the annual review could really break the review mold. MicroEval isn’t doing this yet, but it seems ready to transform this highly traditional event.</p>

<p><b>Future Possibilities:</b><br>
What are employee evaluations but the adult version of grades? MicroEval’s review process has potential direct implications for teacher evaluations of students and student evaluations of teachers. Though there is a strong digital tradition for the latter in higher education, K-12 grading is still often confined to the report card. It seems natural to evolve the grading process to emulate rapid online social feedback and allow students to course-correct throughout the year. A "like" from a teacher or quick improvement note might mean far more than a letter grade to today’s student.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
If MicroEval is the future of workplace evaluation, then schools should pay attention.</p>
