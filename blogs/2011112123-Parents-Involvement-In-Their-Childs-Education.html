          <p>
            During the weekend, I read this NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-about-better-parents.html">article</a> about how teachers and parents are the keys to helping students learn and engaging in new activities. It also notes that teachers often receive the blame when students fail, as highlighted by the continuing trend of teacher accountability, especially when it comes to standardized testing.


As highlighted in the article, research also shows that parents are the big players in the children's education. A study shows that parents who introduce more reading to their children during their primary school years tend to score higher on exams than students who are not introduced to the same amount of reading. The article talks extensively about how parents involvement in their children's education has a major affect on their achievements in school. 

This article caught my attention because of the way it talks about parents' involvement in their children's education. Instead of always blaming teachers, parents also need to play their part in their children's education. School is not over once they leave school grounds, it also goes with them to the home. Parents are the ones charged with this task once students are home.
