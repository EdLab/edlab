<p><a href="https://cognitoys.com/pages/about">STEMosaur</a> is a dinosaur robot designed to give kids hands-on building, STEM, and coding experience. CogniToys, a New York-based edtech toy company, sells the <a href="https://cognitoys.com/products/stemosaur">STEMosaur</a> for around $100, but offers coding software, an app, and updates for free. The toy connects to the cloud in order to keep track of progress and other interactions.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The toy offers a range of entertaining and engaging activities for kids, such as interactive quizzes, jokes, and conversations. Our team particularly liked how it instructed us to relax and meditate after expressing frustration to it. Despite being a robot, we felt that our dino exhibited a caring and empathic tone. </p>  

<p>STEMosaur’s voice sounds a bit like Yoda crossed with Grover from Sesame Street, and one co-worker even suggested it echoed the Dalai Lama. Most of us agreed that this calming, but cartoon-like voice works for the targeted age group of kids around seven-years-old.</p> 

<p>The coding tool for STEMosaur is a really great concept for exposing kids to coding. Using a computer, children are able to input various commands and responses for the toy. Because it operates over wifi, these inputs work almost immediately with the dinosaur. </p>
 
<p>There is some assembly required, which is actually part of the STEM learning process. However, I did miss a connector when I was assembling it, causing it to be voiceless. This technical issue was frustrating, but CogniToys’ support team was very thorough and helped me quickly figure out the issue.</p> 
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, STEMosaur has a lot of bugs. The first issue that arose was with the wifi connection. In order to use the toy, we had to download the app and then configure it with our wifi, but if the wifi was slow or the signal was weak, STEMosaur could not really function.</p>

<p>We loved the coding aspect of STEMosaur; however, it almost always malfunctioned when trying to code something new. Sometimes the toy would simply freeze when a new command was added, and the only fix was to turn it off and then on again. In other cases, the dinosaur could not execute the new codes, simply saying that it didn’t understand or giving us a completely different answer. It was both a disappointing and frustrating process. </p>

<p>One smaller problem that my team and I noticed was that the STEMosaur could not be interrupted. After being forced to listen to a song with no way of stopping it, we could only imagine how impatient kids would get with this noninteractive feature.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>We had a lot of fun playing with STEMosaur, and we can see the promise and educational benefits from this innovation. However, its frequent malfunctions are likely to cause frustration for many kids and parents using this toy. Hopefully, CogniToys will fix the bugs in the system so that other STEMosaurs can meet their full potential. </p>
