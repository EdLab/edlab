<p>Vaibhav Vashisht is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.acadly.com/">Acadly</a>, an edtech platform that integrates an audience response system and a classroom-focused chat platform with class management tools. Vashisht wants to create access to path-breaking edtech innovations for every classroom across the globe. Vashisht studied business at the Indian Institute of Management and ESCP Paris. He has also worked at National Instruments and the Tata Group.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Acadly?</b><br>
<p>Acadly is the third edtech product that we are working on. Prashant Gautam, the other co-founder of Acadly, had previously developed an Adaptive Learning tool and a MOOC technology platform. During my work at National Instruments, I was involved in setting up experiential learning labs in multiple engineering institutes. Through our combined experiences, we came up with three key hypotheses that have shaped our work:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Human, not cultural problems first:</b> the biggest issues faced by professors are not culture-specific. For example, getting students to pay attention for long durations during lectures is a universal issue.<p>
 <li><b>Professors work two demanding jobs:</b> research and teaching; Expecting them to adopt teaching technology is at best hopeful, unless you’re saving them time.
 <li><b>‘More the merrier’ is the worst way to think about edtech.</b> The most helpful thing you can do for professors is to reduce the number of tech tools they need.
</ul>
</p>
 
<p><b>What motivated you to create a platform as unique as Acadly?</b><br>
<p>The biggest factor was when we taught a short-term course a few years ago. We faced the very problem that we are now trying to solve. Learning management systems (LMSs) are a nightmare and the alternative approach, using clickers and discussion tools to supplement LMSs, is very demanding. We always hoped something multi-purpose and simple would come along, but it never did.<p>
 
<p>It seemed like the biggest gap in edtech was that there was nothing that seamlessly combined in-class polling, quizzing, attendance with Q&A, chat with math support, assignments, and content-sharing. That is where we saw a huge opportunity and jumped at it.<p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Firstly, the effort to reduce the number of interfaces one has to use is a common trend that's cutting across tech platforms today (cases in point include WeChat, Siri, etc.)</p>
 
<p>This can also have a huge impact on learning. It is not difficult for professors to adopt new technologies; however, it is difficult for them to adopt new products. We think multipurpose and cohesive products help professors teach more efficiently. While IT can support professors in using new products, it is better to make things that do not need much support at all.</p>
 
<p>Secondly, we believe there is going to be a huge importance of instructional technologists in education in the years to come. Their role is crucial in helping professors use technology in a way that boosts student success.</p>
 
<p><b>What were some initial challenges in starting Acadly and how did you overcome those challenges?</b><br>
<p>Professors from 70+ universities have signed up for Acadly already, but it was not easy to reach this stage. The biggest problem we faced was getting the word out on a shoestring budget. It took a combination of methods to do so, reaching out to people through our network, cold emails, field visits, and online channels. It is remarkable that we have not spent on online advertising yet.</p>
 
<p>As of today, a little over 200 professors have signed up and we’re beginning to see interest from K–12 as well, even though the product has never officially been marketed to that audience!</p>
 
<p><b>What is next on the horizon for Acadly?</b><br>
<p>Right now, our focus is on getting more professors to use Acadly and we are working on a few campaigns for that. Our Campus Ambassador program, the <a href="https://medium.com/acadly">Acadly blog</a> and a webinar series have all been launched recently. We are creating a community that can build upon ideas around using phones inside the classroom, flipped classrooms, and taking academic discussions online for a generation of Twitter and Snapchat users. Our product roadmap has some extremely exciting things coming up too. Just this week, we launched complete support for math-expressions (e.g., TeX, ASCII Math) and are soon going to launch the same feature on the chat too.</p>

<p>In the long term, the vision is to make edtech blend into teaching in a way so that it feels like a natural extension of the teaching process and not a disjointed add-on. We will also consider the K–12 market based on the interest we see from customers.</p>
