<p>Recent neuroscience findings highlight the malleability of the human brain. Relationships and experiences drive the neurological development that is a necessary precondition for learning. This means that trauma can impede children’s ability to learn, but also indicates the potential positive effect that school relationships and experiences can have on enabling and promoting brain development.</p>

<p>When teachers intentionally combine social-emotional, affective, and cognitive development, connections form in children’s developing brains that accelerate their ability to problem-solve, think critically, and learn complex skills. Healthy relationships, this study indicates, are an essential prerequisite for learning and development.</p>

<p>In your opinion, what value do different models and types of education place on healthy relationships? Are such relationships typically seen as a prerequisite for learning? Do you agree that teachers have the responsibility to intentionally cultivate such relationships in the classroom?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:58 Melanie Hering:</b> I would argue that relationship-building and socialization are the most important indirectly learned concepts of a formal education; this video demonstrates how positive interactions with educators as mentors as well as other kids can have a huge, positive impact on a child's life, both academically and otherwise.</p>

<p><b>@03:05 Toland Lawrence:</b> I think it's about making time and space in the school day for that interaction to happen. Whether it be greeting students individually when they arrive in the classroom or reaching out to students in the hallway or during the day, I'd imagine that these small interactions add up. I think when school schedules are too structured and there is too much pressure on students and teachers to meet certain achievement goals, it blocks the opportunity for these relationships to form.</p>
