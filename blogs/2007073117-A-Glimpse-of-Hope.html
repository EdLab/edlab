          <p>
            About a month ago, I wrote a blog about why soccer is such a popular sport across the world. In the piece, I mentioned its influence as a source of peace and stability in a world full of chaos and uncertainty. I cited a number of examples, such as the national teams of Ivory Coast and South Africa, and how their performances on the soccer pitch have come to shape a better tomorrow for their respective nations. On Sunday, Iraq's men's national team defeated Saudi Arabia 1-0 to win their first ever Asian Cup title. It took me awhile before I was able to fully comprehend the significance of Iraq's victory and the impact it may potentially have on the fragile Middle Eastern country. <p>

Federation Internationale de Futbol Association or <a href=http://www.fifa.com/>FIFA</a>, as it is commonly called, consists of six confederations: AFC-Asia, CAF-Africa, UEFA-Europe, CONMEBOL-South America, CONCACAF-North & Central America and the Caribbean and Oceania for the small nations in the Pacific. Each confederation hosts a soccer tournament comprising only those nations that are members of the confederation. To win a continental title is as big as it gets in soccer, with the exception of the World Cup. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) consists of 46 countries and its tournament is held every four years. Australia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Japan, two-time defending champions, were the heavy favorites to lift the trophy when the tournament kicked off nearly a month ago.  Placed in a group that included the Aussies, co-host nation Thailand and Oman, Iraq was seen by many as the weakest team in the group. But once the ball was kicked off in their first match against Thailand, the Iraqis were all business from the get go and eventually settled for a 1-1 draw. They shocked Australia and the rest of the watching world 3-1 in their next game before a draw against Oman in their last group game confirming them as group winners. The Cinderella story had begun. Iraq made easy work of Vietnam in the quarterfinals with a 2-0 victory to draw one of the pre-tournament favorites: South Korea. In one of the most classic games in Asian Cup history, Iraq and South Korea battled valiantly for close to two hours without a single goal before Iraq won 4-3 on penalty kicks for a chance to play in their first ever Asian Cup final. Popular sentiment was undoubtedly with the Iraqis as they took the field against Saudi Arabia, arguably the best team on the continent. In a game of numerous chances for both sides, a header from inspirational captain Younis Mahmoud in the 71st minute was all that Iraq would need. When the final whistle blew, tears of joy streamed down the face of almost the entire Iraqi team. For a brief moment, Iraqis from all corners of the world were able to put aside the turmoil in their homeland and celebrate with their heroes. In the end, Iraq was the best team in the tournament. When all seemed lost, they found the inspiration to fight back and show a fighting spirit that this tournament had never seen. When Younis Mahmoud stepped on the podium to lift the trophy, he stood above everyone else, a fine symbol of his performances during the tournament.<p> 

The unstable conditions at home meant preparation for the tournament was lackluster at best, but on the pitch, a team that included Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds were able to unite and play the beautiful game at its finest. In doing so, they sent a strong message to the politicians, clerics, and everyone else back home that unity is possible without firing a gun. Their achievement will live on in the history of soccer for some time and it will gain greater importance in the years to come. For the moment, they are the best team in Asia and no one can claim otherwise. The power of Iraqis to break bridges such as ethnicity and religion; bridges which often divides their countrymen and women back home is a testament to the power of the beautiful game. For once in a long time, Iraqis can taste the sweet smell of joy and celebration and not the bitter scent of death and anguish. The significance of victory will lie not in the record books but with the rogue politicians who have yet to fulfill the promise they envisaged for their war-torn country when Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled four years ago.  A job well done for Mahmoud and his teammates because for a brief moment, they have offered an entire nation hope for a better tomorrow and a prospect for a peace that has been a long coming.
