<p>In May 2018, Google released <a href="https://vr.google.com/tourcreator/">Tour Creator</a>, a tool that lets users easily create virtual reality (VR) or online content. After the success of <a href="https://vr.google.com/daydream/">Daydream</a>, Google realized educators and students are interested in more than just experiencing VR; they want to create it. Tour Creator lets anyone create digital tours using 360-degree images, audio, and custom annotations. The tool has already shown promise in many areas, from education to real estate to company training.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Making a tour on Tour Creator is truly easy and intuitive, something that teachers and students could pick up in 10 minutes. While you can use your own 360-degree photos to make a project, you can also pull images directly from Google Maps. This makes it possible to create a tour featuring practically any location on earth. Each tour can include an unlimited number of individual images segmented into different scenes.</p>
 
<p>You can supplement scenes with information on specific points of interest, audio, sound effects, and pictures. For instance, when I digitally toured Machu Picchu, I could click on points of interest to read more about particular sites and listen to informative audio. If I were creating a project on the ocean, perhaps I’d add sound effects of waves crashing or whales communicating. These interactive annotations give Tour Creator a lot of educational potential for a wide range of school subjects, but particularly geography, science, and history.</p>
 
<p>Because it’s so easy to use, Tour Creator could supply valuable project opportunities for students. Some teachers have assigned students to <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/tour-creator-schools-vr/">create tours of their hometowns</a> with Tour Creator. Others will surely find it a fresh, interactive way for students to present research projects.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Perhaps because Tour Creator is so easy to use, it doesn’t have much room for flexibility. Project templates look similar across the board regardless of content. While students can still get creative with the subject matter, they can’t substantially change the way it is presented. This makes Tour Creator a better, more accessible tool for informational projects rather than creative ones.</p>

<p>Also, although you can turn 360-degrees within each image, you cannot travel through the setting as you can in Google Maps. This does not decrease the functionality of the tool, but it does make scenes more static than you’d originally think. You can’t zoom closer to points of interest, for instance, or step to a different area of the landscape.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Students and teachers can use Tour Creator best for informational projects on geography, history, and science. Its ease of use makes it a fantastic way to create original VR and online content for educational projects. Because it lacks flexibility, it seems better suited for informational purposes rather than creative pursuits.</p>
