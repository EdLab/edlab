          <p>
            Last Thursday, the two biggest school systems in the nation announced <a href="http://www.nabe.org/files/Education_week_10_26_11.pdf">plans and pledges</a> to drastically increase and improve instruction and services for English-language learners. LAUSD and NYCDOE recognized that they has been a growing need for more ELL programs and that the English learners students have been overlooked for years. 

<i>“Los Angeles Unified has nearly 200,000 students who are English learners–just under 30 percent of the district's 670,000 students. More than 154,000 students–or 14.3 percent–are identified as English learners in the 1.1 million-student New York City system.”</i>

... Those are <b>crazy large</b> numbers of students who have been overlooked in the public school system for years. Therefore, school officials in NYC have pledged to start 125 bilingual programs over the next three years and communicate more effectively with parents of ELLs about the services available at the schools. School officials in LA worked with the U.S. DOE to devise a plan to completely overhaul its current ELL programs. 

It's refreshing to see school officials finally stepping up and recognizing the needs of their public school system. However (maybe it's the skeptic in me), but I wonder how set-in-stone these long-term “pledges” are. I hope the community — parents, teachers, and just people who care — will keep our DOEs accountable.
