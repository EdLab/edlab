<p>As augmented reality (AR) gains popularity, more researchers are examining its educational potential in different subjects. A recent study looked at how AR-based writing assignments differed from paper-based activities in terms of both grades and student enjoyment. Unlike many educational apps, this AR system was designed with feedback from practicing teachers.</p>
 
<p>This study involved 30 twelfth grade students in Taiwan studying Chinese writing. They were split into two groups: one group completed a writing assignment using only paper-based instructions and prompts, and the other group completed it using an AR-based system. The assignment required the students to walk outside and observe various natural scenes around their campus. Using tablets, the AR group could point to the particular outdoor scenes with their devices, and on the screen would appear additional information on the object and a writing guide.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found mixed results. Neither high- nor low-achievers in the class achieved significantly different grades across the groups. Intermediate-achievers in the AR group, however, did perform significantly better on the writing assignment than those completing it only on paper. In addition, the low- and intermediate-achievers enjoyed the AR-based activities more than the high-achievers, likely because the AR instructions provided them with more scaffolding than the paper assignment.</p>
 
<p>While the researchers indicate that more long-term studies need to be conducted to examine the full impact of AR on writing activities, they also suggest that AR might be a useful tool to create blended learning experiences in writing classes. This study did not definitively conclude that AR-based writing activities are better than paper-based, but it did display that various levels of students experience the two activities differently. This could be important information for instructors and learning tech designers as they continue to experiment with putting AR in the classroom.</p>
