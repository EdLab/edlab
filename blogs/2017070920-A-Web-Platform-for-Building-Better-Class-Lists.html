<p>For elementary school administrators, creating class lists has for many years been an arduous task of sorting through paper cards. This can, and most often does, lead to lost placement requests or unbalanced classes. Class Composer is a subscription-based software solution for elementary schools to create more balanced class lists. The program is intended for school staff to use to more easily place students in classes where they can succeed.(<a href="https://classcomposer.com/">About Class Composer</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Setting Students up for Success</b></p>

<p>As a former teacher, Mike Cronley wanted to provide his students with the best learning experiences possible. He found that he was often frustrated by problems resulting from class list errors and oversights. He created Class Composer to leverage technology as a solution that showed all the information relevant for easily creating class lists. He views balanced classes as benefiting students by creating environments where they can learn best. </p>

<p><b>Data-driven Placement Decisions </b></p>
 
<p>Though administrators may only create classes once a year, this web-based platform alleviates problems caused by unbalanced classes and upset parents throughout the year. Class Composer also functions as a data wall that allows teachers and administrators to visualize student data. Teachers add information to individual student cards, much like report cards, but with the addition of behavioral information to track students’ progress throughout the year. </p>

<p>While tracking student progress could be useful in helping staff form a well-rounded picture of learners; Class Composer doesn’t appear to have the benefits of student portfolio software and it doesn’t capture student work or share information with them and their families. By rounding out the software with additional features, the platform could be a promising tool for elementary school administrators.</p>
