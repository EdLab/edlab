<i>The need for a more enriching learning experience is coming from multiple fronts. Educators are increasingly recognizing the power of communication and collaboration tools not only for teaching and learning in situ but also for distance learning and interaction with remote peers.</i> (Cisco white paper, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/strategy/docs/education/cisco_telepresence_in_education_white_paper_final.pdf">"TelePresence in Education"</a>)

<b>TelePorting Learning?</b><br>
While not a new concept, there has been a recent influx of interest in developing "telepresence" robots to fill needs both inside and out of the classroom.  Companies and institutions ranging from Maryland-based, <a href="http://mantarobot.com/">MantaRobot</a> and <a href="http://www.vgocom.com/remote-student">VGo</a>, to<a href="http://www.ri.cmu.edu/"> Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute</a> are continuing to imagine classroom uses for these simplistic ‘bots (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/09/05/science/05robots-graphic.html?ref=science">this New York Times graphic</a> for a range of telepresence robot styles and designs).  In this way, using hardware to replace in-person learning has become a part of the greater "future of learning" debate with proponents and researchers citing benefits ranging from accessibility for the sick or disabled to increased learner excitement and engagement.  For example, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.678">this research study</a> from 2000 explores the "excitement" angle, noting that robots "have the potential to excite and inspire children and adults in a way that no desktop computer can."  Beyond allowing learners who are ill or who are in a remote location to attend "virtually" and participate in class, robots may also allow educators to direct classes or more inexpensively provide additional support.  A similar use case is telepresence testing in Hospitals, in which telepresence robots are being used for routine, bedside patient consultations (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/science/05robots.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">this New York Times article</a> for more examples).

<b>TeleAbscence?</b><br>
While the potential for telepresence robots and autonomous robots is tempting to some, many educators and researchers are wary of robots of any kind "invading" their classrooms.  The often polarizing debate seems to skew towards both fear and intrigue.  As CNN explored in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/innovation/10/22/south.korea.robot.teachers/index.html">this special report on Korean schools</a> that are testing robotic "teaching assistants" in English language classes.   Never mind "M-Learning" (mobile learning) the Korean government is actively trying to support this "R-Learning" initiative (from the CNN report linked above); "the educational robot system indeed helps increase students' interest and self-motivation in studying English and improves their English skills."  In the CNN report Tucker Balch, an associate professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, claims that "It may be better to have a telepresence robot from a highly skilled teacher than to have just an average teacher in the classroom."  It is just this kind of statement that inspires a sense of trepidation for many educators and parents who are afraid that a machine might eventually replace a flesh and blood educator.  Balch goes on to add a note of caution regarding the limitations of this type of artificial intelligence: "It is a creative role and to teach well you really have to understand the person you're teaching. It requires a real fundamental leap in ability before we can get there."
