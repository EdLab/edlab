            **Private**

Jo and I are exploring a range of themed personas for the mSchool. We think a friendly, engaging figure can be part of what makes a great user experience.  We want to sound a vote internally for the one that would fit well to the root concept of <b>school+metaphor</b>, or <i>metaschool</i> (like, beyond school). A friendly graphical identity that would appeal to users of all demography but especially to mSchool's target group, which are educators, teachers, researchers and learners (which can interchangeably be one of the three before). <b>But most of all, it should appeal to all of you here at Edlab who will be working on the project.</b>

The design of the mSchool web site (including signifiers, logo, colors and other styling) will reflect the persona's color, identity and story (loosely). We will possibly be doing <u>a A/B testing of a plain version of mschool <i>vs</i> the one with the identity to see how engaging the latter will be</u> once we're ready to launch.

Some are more polished since they are not original and taken only as closest representations of what can be designed. The less polished ones were originally designed and drawn this morning and will be developed further once the decision is finalized (of course with all your feedbacks)

<b>Here is a roster of mascots</b>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/sKFc7yp.png?1" title="source: imgur.com" />

<b>Socrates</b> (The Greek Philosopher)
This philosopher needs no introduction. He was actually in the painting “the School of Athen” walking alongside Plato, which was the origin of the concept of mSchool (meta- school). He is the symbol for knowledge and virtue, and especially a famous figure in playwright and dramatic art. This design is not original, and will be designed later if selected.
Learn more about him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">here</a>.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/X5YECci.png?1" title="source: imgur.com" />

<b>Athena</b> (The Female Greek Philosopher/goddess)
The very goddess depicted as the <i>Alma mater</i> sculpture of Columbia University herself, only a few knows that she is the greek goddess of wisdom with an owl by her side as companion. This is arguably why an owl represents knowledge and wisdom globally. While she is often depicted with a shield and spear in both hands, she was the guardian goddess of Athen, the Greek city where all philosophers gather and defined the root of school as we know today.
Learn more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Mater_%28New_York_sculpture%29">Alma mater</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena">goddess</a>.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/s2W9ftH.png?1" title="source: imgur.com" />

<b>Gibran</b> (The cross-culture thinker)
Kahlil Gibran is a famous thinker, artist and poet of Lebanese origin who have bridged his culture and the western world. Kalil Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all times following Shakespeare and Laozi. One of hist most noted work <i>the Prophet</i> has been translated into 40 languages and is among the bestselling books of the twentieth century in the United States. 
Learn more about him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran">here</a>.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6OnLeub.png?1" title="source: imgur.com" />

<b>Animal</b> (alias)
We are also exploring an animal that represents the idea of “meta- school” well. The owl is out since it has been used for too many times it has become a cliche of knowledge than a symbol. Some kind of hybrid creature, or even eastern deities which do not resemble a human may be in this category. Right now a Google's gopher is used as a placeholder for animal which has nothing to do with school or meta- school at all. (It's just cute and perfect for the hero section)

<b>Samples on mschool mockups</b>

<b>Socrates</b>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7F3qQFu.png" title="source: imgur.com" />
The scheme central to this id is easy. A Parthenon-esque facade that represents a ‘M', a thunder bolt for ‘Launch' (Zeus, anyone?), stone blocks reminding of Greek contruction, etc. and of course colors of buttons and elements reflecting the id.

<b>Athena</b>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/L0bWm0q.png" title="source: imgur.com" />
Pretty much similar to Socrates (since they are both Greek), but possibly with different playful signifiers like the a wooden horse, apple (Troy, anyone?), shield, spear, owl can be used instead. 

<b>Gibran</b>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/MEb6qMq.png" title="source: imgur.com" />
The intention is to not have people actually know him (that would be like having an Einstein mascot), but sort of want to know who he represents and also represent the users themselves. This version of Gibran looks like a teacher, with a khaki blazer, a paper box often found in teachers' rooms and libraries, scissors for mashing up contents, and coffee to “sit back and enjoy”. 

<b>Animal</b>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/o8akSCy.png" title="source: imgur.com" />
I don't know what a rocket, cloning and bull horn has anything to do with a gopher, and what a gopher has to do with mschool. This is just a placeholder of a general animal with this gopher representing the overall style of what it can or will be.
