Can a passion for reading be taught? Last week's article in the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/We-Cant-Teach-Students-to/128400/#disqus_thread">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> explores the advent of text-based schooling and questions the idea that inspired teaching can create lifelong readers. Alan Jacobs, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pleasures-Reading-Age-Distraction/dp/0199747490"><i>The Pleasures of Reading in an Age of Distraction</i></a>, argues that the ability to experience pleasure in long form reading has always been a minority pursuit and that educators have been stinking up this issue with our reading love bias for years. Notably absent from the discussion are the illiterate masses to which Jacobs alludes. Joking aside, the article has inspired a lot of thoughts not only about the teaching of reading, but about the migration of quality content. The biggest issue in educating readers today is that we may fail to identify that good modern reading transcends format. 

Perhaps Jacobs is right that the naturally occurring ability to enjoy a sustained literary effort cannot be taught--officially not a problem anymore. The essential skill isn't in reading text, but sharing ideas. We can listen to Patrick Stewart read Dickens (sounds scintillating) or view the story in <a href="http://www.arthuralevinebooks.com/book.asp?bookid=123"><i>The Arrival</i></a>. At risk of losing my librarian license, don't read <a href="http://www.charlaineharris.com/">Charlaine Harris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood"><i>True Blood</i></a> is just superior storytelling. 

I think that one of the most poignant arguments against Alan Jacobs' article really stems from this growing format equality. Austin Allen on the <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/39658">Big Think</a> blog suggests that the ubiquity of the intimidatingly long and resolutely print Harry Potter series disproves Jacobs' idea that the love of reading is born with readers. I think Harry Potter just happened to be a book. 

I, like Jacobs, am a born or made reader who has failed many times to ignite this love in others. It's frustrating and it's much easier to feel superior than maligned. One may not be able to teach love, but the ability to teach bias has never been in question. It's important that teachers of literacy encourage students to participate in language and evaluate sources. Modeling a well-rounded intellectual sensibility certainly can't hurt the teaching of reading, though it may not inflame a passion for print.
