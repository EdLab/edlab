            <i>After attending the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6913">“Workshop on Meaning: Language and Socio- cultural Processes”</a> given by Duncan Watts along with Manav, I was equally impressed by his thoughts on Professor Watt's work, and his assertions regarding the potential benefits of creating a fully open data-commons.  I was also impressed that Manav chose to venture-back into the incredibly crowded, tiny classroom to speak to Dr. Watts and clarify points that he explores in his post listed below.  

Regardless of whether or not (Dr. Watts would be in the "not" group) you believe that Twitter is a social network, it remains to be seen what what data "gold" from social networks and micro blog platforms will be mined and transformed into insight over the coming years.  If researchers are allowed to freely rummage around the great attic that is our social networks, how will these insights shape the future of both human interaction and the form in which these networks take?  Manav manages to both ask the big question that will be at the core of these debates for years to come while summing-up one of the biggest issues, "research questions must still be modified and narrowed to fit the data available. You'll surely say "Duh. That will always be the case." True. But now, often times it's not the lack of data that forces this, but a lack of access to data."  Will Facebook and Twitter allow us to peek-into the attic and fully mine their data "gold?"  Only time will tell... if we, like Manav, continue to ask the right questions.</i>

Read the entire post below.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6915">I know you have it, just let me borrow it.</a></b>

After his talk “Workshop on Meaning: Language and Socio- cultural Processes”, I got to chat a little with Dr. Watts about the current process of getting data sets from social networks (though he insists Twitter is not really a social network). While the web has made measurement in social science orders of magnitude easier than before, research questions must still be modified and narrowed to fit the data available. You'll surely say "Duh. That will always be the case." True. But now, often times it's not the lack of data that forces this, but a lack of access to data. 

In, "Who Says What to Whom on Twitter," Dr. Watts mentions that his research was limited by the Twitter API allowing only 20k calls per hour, where only 20 lists may be retrieved for each API call, requiring the study to determine categories of interest in advance to get data in a reasonable timeframe. Depending on the questions you ask, this can cause unwanted bias in the data set, but at least it's something. Facebook, where Dr. Watts is performing a digital <a href="http://smallworld.sandbox.yahoo.com/">Small World study</a> through an app his team developed, is notoriously closed about any and all data they have. 

This isn't too surprising; they are businesses first and their network structures and information are their value. Why give any IP or data up until it's clear what you'll get in return (and until you've gone public)? Privacy issues are also an enormous deterrent to sharing. But it is sad to see such vast data sets (and deep in the case of Facebook), not available for analysis. 

The rules are certainly not written in stone. Twitter was once a fire-hose of information, especially as they were trying to figure out how to monetize the platform, and now, for a variety of reasons, they are slowly limiting access. Facebook on the other hand, with its massive research talent acquisition over the last few years, seems to be opening up. Dr. Watts has hope that Facebook will soon allow academic researchers work with them in their goldmine of data. Though it should be said that even as the web and web analytics modernizes, it is not clear that these datasets will be the social sciences godsend they are expected to be. But there's no way to know until we really get to take a look.
