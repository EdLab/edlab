There have been several <a href="http://www.ere.net/2009/07/21/everyone-wants-to-help-you-with-your-resume/">startups</a> aimed at reinventing rÃ©sumÃ© and achievement presentation. <a href="http://www.internsushi.com/">Intern Sushi</a> launched with an eye to presentation in film, television, sports, music, fashion and advertising internships and has since expanded, mostly into tech. The site is dual purpose, helping prospective interns create exciting achievement records and prospective employers sift creatively through the rÃ©sumÃ© deluge. 

<b>Pros:</b>
RÃ©sumÃ© presentation is only one aspect of Sushi, which aims to become a social network and task management platform for the entire internship process. As an employer, you're able to assign projects and track progress through the site and when the internship is over, upload a recommendation video to the student's profile. The site's paid features are tempting and clever, premium interns are able to post unlimited videos targeted at specific positions and get a 48-hour advance on applying to all positions. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The site relies heavily on social media connection over traditional communication methods, which seems like it would be a con for young people with lived-in social profiles. The site is also slightly too cool for practicality; semi-functional funky scrollbars and surprising, usage-diverting popups abound though the overall effect is sleek. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Sushi is clearly aimed at the young and emphasizes personality and goals over education and experience. The site comes off more trendy than <a href="http://www.thestar.com/business/article/1142264--facebook-predicts-job-success-better-than-personality-tests">trending</a>, but it seems like a job-seeking spinoff isn't too far away. Vialogues marketing alums might be interested in their campus ambassadors program, which rewards undergraduate students $5 for every person they sign to the site. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Intern sushi seeks to create representation for those underserved by the traditional rÃ©sumÃ© model.
