          <p>
            Recently, I came across <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/living-in-dialogue/2011/05/oakland_teachers_show_the_powe.html">this article</a> in Education Week on the <a href="http://millsscholars.org/">Mills Teacher Scholars</a> project based at Mills College in Oakland, California. Instead of bringing in (and paying for) outside consultants to interpret data culled from the classroom and recommend changes based on it, teachers who are part of the scholars program meet monthly to discuss their students' learning, look at data they themselves have collected while teaching, and figure out effective instructional strategies. The teachers are all graduates of the Mills College School of Education and work in area public school districts with a diverse group of students. After choosing an area of learning to focus on, the scholars meet to collaborate, and are able to analyze data from different schools and different grade levels (as with any research project, the more data the better) and can immediately implement improvements while building upon what they and their colleagues have learned about a variety of subjects and teaching methods. 

With so much focus on data from testing as a basis for measuring educational success, it's great to see classroom data immediately affecting the lives of the students who produce it. Since the data is gathered and analyzed by their teachers, resulting changes can be quickly and efficiently implemented in the classroom as teachers learn how their students learn best. Perhaps if teachers were provided with the time, space, and tools to analyze their work as they  teach, school districts could eliminate much of the need for outside consultants while at the same time giving teachers a chance to gain new skills and improve their students' learning.
