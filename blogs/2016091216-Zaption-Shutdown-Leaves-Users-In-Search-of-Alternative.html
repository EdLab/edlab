          <p>
            Following its acquisition this past June by <a href="https://www.workday.com/" target="_blank">Workday</a>, a publicly-traded human capital management software company, <a href="https://www.zaption.com/" target="_blank">Zaption</a> has announced that it will be shutting down its service on September 30, 2016. 

Zaption allowed users to add annotations to videos in the form of questions, comments, surveys, and quizzes. It’s impending end is leaving users scrambling for an alternative site to host high-quality, interactive video content. If you find yourself in this boat, let me to offer you a life raft in the form of <a href="https://vialogues.com" target="_blank">Vialogues</a>, a video discussion platform created by <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">EdLab</a> of Teachers College Columbia University. 

There are many solid reasons you might want to give Vialogues a whirl. Among them...
<ul>
<p><li><b>It’s free!</b> Really, there’s no catch. Vialogues is absolutely free to use. You can create as many vialogues as you want and invite an unlimited number of people to participate in your video discussions. </li>
</p>
<p><li><b>Test your audience.</b> Get a quick read on whoever is engaging with your vialogue by administering a poll or survey; test their knowledge of a topic with multiple choice questions. This gives you, the moderator, a chance to gauge sentiment and understanding across your audience. </p>

<p><li><b>Embed vialogues anywhere.</b> You can create portable video discussions by pulling the embed code off of any play page and posting it anywhere that reads HTML tags (i.e., websites, blogs, and LMSs like Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard, and Edmodo). This allows your audience to interact with your video discussion in whatever context you’d prefer. </p>

<p><li><b>Pick a source, any source.</b> You have an array of options when it comes to sourcing your video discussion. 

	<b>1.</b>	If you have a video file from, say, a lecture or screencast you or your students made, cool! You can upload files in a wide range of supported formats (i.e., mov, flv, mp4, mpg, mpeg, avi, wmv, 3gp). 

	<b>2.</b>	If you’re not sure what video you’d like to use, have a look around the site and see what other educators across a wide range of disciplines are doing. If you see something you like, chances are you’ll be able to create a new vialogue based off of the video they are using (provided that they’re using a public video). 

	<b>3.</b>	You can also choose to embed videos straight from YouTube or Vimeo, our most popular option. </p>

<li><b>We have research on our side.</b> We hold ourselves accountable to our mission to make learning better. As such, we are constantly collecting and analyzing data that allows us to investigate video’s evolving role in online learning and how Vialogues specifically contributes to a conducive learning environment.

I can go on about how Vialogues can help you create a unique, interactive learning experience, but you don’t just have to take my word for it. Here’s what educators are saying about Vialogues: 

<blockquote>Our new favorite tool for discussing video is Vialogues. [...] This is a great way to share your group's discussions with other learners from other places by inviting them to add to your comments, to do their own for comparison, or by making your Vialogue public.
- Mike RobbGrieco, <a href="http://ml4ml.blogspot.com/p/vialogues.html" target="_blank">Media Lunacy for Media Literacy</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Vialogues is a great tool for teachers looking to integrate Web media into traditional, flipped, or blended classes.  [...] Features are relatively simple to use, and the help pages are well-organized, thorough, and easy to follow. Email help is available.  
- Amanda Finkelberg, <a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/website/vialogues" target="_blank">Common Sense Education</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Vialogues could be a great tool to use to publish questions for your students to answer while they are watching a video that you have created or found online. 
- Richard Byrne, <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2015/02/try-vialogues-to-build-discussions.html#.V9a1jT4rLR0" target="_blank">Free Technology for Teachers</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>All in all, it seems to me that this is a web-service well worth exploring in the classroom, and I am itching to find a project I can try it out with!
- Dorian Love, <a href="https://digiteacher.wordpress.com/2012/06/09/vialogues-in-your-classroom/" target="_blank">The DigiTeacher</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>[I use Vialogues because] I frequently use video in my class to support student learning. I also create (and have students create) and share videos to document work process and product. I believe this helps students comprehend by providing another mode of information.
- <a href="https://wiobyrne.com/using-vialogues-to-scaffold-student-use-of-video-and-dialogue-in-the-classroom/" target="_blank">W. Ian O’Byrne</a></blockquote>
