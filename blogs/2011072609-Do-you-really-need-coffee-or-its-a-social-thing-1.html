Quoting <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/14"> Hui Soo's </a> question to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/2295">Megha</a>, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/274">George</a> and <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/703">Ankit</a> during the Sloan Conference: "Do you guys really need coffee in the morning or is it a social thing?" I'd like to start a mini blog series. The series could be about any casual constructive conversations we have on our way for coffee and pastries. 

I'd like to present the grand opening series

----------------------------------------------------------------

Megha and Angela's conversation on "Pursuing a master's degree."


Angela: " I am thinking about getting my Master's in the near future, but I'm not sure what I'd like to major in"

Megha: " I suggest you figure out what your passion is...don't just get a master degree for the sake of getting one - or it's useless."
                 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Of course the above conversation is shortened, but it sparked an interesting thought- How many people are simply getting their Masters because they believe a Master's degree will ensure employment more so than those with a four year degree.

The NY Times recently published an article on this topic titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24masters-t.html?_r=1&ref=education">The Master's as the New Bachelor's</a>. 

Here are some of the key points below:

 "Call it credential inflation. Once derided as the consolation prize for failing to finish a Ph.D. or just a way to kill time waiting out economic downturns, the master's is now the fastest-growing degree. The number awarded, about 657,000 in 2009, has more than doubled since the 1980s, and the rate of increase has quickened substantially in the last couple of years"

"While many new master's are in so-called STEM areas – science, technology, engineering and math – humanities departments, once allergic to applied degrees, are recognizing that not everyone is ivory tower-bound and are drafting credentials for rÃ©sumÃ© boosting."

"There is definitely some devaluing of the college degree going on, and that gives the master's extra signaling power. We are going deeper into the pool of high school graduates for college attendance, making a bachelor's no longer an adequate screening measure of achievement for employers."


"While jobs at Welch Allyn may not require a master's, the degree has been used as a sorting mechanism. After posting an opening for a technical writer, Mr. Mc- Gloon received “dozens and dozens” of rÃ©sumÃ©s. Those in charge of hiring wondered where to start. “I said, ‘Half of our applicants have master's. That's our first cut.' ”



-------------------------------------------------------------------
I somehow related this article to what's going on in the fashion industry. I will use Louis Vuitton as an example as it is one of the most high end brands in the industry. It is famous for it's sturdy leather, beautiful pattern and of course - a skillful PR campaign. It seems that we all crave for a one of a kind and unique product such as Louis Vuitton, which is slowly becoming an "entry level" bag for the rich and famous. As the Louis Vuitton bag is seen almost everywhere on the street- Hermes Berkin's series started to sneak on to some of the most fashionable figures at a price ranging from $6000 to $50,000. I wonder if or when the exclusive Hermes Berkins bag will become the next Louis Vuitton.  

And finally quoting the article: "Will the Ph.D. become the new master's?"
