          <p>
            Solar energy begins with the sun. Solar panels, also known as photovoltaics, are used to convert light from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads. Light from the sun is a renewable energy resource that provides clean energy, produced by solar panels.<p>

Solar panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power systems for cabins, telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of course for the production of electricity by residential and commercial solar panel systems.<p>

I hear everyday, on TV, newspapers,magazines, that we have to save the planet. Did you know there are areas in this world that don't have power, they don't even know it exists. Yet in other parts of the world humans are wasting it. There is an alternative to this problem, and a good one. We have it on the top of our head everyday. It Is called solar energy. <p>

We all know that electricity has been here since the early 1900's. When it started, there wasn't much demand for it, First of all, because most people didn't have it in their houses, secondly, the only use for it was for light bulbs. Then came heaters, stoves, and then followed by electric appliances and everything else that work with electricity. But today  the demand is so strong for electricity, we have to find other ways how to produce it. Did you know that Canada is the number one  producer of electricity in the world? that the United States have to buy energy from Canada, because the demand is to strong, so i think now is the perfect time to make this solar panels work because, now at this time almost everything work with electricity which means we are causing problems to our green planet and what a better solution than pure energy taken from the sunlight without polluting our planet and save money from our pocket. <p> 

There are many reasons why we should all use solar panels to provide a source of clean, cheap and renewable energy for our homes. <p>

I Think the main reason why we should use solar panels at home is because, its energy actually taken from the sun which means that its natural and less harmful for our planet so it could keep our environment clean. <p>

Another reason why we should use solar panels is because, this will reduced your electricity bill. But this doesn't means you'll see results immediately Because one of the best solar panel cost around 31,082.00 Dollars, so this means you have to make an investment first then later on you will see results in you saving money.<p>
