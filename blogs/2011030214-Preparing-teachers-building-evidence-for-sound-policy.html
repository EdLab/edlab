            <strong>Title</strong>: Preparing teachers : building evidence for sound policy

<strong>Author</strong> :  Committee on the Study of Teacher Preparation Programs in the United States, Center for Education, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education

<strong>Publisher</strong>: Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press

<!-- field v --><!-- field # --><strong>From the Publisher:</strong>
<div><em>Preparing Teachers</em> addresses the issue of teacher preparation with specific attention to reading, mathematics, and science. The book evaluates the characteristics of the candidates who enter teacher preparation programs, the sorts of instruction and experiences teacher candidates receive in preparation programs, and the extent that the required instruction and experiences are consistent with converging scientific evidence. <em>Preparing Teachers</em> also identifies a need for a data collection model to provide valid and reliable information about the content knowledge, pedagogical competence, and effectiveness of graduates from the various kinds of teacher preparation programs.

Federal and state policy makers need reliable, outcomes-based information to make sound decisions, and teacher educators need to know how best to contribute to the development of effective teachers. Clearer understanding of the content and character of effective teacher preparation is critical to improving it and to ensuring that the same critiques and questions are not being repeated 10 years from now.</div>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Study Background</span></h3>
Teacher quality is widely recognized by policymakers, practitioners, and researchers alike to be the most powerful school-related influence on a child’s academic performance. As a consequence, accountability measures in federal education law are increasingly focused on ensuring that there is a highly qualified teacher in every classroom, and that in turn, the teacher preparation programs housed within institutions of higher education are themselves of high quality.</td>

Consistent with its mission to provide independent, evidence based advice to government on key public policy issues, the Center for Education of the NRC will bring together a committee of leading experts to provide an assessment and synthesis of the evidence associated with teacher preparation programs, in both traditional and alternative settings.
