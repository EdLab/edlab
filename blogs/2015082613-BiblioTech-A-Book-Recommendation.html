          <p>
            I just finished reading John Palfrey's <i><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/record=b2066489">BiblioTech: Why Libraries Matter More than Ever in the Age of Google</i></a>, and could easily recommend it to anyone at EdLab. It's not the most groundbreaking text, but it's highly readable and relates to our work in a lot of ways. 

The book is pretty broad—much more of an overview of the current issues facing libraries than a deep dive on anything specific—and includes chapters on library spaces, user experience, technology, and challenges related to different types of libraries. I don't think I'm really the target audience for this book, as it seems geared more towards a general public with a strong sense of library nostalgia rather than anyone with much experience with current library trends. Palfrey himself isn't a librarian—he's primarily an educator, and has worked as a law professor, the Head of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_Academy">Phillips Academy</a>, and the executive director of Harvard's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkman_Center_for_Internet_%26_Society">Berkman research center</a>, where he contributed heavily to the founding of the Digital Public Library of America.

I think most librarians <i>(Dana, I'm talking to you)</i> could probably skip to the last chapter, honestly, and get the gist—and I'm not sure the parts on copyright law, library networks, and preservation issues will be all that interesting to everyone (though maybe I'm wrong!). However, the section on privacy may resonate with our researchers and developers, and Chapter Eight ("Education: Libraries and Connected Learners") is definitely relevant for all of us here at EdLab.

Overall, Palfrey makes a few key points: he argues that libraries need to seriously start collaborating to tackle some of the bigger ideas of the day (building on innovation in information management, developing solid digital & physical preservation strategies so we don't lose a huge chunk of our knowledge base, etc.), and that we as a nation need to invest more heavily in library research & development so we can continue to provide equal public access to knowledge. It's a good goal, but unfortunately there aren't really any solutions on offer. I guess that's supposed to be our job?
