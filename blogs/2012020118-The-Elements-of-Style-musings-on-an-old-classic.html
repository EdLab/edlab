            As  I was checking in items from the book drop recently I noticed that  someone had returned my favorite grammar book, if one can have only one  favorite grammar book: <em>The Elements of Style</em>.   The book is slim and unassuming (especially the version of the book we  have here, which  looks like this):

<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2012/02/51yQb9-P84L._SL500_AA300_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15404" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/02/51yQb9-P84L._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

<em>The Elements of Style</em> is more a style guide than an extensive set of grammar rules; it’s a  clear and concise guide to writing well, and helpful to a wide range of  writers (professional and beginners alike). Roger Angell, who wrote the  introduction to the 2005 edition, says, “How often I have turned to [these rules], in the book or in my mind, while trying to start or  unblock or revise some piece of my own writing! They help--they really  do. They work. They are the way.” If that strikes you as an unusually  robust recommendation, consider E.B. White’s own introduction to the  1979 edition (which he revised and edited from its original version,  written by White’s mentor William Strunk Jr.), in which he claims, “In  its original form, it was a forty-three page summation of the case for  cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English. Today,  fifty-two years later, its vigor is unimpaired, and for sheer pith I  think it probably sets a record that is not likely to be broken.” White  revised the text in his 1979 edition to include feminine pronouns in his  examples, and references to technology unavailable at the time of its  first printing.  But the most exciting addition to the newest edition, published in 2005, is  the work of painter/illustrator/writer Maira Kalman.

<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/02/41j6rvs40bL._SS500_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15403" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/02/41j6rvs40bL._SS500_-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Kalman, whose illustrations often grace the covers of <em>New Yorker</em> magazine, and whose publications include both children’s and adult art  books, tends to offer a quirky take on every situation she paints.  She  particularly excels at painting scenes that accentuate an accompanying  narrative, as she does in my favorite book of hers, <em>The Principals of Uncertainty</em>.  Most recently, she illustrated Michael Pollen’s book, <em>Food</em>.  In <em>The Elements of Style</em>, her illustration elevate Strunk’s already  quirky example sentences into an artform--something I don’t tend to  expect when reading a book of grammar rules.  For example:

<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/02/elements-05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15405" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/02/elements-05-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></a>

The  caption under the illustration of the dog, in case you can't read it,  is "Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."  The sentence is an  example showing that "a name or a title in direct address is  parenthetic," and exists under the general rule, "Enclose parenthetic  expressions between commas." It's a handy rule, made visual by Kalman's  sad yet sweet looking dog.
