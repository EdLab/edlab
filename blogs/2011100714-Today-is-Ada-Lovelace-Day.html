For those that do not know, today is an important date for women in the STEM fields. Today is the day we celebrate the work women have done in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. A way to participate in this celebration is to blog about a woman in the STEM field, to spread awareness on how much women have contributed to math, science engineering, and technology, and also to encourage more girls to go into STEM majors (there's way too many men!) There are still too few women in the STEM fields, but hopefully that will change soon. 

I want to talk a bit about <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace"> Ada Lovalace</a> (born Augusta Ada Byron) because her story is very interesting. She was the first person to write a computer program, and she worked on an early mechanical general-purpose computer, the analytical engine, which is considered as a model for the computer. It was her notes on the engine that is considered as the first algorithm to be processed by a machine, and this was back in 1842. She saw the use of computers going beyond number-crunching and calculations in a time where everyone else only focused on those uses. If you want to be a part of this celebration of women in STEM then blog about a woman you know who is in the math, science, engineering, or technology field!
