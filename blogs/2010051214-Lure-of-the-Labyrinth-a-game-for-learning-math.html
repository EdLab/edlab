<blockquote>
Lure of the Labyrinth is a product of the Learning Games to Go (LG2G) project, funded by a Star Schools grant from the U.S. Department of Education, spearheaded by Maryland Public Television (MPT).

...

The development of Lure of the Labyrinth involved a group of educational and game experts working in concert:

<ul> 
<li>The Education Arcade at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was responsible for game design, under the leadership of Project Manager Scot Osterweil.</li>
<li>The multimedia studio and educational publisher FableVision was responsible for executing the game design, including story line development, programming, art work, and narrative voice work.</li>
<li>The research firm ORC-Macro was responsible for providing formative and summative evaluation that helped shape the development of the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
(From http://labyrinth.thinkport.org/www/about.php)

I first learned about this game at the Game Developers Conference in 2008. At that time it was called Labyrinth. Now it is called The Lure of the Labyrinth, and is available for free <a href="http://labyrinth.thinkport.org/www/index.php">here</a>.

I registered for an account today and played for about 15 minutes. The game began with several pages of cartoon drawings to illustrate the intro story, where "I" lost my pet and traced her into a mysterious cave where monsters lived. "I" disguised myself as a monster and went into the cave in order to salvage my pet. Then the gameplay started and "I" had to talk to different monsters and explore the cave labyrinth in order to collect clues and artifacts that will help me find the pet. By the time I logged out, I haven't encountered any activity related to math. However, based on the video resources on the game website, math concepts and activities are integrated into the gameplay. You can find the videos <a href="http://labyrinth.thinkport.org/www/educators/resources/video.php">here.</a>

It looks like a nice game and I'll continue playing to find out more.
