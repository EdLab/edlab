<p>Put down the pricey computer software; <a href="http://tentouchapps.com/grafio/">Grafio 3</a> gives users a new and easy way to create graphs on their tablets and smartphones. It provides templates and tools to create colorful, professional diagrams that users can export to email, PDF, and social media sites.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Grafio 3 makes it easy to create a graph that looks professional. To start their graphs, users can either choose from a wide range of already-available shapes or draw their own. The app recognizes hand drawn shapes and lines and automatically neatens them. This feature makes connecting the shapes a breeze. Also, when text is added to the shapes, it automatically adjusts to stay within the lines. If you don’t have the time to start from scratch, however, Grafio 3 also provides 92 pre-formatted diagrams.</p>
 
<p>Users also have a lot of flexibility when it comes to choosing fonts, colors, and pictures. One of the most interesting features is the ability to insert pictures from a photo gallery into the shapes as background images.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite all the flexibility Grafio allows, it also demands plenty of patience. The tools are not always intuitive, so learning all the features could take time, especially if you start a graph from scratch. In addition, Grafio doesn’t always understand your intentions. Sometimes, when trying to connect two shapes with a simple line, it took several attempts before the app was able to get it right. This was incredibly frustrating, a glitch worth fixing in future versions of this app. </p>

<p>Finally, Grafio Lite 3 (the free version) only allows users to make four graphs at a time and limits their exporting capability. If users need more space and export flexibility, they will have to buy the full version, which is $7.99. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>This app is a great tool for easily creating charts and graphs without much frustration. It could supplement brainstorming sessions, presentations, and papers and be useful not only to students and teachers, but also to people working at a wide range of jobs or simply trying to organize day-to-day life.</p>
