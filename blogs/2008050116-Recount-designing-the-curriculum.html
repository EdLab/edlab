            Recount
Top 5 things we wish to put into the curriculum

1. Bush vs. Gore. The Supreme Court Decision. 

This is the decision that ends it all, its not too long, definitely readable, and I think we should include this into the CM. Personally I feel its important for the students to read the entire decision, not just an abridged version (its gonna be hard though right?! haha). Thus our job should be to find a way to make the reading easier, perhaps a guide with highlights, key vocabulary terms...etc. We can also use the decision as a basis for discussions of other topics such as Electoral College. 

For example, the decision says:

"The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College." 

2. What is the Electoral College. Why is there an Electoral College? Do we still need an Electoral College? Is the US presidential election still a "popularity contest" when a candidate loses even after winning the popular vote?

Prior to 2000, the last time a candidate lost the popular vote but won the election was Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876. How are the voters different <a href="http://pbskids.org/democracy/vote/timemachine.html">then</a> and in 2000? Students can research on the demographics of the voters (e.g. women weren't allowed to vote in 1876) and discuss whether a Electoral College is still a better way to elect presidents (compare to just counting the popular votes). 


3. Ballot Design. Examine the different types of ballots out there. Apart from designing their own ballots, students can also look into the Help America Vote Act 2002. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Act. Students can also work in teams and design a mock "Help America Vote Act 2002". 

While the Supreme Court stressed how unconstitutional it was to count the undervotes without a standard manual, in reality, counties are free to choose the voting equipments they use. What can be done to avoid another Florida? Is "Help America Vote Act 2002" enough?

4. Campaign Managers. What is it like to be in a campaign office? What kind of things are being done in a campaign headquarter? Who are the key people? After learning the structure of a campaign office, students can do a role play of how work is done in a regional/ town campaign office...etc

5. 3 branches of government. 

How is it that the Supreme Court gets to decide who is the election winner. According to <a href="http://www.nationalmockelection.org/docs/nspme_fact_sheet.pdf">an American Bar Association Poll</a>, only 56% of respondents know the 3 branches of the government. 20% of the respondents think that the 3 branches are: Democrats, Republicans and Independent. There are lots of evidence of how this division of power is honored in the movie. Students can also compare how this division of power is achieved in other countries with different structure (e.g. UK parliament). 

The 3 branches of government topic can also be a basis for discussing the counties' reactions to the requests for recounts made by the Democrats. How are things enforced and executed in the government. What is the relationship between the county, state and the country? How can the counties officers just decided not to continue to recount (even before the Supreme Court decision).
