<a href="http://www.nmc.org/publications/2012-horizon-report-k12">Johnson, L., Adams, S., and Cummins, M. (2012). NMC Horizon Report: 2012 K-12 Edition. Austin, Texas: The New Media Consortium.</a>

The annual <i>NMC Horizon Report</i> “charts the landscape of emerging technologies for teaching, learning, research, creative inquiry, and information management,” in order to help inform educators' technology strategies. For the past several years, the New Media Consortium (NMC) has published the <i>NMC Horizon Report</i> in collaboration with the Consortium of School Networking (CoSN) and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). The report is generated by the <a href="http://k12.wiki.nmc.org/Advisory+Board">advisory board</a>, an international team of education and technology experts, who research and dialogue to determine the most significant emerging technologies and trends likely to have the greatest impact on education over the next five years.  There are three different editions of the <i>NMC Horizon Report</i> for different educational sectors - primary and secondary education, higher education, and museum education. This summary will focus on the results of the K-12 edition.

Summary

The report highlights six technologies and practices anticipated to be adopted by the majority of K-12 schools over the course of three adoption “horizons.” In the near-term, the report identifies two closely related technologies, <i>mobile devices & apps</i> and <i>tablet computing</i>, as the technologies that are expected to enter mainstream use in schools over the next year or less. Many schools are already experimenting with “bring your own device” (BYOD) programs, such as <a href="http://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/byot">Forsyth County Schools in Georgia</a>, and educators are exploring the use of <a href="http://appsintheclassroom.com">apps in the classroom</a>. There are <a href="http://www.mitty.com/academics/ipad-overview">many</a> <a href="http://svsdipad.weebly.com/">examples</a> of pioneering tablet programs in schools, plus publishers are releasing e-textbooks for tablets and libraries are building e-book collections. It is easy to see the relevance of tablet computing and mobiles devices & apps for teaching and learning. Frankly, these are the obvious near-term choices, since these technologies are already having an enormous impact on education.

On the mid-term horizon - two to three years out - the report predicts that <i>game-based learning</i> and <i>personal learning environments</i> will become widely adopted in schools. Game-based learning is becoming more and more accepted among educators, thanks to growing <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/video-games-learning-student-engagement-judy-willis">research</a> demonstrating the effectiveness of games for learning. At this point games are not integrated very well into K-12 curriculum due to lack of resources, but if President Obama supports the <a href="http://stemchallenge.org/">National STEM Video Game Challenge</a>, maybe times are changing. The concept of personal learning environments (PLEs) “refer[s] to the personal collections of tools and resources a person assembles to support their own learning - both formal and informal.” The idea is for students to engage in directing and designing their own personally relevant learning strategies, providing them more control over how they learn. For example, <a href="http://playnml.wikispaces.com/PLAY!">The PLAYground</a> is one of many examples of online platforms for “curation, creation, and circulation of user-generated learning activities.”

The forecasts for the far-term horizon of four to five years are especially interesting to consider, namely, <i>augmented reality</i> and <i>natural user interfaces</i>. While the report admits a lack of well-documented usage of these technologies in the K-12 arena, the interest and investment in both areas is significant. Examples of augmented reality (AR) - that is, “the <a href="http://learnar.org/index.html">layering</a> of information over a view or representation of the normal world, offering users the ability to access place-based information in ways that are compellingly intuitive” - are already popular in more informal educational settings, such as <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2010/november/museum-brings-extinct-creatures-to-life-before-your-eyes90697.html">museums</a>. The goal of natural user interfaces (NUI) is to replace the keyboard and mouse as the norm for human/computer interactions, allowing computers to respond to more “natural” movements, such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. The current classic example of NUI is the Microsoft Kinect, about which <a href="http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Personal/The-Power-of-the-Natural-User-Interface">Bill Gates says</a>:

<blockquote>This has profound implications. At the most basic level, it means people will be able to use technology without any special knowledge or training. Advanced computing tools that can only be used by experts with highly specialized skills today will be available to anyone in the not-too-distant future.</blockquote>

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>

Overall, this report seems to be worth a read for anyone involved in education and technology to get a sense of where things are heading in the next few years. Since EdLab is uniquely positioned in the landscape of emerging technologies, I'm curious to hear what you think of this report. What technologies or trends are missing from this report? Do you agree with the time-to-adoption “horizons” predicted by the advisory board? If these forecasts are true, how can EdLab anticipate involvement in educational AR and NUI projects that relate to our mission?

Note: Two additional emerging technologies mentioned in the <a href="http://www.nmc.org/publications/horizon-report-2012-higher-ed-edition">Higher Ed Edition</a> of the <i>NMC Horizon Report</i> are <i>learning analytics</i> (two to three years out) and the <i>internet of things</i> (four to fives years out).
