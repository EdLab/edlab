<p>In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, sand mandalas represent the impermanence of the material world. Monks spend days to weeks creating intricate, geometric designs that are as meaningful as they are magnificent. Once they have finished, their creations are ceremoniously destroyed.</p> 

<p>Students from Forbes College at Princeton University took a lesson in sacrifice as they created their own mandalas under the instruction of top-ranking Buddhist monks. They produced a wonderfully ornate design in their own right and worked on it together for hours, all the while knowing it would inevitably be discarded. The students learned of attachment and suffering; one student even called the experience "beautiful."</p>

<p>Would the lessons have been as powerful if the monks were not the ones to teach them? Is there an age minimum to learn of pain and sacrifice? Discuss with other interested parties over <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18753">on Vialogues.</a> </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:24 Carla:</b> Would you still put as much effort into something that you knew would get thrown in the garbage? I guess that's the point of this lesson, but I still wonder if I would have a positive enough outlook to invest so much time and energy into something so impermanent.</p>

<p><b>@01:36 YogiP:</b> Despite their attachment to the beautiful works they created, they have to destroy them. The root of pain and suffering is attachment. To let go of this is to let go of suffering.</p>
