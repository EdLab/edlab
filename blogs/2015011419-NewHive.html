<p><a href="https://newhive.com">NewHive</a> is an open social network that simplifies basic web development and puts real digital creation in the hands of non-programmers and guides users through the process of creating digital art. The site is free form, so users can create with almost total freedom to embed, remix, and structure their pages. The site is new and has mostly been used to create digital art projects, but there's already evidence (and slick examples: <a href="http://newhive.com/pmfarrell/how-tos-and-playlists">1</a>, <a href=" https://newhive.com/kigero12/multicultural-education">2</a>) of this platform also being used to host free-form educational content.</p>

<p><b>New Kinds of Courses:</b><br>
The backbone of the site is customizable tools that users leverage to publish multi-media projects. The <i>UserGuide</i> is an educational resource in itself and breaks down all the functions of the site. The instructors who are currently using NewHive seem to approach it as an accessible and infinitely linkable course homepage. Because the site is web hosted and cross platform, it can act as a bridge to other course platforms and resources. There is even the potential for NewHive, as an easily buildable and flexible resource, to disrupt more robust and restrictive LMS platforms like Moodle and Blackboard. However, the expansive possibility that comes with NewHive also brings disorganization. A loose template for educators might help scaffold teachers and students into a shared community space.</p>

<p><b>A Digital Art Gallery:</b><br>
Looking for inspiration? New Hive also features the work of community members. Users can favorite, share on Facebook or Twitter, follow, and comment on other users' work. The interface resembles a mix of Pinterest and Facebook, with a focus on digital creations and many options for engaging and sharing.</p>

<p>Unlike other similar sites, NewHive also commissions new digital works and provides a stipend to artists along with additional technical support. These commissioned pieces are featured in a curated exhibit alongside other digital art and hosted by partner organizations, most recently the Goethe-Institute in San Francisco. The process of browsing and following the works of these digital artists on NewHive is a rewarding experience in and of itself, though the real strength of the site is in creation.</p>
