<p>Video games are suspected of inciting violence in youth, but a subgenre of literature borrowing narrative structures from video games suggests that they can instead boost youth empowerment and activism. These ludic (game- or play-oriented) stories also suggest ways storytelling can evolve to engage youth in a world where technology is not an add-on, but an essential way of being. Through a close analysis of Salman Rushdie’s (2010) children’s novel <i>Luka and the Fire of Life</i>, this study demonstrates the potential of integrating technology and storytelling to develop young people’s problem solving skills and civic engagement.</p>
 
<p>The researcher demonstrates Rushdie’s own experience with videogames as a way to stay occupied during his exile and as a way to stay connected with his sons (Rushdie dedicated <i>Luka</i> to his youngest son, Milan). Through quotations from Rushdie, the researcher shows his explicit interest in experimenting with the structure of videogames for storytelling. The author points out that videogames are especially relevant for storytelling, because users create their own characters and narratives within the game. The reader might recognize tropes such as characters creating their own fictions, multi-level challenges, temporality of death, and allusions to a variety of world mythologies, cultures, and religions, not only from video games, but also from other novels in the literary gaming genre, such as works by Orson Scott Card and Suzanne Collins.</p>
 
<p>In <i>Luka and the Fire of Life</i>, the protagonist is a young boy who must enter into an imaginary world to successfully complete a series of quests in order to save his elderly father, the esteemed storyteller Rashid Khalifa, from dying. At stake is not only the life of his father, but the life of his characters. As Luka enters into this imaginary world, he persuades the characters that his father created them to be his allies—their existence depends on a storyteller to keep people interested in their adventures. In this way, the book becomes about the enduring power of stories, whether technologically or traditionally mediated.</p>
 
<p>Throughout the story, Luka’s mother argues that videogames are useless. Luka’s father counters this by pointing out the problem-solving skills he learns as well as his motivation to solve epic quests that will serve him in a variety of contexts. Indeed, those skills help Luka in his quest. He demonstrates an understanding of the temporality of death in the gaming context, as well as both local and global agency. The direct contradiction between the many lives Luka can experience in the game and the impending end of his father’s life that Luka aims to prevent reminds the reader that not all of game structure applies to "real life." However, as a structure for storytelling, video game playing does present opportunities for users to exercise agency, change systems, and imagine their own stories and communities. The author argues that these types of experiences can transfer to and inspire citizenship and social activism in the real world.</p>
