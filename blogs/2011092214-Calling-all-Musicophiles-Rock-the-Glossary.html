            Private!

Hi Team Edlab!  Jo & I are working on a custom glossary for the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6343">Rock & Roll Forever Foundation</a> professional development course we are developing.  I wanted to share some of the entries we have so far in the hopes that you can generate some ideas of your own for us to include... ok you musicophiles, this is your chance for your music trivia knowledge to be immortalized in this Moodle course! 

<b>Why include a specialized glossary?</b>
1) We want to help educators feel more comfortable speaking of these subjects in-class... nothing worse than making a music faux-pas in-front of your music-literate High School  students. 
2) The dictionary is often too broad & often not music-specific enough.
3) Wikipedia entries are often too long and involved, not efficient enough for time-crunched educators. 
4) Terms will be pulled from the existent lesson plans & materials. 

<b>Existent entries include:</b>
<b>Amplifier:</b> Used to increase the sound output of electronic devices, in this case, instruments.

<b>Band Aid:</b> A British & Irish Charity supergroup created to help support various causes. Adapted from the Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_Aid_(band)

<b>Charts:</b> In this case, adapted from the Webster's entry: "a weekly listing of the current best-selling pop records : she topped the charts for eight weeks." For example: http://www.billboard.com/charts/pop-songs#/charts/pop-songs

<b>Fragmentation:</b> From Webster's: "the process or state of breaking or being broken into small or separate parts : the fragmentation of society into a collection of interest groups."

<b>Generation Gap:</b> From Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_gap: The generational gap is and was a term popularized in Western countries during the 1960s referring to differences between people of a younger generation and their elders, especially between children and parents.[1]
Although some generational differences have existed throughout history, modern generational gaps have often been attributed to rapid cultural change in the postmodern period, particularly with respect to such matters as musical tastes, fashion, culture and politics. These changes are assumed to have been magnified by the unprecedented size of the young generation during the 1960s, which gave it the power and inclination to rebel against societal norms, as reflected in songs such as the 1965 hit "My Generation" by The Who and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" by Bob Dylan.

<b>Teenage Rebellion:</b> From Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_rebellion: As part of their development into young adults, humans must develop an identity independent from their parents or family and a capacity for independent decision-making. They may experiment with different roles, behaviours, and ideologies as part of their process of developing an identity. Teenage rebellion has been recognized within psychology as a set of behavioural traits that supersede class, culture, or race...

The phenomenon has been categorized by mainstream media and popular culture,[5] and is a very common subject in music and film. Some examples of films on the subject are The Wild One (1953), Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and The Breakfast Club (1985). The classic novel The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger has gained a reputation as the quintessential book on teenage rebellion.

<b>Transformation:</b>  From Webster's: "a thorough or dramatic change in form or appearance : its landscape has undergone a radical transformation."


Thank you for your help and we look forward to your additional entries!
