<p><i>The Long Island Science Center is a not for profit organization that encourages enthusiasm and excitement for learning and stimulates discovery and creativity. Interactive exhibits and demonstrations, and both in-house and on-site (school, library and community center) programs enhance the discovery process for visitors regardless of age or background. This "learning by doing" philosophy underpins the Science Center's programs and exhibits. As people freely explore the materials and activities available, they become empowered and motivated to learn more about science and life.</i> (via <a href="http://www.lisciencecenter.org/">Long Island Science Center</a> site)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lisciencecenter.org/">Long Island Science Center</a>
hosts a variety of experiences and activities to encourage creative exploration and hands-on learning in an exciting and educational environment. Located on the east end of Long Island, LISC's prime location on the Peconic River offers plenty of opportunities for studying natural ecosystems, biological processes, earth science, and astronomy in both traditional and innovative ways.</p>

<p><b>Natural Resources, Digital Data</b><br>
The organization offers summer camps, weekly themed programs, internships, and exhibits covering all major science topics. As this not-for-profit organization encourages learners to investigate and understand their world, most LISC lessons take place outside. Students are encouraged to examine natural resources firsthand, collecting water samples from the Peconic River for ecological assessment or using weather instruments to discover the science of meteorology. Students are introduced to a variety of scientific instruments, including microscopes, barometers, and telescopes. Over the course of each program, learners become increasingly familiar with both the natural world and the technology used to evaluate and explore it.</p>

<p><b>Science for Every Season</b><br>
Students looking to spice up their summer vacation can enroll in LISC's summer camp programs and learn about everything from earthquakes and zoology, to the human body and investigative forensics. These weeklong programs are sure to awaken participantsâ€™ inner explorers. Additionally, students in grades 10-12 have the opportunity to sign up for the Board of Youth Trustees. These young members are responsible for overseeing the museum's exhibits and curriculum and will learn the in's and out's of marketing, from social media promotion to business strategy and website management. LISC also offers internship opportunities for middle school and high school students looking to gain experience working with a team to develop and implement various museum attractions.</p>
