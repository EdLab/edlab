<p>The digital curriculum planning tool, <i>Curriculum Customization Service</i> was studied over a one year period via phone interviews with a group of 11 high school science teachers. During the interview sessions teachers discussed concepts they were focusing on with their students and then interviewers noted which segments of their conversations either tended more towards constructive (active/participatory) teaching methods or more towards directive (traditional learning) teaching methods.</p>

<p>Analyzing these discussions, researchers hoped to uncover how favoring one of these methods over the other influenced teacher thinking on content, teaching strategies and technology. They were also interested in exploring whether these thoughts would shift during the course of the year. It was also important for researchers to determine how easy or hard it might be for teachers to integrate a tool like this into their classroom environment at the spur-of-the-moment.</p>

<p>But first the researchers needed to explore the teachers’ past experiences with technology so they could better understand what professional development was needed beforehand. In the past, had the teachers used technology with their students for more hands-on (constructive) types of activities or had they used technology more as a means to display content (directive)? And finally, they were curious about how using the tool would function to level the playing field for diverse groups of learners.</p>

<p>Results in general indicated that implementing curriculum technology in the classroom promotes more constructive teaching methods. And teachers who were previously familiar with technology tools were more compelled to make use of the tools at the spur-of the moment. When it came to using the technology, in the beginning of the year, teachers discussed more directive (traditional) approaches, and towards the end of the year approaches became more constructive and active. The results suggest that during their schooling teachers should receive basic technology training so they will be familiar with the more common digital tasks, like file organization. New teachers will then be able to spend more time on tasks like differentiating their content, making sure each student is getting the most out of the experience. </p>

<p>Technology implementation in the classroom can influence the way that teachers teach. This study has shown that for technology in the classroom to yield the biggest benefits, moving away from more directive (traditional) approaches which include activities such as memorization to more constructive (active) learning approaches which include activities like discussion or group work appears promising.</p>
