<p>A recently launched "virtual town square" is blurring lines between education and the YouTube generation. Teacher Wall (TW) is an asynchronous video discussion site set up to inspire conversation and spark collaboration for educational change. This teacher sounding board, which is backed by Scholastic, Donorschoose.org, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, hosts videos, makes content easily shareable, and provides a community structure through discussion prompts. The site has fairly strict content guidelines, and while they may not be enforced regularly, it appears that some moderating exists. 
</p><p>
The site launched in September and embarked immediately on a rather ingenius yet curiously old school outreach campaign targeting local and national media outlets. TW offered financial grants to news stations to run interviews about the changing role of teachers. The high-quality interview footage became the seed videos for the site while television news programs across the country featured the new Teacher Wall site as a story. The site also offered a town hall meeting in real life at the Education Nation Summit this past fall and ran footage from the event on TW and through its YouTube channel. Leading with offline advertising is a curious choice for edtech, but TW seems committed to meeting teachers in 20th century spaces and gently drawing them into video production and sharing. 
</p><p>
<b>Pros:</b>
The most powerful component of Teacher Wall might be its ability to encourage video-reluctant educators to create and engage with digital video. The current backlash against the bland, faceless learning management system means teachers will soon need to be proficient in video communication and TW is a comfortable place to begin. The interface has a bento box vibe that offers a rich selection of compartmentalized voices and faces. The site has even inspired non-teachers and students to upload videos. That diverse user base (not to mention the 8,000 seed videos uploaded pre-launch) makes the site seem well used, a good and unusual credit for a destination so new. 
</p><p>
<b>Cons:</b>
The delicate unfolding actions of the interface do not always work in practice. Each tiny shift represents a page view, which will feel familiar to mobile aficionados, but may be unwieldy in the hands of the back button set. The site includes straightforward instructions for uploading videos, but more could be done to encourage content creation. Turning the educational tables with a video-based course led by student contributors to the site could potentially lower the barrier to entry. TW also has some consistency issues to iron out; searches donâ€™t always work well, the location-based search feature in particular often produces unexpected results.
</p><p>
<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
TW has the potential to move in unexpected directions. The site is fairly professional for now, but the power of instant sharing and the growth of social media networks could give us the educational equivalent of <i>Leave Britney Alone</i> in short order. The education sector might benefit from the uncontrollable weeping and dirty laundry airing that confessional videos seem to inspire, and the wide audience appeal of the site will make it an attractive destination for some serious sharing. This will undoubtedly be fun to watch, but should also open a conduit of communication between teacher need and technology solution. It also has the potential to get teachers and students interacting in online spaces through the same medium. Getting the right people talking to each other is the only way towards process change and TW seems poised to network. 
</p><p>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>
Teacher Wall is ready for its close-up.
