<p>There is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that human activity is causing global temperatures to rise. Humans must act quickly to create sustainable infrastructure and reduce emissions if we want to prevent catastrophe. Yet, most young people know very little about the causes or consequences of this important issue. Researchers at the University of British Columbia have developed a new augmented reality game designed to raise awareness about the urgency of climate action.</p>

<p>The game begins in a dystopian future; participantsâ€™ arrive at a virtual replica of their hometown which has been devastated by flooding, fires, drought, and other effects of climate change. There are food shortages, failing infrastructure, and the city is overpopulated due to an influx of climate refugees. The player is then invited to travel back in time (to our present moment) to try to prevent this terrible outcome. The activities that follow require students to alter their own choices and work to influence the actions and attitudes of those around them. </p>

<p>Overall, this game looks like a fun and engaging way to use technology to educate young people about the impacts of a warming planet. By placing the danger close to home, this game emphasizes that it's up to each of us to take steps to protect the world we love. How do you think climate change should be taught in schools? Do you think an augmented reality game like this one would be effective? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/32668/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:15 DJRojas11:</b> I like the idea of this game, but some of these images seem overly sensationalized. Many of the effects of climate change will be incremental and at first only noticeable to scientists. I think we need to make sure games like these are carefully rooted in sound science. Whether fair or not, the politicization of global warming means that the claims made about climate change need to hold up under intense scrutiny. I'd like to see the research behind the visuals in this game.</p>

<p><b>@00:31 saraehardman:</b> I think the power in this game is that it shows rather than tells students about climate change. If students experience different situations, even in a game, they will be more likely to understand the reality and impact of their choices. </p>
