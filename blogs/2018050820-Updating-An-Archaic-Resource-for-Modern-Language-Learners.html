<p><a href="https://letsenhance.io/">U-Dictionary</a> is a free English language learning app available in 38 languages that hosts a comprehensive collection of definitions, sample sentences, phrases, synonyms, antonyms, pronunciation guides, and daily practice opportunities, all available offline. It is ideal as a reference and practice tool for someone living or traveling in an English-speaking country and hoping to improve their language skills.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Unlike many dictionary apps that exist, U-Dictionary offers a wide variety of informational and practice options that are easy to navigate and cater to different learning styles, needs, and interests. While U-Dictionary provides the standard features of any dictionary, such as different definitions, pronunciation, and parts of speech, it also includes bilingual sample sentences, examples of the word or phrase used in recent news articles or radio programs, and non-standard, informal web definitions.</p> 

<p>The non-standard definitions are particularly helpful. For the word <i>please</i>, some of the alternate web definitions include "the magic word" and "can be used to mean ‘I don’t believe you’ or ‘yeah, right’" as a skeptical response, such as "girl, please." The inclusion of these more colloquially recognized meanings helps learners more fully understand the English language and all of its everyday uses.</p>

<p>In addition to definitions and sample sentences, U-Dictionary also includes games, quizzes, words of the day, daily conversation practice, articles to read and listen to, and a writing club. All of these features make this app more than a dictionary and a true tool for language learning.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Since this app wasn’t specifically marketed as an English dictionary app, I downloaded it thinking that I could use it to learn another language. Just some clarification within the app description would help those searching for dictionary or language learning apps better understand U-Dictionary’s purpose.</p>

<p>The fact that all words, phrases, and articles are very clearly read by a robot demonstrates room for improvement in the audio component. Though decently accurate, without a native speaker, users won’t be able to use this app to improve their listening or speaking abilities as effectively as their reading and writing abilities.</p>

<p>Also, some of the non-standard web definitions weren’t quite right. Perhaps this app was pulling from multiple cultural contexts, but some seemed like a bit of a stretch to me, or they were outdated or inappropriate.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Overall, U-Dictionary was a resource that exceeded my expectations. As a completely free app, it gave me access to so much more than the simple, standard dictionary definitions I expected. Though it could be improved with real voice recordings, it ultimately demonstrates the best of what a dictionary app can be.</p>
