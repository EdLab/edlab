            As the salaries of professional athlete continue to grow at a rapid rate, more and more teenagers are now attracted to the prospect of becoming professional athletes. Many feel this path is their best shot of becoming a millionaire or achieving fame and as such invest so much effort in trying to reach the promised land of professional sports.  As a result, they commit the majority of their time practicing the sport they want to pursue in hopes of one day turning pro. This is a behavior commonly practiced by individuals of third world countries since their very livelihood depends on whether or not they become professional players. Many teenagers in America however are now also seeing pro sports as the ticket to riches and stardom. The media receives most of the blame for this new phenomenon of depicting the lavish lifestyle of these professionals in recent reality shows and other outlets.
 
For aspiring pro athletes, going to college is the first step in achieving their long term goal of becoming a professional athlete. Although in some sports college isn't mandatory to become a pro (especially European soccer, and many Olympic sports), the majority of sports in America require an individual to play collegiate sports in order to play at the pro level. With this in mind, students begin gearing up for the competition that lays ahead for limited college athletic scholarships at an early age. Others begin literally from birth due because their parents put overwhelming pressure on them to become professional athletes. These parents are engraved in this mindset because of notable teenagers who have received multimillion-dollar contracts at a very young age: Lebron James, Freddy Adu, and Sidney Crosby, among others.
 
As an athlete for South Bronx United, I've witnessed firsthand some of these overzealous parents from opposing teams being hard on their kids and constantly criticizing their every action on the field. One such example was a league game in which a father from the opposing team constantly criticizing his son, who happened to be one of the best youth goalies I've ever witnessed, about his mistakes. Such scenes have also led to violence at youth sports games countrywide.
 
There also is no such thing as seasonal sports anymore due to the fact that aspiring pro athletes focus on one sport year round in hopes of obtaining a college scholarship. This in turn is leading to more sport specific injuries such as ankle problems for basketball players or arm trouble for baseball players. Electing to play through these injuries is also becoming a common practice since they feel they can't lose precious time in which they could obtain accolades and improve their game to increase their chances of obtaining a scholarship. This year round commitment can indeed be costly for those who are willing to spend accordingly in order to receive the best training possible. For instance, in youth soccer, parents shell out thousands of dollars for their kids to be able to play with so called “elite” travel teams. These travel teams, with the huge profits they are making, are then able to afford and attend national tournaments for college coaches. I personally know this because my soccer team has played such teams in league or tournaments. The truth though is that fewer that 3 percent of high school athletes will play any collegiate sport. Furthermore, in 2004, of the 6.9 million high school athletes, just 126,000 received scholarships to play in NCAA Divisions I, II, and III, that's a mere 1.8 percent. If they did receive a scholarship in the long run, one has to wonder whether the amount of time and money spent was really an investment due to the fact that the stats associated with becoming a professional are very unfavorable.  Only 1 in every 13,000 high school athletes will actually be paid to play professional sports so it's bewildering why teenagers are so intrigued about the prospect of turning pro when the odds are clearly stacked against them.
 
This is why I am for <a href="http://southbronxunited.org/">South Bronx United's</a> mission, which is to provide the youth of the Bronx and (to a larger extent New York City since some of the club members live in other boroughs) with a chance to go outdoors and compete while at the same time having fun and not stressing themselves about obtaining an athletic scholarship. They focus more on academics as a way to get a college scholarship than athletics. If someone is really naturally talented that is when they're athletic scholarship worthy. Teens should realize that only naturally talented people turn professional and that they should stick to academics for it's the best way to achieve success.
