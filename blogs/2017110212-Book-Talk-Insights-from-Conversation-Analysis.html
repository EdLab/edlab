A scholar in language and social interaction, Professor Waring introduced her subject with a story about her own first teachers in China. Her father had a gift for making complicated things simple. Her grandmother demonstrated that you don’t need to know something well to teach it effectively. These early teachers struck her as nothing less than superheroes.

While Professor Waring continues to consider good teaching to be the act of superheroes, her work reveals that you can <em>learn</em> to be a successful teacher. Using the discipline of Conversation Analysis to examine pedagogical interactions, Professor Waring’s studies coalesce into three larger themes: <strong>competence</strong>, <strong>contingency</strong>, and <strong>complexity</strong>. By applying these three principles in the classroom, good teaching becomes something that can be taught and replicated.

Based in the social sciences, Conversation Analysis<span class="s2"> affords a view of the entire world of pedagogy through observing the minute details of classroom interaction. A turn-by-turn analysis of participants’ conduct is produced from analyzing numerous recordings and transcriptions that convey not just what is said, but how. Professor Waring terms this analysis the “<em>why that now?</em>” Conversation Analysis employs a fascinating technical system that uses symbols to capture nuances of speech. These nuances include quickened pace; <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-30-at-12.51.26-PM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-28432"><img class="size-medium wp-image-28432 alignleft" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-30-at-12.51.26-PM-300x63.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-10-30 at 12.51.26 PM" width="300" height="63" /></a>measured silence; quiet speech; raised pitch; volume range; and sound stretch. A $ sign, </span><span class="s2">for example, is the symbol that indicates a “smiling voice.”</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Professor Waring walked the audience through a series of videotaped data extracts in which classroom teachers demonstrate the three guiding principles of pedagogical interaction, competence, contingency, and complexity. Professor Waring concludes that good teachers:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">Acknowledge student <strong>competence</strong>. They foster an inviting learning environment through speech and actions that highlight success, give voice to the less vocal, and take seriously the work of their students.</span></li>
	<li class="p1">Demonstrate what Professor Waring calls <strong>contingency</strong>. They preserve the integrity of the moment while being responsive to the voices of students.</li>
	<li class="p1">Address the <strong>complexity</strong> of competing classroom demands using multivocalic “teacher talk.” They manage “side talk,” move on without discouraging, and help their students stay focused.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The Language and Social Interaction Working Group (LANSI) stands by its empowering motto, “We articulate the expertise you own.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Professor Waring encourages those interested in learning more to follow LANSI on the web <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/lansi/"><span class="s3">http://www.tc.columbia.edu/lansi/</span></a></span><span class="s3">,</span><span class="s2"> Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LANSITeachersCollege/">https://www.facebook.com/LANSITeachersCollege/</a>, and Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lansi_tc">https://twitter.com/lansi_tc</a>, and to sign up for LANSI’s ListServ at <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/lansi/join-lansi/">http://www.tc.columbia.edu/lansi/join-lansi/</a>.</span></p>
