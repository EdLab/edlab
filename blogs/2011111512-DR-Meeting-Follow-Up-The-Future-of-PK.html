I think Janice Joo brought up some good points in our meeting today about the future of Pocket Knowledge and I wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions, particularly about our visualization exercise. I think that there are three major use case scenarios that we'll have to consider in thinking about the information PK users need. I'm going to think out loud to corral our ideas from the meeting and solicit your feedback:

1. The searching user: 
This user knows what they need and wants PK to deliver accurate and targeted search results. I think much of the in-house dissatisfaction with the current structure of PK is that it focuses too heavily on browsing users and doesn't make it easy to find specific items or groups of items. (much improved by Pranav's recent magic) 
-What kind of information is this person looking for? I tend to think, based on the data that's in PK right now, that it's not upload date or uploader. 
-What kind of visualizations and search refinements would help lead this user to their holy grail of information? 

2. The browsing user: 
This is the fun one, a user that is open to discovery. I think Gary, Pranav, & Demetri's group were on the right track with their node concept. Take a spin on this similar cool visualization from OCLC:

<a href="http://experimental.worldcat.org/IDNetwork/display.html?query=lccn-n84-2441" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/Untitled.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

-How can we engage browsing users? These are, I think, who we'd be targeting with our plans to monetize PK. Megha had a good idea of offering a snippet view of materials as Google does with Books. 
-What visual material is important to the browsing user? How can we represent the things that enable browse (like keywords & format) in a visual way? 

3. The uploader/dynamo: 
This person is uploading information to PK or is a master user of the system. How can we entice these users to work for us?
-Janet's group brought up the interesting idea of content “playlists” 
-Opening up keyword tagging might help flesh out our metadata
-How do we incentivize this kind of use? How can we better tap in to the TC pride factor?

If you had any thoughts about the future of PK you didn't get to drop during the meeting, comment while it's hot!
