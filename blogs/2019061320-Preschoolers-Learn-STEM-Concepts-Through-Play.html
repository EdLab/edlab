<p>For children not even old enough to attend a full day of school, many might think teaching science and technology concepts is far too advanced for their young minds to handle. Now, though, a new program in a New Orleans preschool is proving otherwise.</p> 

</p>Educate New Orleans is integrating science, technology, engineering, and math concepts into their students' learning by encouraging play and discovery targeted at growth in these subjects. After extensively training teachers on how best to incorporate and support student-centered STEM learning, the program provides classrooms with tools, from digital microscopes to slime-making kits, for hands-on learning activities. Students who have completed the program all meet or exceed national kindergarten readiness standards both academically and in social-emotional development, proving that their methods might merit widespread adoption.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@03:03 RuthS: </b>This demonstrates how children learn through play. Kids learn so much about how the world works by being curious and playing. Even if they don't know traditional STEM vocabulary, they understand the concepts.</p>

<p><b>@04.35 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> More than an endorsement of STEM in preschool, this video seems like an endorsement of play for young children. These kids' natural interest in building and playing with sand emphasizes that the scientific method and language are not the primary way we interact with the world. What seems important is that children explore and experience the force of gravity and the feel of solids and liquids in preschool; I am less convinced by the importance of them being able to name these concepts in STEM language.</p>
