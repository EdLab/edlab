<p>Teenagers have always had a transgressive streak, but mobile technology has given them a new way to misbehave. One deviant digital behavior that’s on the rise? Sexting: the sharing of sexually explicit content through web or mobile devices. While swapping provocative pics may seem innocuous, these items can be embarrassing and harmful if they are made public without permission. For this reason, sexting has been linked to bullying, harassment, and even suicide. Despite its growing prevalence, most high schools are silent about sexting and research on the topic is thin. Gaining a better understanding about what motivates teens to engage in this behavior could help practitioners to develop effective e-safety campaigns. </p>
 
<p>Researchers in a recent study investigated the social learning factors that best predict a teen’s likelihood to engage in sexting. A questionnaire administered to students at public high schools in Belgium asked students if they had engaged in various sexting behaviors and used two scales to measure their beliefs and attitudes toward sexting. The first focused on sexting with a romantic partner and asked participants to rank statements like <i>it’s ok to engage in sexting when you do it with someone you love</i>; the second focused on measuring attitudes toward sexting with a non-romantic partner, with questions about perceived approval of parents, friends, and peers. The survey also sought to measure the positive rewards associated with sexting, like its ability to strengthen a relationship or give a thrill.</p>
 
<p>Researchers found that adolescent motivations differed depending on the intended recipient. In the case of romantic partner sexting, those who believed their peers viewed the behavior favorably were more likely to engage in it themselves. However, in the case of sexting with a non-romantic partner, perceived peer approval had no effect on actual behavior. Instead, non-romantic sexting could be better predicted by non-social rewards like thrill and excitement. Neither group was strongly influenced by perceived parental disapproval. </p>
 
<p>This study provides a deeper understanding of the reasons behind sexting and has implications for parents, educators, and counselors. While sexting might seem like an aberrant behavior that simply needs to be prevented, this study suggests that teen sexting is just one aspect of a larger trend. As real life and digital identities become increasingly intertwined, it is natural that young people will use technology as a platform for personal experimentation. Yet many teens do not understand the risks involved when they engage in digital interactions. It is essential that they learn digital literacy skills, especially relating to online identity, privacy, ethics, and media appraisal. By providing a clearer understanding of what motivates and dissuades young people, studies like this one can guide adults in helping young learners make safer decisions on and offline. </p>
