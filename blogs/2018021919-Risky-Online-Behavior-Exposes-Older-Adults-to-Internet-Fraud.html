<p>Online risk is generally associated with young people. Indeed very little empirical data describes older adult behavior and risk-taking tendencies, which is concerning since the National Council on Aging has labeled the prevalence of financial scams targeting seniors, in particular internet fraud, the crime of the 21st century.<p>
 
<p>To address this information gap, a study of 326 adults (171 female, 155 male, between 18 and 79 years) used the Fuzzy Trace Theory (FTT) to investigate adult online risk-taking behavior and intention. The FTT examines how we use cognitive tools such as intuition, gist, and meaning when we reason. Researchers focused on two online activities known to be risky: the disclosure of personal information and befriending strangers. Participants were asked to describe how much time they spent using social networking sites, emailing, gaming, shopping, trying to meet new people (including dating sites), doing work (employment), visiting chatrooms, searching for information, and reading news. An online questionnaire measured participants’ future intention to give out personal information, make unknown friends, communicate with unknown people, or share personal information with people they knew only online.</p>

<p>The majority of participants, regardless of age, took some risks with personal information. Over one-third befriended strangers, developing relationships with an average of eight people they did not know offline. Although risk-taking behavior appeared to decline with age, individuals over 60 reported higher rates of risk-taking, both with information disclosure and friending behavior. The findings add to existing data showing use of verbatim reasoning (using quantitative, specific knowledge) among adults of all age groups is not only correlated with increased past risk-taking behavior, but also predictive of increased intention to take risks in the future.</p>
