          <p>
            <p>Memories are still fresh about Gary's presentation of his visions of EdLab to bridge educational research and EdTech innovations by expediting the long educational research-development-implementation cycle. I am very excited about this splendid blueprint and have been thinking about in what ways we can achieve this. I think it's a good time now to share some of my thoughts because we are making great progress in developing the the next version of Vialogues.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some of you know in the past two months we have been working on <b>Vialogues 2.0</b> - a thorough revamp of our beloved video-driven discussion app. This is not just a facelift. We actually adopted a totally different technology stack in order to support a brand new feature: <b>synchronous video discussions</b>. With this new feature, Vialogues will be able to support both traditional-style asynchronous discussions like in a course forum and instant-messaging-style discussions (i.e. new discussions will automatically appear without reloading the page). </p><p><br /></p><p>What does this mean anyway? It means that Vialogues now can be a complete solution for video-based learning. In the current Vialogues, teachers usually assign the video discussion as assignments before or after the class. This type of discussion is asynchronous which is suitable for more profound thinking but is less efficient in terms of communication and social interaction. In<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> the new Vialogues, in contrast, students and teachers can meet in a vialogue like in a virtual classroom and co-construct knowledge in real time. Afterwards they can extend the discussion beyond the class in the asynchronous mode. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Vialogues 2.0 will support new modes of video-based learning and opens up lots of new opportunities for us. Thanks to the thoughtful technical design of the new app, it will take a lot less effort than before to develop a different UI in order to scaffold various modes of video-based discussions</span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">(e.g. synchronous vs asynchronous, desktop vs mobile, focusing on video watching vs discussion, etc.)</span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">. I'm seriously thinking of instrumenting a UI similar to the following design where teachers can control the video playback of all students in the room. This design will best support synchronous learning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20170520100538-live_events_chat_jpg_97e52d825e30c7a278476a879d43aa45.jpeg" style="font-size: 0.875rem;" /><br /></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Of course there are tons of other possibilities just as great including live streaming chat, Choose Your Own Video Adventure, video slideshare, etc. (see my other blog for <a href="https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/blog/13155-Existing-and-Potential-Vialogues-Use-Cases-for-Education">ideas of Vialogues use cases</a>). We won't be able to research, design, develop, and test all those possibilities - not just for Vialogues but also other products and services like Rhizr, EdLab Supersearch, etc. Yet this is a long-term effort we should make in order to keep ourselves competitive as the leader of educational innovations. So I ask myself, how can we achieve more and contribute more with exiting resources?</span></p><p><br /></p><p>One idea I have is to reserve <b>a few one- or two-week sprints every year</b> for the D&amp;R teams to experiment new features and apps. We will push those new experiments to a beta page (e.g. <b>Vialogues Lab</b>) then invite our users to try and provide feedback. We will continue improving those experiments in iterative R&amp;D cycles based on user feedbacks. Some of the experiments will graduate and officially become part of the app. Besides, w<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">e can host </span><b style="font-size: 0.875rem;">EdLab Hackathons</b><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> where we invite students, educators, and developers Columbia- and NYC-wide to team together to develop those beta apps. This way we are opend up for novel ideas and talents.</span></p><p><br /></p><p>I'd also like to refresh our memories about the <a href="https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/projects/5068">LaunchPad</a> program. We are in a perfect position to accelerate educational innovations. I always believe this is how we can best support new educational initiatives. The sprints and EdLab Hackathon can well prepare us for the role of an incubator. <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Eventually, we will have first-hand experience and understanding of how we can become the game changer by helping accelerate the educational research and innovation cycles.</span></p>
