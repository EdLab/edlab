          <p>
            Recently I attended a meeting at my school (Aviation High School in Queens) about it's Fifth Year Program. The program is designed to offer seniors an option of staying an extra year in high school in order to obtain a second Federal Aviation Administration FAA mechanics license. This can either be an Airframe or Powerplant license depending on the one obtained during their senior year.

Obtaining a second license through the fifth year program wasn't always the case though as my workshop teacher, also an alumni, informed me. During his high school tenure, students had to obtain both licenses during their four years of high school. That approach was achieved by requiring all students to meet FAA requirements starting from their freshman year all the way through to their senior year. A significant portion of students though failed to meet the mandated requirements early on due to the shear workload of essentially a college level class. Often times this would carry over as they advanced grades thus leading to an unacceptable number of students graduating without both licenses. 

After spotting the issue, the FAA finally intervened and amended that freshman year for these students should act as a “buffer year” in which students are able to explore the type of work in they will be par taking in throughout their high school career. In doing so they would NOT be required to be FAA qualified (70 and above) during their freshman year. This also gives them the option to choose whether to continue enrollment in the school or transfer to a different school. Although some students choose to transfer, their slots are quickly filled by incoming students that transfer into the school thus balancing the student population.

The buffer year though would result in an additional year requirement if one wanted to obtain both licenses and that is why there is currently an optional fifth year program implemented by Aviation.

Students who are committed or at least have future plans about becoming an aircraft mechanic often pursue this option since many employers mandate that a mechanic has both licenses. A workshop teacher once put this into nice perspective by asking students whether they prefer to walk around with one sneaker or two sneakers on as an analogy on the importance of earning both licenses. 

Competition into this program is highly competitive due to the number of juniors that apply. It was blatantly evident as to how competitive this program was when almost the entire junior class attended the aforementioned seminar, which was not mandatory.

In order to be accepted into the program one must be qualified and have a descent grade in both their workshop and academic classes. Interviews and letters of recommendation are required as part of the application process. All of these should be accomplished towards the end of an applicant's junior year. Of the roughly 500 juniors that apply, 150 students are accepted into the program. Last year's class was said to be an extremely competitive class for they had to turn down students who were more than qualified in normal circumstances to be accepted into the program. The results are posted about a month before the last day of school, as it gives a chance for accepted students to either confirm or reject their admission. It also offers a chance for those students who were on the borderline to fill in the spots vacated by admitted students who declined the offer. It is critical for one to change their mind before the final roster is sent to school officials because one academic class is held (usually Social Studies) during their senior year which is then taken out during their super senior year due to school rules; so if a student decides not to pursue their second license after the final roster is sent to officials, they will be without a graduation required academic class and thus they won't be able to earn a high school diploma. Once the final roster is sent, there can be no revision and the roster stays final so a student has to be 100% sure on whether to pursue a second license.  

Advanced students that excel when it comes to aviation workshop are placed in the Annex at John F. Kennedy Airport to work on far more complex models including an actual Boeing 727 donated by Fed-Ex. Approximately only 23 students are accepted to that program and they often are the ones heavily recruited by the major airlines.

Anyone that completes the fifth year program and wishes to attend college afterwards is eligible to receive two years worth of credit (usually 60 credits) from institutions such as Vaughn College of Aeronautics and the Pennsylvania institute of Technology, among others. As for me, I wish to obtain only one license and continue obtaining a normal college education at a traditional four-year institution. I attended the seminar to avoid being closed-minded so that I can explore the opportunity the program offers.
