<p>One of the most frequent complaints from busy students is how procrastination affects their study schedules. With more online courses coming to the fore, the amount of direct student monitoring will likely decrease, which could potentially lead to even more dysfunctional study habits. Researchers from the Netherlands hoped to assess how one particular strategy on mobile learning analytics could highlight techniques to combat procrastination, and increase students’ levels of self-regulation. </p>
 
<p>The authors hypothesized that there is a positive correlation between logging study time and self-regulated learning. They also posited that providing scheduled mobile notifications would have a more positive impact on self-monitoring than randomized notifications. And finally, they predicted that providing notifications containing learning analytics—which they call "stop and think" beacons—would be more meaningful than generic study tips. </p>
 
<p>Out of the 89 students included in this study, the majority preferred scheduled notifications at 10 in the morning instead of 8 in the evening, which the authors interpreted to mean that they prefer planning ahead rather than looking back in their self-monitoring. They also noted that students preferred reviewing their learning analytics rather than generic tips, though the researchers were careful to add that this does not necessarily mean that the analytics themselves are more effective than study tips—they were only the preferred option. </p>
 
<p>This research can help students keep track of their own learning and progress by providing better tools for studying. Although the authors acknowledge that future studies should be conducted to test the longitudinal stability of these methods, they also claim that the results from this particular study have significant implications for how students "learn how to learn," specifically with respect to self-monitoring, a crucial metacognitive skill in education. </p>
