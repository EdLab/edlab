<p><i>"By engaging top corporate executives, investors, and entrepreneurs nationally, Defy catalyzes broad scale personal and economic opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals, and shatters perceptions of one of the most stigmatized and overlooked populations in America."</i> (<a href="http://defyventures.org/about-us/">About Defy Venture</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>From Prison to Office</b></p>

<p><a href="http://defyventures.org">Defy Ventures</a> is an organization dedicated to helping people with criminal histories create their own startups and businesses. Founded in 2010 by Catherine Hoke, Defy Ventures has served over 350 men and women across 11 states and has helped finance and incubate over 100 startups.</p>

<p>Students at Defy Ventures spend a year taking MBA-style courses that focus on business, entrepreneurship, and character development. Their students' last assignment is to propose a serious business model in a Shark Tank-style competition judged by top corporate executives and entrepreneurs. Judges can choose to invest in the companies, and so far over $350,000 has been awarded to the participants.</p>

<p><b>Community Help</b></p>
 
<p> A unique feature of Defy Ventures is that it provides its students with individual business mentoring given by executive volunteers from hedge funds, investment banks, equity firms, and Fortune 500 companies. As of today, over 3,000 executive volunteers have acted as mentors, business coaches, competition judges, and resume editors to the students at Defy Ventures.</p>
 
<p><b>Second Chances</b></p>

<p>Hoke created Defy Ventures as a replicable model that she hopes will be recreated in urban communities across America. With high incarceration rates and few post-prison job opportunities in America, Defy Ventures seeks to make an impact by teaching former inmates how to build their own companies and become their own boss. With a less than 3% recidivism rate for those who complete the program, Defy Ventures is creating change one second chance at a time.</p>
