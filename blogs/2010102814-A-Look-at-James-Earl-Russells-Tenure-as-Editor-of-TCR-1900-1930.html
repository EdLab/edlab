As part of our ongoing analysis of the history and evolution of TCR, I recently completed a careful thumb-through of the 32 volumes (185 issues) published under James Earl Russell's inaugural 30-year editorship.  

Given the wealth of curious tidbits unearthed by the analysis, I offer below some highlights in case of interest:

<u>Contributors:</u>
During this period, TCR articles were written largely by Teachers College faculty, including some big and familiar names.  Edward L. Thorndike, for instance, was one of the most frequent contributors (he once published 14 articles in a single issue!), and William H. Kilpatrick, George D. Strayer, David Snedden, Ruth Strang, and Adelaide Nutting also made regular appearances.  Russell and his son, William (who succeed him as Dean of the College), contributed frequently as well.  Interestingly, John Dewey only published three times during this period (in volumes 15, 17 and 30), although one additional issue dedicated a good amount of space to his influence in the field. 

On average, women authors constituted 1/3 of the contributors per volume, although they were more likely than their male counterparts to publish with co-authors, and their articles generally concerned “traditional” topics such as nursing, the household arts, women's education, nursery school, and elementary and secondary curricula.  Although many earlier issues focused on a single topic (and were even penned in entirety by a single author), Patty Smith Hill (of “Happy Birthday” fame) was the only female author to write an entire issue (her topic, in 1905, was the educational theories of Herbart and Froebel).

<u>Format:</u>
No editorials, commentaries, book reviews or original abstracts were published during this period.  However, TC-specific articles -- such as College news, notes and alumni reports — began to populate and even dominate issues beginning with volume 17 (1916), dramatically increasing the number of articles published per issue until volume 24 (1923).  However, these “TC Notes” returned in great number during the last two years of Russell's editorship.  In general, the issue count per volume held steady at 5 until 1925, when the number increased to 8 or even 10 issues per volume.  

<u>Content:</u>
A number of topics were well-covered during this period, including:

<i>Measurement & Evaluation</i> (probably no surprise, given Thorndike's large number of articles and the climate of the times).  Sub-topics included everything from IQ testing and academic assessment to handwriting and physiological analysis (volume 2 even included a reprint of a piece by phrenologist, Francis Galton).

<i>Citizenship & Democracy</i>.  The advent of WWI ushered in a stream of articles focusing on the responsibility of schools to develop conscientious and patriotic citizens.  Both Teachers College and TCR were institutionally aligned with governmental efforts in these domains — including a partnership with the U.S. Food Administration that resulted in a number of articles about rationing and the frugal conservation of meat products.

<i>The “Practical” Arts</i>.  Paralleling departmental structures at the time, many articles related to the fine arts, household arts, industrial arts, music education, nursing education, health education, physical education and practical sciences were published under this umbrella.

<i>Horace Mann Elementary & Laboratory Schools</i>.  Updates about and investigations of TC partner schools were likewise regularly featured.

<i>Other Frequent Topics</i>.  Other common article topics included elementary and secondary school curricula, the Project Method, reading & spelling, teacher training, and school administration/finance.

<u>Further Questions:</u>
Despite all of these interesting findings, many questions still remain.  Some that feel most pressing include:

1)  What, if anything, triggered TCR's format changes?

2)  What more can we learn about the audience of the journal?  (For instance, was it largely read beyond TC?  How did the readership change over time?)

3) What was the submission / editorial process like during this time?  (ie, Were articles submitted or solicited?  What kind of review process, if any, did they undergo?)
