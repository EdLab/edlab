          <p>
            Prior to the start of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06Soccer-t.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1">interesting article about how a soccer star is made appeared in the NY Times magazine</a>. The article is mainly devoted to the contrast in style, philosophy and approach between youth teams and academies in Europe (and to a larger extent the rest of the world) and the United States and why there seems to be such a large gulf in class and talent despite America having one of the largest populations in the world. The author spent part of his research at <i>De Toekomst</i> (The Future), the famed youth academy of my beloved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax">Ajax Amsterdam</a>, one of the most recognized soccer teams in the world. Ajax is renowned for creating soccer superstars and as the creators of the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Football">Total Football.</a>

The author notes the primary difference between youth teams in America and Europe is that most youth teams and coaches in the former devote a lot of time to playing games while the latter spend a large amount of time teaching technique and working on physical conditioning. The result is a system in which the best players in the European academies are ready to go pro by their 16th birthday while most American players don't go pro until after four years of playing collegiate soccer.  Furthermore, most travel youth soccer teams in the US charge players through the roof to play, a system that leaves those players good enough to play but cant afford the fees. This system leaves the US Men's National Team programs with a small pool to choose from since they tend to look at only players who play travel soccer.  Many pundits point to this philosophy and system as one of the primary reasons the US Men's National Team has yet to make any meaningful impact at major tournaments such as the World Cup and even at global youth tournaments such as the U17 and U20 world championships. <p>

During my early days as a youth soccer coach, I was not immune from the US philosophy of playing more and practicing less. I coached about two games a week while holding practice maybe once or twice for a few hours during that time span.  I am slowly gravitating towards the European model with more practice time and less games (much to the frustration of my players) since my players seldom learn or acquire new skills or techniques during games. With soccer at all levels becoming more tactical, more practice is certainly required as young players have to be adept at various positions and gain a greater tactical awareness on the field. <p>

I personally believe a change in philosophy and approach to the beautiful game in the US will reap great benefits moving forward as soccer continues to grow as a sport in the US.
