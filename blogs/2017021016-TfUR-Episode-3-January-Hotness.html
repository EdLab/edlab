A new year means a new semester, and that’s usually when things get popping on Vialogues. This month was no different, seeing record high engagement and activity levels across the site. As always, if you saw something cool on Vialogues recently, say something! 

Here we go for January...

<b>QUICK STATS</b>

<b>SUPERLATIVES</b>
<b>Best Discussion</b>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/33881/" target="_blank">Child Development Theorists</a>
Students here had a focused discussion on child learning theories and teaching styles, drawing examples from the video and telling anecdotes from their own experiences. There was even some cross talk and side conversations!

<b>Best Lowkey Feedback</b>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/33968/" target="_blank">Multimedia Theory</a>
Here, students discuss the affect graphics, videos, and pictures have on learning. It's interesting to note that in a discussion on multimedia, students offhandedly shared thoughts on the video-driven learning environment in which they were participating. 

<b>Best Show of Work</b>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/34002/" target="_blank">Springs in series and parallel</a>
In this AP-level Physics video, students take to the comments to answer one question from their teacher. Straightforward? Yes. Simple? Hardly. 

<b>Most Redundant</b>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/34105/" target="_blank">Acids and Bases: Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs</a>
While there isn't much going on by way of discussion here, the moderator shows the promise of Vialogues as a comprehension tool, providing clear directions and some feedback throughout. Maybe not the most flattering award, but his efforts haven't gone unnoticed. 

<b>Best Prompts</b>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/34448/" target="_blank">[Primary] Lesson Experience - What is Imagery?</a>
It's too early to tell what kind of discussion this vialogue will generate, but the abundance of thoughtful questions from the moderator offers ample opportunities for participation. 

<b>The Role Model Award</b>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/34383/" target="_blank">Performance Assessment Interview</a>
A fantastic use of the underused Q&A feature, this is the paragon of comprehension assessments.

<b>GRAIN-OF-SALT TAKEAWAYS</b>
<ul>
<li>Even in vialogues with great interactions, there’s a limit to how deep the conversation can get. Do users feel restricted by the inability to have threaded conversations? Are we inhibiting community engagement? Or, do side conversations eventually distract? How many levels deep is  the ideal (or maximum)?
<li>An insight from the “Multimedia Theory” vialogue referenced above: in talking about cognitive theory, a user complains that she can’t type and pay attention to what the speaker is saying at the same time. Pausing while typing would make it easier, she surmises. 
<li>I’m not sure what benefit a student gets out of answering the same question 10 others have already gotten to, especially when they can see all of the answers. I’m also not sure what it does for the moderator, except let them know who participated. I don’t have any ideas for this one, just an observation.  
<li>For mods that are testing comprehension like the “Interview” vialogue above, it might be helpful if the mod was able to see exactly who answered what and, since there is a right answer for each, to know more metrics, like the breakdown of right vs wrong per item (so mods can see which q is giving students the most trouble). Similarly, it might be helpful for students to know which answers they got right/wrong, and what the correct answer is. Although I guess that would turn it more into a “test” feature than a Q&A…
