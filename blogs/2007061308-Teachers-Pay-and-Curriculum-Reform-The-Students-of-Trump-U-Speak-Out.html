This is so true! I even complained about it 10 years ago because without a college education I was making 12 to 15 dollars per hour and time and a half or double time in the '70s. That's what people are making today (30 years later). I scoff at today's so called good wage. 

Now that I have a couple college degrees and a teaching credential, I feel blessed to earn a better than decent salary. However, I know people (including some teachers) who think that $35,000 per year is a good wage for teachers ( in private and chartered schools). I scoff at that too. I can see fear behind their eyes when I challenge employers who pay teachers so little. The fear is because these folks think they cannot find better, (or they are ignorant of what teachers elswhere get paid). I looked for better and gave notice within the month of hire or just turned the jobs down in disgust. It actually angers me that there are employers who exploit these educated/credentialed workers. They do work harder; the employer micro manages their teaching techniques to the point that teachers become more of a paper mill to make the companies money verses being able to spend quality time with the students. It's a shame.

We earn less than our parents because the educational curriculum was decided by local school districts and the children of minorities where systematically steer into vocational education instead of academics. I know because I was one of those students. During the 1960's, 1970's 1980's this was the status quo in inner cities. Today, thank God for President Bush's "No Child Left Behind" children must meet the a national standard. To blame for the pass are the selfish, racially motivated, greedy and foolish individual that believe in subjugating other groups of people based on race. Those ignorants never envisioned a world market and their limited vision on the future is the reason so many of us must do without. These idiots that pushed for vocational curriculum instead of academics during the above mentioned years really did an injustice to America. However, I firmly belief that everything reverts to the way it should have been, regardless of the thief working in the dark places.

For instance, although I was unable to attend to proper education, and despite many years of diverse work experience am unable to move to higher title work, because of the lack of degree, I ensured my child would not suffer the same. At 21 years old, (2006) my daughter Helen gained a Mechanical Engineering Degree from one of the top Engineering Schools in the North East, Stevens Institute of Technology. Hurra!

The bottom line is that the people working against innocent children in their education are mean spirited people that have no place in the educational system. Any adult advocating that some children just do not have the capacity or genetics for certain work or knowledge should be put down by my story. Any elected official advocating the same should be voted out of office. Every (Black, White, Yellow and Red) child has the potential to excel unless there is an injury to the brain.
