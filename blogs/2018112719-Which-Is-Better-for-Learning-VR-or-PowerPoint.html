<p>A recent study pitted an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience against a PowerPoint slideshow to see which prepared students better for a test, and which they enjoyed more. Participants included 55 college students randomly divided into an immersive VR group and a self-directed PowerPoint group. In both, students learned about the human body. The VR experience was a 12-minute game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/451980/The_Body_VR_Journey_Inside_a_Cell/"><i>The Body VR: A Journey Inside a Cell</i></a>, where players toured the bloodstream and individual cells. The PowerPoint slideshow included the transcribed script and still images from the VR game, and students took on average eight minutes to complete it.</p>
 
<p>Afterwards, students took a test on the lesson content and answered a questionnaire about how much they enjoyed the experience. Students in the PowerPoint group scored much higher on the test, likely because they could focus more on the information and less on the experience. That said, students in the immersive VR group reported much higher levels of enjoyment, interest, and motivation, which are also important factors for long-term learning.</p>
 
<p>Based on these results, the researchers devised a second experiment to see whether they could apply different pedagogical methods to make the same VR game a more successful learning experience. They again recruited college students to participate and split them into two groups. One group played the VR game without stopping, just as in the first experiment. The second group played the same VR game, but split into 6 segments. After each segment, the group removed their headset and wrote a short summary of the segment.</p>
 
<p>These participants took the same test and questionnaire after the lesson. Students in the segmented VR group scored much higher than the regular VR group. In fact, their scores were basically the same as the PowerPoint group. Yet in addition, students in the segmented VR group reported the same levels of enjoyment, interest, and motivation as the regular VR group.</p>
 
<p>This shows that while VR experiences might not provide the best learning environments by themselves, specific methods could improve their pedagogical potential. As important as high test scores are, it’s also important for students to be interested in a subject to retain long-term motivation. Studies like this demonstrate one possible way to marry the two by using emerging tech in a thoughtful, supportive way.</p>
