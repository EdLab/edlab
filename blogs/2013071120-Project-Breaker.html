<i>Breaker’s mission is to drive social innovation and alternative learning by mobilizing interdisciplinary teams of young creative collaborators to help solve the world’s most pressing problems. We connect our young people with global thought leaders and industry experts to answer challenges like literacy, urban agriculture, and technology for civic engagement. We facilitate a creative problem-solving design process and teach the entrepreneurial skills necessary to transform ideas into businesses.</i> (<a href="http://www.projectbreaker.org/about/">Project Breaker</a>)</p>


<p>
<b>Breaking GOOD</b><br>
In an innovative play on the classic "mentorship" or apprenticeship model, <a href="http://www.projectbreaker.org/about/">Project Breaker (Breaker)</a>, pairs teams of 18-24 year-olds throughout the country with "visionaries" who task them with solving a unique and pressing "global challenge" and serve as guides throughout the design process.  These collaborative design challenges are free for participants (sponsored financially by partner companies), facilitated by <a href="http://www.projectbreaker.org/leads/">Breaker’s team leads</a> and solved over the course of three months.  Challenges have run the gamut from re-imagining the "Future of the Book" to the most recent, "Future of Stuff."  Future of Stuff is being planned in partnership with, The <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/">Institute of Design (d.School) at Stanford</a>.  This challenge will involve 14 days of workshops across three cities, New York, Detroit and San Francisco and employ an innovative <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/919258/design-thinking-what">"design thinking"</a> grounded approach to collaborative problem-solving.  Julliette LaMontagne the Founder and Director of Breaker explains the valuable learning that is facilitated by this process and the program on the <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/02/03/breakthrough-solutions-fellows-friday-with-juliette-laMontagne/">TED blog</a>, "The team approaches problem-solving using design processes they learn from <a href="http://www.ideo.com/ ">IDEO</a>, <a href="http://www.fuseproject.com/">fuseproject</a>, <a href="http://www.frogdesign.com/">Frog</a> and more; they’re exposed to start-up perspectives by working inside innovation ecosystems like <a href="http://corp.aol.com/products-services/aol-ventures">AOL Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.qlabs.com/">QLabs</a>."  
<p>
Further increasing opportunities for participation, interested young people and educators can "ride along" and engage with each challenge online as well.  LaMontagne explains to NLT, "We run two parallel learning experiences for teachers and Breakers that intersect at critical points. So teachers have a chance to both engage in the design process, observe students applying it in the context of a challenge, and reflect on the implications."
<p>
<b>Breaking-the-mold</b><br>
What is perhaps the most compelling aspect of the Breaker experience is that unlike <a href="http://challengepost.com/">ChallengePost</a>, in which "challenges" are most often completed by individuals who are then awarded cash prizes, Breaker, however, creates experiences that generate unique learning opportunities for all involved and can help young people to prepare for and replace traditional higher education.  LaMontagne explains on the TED Blog, "What we’re hearing from participants is that Breaker is seen as an alternative-learning pathway for those who’ve chosen not to go to college after high school, or as an experiential supplement to college coursework, or as a transitional opportunity for early career professionals. We see all three types applying to our program."  Given the rising cost of college and ever-increasing student loan debt paired with the growing <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/business/education-internships-needed-to-fill-skills-gap_2013-05-15.html">"skills gap"</a> contributing to steady unemployment, alternative pathways to career readiness, like Breaker, will only increase in relevance and importance.  LaMontagne explains to NLT, "If we continue to build credibility with employers who continue to validate that our skills and competencies align with their needs, if our training leads to employment or self-employment – then it can’t NOT be a viable alternative."
<p>
<b>Breaking-through</b><br>
Breaker takes learners from "design thinking" ideation sessions to pitch session, and at the conclusion of each cohort participants pitch the proposed "product/solution" to both existing mentors and a panel of outside VCs.  As LaMontagne explains, "We set the bar high, but we also bring in the best of the best to support the process, offering the team access to the people and companies driving innovation in the space."  Breaker is able to provide the elements most often missing from a traditional higher ed degree, real world experience and skills that will apply less in a classroom and more often as a part of an organization creating innovative products and services.  Montagne explains this added value to NLT, "And by introducing and training young people in this emergent space, we’re providing a pipeline of talent to further support the growth of the industry, even if their product doesn’t succeed in launching." As a result, Breaker is helping to BREAK-through the previous model of educating "workers" and instead helping to create innovators.

<b>Exclusive NLT interview with Project Breaker founder, Juliette LaMontagne</b>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Is the program completely free for participants?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Yes.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What inspired the "Ride-along-Program" for educators?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Professional development experiences for teachers tend to be just as insulated from the outside world as the typical classroom. The physical spaces we inhabit profoundly influence the kind of work that gets accomplished. The ride along model provides an introduction to the rich learning ecosystems that exist beyond the school walls, and to have teachers consider the ways they can better leverage the assets of the larger community in meeting their learning objectives. 
We wanted to give the teachers the opportunity to learn with and from the students. We run two parallel learning experiences for teachers and Breakers that intersect at critical points. So teachers have a chance to both engage in the design process, observe students applying it in the context of a challenge, and reflect on the implications.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How many learners participate remotely?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> In June we launch our first hybrid iteration. We have a 100 person cap on the course.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What has your primary demographic been?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Wide range. From high school seniors, to high school drop outs, to gap year kids, to college students looking for opportunities to apply their learning to real world challenges, to early career professionals. The largest group is currently in college.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you choose corporate sponsors/participating companies?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The partners support the curriculum with their respective expertise: the challenge area experts (changes with each new project), designers inform the research process, synthesis, ideation, and prototyping. Then businesses and startup entrepreneurs inform the testing, business modeling, and funding pitches.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you choose the projects you focus on?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> We choose projects in emerging industries where we feel we can create value and have social impact through generating product and service designs. And by introducing and training young people in this emergent space, we’re providing a pipeline of talent to further support the growth of the industry – even if their product doesn’t succeed in launching.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How many participants have gotten jobs or internships as a result of participation?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> 45 students have gone through Breaker in 18 months.
3 directly got jobs/intern with our partners. 2 are bootstrapping a business. I sometime receive emails from Breakers talking about how they highlighted their work with Breaker to land their current job.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Do you feel that the program is a viable alternative to traditional higher ed pathways?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>The employment crisis coupled with student loan debt make Higher ed’s return on investment increasingly dubious. The growth of low-cost, short term applied learning programs like Breaker and others are inevitable from a market perspective. If we continue to build credibility with employers who continue to validate that our skills and competencies align with their needs, if our training leads to employment or self-employment – then it can’t NOT be a viable alternative.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Is Breaker the apprenticeship of the future?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Yes. With the caveat that apprenticeship as we think of it is growing and evolving.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What is the most satisfying aspect of working with Breaker for you personally?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> 1. Being a learner in the rapidly shifting education landscape. 2. Providing relevant learning experiences for kids who’ve been poorly served by the traditional model of secondary and postsecondary schooling.
