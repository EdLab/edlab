Curt Allen is perhaps best known for his prior role as the President and CEO of leading genealogy site, Ancestry.com.  The social platform is now a Top-10 web property, has become a publicly traded company, raised $100M in funding and hosts millions of users worldwide.  Before coming-on-board at Ancestry.com, Allen was the co-founder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio_Corporation">Folio Corporation</a>, a leading electronic publishing software company responsible for helping hundreds of commercial publishers transition from print to digital.  However, it is his decade-plus post as the President and CEO of <a href="http://agilix.com/">Agilix Labs</a>, and leader of the team behind award-winning and widely used LMS, <a href="http://agilix.com/products/brain-honey/">BrainHoney</a> (also, their student-centric Personalized Learning App, <a href="http://agilix.com/products/buzz/">Buzz</a>), that will allow Allen to directly impact another perhaps more pressing universal human need, learning.  Allen cites the influence of watching his five children grow and learn and his desire to "leverage technology to improve the quality of life for people around the world" as guiding principles in the development of past, present and future Agilix learning products.  Let’s hope that Allen is as successful in both connecting families AND helping individuals to more effectively learn.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I had several formative experiences in school that set me on a path to utilize technology to help people learn more effectively.  One such experience occurred as I was listening to a university physics lecture with 250 other students.  The guy next to me started to chuckle so I leaned over to ask him what was so funny.  He told me he had taken the course twenty years earlier and was sitting in as a refresher before he taught it the next semester.  He said the course notes matched word-for-word from twenty years before.  I laughed along with him, but over time became increasingly disturbed by the implications of that revelation.  The more I reflected on the state-of-the-practice of our educational system (textbooks, lectures, lock-step progress, high-stakes summative assessments, grading on the curve, letter grade as credential, programmed failure, etc.), the more I came to believe that it was time for the entire educational system to be disrupted.  Since then, the members of my team and I have spent a large portion of our time and energy trying to contribute in some small way to the solution to this global challenge.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> Clayton Christensen is one of our Strategic Advisors.  We have embraced his Theory of Disruptive Innovation and the potential it has to affect education in a positive way. Everything we have done over the past 25 years seems to be converging now to support the opportunity to help kids learn.  At VidComp, we produced tools for delivering high-quality multimedia learning experiences on laserdiscs and CD ROMs.  At Folio. we worked with more than 800 commercial publishers to help them move their content from print to digital on the web.  At Ancestry.com, we helped millions of people search and collaborate through a viral and sticky social network around billions of records and petabytes of data for family history research and sharing.  At Agilix, we hope to bring together these disciplines and technologies -- and combine them with the power of mobile devices connected through broadband social networks -- to help our partners create transformative educational experiences.  On a personal level, the thing that drives our work is the experience of watching students who had lost hope in their future, regain it and start to believe again that they can realize their dreams.  It is a tremendous motivator!

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Our vision is to enable each learner to realize the full potential of their God-given talents and gifts.  We are doing this for the children – our own children and all others.  As humans, we enter this world as natural learning machines with a voracious appetite for knowledge.  Children exhibit that desire for learning through play and interaction with others.  However, at some point in the industrial-age institutional model that persists to this day, many children lose that zeal for learning and come to feel that school is an unpleasant necessity. Many lose hope and drop out because they aren’t challenged, don’t have the prerequisite knowledge they need to succeed, or don’t see any relevance to their lives.  There is a better way.

Our current work is focused on helping our partners deliver compelling learning solutions better, faster and cheaper than they can by themselves.  Much of the financial investment in education technology has been wasted on "reinventing the wheel" or delivering "text in a browser" as the status quo in content delivery.  By providing a scalable ‘eXtensible Learning Infrastructure’ (xLi) that delivers approximately 80% of the web services required by most learning applications, we can focus with our partners on the 20% of their solutions that make a unique and significant difference for students.  Rather than the monolithic, vertically integrated learning systems of the past, we see composite learning solutions provided by an ecosystem of partners that come together to address specific learning needs.  Ultimately, we hope to collaborate with others to provide lifelong personalized learning experiences for every learner that enable each individual to achieve his or her full potential as a contributing member of society.

<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> We founded Agilix twelve years ago based in part upon our belief that three technology megatrends (mobile devices, wireless networks and cloud computing) had the potential to transform education as we know it.  We are now faced with the perfect storm of: economic crisis, global competitiveness and technology innovation.  Providentially, the status quo in education is no longer an option.  We need to educate the rising generation in a fundamentally different way if we are going to successfully confront the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We have partnered with some of the leading educational content and assessment companies to help them deliver personalized learning at scale.  One of our innovative partners is the Education Achievement Authority (EAA) of Michigan, headed by Dr. John Covington and Dr. Mary Esselman and supported by The School Improvement Network.  They are working to turn around 15 of the lowest performing schools in Detroit serving more than 11,000 students.  Their model is based upon five key tenets: (1) Grouping:  students are grouped by readiness, not age,  (2) Mastery: students master content at their own pace and choose their own path, (3) Self Assessment: measure and communicate self-assessment of interest, understanding and effort, (4) Community: build community and peer help network, (5) Productivity: measure productivity and progress.  We developed a Personalized Learning Application called "Buzz" to support this project, which will now be delivered by the School Improvement Network to other interested School Districts as a solution called "GAGE."
