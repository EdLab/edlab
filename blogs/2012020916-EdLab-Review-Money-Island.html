<b>Description</b> <a href="https://yacenter.moneyisland.com/">Money Island</a> is an interactive web-based games that focuses on teaching users about money management. Users will learn about financial responsibility by completing quests in this virtual world, and there are additional games, videos and contests that continue the money managing education. Areas of study include saving and spending, earning and investing, using credit wisely and more.

<b>Pros:</b> Parents and teachers can also view the lesson plans that are on the site, which are about financial responsibility. An administrator tool is also available for parents and teachers to view their childrens and students' progress in the game and also what they have learned.The game itself is very enable that has many mini-games, and videos about money management. The demo included a video about a chef making a pie that looks like a pie chart on how much to spend, save, invest, and share, showing how the game tries to explain a serious topic through fun animation. There are also quizzes every once in a while, which is a great way to test a users knowledge after a mini-game or a video.

<b>Cons:</b> Users might get a bit lost in the game if they do not pay special attention to the hint button. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> Money Island is a nice web-game that combines several types of media to teach users about financial responsibilities. Money Island has some simulations embedded: one example is when a user has to create a bank account, and choose a pin number to use for accessing their account. Although the level of difficulty isn't really automatically adjusted to each user's need, there is an option before each mini-game to choose a level of difficulty.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> Money Island could be added to a the list of recommended games that are available on the <a href="http://understandingfiscalresponsibility.org/topic/resources/games-and-interactive-media">Understanding Fiscal Responsibility</a> website. It is a great resource to teach younger students about fiscal responsibility.
