<p>Jessica Lindl is the Global Head of Education at <a href="https://unity3d.com">Unity Technologies</a> with a vision of democratizing creativity for all learners. She has spent over 15 years overseeing companies and teams that design, develop, and distribute deeply impactful learning games to the global education market. In her work at both for-profit and nonprofit organizations like Unity Technologies, Common Sense Media, GlassLab, Scientific Learning, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, she has worked to improve learning outcomes and earning potential for all learners worldwide by blending effectiveness with ground-breaking engagement.</p>

<p><b>How has your education and previous professional experience shaped your current work as global head of education for Unity?</b><br>
I’ve spent my entire career in education trying to focus on leveling the playing field for all learners, independent of the community they are born into. I was inspired to join Unity by CEO John Riccitiello’s vision to enable everyone to become a creator. The vision that anyone can have the tools to create and share that skill was really exciting for me.</p>
 
<p>There are a couple key principles that I’ve brought to the role. Number one is the critical importance of diversity (diversity of learning styles, learning approaches, of your own socioeconomic or racial and ethnic identity) and having that be a key part in any education approach that we create. As we all know, the more diverse the body of creators, the greater the outcomes of experiences for all of us to partake in.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you believe that games, game development, and creative content making can impact social change?</b><br>
A lot of my work in games, stemming from my work at <a href="https://www.glasslabgames.org">GlassLab</a>, focused on the data and analytics that comes from game play, so I think that there’s something really powerful about continuous improvement. In essence, I think that’s mainly what social change is. If you can draw this meta-parallel of us as a human race seeing the impact and the evidence of our behavior and our decisions, oftentimes you’ll see a meandering journey of trying to take feedback and continuously improve. In a lot of ways, what I’ve learned about games is very much that approach and that understanding of how we are taking the evidence that we gather from gameplay and impact in general and improving the game, and then looking at that from the perspective of life. You understand things that are natural in games around failing, and failing forward, which we hear a lot but is hard for everyone to do naturally. The failure aspect of gaming, and the data and feedback from that failure to continuously improve, are things that in a lot of ways games make innate for us. It’s a learned skill that will hopefully allow future generations to continuously improve and create better social impact than prior generations.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Unity impacts education?</b><br>
My real hope, and where I see the key lever for change, is inspiring educators. My goal has always been to give educators tools that make their lives easier and better engage them and consequently the learners in their classroom. I see educators as the key leverage point for us in enabling everyone to become a creator. Right now, one of the opportunities that we have pertains to the fact that most of these educators haven’t been raised with computational understanding. It’s one of the biggest challenges that we have right now. How do we get youth prepared for the digital revolution, let alone the fourth industrial revolution that we’re heading into, with the group of educators like myself who never grew up with a strong foundation of computational understanding as a skillset that we were taught? Giving educators those skills is first. Secondly, we want to give them the tools to be able to enable learners to create, which they may also not have learned in their own personal or professional lives. The third point pertains to that old adage of moving from sage on the stage to guide on the side, which is really a key element around how we’re supporting educators in their own personal evolution of what their profession is and how they see their contributing value to the classroom.</p>
 
<p><b>What are the main challenges to implementing VR/AR in classrooms?</b><br>
First and foremost hardware. And then hardware and hardware and hardware. We’re still in a world where we don’t even have Chromebooks for every kid in a classroom. The first challenge is getting the hardware down to a place where it’s really affordable and easy to implement in a classroom. I think the second challenge is getting teaching practices to adapt to it. Some of the greatest implementations [of VR] I’ve seen involve one student to one device with a screen and the entire class following along and getting really deeply engaged by what that one student is doing. You can see the teaching practice changing. It doesn’t need to be <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline/dp/0307887448">Ready Player One</a></i> where we’re all in virtual reality in order to see the benefit of VR and AR.</p>
 
</p><b>What do the best pieces of educational content for AR/VR have in common?</b><br>
I think it’s leading with curiosity. It’s starting with what the learner is curious about and pulling the learner through based on their curiosity and their interest. That’s one key part of the motivation. The second is being able to create an experience that would otherwise be very difficult to replicate, either from a cost perspective or an access perspective. One of my favorite experiences in VR is <a href="http://wevr.com/project/theblu-encounter">theBlu: Encounter</a> where you’re actually under the ocean thousands of feet down, not having to get into all the scuba gear. Things that are hard to access provide another common theme of deep motivation for the learner. I think the third is empathy, things that can really tie to our emotions, which is somewhat difficult in traditional classroom education. So another key element of what great education companies are doing is tying the emotion into the experience of learning.</p>

</p><b>What is next on the horizon for the education program at Unity?</b><br>
A lot. Period. We are just so early stage. All we have right now in the market is a beginner game development courseware and a beginner game development certification. Next we will be launching student ambassador programs, educator ambassador programs, and a more diverse array of courseware and curricula that is aligned to different professions like architecture and automotive. Also, we want to start with STEAM skills for middle and high school students, beginning with that curiosity where they already want to tinker. One of the prototypes that we’re most excited about right now is learning how to create virtual reality in a virtual reality experience. This addresses the challenge of learning how to use an engine as powerful as Unity without computer programming skills. This type of an application would allow you to bypass needing to have those skills initially as you create your first VR experience. The first thing we hear from kids after they put on the headset is, "How do I go make my own?" Giving them that next opportunity is really exciting.</p>
 
<p>The broad direction that we’re heading in is serving all of these diverse learners we have and their diverse learning paths and figuring out how to quickly fill those out at scale. Also, we are learning how to do that through partnerships because that’s the only way we can move quickly to fulfill the demand that we have.</p>
