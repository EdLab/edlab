<p>Blogger, author, and former public school teacher, Will Richardson, describes himself as an "…outspoken advocate for change in schools and classrooms in the context of the diverse new learning opportunities that the Web and other technologies now offer." At this year’s International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) conference, Will shared his ideas for disrupting education by way of an <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)">ignite presentation</a> (5 minutes/20 slides). </p>
<p>He spoke quickly and excitedly (perhaps due to the time crunch), breathlessly encouraging his audience to rethink the roles and functions that our factory-model education system currently supports. For example, he calls for the abolition of how-to professional development workshops that teach basics such as "how to blog." Will argues that educators should already know where to find this fundamental information. What would be more fruitful is if educators met to collaborate and share ideas on how they plan to incorporate resources, like new media, into their lessons. "Share everything," Will encourages. </p>
Not surprisingly, Will’s ideas evoked many comments from fellow educators who were viewing his presentation via Vialogues. Some highlights from the discussion included the following: </p>
<p><i>On incorporating students’ personal devices into the learning experience @</i><a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4248#time=42&comment_id=29274">00:42</a> </b>meo2145: I like this idea, but I also worry about the practicality of it - some students would obviously use their cell phones to enhance the proffered academic experience, but others might take the opportunity to text or check their Facebook accounts instead. How do teachers set up an environment in which students resist the social temptations of personal tech?
<p><i>On textbooks as a waste of money </i><br>@<a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4248#time=42&comment_id=29274">00:53 </a>lmd2135: I really like this idea of using the wiki as a means to create a textbook within in the classroom and among the students. I think we too often rely on prescribed texts and publications because they have attained some sort of validity through publication. Realistically, I am a bit hesitant to fully implement the wiki as a textbook, but I feel as though using the wiki as a supplementary piece in the beginning and then, over time, using the compilations to create a class text would be a valuable experience for the students. 
<p>
<i>On sharing your work and the work of your students</i> <br>
@<a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4248#time=160&comment_id=29377">2:40</a> lmd2135: Share Everything . . . interesting concept here especially because I think as teachers it is easy to get wrapped up, particularly in this day and age, in trying to be more successful than the person in the room next to you for fear of your livelihood. But just think how much stronger the teaching profession can become if all of us share our ideas…
 </p><p>As Will would say, we need more disrupters on the side of education, specifically those who tell people that "Education is not under the purview of businesses and politicians. [...] It’s about focusing on learning in a world that is very different from the world most of us grew up in." Join the conversation at <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4248">vialogues.com</a> and tell the world how you plan to disrupt education.
