            Crack! “Look at that, going deep to left field, still back, at the wall, gone!” One of the most exciting events to watch for in baseball is the homerun. Guaranteed to make any crowd's legs rise, jaws drop and eyes widen in marvel, a homerun is the product of an athlete's power, timing and coordination. 755 homeruns however, is the product of a lifelong display of skill, perseverance and determination to succeed against all odds.

Such is a fitting description of Henry Aaron's great career. Henry, better known as Hank or “the Hammer,” approached the game with respect, enthusiasm and professionalism. Rather quiet by nature, Aaron stirred up the most noise and commotion with his bat and his leather. He was a National League MVP in 1957, a three-time Gold Glove Winner, a 24-time All Star and of course the Homerun King from 1974-2007–Hank had the career people only dream of. His 755 career homeruns is a feat only accomplished by two players since major league baseball's inception in 1876. While 755 is both a great and rare accomplishment for any player, it is the history behind Aaron's run to the top, the social context through which he played and the significance of a Black man surpassing the record of baseball's poster-boy, Babe Ruth, which give 755 its true magic.  

Hank Aaron, like Jackie Robinson, is a hero. He played baseball in a time when discrimination towards African-American players still had deep roots in the game. In 1953, he received a Minor League contract from the Boston Braves to play for the Sally League in the segregated South. Hank was then one of just five African American players in the league. He could not eat at the same restaurants his teammates could. He could not sleep in the same hotel that his teammates could. Hank could not sip water from the same fountain his teammates could. “Welcome to the team.” There he was a frequent target of mockery from fans and racial slurs from his fellow players. They all sought to strip him of his dignity, of his pride, and throw his remains into a batter's box. All Hank wanted to do was play the game.

That, however, would never happen. A world where African Americans could just play the game was one that only existed in dreams and stories that began with “Once upon a time…” The bitter cold reality was that the jeering, the spitting, the taunting in the life of an African American ball player was as much part of the game as were balls and strikes. No one can contemplate what 1950's racism really felt like unless you were there. The impact that such ignorance had, the fear that it caused, the sense of loneliness it created, the vulnerability one felt and their combined effect on the mental state of a man is immeasurable. As a youth, however, Hank displayed innate talent and a will as strong as any. He played the game, and he was good. 

In the Minor Leagues, Hank Aaron held a .362 batting average with 22 homeruns, 125 RBIs and was named the League's MVP–not bad for someone who had little formal training while growing up. He worked his way in the organization by playing in Puerto Rico for a summer and in 1954 was given an opportunity to play for the Milwaukee Braves. Hank, donning a major league jersey, wasted no time putting his power on display as he cranked a homer in his first very start at Spring Training–just a sign of what was to come. 

His first year totals were modest by his standards. He batted .280 with 13 homeruns, but by his sophomore season he was already an All Star. Year after year, Hank continued to establish himself as one of the most consistent hitters in the league. Within 3 years Hank was named National League MVP and had already won a World Series Title. Hank hit for power and average. Over his 22 year long career, he was a .305 hitter and averaged 37 homeruns per season. He is the only player to have hit 30 homeruns in 15 seasons and he holds the record for most career RBIs at 2,297 and most career extra base hits at 6,856. With each new season Hank continued to add more accolades to his already very impressive resume. 

To say that his success came easy, however, would be very far from the truth. His achievements brought him fame yet it brought even greater infamy. Both he and Jackie Robinson were close friends and often wrote each other about the prejudice, the boos and the threats that both encountered playing in the “White man's sport”. They were each other's fan in times when it seemed that no one else wanted to be. On more than one occasion Hank considered leaving baseball, and with health problems and many death threats, he had all the incentive to do so. Was it not for his family, close friends, and fellow African American supporters, Hank may have not been in the game long enough to do the impossible–to break Babe Ruth's famed homerun record. 

Fortunately for Hank, he did have those positive outlets and he stayed in the game. As he kept setting personal accomplishments, America realized that “the Hammer” was on the verge of becoming the new Homerun King. Hank began to receive hate mail insulting him, discouraging him and threatening him. The letters had the clear intention of striking fear in the Aaron family and deterring Hank from breaking the Babe's record. When Hank hit his 711th homerun in Atlanta the 1,362 fans in attendance–fans from his own town–heckled him as he rounded the bases. Hank's wife and children went through intense trepidation wondering if Hank would even live to realize his great accomplishment. In September of 1973 with just two days left in the season, Hank came closer as he hit his 713th homerun with an opportunity to tie the record the next day. No homerun would come and Hank would to wait another seven months before he would get another opportunity.

The ensuing seven months were grueling for the Aaron family. Many did not want to see a Black man break Babe Ruth's record. Babe, “the Great Bambino,” “the Sultan of Swat,” “the King of Crash,” “the Colossus of Clout,” the man of many names, had popularized baseball in a way that no other athlete had in his time. Whereas the breaking of such an illustrious record deserved celebration, widespread bigotry in the Deep South spoiled the party. The hate mail and death threats continued to pour in; however, Hank would find support from some of the most unexpected places. Babe's widow, Claire Hodgson publicly called for an end to the racism and an end to the hate. In response to all the hatred came support from true baseball fans–the kind of fans that root for player performance and not racial background. Hank was not just breaking a record, he was moving the country into a more progressive future the same way Jackie Robinson had done before him. 

On April 4th 1974, Hank Aaron homered in his very first at-bat on the road tying Babe Ruth's record. When the Braves returned to Atlanta on April 8th, Hank did the impossible; he broke the record with his 715th career homerun and became the Homerun King. Two White College students ran out on the field while Hank was circling the bases–this caused a stir and great concern from his family–however, they were there to congratulate Hank and celebrate his legacy. He would finish his career having hit 755 homeruns. Hank had come a long way since his days growing up in a small town in Mobile, Alabama, and so had his country. 

Hank Aaron's record lasted 33 long years until Barry Bonds broke his record on August 7, 2007. Although Barry Bonds has displaced Hank Aaron as the reigning Homerun King, the magic and legacy of 755 will always remain.
