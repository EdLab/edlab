<p><i>"Understanding student engagement and efficacy of content in online learning. Using facial expression recognition to analyze engagement. Learning how your students learn. Adapting to their needs."</i> (<a href="https://www.emotuit.com">About Emotuit</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The Missing Analytical Piece: Student Engagement</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.emotuit.com">Emotuit</a> is addressing a serious problem in online learning: student engagement. This startup’s solution is to utilize students’ webcams to track facial expressions while they participate in an online course to assess individual and group engagement at every moment of the class. Online learning analytics now generally focus on number of clicks and time spent on each page, but as the company says, that does not tell us anything about how engaged students actually are. Their system is a promising new way to analyze online learning.</p>

<p><b>How It Works</b></p>
 
<p>The software is adaptable to K–12 and higher education, as well as enterprise learning. Emotuit integrates with many different learning management systems so that users can incorporate the software into their current course program. The software uses students’ webcams to track their facial expressions throughout the course, and then uses an expression recognition algorithm to analyze engagement and reaction. Emotuit plots this information on a graph for course instructors so they can see the exact moments in class when students were most or least engaged.</p>

<p><b>A Hope for Better Online Education</b></p>
 
<p>Emotuit can also plot these emotional responses throughout an entire course so teachers can see how student engagement might correlate with the dropout rate and ideally learn ways to lower it. The company’s goal is to give course instructors the type of information they don’t usually receive while teaching an online course so they can know when to target individual students or improve course material across the board. When learning is separated by a screen, it’s almost impossible for educators to know all their students’ reactions. Emotuit is working to improve online learning by changing that.</p>
