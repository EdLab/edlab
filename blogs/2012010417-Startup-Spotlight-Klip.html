<b>The Details & Back-story</b>
Founded in September by Alain Rossmann, one of the original members of the Apple team (his wife was employee #5) and the creator of <a href="http://www.vudu.com/">Vudu</a>,  <a href="http://www.klip.com/">Klip</a>, allows users to share short 1 minute-or-less videos and "follow" other users and topics.  

Creating for video what Twitter has accomplished for text-based communication, Klip pares-down the video-viewing experience to a kind of text-free visual shorthand, eschewing comments for constant streams streams of short videos.  As Rossmann eloquently points-out in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/alain-rossmanns-klip-a-twitter-for-videos-12152011.html">this</a> Bloomberg Businessweek article, "Our entire history will be chronicled in a mosaic of video.‚Äù  It is Rossmann who wants to help you assemble your own collection of one-minute masterpieces.

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>
Klip just plain works.  Not only is the site, platform and mobile app fast, sleek and intuitive to use, but it seems fun and manages to cultivate and encourage a loyal tribe-like following.  This growing "tribe" of "Klipsters" (I want residuals for this one!) can easily organize their content streams, follow other users or categories of content and seek-out like-minded souls to share with.  

It seems that Klip manages to be both simple, unique and vital all at the same time. What the platform lacks in bells & whistles, it more than makes-up in efficient functionality and the ever elusive "over delivering" by not "over selling" state of not releasing features that aren't fully realized.


<b>EdLab Takeaway</b>
As we think about new ways to add features and extend Vialogues.com, what features and selling-points of Klip can we study and adapt-into our platform?  I think the ease of "following" hashtags associated with each video is especially compelling & makes the social experience of video even more seamless and enveloping for a user.  Also, the lack of lag or hang-time as they employ an adaptive bit-rate structure seems valuable (touted as one of the fastest in the business).  

Another great lesson for EdLab development is that what Klip lacks in bells & whistles, it more than makes-up in efficient functionality and the ever elusive "over delivering" by not "over selling" state of not releasing features that aren't fully realized.  Finally, why not borrow what works from one popular tool & adapt it to fit another medium?  In this case a Twitter model was applied to video.  Perhaps there are other platforms like Flickr that we can explore for current or future tools?  There is nothing wrong with reinterpreting a classic.
