            Should public schools delay school start times? I first pondered on this topic following the recent observance of daylight savings. Since I now commute to school (from the South Bronx to Long Island City, Queens) when it's still dark outside, I wonder if it might be in the best interest of students for schools to start at a later time.

In the United States, the average school start time ranges from 7:00am-9:00am. A very small percentage of schools though start past 8:00am thus making 7am-8am the normal start time. Such an early start time though has been proven to have negative effects on teenagers.
 
According to studies, a teen's internal biological clock is naturally set up in such that they fall asleep later and wake up later. Having an early school start time as a result disrupts this natural occurrence, which in turn has many teens sleep deprived.

The <a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/hot-topics/backgrounder-later-school-start-times">Natural Sleep Foundation</a> states that teens on average should get 8-9 hours of sleep per night but about half get under seven hours of sleep. Several major factors affect such a statistic and they include school course load, test prep, and extracurricular activities. Students go to sleep late due to all of these factors and have to wake up early in order to make it to school on time. Once in the classroom, <a href="http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-sleepy-student-23743/">students</a> are sluggish, drowsy and lack alertness. They have difficulty analyzing or using good judgment to solve problems. Furthermore, sleep deprived teenagers are less motivated, earn low grades, more likely to be tardy or absent, and more likely to suffer from depression.

High levels of stress, which is directly related to sleep deprivation, causes some of these teens to turn to unhealthy practices such as the consumption of coffee or other high caffeine drinks like Red Bull or Monster; All in hopes of trying to alleviate or remedy this problem. Such practices and the other negative consequences that are the result of an early state time can be lessened or abated if schools delayed their start time.  

School districts that have pushed back their start times have indeed seen positive results. A Minnesota school district that moved its start time from 7:15am to 8:45am saw an improvement in student's alertness, grades, and punctuality. Also fewer students reported depressive thoughts or sought stress relief due to academic pressure. Not only were students able to gain an extra hour of sleep, but it also gave them much needed time to finish any schoolwork. The question that now remains is that how come other schools are not implementing a later start time given the proven results. 

The answer lies in the fact that delaying start times has a direct effect on other variables. These include district bus routes (which is not cost effective according to most districts), and conflicting teacher/parent schedules, among others. Also on the student's part, a delay in start time interferes with after school jobs, extracurricular activities, and other things students participate in after school.

In all though, the benefits of a delayed start time far outweighs the potential troubles that accompany it. So whether it is a thirty minute delay or an hour, the end result for the most part benefits the student.
