Steve Taffee is an educator, consultant and early employee at one of the first educational gaming companies, MECC (responsible for the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_%28video_game%29">Oregon Trail computer game</a>).  Taffee has paired his unique insight into both education and technology in his work as a consultant and edtech agent of change.

<p>
<b> EXCLUSIVE NLT INTERVIEW</b>
<P>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory/background affect your current work? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> My work was profoundly affected by the <a href="http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/affect/humed.html">humanistic/open education</a> movement of the 1970's, and writers like Jonathan Kozol, John Holt, Charles Silberman, A.S. Neill and Herb Kohl. I did my student teaching in an open classroom, and brought that experience and background to my first teaching job which proved to not be simpatico with the school district in which I was working and resulted in my being sacked. It's ironic, I think, that in the 1970's educational technology was equated with B.F. Skinner's teaching machines and therefore anathema to humanists like myself. The introduction of the personal computer in the 1980's led me - and many others - to see that technology could be an empowering, human-centric tool and not just one used in stimulus-response, drill and practice programs.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> In 1984 I joined the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Educational_Computing_Corporation">Minnesota Educational Computing Corporation (MECC)</a>. At the time it was owned by the State of Minnesota, and was offering timeshare computer services as well as developing software for Radio Shack TRS-80, Commodore, and Apple II computers. MECC developed hundreds of software titles and distributed them to schools using an innovative system in which districts paid by enrollment, making as many copies of the program as they needed. I really think that MECC was a key to the rapid adoption of personal computers across the country. While at MECC, I was fortunate to not only work on great products, but to gain a broad understanding of software development by leading design and documentation teams, graphic and multimedia artists, researchers, online learning and our first forays into web sites and e-commerce.

Following that, I had a stint with Netscape, where I led a group responsible for Netscape's international web portals, which provided not only a chance to learn more about web applications, but to work with people in multiple countries.

I returned to educational technology in 2002, taking a position as Director of Technology with one of the leading, all-girl independent schools in the country. The decade starting in 2000 reminded me in many ways of my heady, inventing as you go along days at MECC where you knew you were part of a larger shift in education and society. In the 1970's it was the PC. In the 2000's it was the Internet. In the 2010's, it’s ubiquitous, always on network devices whose current poster child is the iPad.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
 
<b>Answer:</b> My work alone won't change anything. In many ways we're teaching the same way we were when I was in school, or even when my grandparents were in school. Rows of desks, teacher up front lecturing, kids who get it and those who don't left on the wayside. Despite this dismal picture, I am optimistic that pockets of progressive educators are creating a viral movement in which technology plays a role in freeing teachers to adopt new and exciting roles, students to engage in learning that maintains an optimum state of curiosity and mindfulness; courage; failure and resilience; good humor and serious inquiry. I hope that teachers and administrators, students and parents will demand more of their teaching and learning spaces, that the cells and bells model of school architecture will disappear to be replaced by schools that resemble living organisms rather than prisons.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> There are several trends, both within education and the larger world, that will dramatically impact education.<br>
•	The role of assessment will change. Recognizing that standard forms of assessment such as those advocated by NCLB and Race to the Top are failures, districts and states will look to more holistic and formative approaches, the inklings of which may be found in portfolios, project-based learning, and authentic publication of student works.<br>
•	Funding for education will radically change. Recognizing that decades of underinvestment and mis-investment in education has led nowhere, and accompanied by changing national priorities in where government spends its money, we will see Defense spending drop and domestic program spending increase.
•	Climate change accommodation will force some schools to close in areas of the planet that are no longer inhabitable (due to sea rise), accelerating the building of new schools to the highest possible standards of environmental sustainability.<br>
•	Printed materials in general, and textbooks from major publishers in particular, will disappear. In their place will be e-documents and custom texts created by and for teachers.<br>
•	Educational gaming and simulations will no longer be perceived as "trivial" or "ancillary" to teaching, but core.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I recently left full-time employment and am starting to consult with schools that are interested in the intersection of technology, learning, space design, and professional development. I'm not sure where that is going to lead.
