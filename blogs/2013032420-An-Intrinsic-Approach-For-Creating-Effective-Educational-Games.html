<p><b>Title: </b>Motivating Children to Learn Effectively: Exploring the Value of Intrinsic Integration in Educational Games (2011)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> M. P. Jacob Habgoodab & Shaaron E. Ainswortha</p>
<p>
<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Intrinsic motivation is the desire to accomplish a task for its own sake with no apparent external reward. We know that intrinsic motivation is particularly conducive to learning and educational video games, especially those that deliver learning material through the parts of the game that are the most fun to play without interrupting or diminishing gameplay. In an intrinsically integrated video game, the learning content is seamlessly blended into the world of the game, providing an external representation of the learning content that is explored through gameplay. For example, if a player submits an incorrect answer, it will not show overtly on the screen but will have a direct effect on the player’s progress. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.508029">Motivating Children to Learn Effectively: Exploring the Value of Intrinsic Integration in Educational Games</a> tests the concept of intrinsic integration to create a more productive relationship between educational games and learning content.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCrd6MV0ehU">Zombie Division</a> educational game was used to test whether intrinsically integrated games promote learning. Zombie Division is a 3D adventure game with a sword-fighting hero who must use different attacks to mathematically divide opponents according to the numbers displayed on their chests. The game focuses on number patterns and using sequence recognition to make predictions. The first study examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for two hours, supported by their classroom teacher. The second study compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
In the first study, students played the game and then participated in teacher-led reflection. Learning was measured by the percentage of correct answers the students provided on post-game tests. The authors found that children playing all versions of the game learned from the experience, but the children who played the intrinsic condition learned the most. The second study examined the time on task when students were given a choice of which version of the game to play. The authors found that students spent 7 times longer playing the intrinsic version and had more positive perceptions toward the intrinsic version of game. One student said of the intrinsic version, "it’s easier to learn…instead of to having to figure out what the symbols are you just have to figure out what to divide by."</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study showed that a math game featuring intrinsic integration promoted learning and was more fun for students in this age group. Further research with different age groups and subjects is needed before we can say that these results are universal. Game-based learning will likely become more acceptable and ubiquitous as classroom technology and the options for educational gaming improve. Studies like this show that gaming can be an effective strategy for learning and that intrinsically motivated math learning may not be an oxymoron.</p>
