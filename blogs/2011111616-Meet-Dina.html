<em>Dina joined the library services team in September. She keeps things festive around the desk! Have you seen our pumpkin? Dina is a hard worker and has quickly learned how to trouble shoot technical problems that arise here at the library. To learn more about Dina keep reading...</em>
<h1 style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #800000">Meet Dina!</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/10/dina-apple.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13260 aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/dina-apple-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<em><strong>Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</strong></em>

I am indeed a TC student! First year, first semester student going for an MA in Social-Organizational Psychology.

<strong><em>Where’s your hometown?</em></strong>

My hometown is Staten Island, New York -- the so-called "forgotten borough" of NYC. Don't hate! There are some great things on that misunderstood island. Ask me!

<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/vegetable-lasagna.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-13108  alignleft" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/vegetable-lasagna-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="114" /></a>

<strong><em>Your favorite meal?</em></strong>
Two things only my mother can get right -- veggie lasagna and clam dip -- they are out of this world!

<em><strong>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:</strong></em> "Heartbeats" by The Knife or, next best thing, by Jose Gonzalez.

<em> </em><em><strong>A country you’d like to visit?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

The countries at the top of my list include Brazil, Belize, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Mali, Thailand, &amp; Croatia.

<em> </em><em><strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

I recall wanting to be a nurse or a clothing/shoe designer when I was very little. Then I wanted to be a lawyer, a doctor, a veterinarian, a pilot, an artist, a stylist, a photographer, a travel writer, a cafe/cupcake shop owner, etc!

<em><strong>What was your first job?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

When I was ten years old, I babysat/tutored two brothers -- one child had ADHD and the other was a brat.

<em><strong>What has been your worst job?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

I believe my job as a legal secretary was the most labor-intensive, boring, late-night gig I have ever had. My boss did not believe in technology, so I had to type everything on a typewriter. For one case, I was required to measure sewer grates and their distances from the nearest intersection and various curbs. Ugh!

<strong><em> What has been your best job?</em></strong>

<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/lifebeat.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13109" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/lifebeat.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="115" /></a>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

My favorite job, well, actually...it was a volunteer gig...was working as a <a title="LifeBEAT" href="http://lifebeat.org/" target="_blank">LifeBEAT </a>outreach volunteer. I tabled music concerts, fundraisers, and special events in and around NYC whilst giving out various contraceptives and providing information about testing and the ways to prevent STIs (sexually-transmitted infections). I met some of the craziest, funniest, and misinformed people! Sometimes celebrities or musicians would say hello as well.
<p style="text-align: center"></p>
<em><strong>What do you remember about your first day of school?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

I honestly don't recall much at all. I was probably apprehensive, annoyed and bugged out by nap time.

<em><strong>A book you strongly recommend?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>Everyone should read "<a title="Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/teats%2C+shoots+and+leaves/teats+shoots+and+leaves/1%2C2%2C2%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=teats+shoots+and+leaves&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-" target="_blank">Eats, Shoots, &amp; Leaves</a>" -- it is a funny and helpful guide to punctuation.

<em><strong>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

I am not a huge sports fan...but I love to play tennis. I talk a lot of smack on the courts. But, you play with me and you'll have great fun <span style="text-decoration: line-through">or a bruised leg</span>. :)

<span style="color: #800000"><strong><em>TOP THREE….</em></strong></span>

<em><strong>…Best places to read? </strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>Barnes  &amp; Noble, 2nd floor during a weekday evening in Staten Island; my comfy bed; &amp; any of NYC's beautiful parks or plazas on a gorgeous day!

<em><strong>… Favorite authors or books?</strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>Call me a nerd...but I love anything by <a title="J.R.R. Tolkien" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/atolkien/atolkien/1%2C3%2C13%2CB/exact&amp;FF=atolkien+j+r+r+john+ronald+reuel+1892+1973&amp;1%2C11%2C">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>, the author of the famed Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I also fell in love with a South African Literature class in undergrad; so, two of my favorite books include "<a title="Bitter Fruit" href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=bitter%20fruit&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;SL=None&amp;CNT=50&amp;PID=jvTsBV98UUeRaKcyZFk7h9ch6q8&amp;SEQ=20111011213522&amp;SID=2" target="_blank">Bitter Fruit</a>" by Achmat Dangor &amp; "<a title="Disgrace" href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=2&amp;ti=1,2&amp;Search%5FArg=disgrace&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=50&amp;PID=vf7MRuHtgQjLCwT2mbXn8yD9TwA&amp;SEQ=20111011213415&amp;SID=1" target="_blank">Disgrace</a>" by J.M. Coetzee.

<em><strong>Complete the sentence:</strong></em>

<em>T<strong>he strangest thing that has ever happened to me was...</strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>Three individuals proposed marriage to me over the course of four months. They were all strangers. They were all from different countries. And, worst of all, they were all serious.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/wedding-proposal.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-13107 aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/wedding-proposal.jpg" alt="" width="162" height="127" /></a></p>
<em><strong>Most fascinating person I’ve ever met was...</strong></em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>My mother's uncle, through marriage -- my Great Uncle Harry. He was a NYC detective involved in various high-profile mob cases. He was also a private detective. The man was hilarious! He would tell the craziest stories. We looked forward to him coming over for dinner because he would regale us with his most recent tales of his wealthy, miser friend or his crazy hijinx. He lived a full life and brought joy to so many people. He was one of the most generous people I knew, too. He was best friends with my father -- which is no small feat! (Dad is pretty difficult to get along with). I miss him a great deal. May he rest in peace.

<em><strong>The weirdest thing I’ve ever done for money was…</strong></em>

Actually more something to SAVE money and time. My friend and I were catching a train in Egypt. It takes a while to book a train there, so it was critical we made the train that day. On our way to the station, I tripped, fell and hit my head on a sewer grate. When I came to, I threw some ice on my head, got up and started speeding toward the train station. We missed our train by 30 seconds. We found a taxi driver who agreed to take us to the next station to catch up with the train. We made it to the next stop just as the train was pulling up. It was the ride of our lives. I will reflect about this in a later post because it is a horrific, hilarious story.
