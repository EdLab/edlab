<b>The Details & Back-Story</b>
UPenn college students, Joseph Cohen and Dan Getelman, first started working on <a href="http://coursekit.com/">Coursekit</a> in June 2010. The journey began with a mission to replace the traditional class syllabus because they were frustrated that professors still used a piece of paper to outline their class. Their vision grew bigger when they realized that the root of the problem was beyond outdated syllabi. It was outdated academic course software in general. So with a few other friends, they created Coursekit. Since then, the three founders dropped out of school, raised $1M during seed round, and started out this year strong with another $5M in series A funding (<a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/coursekit">Crunchbase</a>).

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>
How did they get series A funding already? Unlike Blackboard, it's biggest competitor, which sold itself to university administrators, Coursekit decided to take a grassroots approach of targeting individual professors, instead of selling to university administrators, allowing it to bypass the typically slow adoption of the education market. 

<b>EdLab Takeaway</b>
It's a little crazy to me that the founders of Coursekit are younger than me and are technically still supposed to be sophomores in college. We all knew that young people were stepping up in the startup world in Silicon Valley, but now the trend seems to have migrated over here to the East Coast as well. It's a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/08/03/can-new-york-rival-silicon-valley-for-start-ups">discussion</a> that has started to create buzz and I'm excited to see NYC become a serious, long-term startup hub.
