<p>Ask anyone how to improve student achievement, especially in low performing schools, and you will most likely receive a million different answers. Learning is an individual endeavor and improving overall student achievement requires a unique and special approach. That's why Rocketship Education, a consortium of public elementary schools, is working with low-income neighborhoods across the country.</p>
 
<p>At the very core of Rocketship Education’s goals is their instructional model, which combines classroom instruction and outdoor activities. This model is centered on five key components: whole group instruction, online learning, targeted intervention, team learning, and small group instruction. Rocketship’s educators are afforded enormous flexibility in planning their lessons in order to meet the needs of their students. Additionally, students engage in a host of enrichment activities outside the classroom, such as physical education, theater, and foreign language instruction. The goal is to provide students with a complete education that prepares them for the rest of their educational journey and ultimately, professional life.</p>
 
<p>Can this model be replicated across the country? Is the model robust enough to bring about student achievement? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25063/">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a></p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:15 ABARRY:</b> It's really important that online learning is part of their project, allowing the students to develop computer skills and individual learning.</p>

<p><b>@01:27 bizapp:</b> I think this is a great activity for students. Allowing the students to access   the internet will enhance their computer skills and prepare them for the future, especially due to the advancement in technology.</p>
