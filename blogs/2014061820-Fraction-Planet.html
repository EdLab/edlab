<p>Picture this: Angry Birds meets the new Common Core math standards. <a href="http://www.fractionplanet.com/">Fraction Planet</a> has figured out a way to make fractions, number lines, and angles a fun and engaging learning experience. Through a series of interactive video games, students work through different challenges in order to advance to the next level. Teachers can easily sign up their entire class to participate in Fraction Planet. They also receive detailed reports on student progress and areas for improvement.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Fraction Planet is designed with the look and feel of the wildly popular video game, Angry Birds. The bright colors and easy-to-use interface quickly captures the attention and interest of users. In the first game, Battleship Numberline, students start by locating integers between 1 and 10 on a number line in the middle of the ocean; in the next level, they locate fractions on a similar number line between 0 and 1. In a later game, Angle Asteroids, students need to identify the degree of an angle that they are given in order to shoot the asteroid and collect the points. This time, a countdown clock is also introduced to add a level of excitement to the game. As students advance within each game, the questions become more challenging and complex.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>Fraction Planet is still in its beta testing phase, so users are limited in terms of the content they can access. As the site continues to develop, we may be presented with additional mathematical concepts. Fraction Planet would also be an excellent app for tablet format. The target audience for Fraction Planet is currently elementary-level students. Once the game gains attention and traction, it could expand to cover additional grade levels. While this is an excellent educational tool, teachers must be conscious of the fact that this is still a game and it has the potential to distract from the classroom learning experience. Teachers should use this tool to supplement traditional classroom instruction.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>By accessing the Teacher’s Summary Dashboard, instructors can easily identify the concepts that their students are mastering and those areas where they need further improvement. The Teacher’s Summary clearly identifies the Common Core learning standards that correlate with the different games and levels.  The dashboard also lists the average time it takes students to complete each section of the game.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b> Fraction Planet makes learning math fun again.</p>
