Jonathan Taplin is director of the <a href="http://www.annenberglab.com/"> Annenberg Innovation Lab</a> at the University of Southern California and is a professor specializing in international communication management and digital media entertainment. His current project is called Movie Sentiment, which aims to understand and analyze how people tweet about movies in order to improve the use of social media surrounding film. Taplin’s many accomplishments include his background as Tour Manager for Bob Dylan and The Band in 1969 and his role as producer on Martin Scorsese’s film <i>Mean Streets</i>. Taplin is a prolific producer of films and television documentaries and a Golden Globe and Oscar nominee.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work? </b><br>
Most of my life has been spent producing movies and music, so I came to the academy late in life. That leads me to try to find ways that students who aspire to participate in the creative economy will have a way to make a living. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br> 
We try to wrestle with real world problems at the Innovation Lab. Too much of the work of Universities is spent in theoretical discussions that seem removed from the problems of the real creative economy. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The jury is still out on MOOC's, but I'm pretty sure that online education will develop into a huge part of learning in the next ten years. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
We are focused on Big Data and Fan Engagement in an OTT entertainment world. We are also doing a lot of work on new types of story telling for VR and other immersive environments. </p>
