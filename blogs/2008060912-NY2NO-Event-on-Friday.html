            Hi Everyone,

As some of you may know I have been filming students from the Beacon School as they plan their trip down to New Orleans this summer. So far they have gotten over 300 students from NYC to commit to going down to New Orleans this summer to help gut houses and organize residents. They hope to get these students motivated and to start helping residents on NYC when they return. 

They are having a fundraising Jazz event this Friday to help fund the trips of those students who are unable to pay. There will be music and a silent art auction.

You can find out more information on their organization <a href="http://www.ny2no.com/">here</a>. I am also posting info from the organizers about the event below. I am planning on attending and if you want to go let me know and I will reserve tickets for you. They are 15 dollars.

______________

Hello Everyone!

Throughout July and August, almost 300 kids will travel down to New Orleans with NY2NO in a massive effort to rebuild the devastated city. However, many of those teenagers can only attend this trip if they receive financial aid that helps cover the rather expensive costs of flying down and staying for more than a week in N.O.  You may or may not be attending one of the trips this summer, but either way, you can come and support NY2NO's summer trips this Friday!

From 7 to 11pm on Friday, June 13th, NY2NO will be hosting a fundraising event that will include live jazz music (one of the artists being trombonist Rob Susman!), delicious food and a silent auction! The event will be held at the Sixth Street Community Center in New York City's Lower East Side (6th Street between avenues B and C). All the benefits from this event will go directly towards paying for financial aids and other summer trip expenses. 

The tickets are $15 dollars and can be bought in advance from any NY2NO organizer, in which case you will receive a free glass of wine. If you have no idea how to get in touch with a NY2NO organizer, even after asking your child, feel free to send an email to fundraiser@ny2no.com where you can reserve tickets and get answers to any questions you may have.

There's a limited number of tickets left and only 4 days left until the fundraiser takes place so don't wait - buy or reserve your tickets today! This is a great way to spend your Friday night after work or school and it's all for a good cause!

Hoping to see you all there!
NY2NO

PS. Don't forget to bring your checkbook as there will plenty of fine artworks etc. in the silent auction!
