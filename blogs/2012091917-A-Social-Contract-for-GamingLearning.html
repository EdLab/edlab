          <p>
            There have been many talks about games and education recently. I just ran into two great videos of Katie Salen, the director of Institute of Play, talking about game, play and design, and am really impressed by the way she describes gaming and playing. In this video <a href="http://soulbiographies.com/play/">Play</a>, Salen talks about play as a way of being that makes players open and comfortable to explore new possibilities and ultimately forget themselves in these engaging experiences (but sure, there are also issues related to such condition like addiction). She suggests that “such a state of being might hold answers for the reimagining of education. And our enterprises. And our lives.” 

As a designer, she is eager to unpack what makes those engaging gaming and playing experiences. Among various elements, she describes this unique social contract between a game designer and the players that seems to me the ultimate guideline for any great game design (she explains this in this <a href="http://www.aiga.org/video-pivot-2011-salen/">video</a>, starting 4:04 to 4:40): 

"When a player choose to play a game, they know and believe that game designers have thought specifically about them, and design an experience for them that is probably really hard, probably going to kick their ass, probably going to get them failed and get super frustrated, but in the end is going to allow them to succeed and there will be tremendous fun in doing this … A great game designer use all his/her power to allow the players to feel clever, creative, and “ultimately to allow that player to feel they can do anything possible in that space'."(A similar view is presented by Jane McGonigal's keynote at 2012 Games for Change on how great gaming makes people believe in themselves to become and achieve anything, thus can make social change. Thanks Wan and Ariel for this <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7889">great video</a>).

I think this is also a beautiful and powerful contract for educators to design any great learning experiences and spaces for learners.

Here is <a href="http://www.teachthought.com/technology/video-games-in-learning-these-50-videos-explain-whats-possible/">another resource</a> of fifty videos about gaming for education. Seems like a good list for a Vialogue online course on gaming and education.
