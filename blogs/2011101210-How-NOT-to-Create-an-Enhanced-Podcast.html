            Private! 

Hi Team Edlab, 

Over the last few weeks I have intermittently endeavored to create an enhanced podcast from my interview with Jennifer Openshaw, CEO of <a href="http://www.superfutures.com/ ">SuperFutures.org</a>.  The goal was to use Power Point to create a "movie" with correspondent visuals and use the audio from the interview as the soundtrack, then uploading the whole kit & caboodle as a vialogue to then embed in a correspondent blog piece on the future of college prep/guidance.

Seems simple enough... right?  

<b>Here is what not to do (followed by suggestions for a better approach!):</b> 

1) Don't assume that an HD flip video camera, though adequate for internally viewed video capture, is appropriate quality for non-EdLab human consumption.

2) Don't take pictures while you film a video, lest you want a "press corps" effect, which could be desirable some of the time. (George you did a great job - my direction was off).

3) DO NOT under ANY circumstance assume that creating a Power Point on a MAC with very specific timed animations will transfer well as a .MOV file.  Microsoft, somehow knew that us MAC users would want to do this and did not make it an easy task.  I am just saying... transitions fine, animation timing NOT FINE! 

<b>Ok now for the positive, potentially easier path to Power Point/Vialogues bliss:</b>

1)  When capturing audio from an interview be sure to borrow the Editoral audio recorder from the video team.  Test this multiple times for the audio levels etc & be sure it is on before starting your interview. 

2)  Yes, do use <a href="http://web.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> (Thanks Melanie!) to edit these audio files... super easy to use and thanks to Zhou's future mSchool course you too can be an audio/Audacity expert! 

3)  Be sure to select only images from Google images/Flickr/The Commons that are labeled for reuse.  Also, be sure to download the highest quality version of the file. 

4)  When using Power Point to convert your presentation into a movie here are a few tricks for getting the audio just so...
   -To develop your animations/transitions with the audio select "play across slides" & not "automatically" from the audio menu. 
   -If the player icon doesn't "hide" when you are finished and ready to upload change the transparency of the slide and it will disappear (Thanks Jo!).
   -When you are ready to save as a .MOV file or .WMV (more on this later) file select from the movie options pop-up menu the soundtrack drop-down menu and add your audio file to the presentation here (thanks Fred!).  

5) Now for the .WMV vs .MOV file issue... if you created a presentation on a MAC without, I repeat without animations proceed to save your file as a .MOV file.  If you are an avid PPT animator, stop, transfer your files to a PC and save the whole shebang as a .WMV file and then upload to Vialogues (thanks Pranav for discovering this!!!).  A .WMV file type is not listed on the vialogues A-OK list... but not to worry it is an accepted format.  

6) Vialogues somehow manages to make everything look better!  Bravo Vialogues team!  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1704">Here</a> is the final product on Vialogues & correspondent <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6625">EdLab blog post</a>.

Ok, there you go!  Hopefully, you, unlike me, will have an expedited first enhanced podcast creation experience!  Go forth and Power Point & feel free to ask me for any additional tips... it does as I learned the hard way, take a village to create a vialogue.
