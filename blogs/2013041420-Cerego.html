<p><a href="http://cerego.com/">Cerego</a> helps users learn basic concepts for subjects such as math, science, geography, and foreign language, and allows students to create their own courses for others to take. <a href="http://cerego.com/learning">According to the creators</a>, Cerego boasts a unique learning algorithm that can help people memorize and learn basic concepts more effectively than other online tools. This is because the founders incorporated research and principles from the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science in the development of this product. One of the unique features of Cerego is their "memory bank" graph that helps users visualize their learning progress on all courses they are currently taking.</p> 

<p>The memory bank graph is able to track multiple courses and plot student levels of activation and memory strength; every course a student is taking on Cerego is a data point on this graph. The data point’s position can let users know when they need to retake a course to refresh their learning and how far they are from learning mastery of the course subject. Every course also has its own graph with data points for every learning concept so users can see how well they know a specific concept based on the data point’s position on the graph.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Cerego provides an effective visualization of students’ learning progress. When users hover over a data point in the graph they are able to view information such as course name, when the course was last viewed, and when they should retake a course lesson for optimal learning. The length of a course session can be easily adjusted which allows students to choose between a quick session or more involved lessons. Another interesting feature is that users can collaborate with others in the system to create a course. When users create courses they can be grouped into a set, which can be useful for organizing courses within the same subject.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Course organization is a bit messy and the tagging system does not make sense at times. An example of this is that the Statistics course is tagged as science, which could confuse users, who might associate statistics with math. Since Cerego only recently launched, the library of courses is small, but hopefully participants will begin to create more courses as the site’s user base grows.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Cerego combines the principles from neuroscience and cognitive science to create a digital learning tool that helps students learn the content and informs them of the optimal time to take a refresher course for more long-term learning. The amount of learning data provided really makes Cerego stand out from similar sites. The platform excels at giving users great visuals of how much they’ve learned, how far they are from their learning goal, and when the time is right to retake a course session to keep the learning content fresh in their mind. The course sessions themselves are adaptive, so when users retake course sessions the content will be different depending on how the user performed in the previous session. These features help users learn more efficiently.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Cerego helps students better visualize their learning progress.</p>
