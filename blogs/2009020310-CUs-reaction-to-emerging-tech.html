          <p>
            <p>While reading Jo's recent blog entry on <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2383>Trends in Ed (01/29/20)</a> about MIT's new approach (known as <a href=http://icampus.mit.edu/teal/content/?whatisteal>Technology Enhanced Active Learning</a>) to teaching introductory physics, one phrase stood out to me: “INITIALLY PROTESTED BY STUDENTS.”</p>

<p>Then I came across a headline in yesterday's Columbia Spectator that read, “<a href=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2009/02/02/cu-science-values-teaching-over-technology>CU Science Values Teaching Over Tech</a>.” The article did mention TEAL and reported that our fellows and professors across the street like their current way of teaching and learning just fine. Several quotes from students and faculty collectively claimed student interest and faculty expertise as more important to a student's success than a new teaching system like TEAL. Nonchalant to dismissive reactions like “helpful but unnecessary” and “good for [MIT] but our way works too” were, needless to say, somewhat of a shock (or to be a little more honest, discouraging) to a new comer to EdLab like me.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to follow up on how Columbia University's Science Dept. will — over time —react to this ‘trend' towards a smaller, tech-enhanced, and collaborative science classes.  After all, the main motivation behind TEAL is to increase student engagement. Obviously, following a trend for the sake of conformity is not something that I would expect of CU.  But perhaps re-evaluating what constitutes student's “success” will help the academic community here to be leaders in their respective disciplines. It would also help if students themselves saw a benefit in this new approach.</p>

<p>On a similar note, other universities are reportedly looking forward to adopting TEAL. For example, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which according to Stephanie, was the original harbinger in modeling this teaching and learning approach. North Carolina State University, University of Maryland, and Harvard are a just a few of the other universities looking to adopt TEAL.</p>
