            The Panel For Educational Policy has voted to close 19 public schools. <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/nyregion/28closings.html">full text</a>

It seems like it is nationwide initiative to close schools that lack competence. However, I have recently noted that Teachers College is littered with flyers which states "more teachers needed!"  
Once schools are closed, I am wondering where teachers in those schools go. Are they hired again by other schools? 

Yesterday there was a talk at TC where faculty members Herbert Ginsburg and Sharon Lynn Kagan discussed the results of a 2009 National Academy of Sciences study to which they had contributed. I attended and heard Prof. Ginsburg mentioned that children's lack of competence in math was not a problem of curriculum or materials, but teachers. 
He said that teachers should be confident of what they were teaching, and they needed to be fully aware of what is going on by observing children's response to math problems and be ready to guide them.
Based on these comments, are teachers one of reasons that led to the schools' closing?
