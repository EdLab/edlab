Teaching Math Problem Solving Using a Web-based Tutoring System, Learning Games, and Students' Writing. <i>Journal of STEM Education: Innovations and Research, Vol 11 </i>(No 1), 82-90.</a>

<b>Description:</b> This research paper describes the use of a website application called <a href ="http://cadmium.cs.umass.edu/4mality/"> 4MALITY</a>, a mathematics tutoring system, to teach students about mathematics and build up on their problem solving skills through the coaching system. This paper also briefly describes the effectiveness of blended learning both online and in-person activities. The hint model that was used to organized suggestions includes two axes: problem solving steps and learning style preferences, these hints were given out through 4MALITY's coach characters (Chef Math Bear, How to Hound, Visual Vera). The researchers had five fourth grade classrooms (125 students total) use the 4MALITY program, the findings indicated that there was a mean gain of 25.51% in test scores from pre-test to post-test among all students. 4MALITY was designed to teach mathematical problem-solving skills and test taking strategies to fourth grade students who were taking the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) standardized exam. The study also found that diversifying teachers' approach to teaching math can improve math problem solving skills, teachers can incorporate web-based tutoring system, math board games, and creative writing.

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b> There are many web-based math applications designed to improve the users problem solving skills, but what makes 4MALITY unique is their coaching system in the program and their hint model that decides how the coach characters will help the user. This program takes into account the different learning styles students have, in this case their hint model includes these four: explaining the question in terms of the language used, mathematical computational operations, test-taking and problem solving strategies, and visual approaches to computation. I believe that this coaching system can be great for guiding students, and helping them improve their problem solving skill, and encourages working toward a solution, instead of guessing the right answer.  The only reason I'm not completely falling in love with this program is because this web-based tutoring app was designed to help students pass a standardized test (MCAS). What this means to me is that the problems in the app might have the same boring problems as the standardize exam itself, instead of more creative and real-life based problems. The overall design is great, and according to the paper, very effective in teaching problem solving skills, but I hope a newer version will be created, one that will have more creative and diverse problems that are based on real-life situations. These types of problems will keep students more engaged and challenge them as well.
