<p>Carrie Shaw became a caregiver when her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s. She found that creating tools that caregivers could use to experience the world the way her mother did enhanced their empathy and responsiveness. She began to imagine how to use technology to take medical staff inside the perspective of a patient with Alzheimer’s.</p>

<p>The Beatriz Lab is a virtual reality (VR) training tool that allows users to experience Beatriz’s transformation as her Alzheimer’s progresses. By seeing, hearing, and talking as Beatriz, users gain insight into the frustrations that come with decreased cognitive capacities. The creators envision the program being used by every type of Alzheimer’s caregiver, from doctor to food service worker. They hope that the virtual experience of living with Alzheimer’s will increase caretakers’ empathy and insight into how best to respond to patients’ needs.</p>

<p>Do you think this VR experience can serve as an effective training tool? Are there other situations or ailments that would be beneficial to experience in VR? Add your voice to the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48778">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@03:23 Melanie Hering:</b> This statement that "we don't actually know what it's like until we experience it" implies that we can truly and realistically experience Alzheimer's through VR; I find this assumption troubling. I think VR is an excellent venue to more intimately and realistically understand experiences, such as a disease like Alzheimer's, but I would be cautious to say it does more than open a door to understanding. It provides great opportunities to build knowledge and empathy, but it's so important to remember that a VR experience isn't a real experience.</p>

<p><b>@03:49 Dallas Milanovich:</b> The idea to require VR training for different professions definitely proves worthwhile in this instance. If a caretaker has the knowledge of the disease from an imitated "lived" perspective of someone who has the disease, they can be more empathetic, more aware, and more effective in taking care of them.</p>
