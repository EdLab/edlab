A group of high schoolers is introduced to immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) for the first time. Inspired and energized by this new experience, these teens share their thoughts about how VR might transform education. Here are the four insights we came away with:</p>

<p><b>1. VR could help educators cater to diverse learning styles. </b><br>
Lecture-style classes may work well for auditory learners, but bringing VR into the classroom could benefit those with a more visual or kinesthetic learning style. </p>

<p><b>2. VR could be the ultimate playground for the imagination.</b><br>
VR learning doesn’t have to be reserved for just high school or college aged students, it could also give young kids new tools for expanding creativity and developing abstract thinking. </p>

<p><b>3. VR could be a "safe space" for those with emotional difficulties.</b><br>
A teen who struggles with anxiety imagines that VR could be a "safe space" in the classroom for those with mental or emotional health challenges who need to disengage or decompress. </p>

<p><b>4. VR could be . . . anything!</b><br>
There is a sense amongst those interviewed that VR has already had a profound effect on them. It’s not often that technology leaves us in a state of wonder and awe. </p>

<p> What do you think about the responses of these high schoolers? What other learning possibilities might virtual reality hold? Share your thoughts about <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/32666/">this Vialogue</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@03:56 Brad Fry:</b> I'm glad that these teens had such a positive experience with VR. I have to say, I'm not really a believer. Having tried it several times and seen it in demos, I don't envision it really catching on or having wide applications outside of the video game community or techy nerds. It's Google Glasses all over again!</p>

<p><b>@01:52 saraehardman:</b> People remember and learn more when they experience and do things rather than just see or read them. I think that's what VR offers for education. Like these students say, it can immerse users into a different world, and they'll remember that scenario like they would an experience in real life.
