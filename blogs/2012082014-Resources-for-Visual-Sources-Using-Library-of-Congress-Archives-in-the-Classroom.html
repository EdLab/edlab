<p style="text-align: left"><strong>NAVIGATING THE COLLECTIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The LoC American Memory collections offer browsing and keyword search options. For a detailed overview of how to navigate through the collections, see the Loc American Memory <a title="LoC search tips" href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/help/search_help.html">search tips</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are some other helpful tips for navigating the collections:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The collections are organized by <em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em>. These subject headings are a controlled vocabulary of subject matter maintained by the Library of Congress and used in essentially every library in the U.S. and many abroad. They enable standardized, consistent, and easier description and access to materials within and across collections and institutions. However, they are not always intuitive (e.g. they use "motion pictures" for films and "Middle West" for the Midwest). If you're not interested in browsing patiently through subject headings, your best bet is to search by keywords. If you're curious to know more, check out the resources below:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a title="LoC Subject Heading Guide" href="http://home.olemiss.edu/~tharry/SH/lcshguide.pdf">Guide to Library of Congress Subject Headings</a></li>
	<li><a title="LC subject headings" href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html">Search for subject headings</a></li>
</ul>
<em>Boolean searching </em>(connecting search terms with "and," "or," or "not") <em>does not function</em> in the keyword search option. Instead, these common words are ignored.

<em>Do not use </em>quotation marks,  asterisks (*), or letters with accents and other non-English letters when searching collections.
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>HIDDEN GEMS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Special Presentations</strong> can be found about halfway down the collection's homepage. These condensed pockets of information highlight each collections' main themes and could be worked into lessons in a multitude of ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">When you click on a resource of interest, don't miss out on the <strong>summary</strong>, usually listed about halfway down the resource's page. The summary functions like a small encyclopedia entry on the author or subject of the resource and often offers one or two bibliographic sources for further consultation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you are searching through a photograph collection, use the <strong>gallery view</strong> to make browsing easier. Check out <a title="Fred Hulstrand History in Pictures: Women" href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/f?ngp:0:./temp/~ammem_g2g4:">this example from the Fred Hulstrand History in Pictures Collection</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, be aware that you may come across <strong>different websites</strong> holding the same collections. For example, the Documenting the American South collection is held at the University of North Carolina (UNC), and many of the LoC links will take you to the UNC site.</p>

<h3>Classroom Materials at the Library of Congress</h3>
The Library of Congress has developed a site specifically designed for teachers and devoted to classroom materials: <a title="Library of Congress Teachers" href="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/">The Library of Congress Teachers site</a>.

This site offers a wealth of resources for teachers including ready-made lessons plans, presentations, activities, and primary resources grouped by theme. Here are links to a few useful features:
<ol>
	<li>See the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/usingprimarysources/">guide to using primary source material in the classroom</a>.</li>
	<li>Use their search to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/standards/index.php">find curriculum materials by state, grade, and subject</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/">Browse classroom materials by topic, era, or in alphabetical order</a>.</li>
	<li>Check out the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/professionaldevelopment/">professional development resources</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.loc.gov/teachers/tps/regional/">Get a grant</a> to help support the use of primary resources in your classroom.</li>

<h3>Using the Library of Congress Digital Archives Creatively</h3>
<a href="http://www.tejucole.com/">Teju Cole</a>, author of OPEN CITY, has been using the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Library of Congress Historical Newspaper Collection</a> to create <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/04/09/150068298/simple-tweets-of-fate-teju-coles-condensed-news">daily tweets reflecting accounts of murder</a> and mayhem from exactly one hundred years ago. He collects these "news of the weird" tidbits on his <a href="https://twitter.com/tejucole">Twitter feed</a>.

PS: Cole's book is available from Butler stacks: <em><span style="color: #000000">PR9387.9.C67 O64 2011</span></em>

<h3>Other Digital Collections</h3>
There are numerous digital archives that you can visit online, many  of which also offer teaching aids to help educators use their archive  materials in your classroom. Whether you use their existing educational  models or not, you can certainly generate ideas from their lesson plans,  or simply develop your own using these fantastic digital archives.

<strong>AN IN-DEPTH APPROACH TO TWO DIGITAL ARCHIVES</strong>

<strong>National Archives (NARA) :</strong>

The National Archives are quite simply “the nation’s record keeper.” They famously hold documents such as the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence. (Those major documents are held at the DC branch—the MD office holds 2 million cubic feet of materials!) They also hold military records, immigration records, land records, the US census data, genealogical data, and more. The digital collections are a way for users around the country to access their materials from the comfort of the classroom.

<a href="http://docsteach.org/"><strong>DocsTeach</strong></a> is a new software developed by NARA specifically to assist social studies teachers in using these collections in their classroom. There are three ways to use this software:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://docsteach.org/documents">Explore their vast ready-made collections</a> developed around time periods in our nation’s history and develop a plan on the fly or create a plan ahead of time in your own style.</li>
	<li><a href="http://docsteach.org/activities">Use their ready-made lesson plans</a> created around the above-mentioned collections. Within each collection there are a series of different lesson plan approaches, all developed by NARA.</li>
	<li><a href="http://docsteach.org/tools">Use their software</a> to place images you’ve stored in folders into their lesson-plan templates. There are a variety of template styles for you to choose from. You need to set up an account with them to use this option.</li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<strong><a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/education/teachers/curriculum-library">THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY CURRICULUM LIBRARY</a>:</strong>

What’s here: in an effort to “make history come alive” the NYHS offers curriculum related kits to help teachers use their digital collections in the classroom.  Staged as a series of exhibits, their lesson plans align with the New York State Learning Standards.

<strong>New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War</strong>

Covers the contentious divide in NYS over slavery and the Civil War through images, documents, maps, letters, and text, with accompanying lesson plans designed using their materials. They provide an overall <a href="http://nydivided.org/Education/">lesson plan by PDF</a>, as well as lessons by unit.

<strong>For a structured approach:</strong> The exhibit is broken down in multiple ways, including sections on <a href="http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/">Pro-South NY</a>, <a href="http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T2/">Fighting Slavery</a>, and <a href="http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T3/">Civil War</a>. These are structured narratives already put together by the NYH for you to share with your students.

<strong>For a less structured approach</strong>, they also break up the materials by <a href="http://nydivided.org/popup/People/BlackSoldiers.php">people</a>, <a href="http://nydivided.org/popup/Places/ATStewartStore.php">places</a>, and <a href="http://nydivided.org/popup/Documents/AlbionBroadside.php">documents</a>, which each contain images and accompanying texts.

<strong>In their own words</strong>: "This is not the American history that our grandparents learned in school. Exciting new discoveries and new questions asked by recent generations of scholars have upended our understanding of the national past, including that of New York City and State," says James O. Horton, the chief historian of the exhibition.

<strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>

<strong> </strong>

This is both an exhibition and a database of original documents (digitized, of course). This exhibition is an excellent example of a non-linear learning platform, where students can learn by seeing visual accompaniments to textual historical notes, but because the site guides its viewers through history through components one can click at will and in any order, it offers a model for a non-textbook approach for students who have trouble learning linearly.

The exhibit includes various approaches to understanding Hamilton:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/virtualtour/good.html">A virtual tour with audio clips</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/nyc_and_nj.html">Virtual maps</a> guiding users through key historical moments in NY and NJ</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/letters/07_02.html">A calendar of facts</a> (which would make it easy to tweet history aka Teju Cole)</li>
	<li>Four <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/document_viewer/start.html">pivotal documents</a> with handy transcriptions</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/timeline/index.html">timeline</a> of his vast and intriguing life</li>
	<li>A way to understand him in the <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/gallery/index.html">context of his peers</a></li>
</ul>
There’s also a <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/database/index.html">document database</a> if you are looking for something specific and want to do a search. However, another way of approaching this collection is to scour through the entire contents, <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/about/contents.html">HERE</a>.

And if all of this isn’t a tidy enough package, they have put together pdf documents with lesson plans specifically for <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/about/teachers.html">teachers using this collection.</a>

<h3>Visiting an Archive in Person</h3>
You may also be  interested in visiting an archive in person for personal research or as a field trip with your students. If you already know of an archive you'd like to visit, go ahead and contact them directly to set up a visit. Be aware, however, that archives' policies vary concerning visitors and access to certain collections.
<ul>
	<li>See these <a title="Tips on Using Archives" href="http://www2.archivists.org/usingarchives">tips on using archives</a> from the Society of American Archivists. [<a title="Using Archives from Society of American Archivists" href="http://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/UsingArchivesFinal.pdf">PDF</a>]</li>
</ul>
There are several options for locating where a collection of interest to you might be held.
<ol>
	<li>Look at bibliographies or lists of references in work relevant to your research or interests.</li>
	<li>Ask librarians or archivists working in your area where local archives are held.</li>
	<li>Search online for specific people, places, or topics.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li><a title="Worldcat" href="http://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a> (short for "world catalog") is the world's largest network of library content. It aggregates information about collections from thousands of libraries across the globe. To search specifically for archival materials, do an advanced search and choose "archival materials" as the format.</li>
	<li><a title="ArchiveGrid" href="http://www.archivegrid.org/web/index.jsp">ArchiveGrid</a> is run by the same organization that runs Worldcat and extracts descriptions of archival materials from the Worldcat and elsewhere on the web. Its search allows you to search not only for collection titles and descriptors, but also for individual items within a collection.</li>
	<li><a title="Archive Finder" href="http://archives.chadwyck.com/home.do">ArchiveFinder</a> covers thousands of archives in the U.S. and U.K.</li>
	<li><a title="Archives Wiki" href="http://archiveswiki.historians.org/index.php/Main_Page">ArchivesWiki</a> is run by the American Historical Association and thus has a strong focus on American history.</li>
