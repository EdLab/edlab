<p>Virtual reality has recently garnered press as the <i><a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/11/is-virtual-reality-the-ultimate-empathy-machine/">ultimate empathy machine</a></i>, but it is far from the only technology that may build this desirable quality. Relying on storytelling and character portraying, video games can also be great tools in this area. In fact, <a href="http://www.weareminority.com">Minority Media</a> has created an entirely new genre of video games called <i>empathy games</i> to help generate social change for the better.</p>

<p>Minority Media creates videos where players must deal with real human issues, such as bullying, alcoholism, and depression. "Weâ€™re trying to put people in a different mindset," says Ernest Webb, co-founder of Minority Media. By putting people in the shoes of others who are afflicted with struggles, Minority Media believes it can improve their ability to empathize and ultimately make the world a more kind and just place. The organization has even taken their games into educational settings, constructing curriculum-based empathy games for first graders.</p>

<p>Do you think that empathy can be improved by playing video games? Who do you think would benefit from playing games like this, and is there a particular stage of life where it would be most effective? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/37166/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:45 RuthS:</b> I think that any story that portrays people different from the reader/player/viewer is bound to make a person more empathetic, if only because empathy seems so tied to awareness. That said, I don't know if video games do this better than, say, books.</p>

<p><b>@00:45 dinosossi2:</b> I think developing empathy depends on a number of factors. The reality of the game, its interactivity, and the player's good will to respond in a human way to the game.</p>
