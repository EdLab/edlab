From the Publisher:

Exclusion and miseducation of black children is endemic in the US and UK. This book takes a long, hard look at the two countries and uncovers what they can learn from each other in their approaches to tackling this problem. The material in the book is the result of extensive work with educators, researchers and scholars working in the area of education and disaffection in the US and the UK.
Richard Majors and his contributors are at the vanguard of research into this topic and this book is one of the most important titles published on the education of black children in recent times.
Gathering together the issues and looking at real-world approaches, this book does not simply advance the debate: it tables some serious solutions to serious problems.
This is a ground-breaking book based on cutting-edge research from writers and experts recognised the world over for their expertise. People will take note of what this book has to say.
