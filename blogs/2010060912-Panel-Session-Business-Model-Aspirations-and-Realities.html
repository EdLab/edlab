            Panelists:
John Corshen - Going On
Alex Finkelstein - Spark Capital
Bill Hughes - Pearson
John Katzman - 2Tor
Jeff Shelstad - Flat World Knowledge
Adam Newman (moderator) - Berkery Noyes. 

Newman: What enables businesses in ed space to be successful and what hinders them?

Shelstad: Faculty is important.

Hughes: Channel is being disrupted in education .. reemphasizes the importance of faculty adoption. Also points to some findings showing that student choice is often driven by price, rather than primarily quality. 

Finkelstein: Need to build differentiated product that is hard to build and has very differentiated distribution channels. 

Corshen: next 'learning management systems' ... connect students under new social models. Online learning is also a big opportunity. 

Katzeman: Universities are very well established brands, but they are trying to figure out how to create a powerful online presence. Big part of university experience is the interaction between students. 

Newman: What types of revenue models are appropriate for your business and for education sector?

Katzeman: we charge because it allows us to have higher margins for profit and allows us to provide high quality. It isn't an issue because the alternative (M.Ed in education) costs $40K these days. Economics of online education programs are much better than on-campus - many more opportunities to scale. 

Corshen: Academic institutions are struggling with 'how to tame social web' ... how to we leverage this technology, but in a controlled way that fits the instructional model of the institution. 

Hughes: Ed is a $1 trillion market, why are we talking about "free" education? Free is a marketing tool to attract people who otherwise wouldn't have used your product and gotten value from it. People are already paying a lot for ed, so free may not be the ideal solution in all cases. 


Newman: generating revenue vs. satisfying customers .... when building or evaluating business, how are the panelists thinking about outcomes both in terms of revenue and educational. 

Corshen: better ways of measuring learning by following social interactions and behavior online. 

Finkelstein: Many people still skeptical about online learning and a lot of work remains in proving whether a particular online program improves outcomes. 

Hughes: Find opportunities to help students in the "gaps" where they are not being helped. 

Question: how many years before some of these educational innovations (especially software) become commodities and become less attractive for investment. 

Katzeman: Universities get value not from their platform, but from faculty, students and certification.

Corshen: Need to build on open source rather than proprietary platforms. Open source not free, though ... lot of investment in how to architect and customize open source technology environment. Platforms: both software and services. Software needs to allow people to spawn organic communities.
