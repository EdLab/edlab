A lot of the current discourse around global education focuses on improving student outcomes in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects. The STEM subjects are seen as the best way to prepare students for the knowledge based economy that eventually awaits them. However, there is also a need to prepare students for life as global citizens. It is within this spirit that the British government launched the <a href="https://schoolsonline.britishcouncil.org/programmes-and-funding/linking-programmes-worldwide/connecting-classrooms">Connecting Classrooms</a> initiative. The initiative provides opportunities for schools in the UK to form partnerships with schools in other countries. <p>

The intent is for educators and students in the UK to share ideas around pedagogy and build cultural understanding with their peers in other countries. In the video, we witness one such example as a primary school teacher from the UK visits a school in Nigeria. For students, one of the goals of the initiative is to prepare them with the skills for life in a globalized world. For educators, Connecting Classrooms provides opportunities to teach about global issues while working to improve their teaching. <p>

Is the Connecting Classrooms initiative a good way to prepare students for lives as global citizens? Can it be replicated in other countries? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16407">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>


<b>00:46 MrNantwi:</b> Lagos is Nigeria's cultural and commercial hub. As home to Africa's largest population, what are some ways that educators and students from the UK can help their Nigerian counterparts?<p>

<b>01:19 AbdulMalik:</b> Creating an atmosphere for young children to share ideas regardless of their differences is a very helpful initiative.<p>

<b>02:35 woenjaekim:</b> What a great teaching program that simultaneously benefits the teacher as well as raises awareness about our current world.<p>
