<p>Education technology can be an incredibly useful tool for facilitating learning in the classroom. Like any tool, however, its value depends on how it is used. Teachers are responsible for taking these technologies and using them to create positive learning outcomes; thus, how a teacher views any new technology is a critical factor in determining its effectiveness. </p>
 
<p>To gain further insight into this, researchers investigated student teacher perceptions of interactive whiteboards in the classroom. Specifically, they performed a qualitative study of student teachers in primary schools in La Serena, Chile during their teaching practica. The analysis consisted of interviews, focus groups, and in-class observations, which were coded and analyzed for common themes.  </p>
 
<p>From this analysis, the researchers found that student teachers’ perceptions were mixed. Many expressed hesitancy around using this technology and weren’t disciplined about integrating it into their lesson plans. At the same time, many saw how using it increased engagement and participation of their pupils, especially when their class got a chance to interact directly with the whiteboard. They found it was most effective when used at a few specific, well-planned times during a 90 minute class. Based on this study, researchers recommend that student teachers receive more robust training on integrating technology into school curriculum.</p>

<p>This study reinforces the critical role played by teachers in successfully introducing new technology into the classroom. It also emphasizes the need for proper training to give teachers more confidence and skill in these areas.  </p>
