<p>Energy has and continues to be one of the major problems affecting every facet of life in developing nations. Power outages and lack of access to electricity is a daily aspect of life. For teachers and students, this is especially problematic. Without access to electricity, many schools cannot run after school programs and students are prevented from completing homework or studying at home. This problem is especially troubling in rural areas where lack of basic infrastructure makes it extremely difficult for teachers and students in and out of the classroom.</p>

<p>For teachers, students, and their families in Abuja, Nigeria the solution to their energy issues comes in the form of an everyday object: a soccer ball. Soccerâ€™s global popularity means that soccer balls can be found in almost every corner of the globe. Since soccer balls are common and their movement, especially during play, produces kinetic energy, students and residents can use them as sources of electricity or alternative energy. They can power lamps to provide students with the light to study and complete assignments. </p>

<p>What other everyday objects might be used as a source of energy? Should governments invest more in objects that produce kinetic energy to provide electricity for students and their families? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18378">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>01:04 Nantwi: </b>In addition to a lack of resources from schools and families, many students in developing countries encounter a host of other problems such as getting to school and safe places to study. </p>

<p><b>02:32 AbdulMalik: </b>This discovery is very intriguing in the sense that, the inventor combined a scientific approach with a popular object to bring a much needed resource to people in the community.</p>
