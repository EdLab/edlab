            Most student athletes build strong relationships with their coaches. Student athletes seek all sorts of advice from their respective coaches. In contrast, most athletes tend to have a very hard time keeping up with the requirements of their coaches, and that usually leads to misunderstanding between athlete and coach. This <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/schooled_in_sports/2012/10/could_forcing_students_to_run_laps_be_construed_as_corporal_punishment.html">article</a> talks about an incident involving a player and coach when the former felt the latter was unfairly treating him. 

After a post on Twitter by the athlete, the coach felt that particular tweet was very disrespectful and inappropriate according to the team's code of conduct. As a result, the student was made to run for an hour without a water break. He was also had to do sprints and more excessive drills. The assistant coach of the team also said that if the athlete was not able to complete his extra drills, there was no way he would be able to play for the team. The National Association for Sport and Physical Education has declared that it is "inappropriate" for sports to be used as a means of punishment of any kind.

Personally, I feel this is totally wrong. The concept of punishment for athletes should be based on what they do at practice and during games. Coaches should not interfere with the private life of athletes. Punishment could be in a different form. A coach could either refuse to start a player as a form of punishment or suspend a player from practicing with the team. Corporal punishment to some extent will not help build a good relationship between athletes and their coaches.
