            Recruiting athletes for college teams is a very tedious but beneficial process for many colleges. Colleges try to recruit players for their sports programs from mostly youth and high school teams. This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/sports/committing-to-play-for-a-college-then-starting-9th-grade.html?_r=0">article</a> highlights the story of a young female soccer player who went through the recruiting process. Prior to the start of her high school career, Haley was been treated as though she was waiting to start her first year in college. She received a lot of letters from several colleges who were interested in recruiting her for college. 

It might be against the rules of the NCAA to recruit players at the ages 13-14, but most schools still recruit middle schoolers who have potentials of playing sports in college. For this young female athlete, it was a great experience to have all these offers even before she kicked a ball in high school. However, there is the concern of whether she was ready to make any commitment to a single college while she was just about to begin her first year of high school.
