<blockquote>
<b>@2:18 Carla:</b> Does the $99 developer's fee discourage potential app creators, especially kids?
<p>
<b>@3:18 MartinPaper:</b>Do students in Thomas's app club have the chance to create the apps that teachers say they need (if they are not available already on the App Store)? That would be an amazing learning/teaching opp for all involved
<p>
<b>@4:26 Lola:</b> Wants to find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.... will Thomas become the Doogie Howser of MOOC instructors?

Remember this name: Thomas Suarez. He might only be 12 years old, but while his peers are getting picked up from soccer practice, he’s founding companies and giving TED Talks.<p>

Thomas is the <a href="http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/youngest/youngest_App_developer_Thomas_Suarez_sets_world_record_112585.html">world’s youngest iPhone app developer</a>, having had two apps in Apple’s App Store: Earth Fortune (no longer available), in which a picture of the earth changes color in response to your predicted fortune, and the more successful <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bustin-jieber/id404956571?mt=8">Bustin Jieber</a>, a whack-a-mole game that allows users to knock Justin Bieber around. Perhaps most astonishing of all is that Thomas is a self-taught programmer. When he was just 9 years old, he downloaded the iOS Developer Toolkit and rolled up his sleeves to learn Python, Java, and C. <p>

The ambitious adolescent even started an app club at his school to encourage other kids to try their hands at programming and creating apps (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club">remind you of anyone?</a>) Thomas recognized the fact that a lot of kids want to develop their own games, but aren’t sure where--or how--to start; they had no means of learning this at school, at least, not before the app club. <p>

"These days students know a <i>little</i> bit more than teachers [when it comes to] technology," Thomas says with a mischievous grin. He goes on, "So, this is a resource for teachers, and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it." <p>

Next up for Thomas: making more games and apps, moving into the Android market, and continuing to work with his app club. A true inspiration for the aspiring developers of his generation. <p>

Watch the TED Talk that’s making millions of people question whether Thomas Suarez is the second coming of Steve Jobs and leave your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2146 ">in the vialogue</a>.
