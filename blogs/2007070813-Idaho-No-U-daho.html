            “You're a social slut,” a <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/235>friend</a> of mine candidly announced the other day. Upon hearing the “S” word, I bristled and took offense — who was she calling a slut? Certainly not me?!

She stuck by her opinion — yes, I was. I flirted with everyone — guys and girls, and switched social circles like I did socks. Apparently, having friends from varying social spectrums is no small feat these days. She didn't mean a literal slut, (otherwise I would have challenged her to duel to defend my honor right then and there), but she did mean that I was … overly friendly? I didn't quite get it myself either. 

Everyone has that one friend who has the gift (or curse) of being “friendly” or “social.” You know, the one who finds himself caught up in a nasty tangle of misunderstandings and angry girls cause all of them think that he likes them, or the one that keeps on getting called out for her “flirtatious” ways when she was just trying to be nice and break the ice in social settings. We call them different names: social butterfly, social climber, flirt, social slut, and various other names and adjectives that cannot be set on print. 

She did have a point though. 

Her comment reminded me of an article that <a href=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/>Cosmopolitan</a> published several years ago. Sorry, it wasn't even an article — it was a short commentary that appeared in the back pages buried underneath ads and overwhelmed by a picture on the same page. Nonetheless, despite the short (and catty) read, I'd have to say that Cosmo called this one; we're all more or less, social sluts. 

The quip wittily remarked at how frighteningly quick it was for people to become BFF (best friends forever, duh) with one another these days. Though there were multiple reasons for this social phenomenon (24/7 internet access, cell phones, text messages, drunk cam, alcohol), the blip came to one conclusion; it's great that people are able to connect with each other so easily and readily these days, but there's a serious flaw that people needed to remember. As excitingly fun and shiny and new your new best friend may be, when shit hits the fan, <i>would they be there for you?</i>

Chances are, they're probably as fleeting as the bathroom pics you two took together at the bar last night (where you met each other for the first time, btdubs) and they're most likely <b>not</b> going to be there in your time of need. 

This doesn't mean that they're bad, fake people, or that making new friends is out of question. 

But the truth of the matter is, they don't owe you anything other than a fun night, and you probably don't feel compelled to offer your loyalty and support as well. It takes time to build a solid friendship where one can just call another at three in the morning with gossip, bad news, or out of plain stupid boredom. And I can tell you, whether you're sick to your stomach puking from food poisoning, or just having an incredibly dull day, butterfly friends just don't cut it sometimes. 

But on the bright side, if your friends suck, it shouldn't be hard for you to move on and find others who'll be twice as fun and exciting. Like they say, <i>otra cosa, mariposa!</i>
