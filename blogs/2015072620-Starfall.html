<p><a href="http://www.starfall.com/">Starfall</a> was created by Dr. Stephen Schutz in 2002. Growing up Schutz was a struggling reader. He created Starfall with the hope that it would help students feel comfortable with reading and help them discover many other subjects as well. The app is intended for pre-K through second grade students.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>There a numerous activities within the app (including reading, math, and art) and subjects are combined from different disciplines; for example, there are songs about math. A lot of the math work is interactive so users are actually seeing objects being added together versus just hearing about it or reading the text of a word problem. This is also the case with the phonics activitiesâ€”the pictures draw your attention, letters smile at you, and the stories that are based on the letter sounds are fun. The "Talking Library" is another exciting feature. Kids can choose from nonfiction, fiction or poetry books. The books are read aloud and users can follow along with the text, as it is highlighted throughout the narration.  </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>In order to access all of the content in Starfall there are subscription fees. Users might experience some lag time with the few of the activities between the user selection and the launch of the activity. This delay could cause frustration for the young users of the app.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The content is excellent for the intended age groups and can be viewed via a desktop or mobile device. The app also includes support and materials for English as a second language, homeschool, and special education students. The layout of the app is clear and the illustrations and colors used are straightforward and engaging. There are free downloads available on the website where teachers can print out worksheets, journal pages, book pages, phonics activities and award certificates that can be utilized along with the app.</p>
