<p><b>[Pros]</b> This content management system is great for amateurs and experts alike, providing a fast and easy way to publish a website. It offers a powerful set of features including the ability to easily 1) Use website templates 2) Create, delete or add to menus 3) Write, organize and display site content 4) Differentiate between registered and non-registered users, allowing site member sections and 5) Utilize already-built modules/plugins. For individuals with programming experience, Joomla is open source and fully customizable.</p>

<p><b>[Cons]</b> There is a significant learning curve here, especially for novices. Joomla's backend layout and method of site organization is not very intuitive at first but must be understood in order to effectively put together something usable. Moreover, one occasionally must have some knowledge of website-server interaction basics in order to customize images and other parts of the site. Additionally, for experts, the Joomla structure may be too limiting. For novices, Joomla may offer too much, be confusing and frustrating, and customizing a template would be impossible.</p>

<p><b>[The Bottom Line]</b> All in all, Joomla provides a terrific system to create and manage a content-driven website, even if at first trying to understand it could get slightly complicated.</p>



<p><b>Recommended Uses:</b> Teachers, students and business professionals who want a website to share and communicate information.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger">Full Review</p>
    
<p>Before Joomla, creating a unique, professional website has always been difficult for people not knowing code and time consuming for people that do. Now, putting one together is much more practical for the average person and much less time consuming for the advanced professional.</p>

<p>Although other content management systems exist, in addition to quick website creation software, no software makes site construction, customization and management as easy as Joomla does. Furthermore, Joomla is one of the only systems that both novice and pro users love, offering quick site construction via its backend system, as well as total access and customization to code files.</p>

<p><b><u>Usability</u></b></p>

<p>Before starting to use Joomla, you must first install it onto your web server. This can be somewhat of an arduous task for novices. Many hosting providers, however, feature a 1-click easy install of Joomla. You also must create a backend mySQL database for Joomla to use. Most hosting providers have an easy database creation button to assist you. Once installed on your server, Joomla's setup wizard will walk you through the rest of the setup process. This entire process usually takes about 3-5 minutes.</p>

<p>After installation completes, you can then begin creating and customizing your site. If you are a novice, you must begin by selecting a Joomla template online. Many simple ones are free while premium ones are more costly. If you are a pro, you can create your template from scratch. Once you have your template, uploading it through Joomla is simple — you go to ExtentionsInstall/Uninstall and upload and install your template. After, you must navigate to ExtentionsTemplate Manager and make your newly uploaded template the default.  All in all, the process is fairly quick and painless.</p>

<p>When your template is in place, you may find yourself having some trouble with what to do next. Although Joomla offers different levels of content organization — called Sections, Categories and Articles — and offers the ability to add components, modules, and plugins to your site, determining how each works and connects with the site is a hassle at first. Fortunately, after you understand how each part works and what each is for, the rest of the building process becomes easy.</p>

<p>Joomla's backend interface is easy to navigate, consisting of a navigation bar on top and large navigation buttons on its front page. It is also not difficult to manage users, email your users, or set permissions for specific users.  Adding content via the backend is also a simple process, requiring you to go to the Article Manager, click the New button, choose a section and category for the article, and type the article into the text editor.</p>

<p>If you want to make any specific changes to articles, or decide what should be displayed as part of your article (i.e. email link, PDF export, author, etc), you can use the convenient side control panel beside your article text editor.</p>

<p><b><u>Features:</u></b></p>

<p>Joomla offers a variety of features, all necessary in creating your site. Main features include as follows:</p>

<p><b>Templates:</b> You can use a pre-made Joomla template and customize it, or you can create one from scratch!</p>



<p><b>Modules:</b> Joomla lets you use already created modules to display content of all sorts. You can use video modules, news modules, simple text modules, social media modules, etc. And, you can place these modules in different positions on your site and choose on which pages to display them.</p>

<p><b>Plugins:</b> These allow you to add additional functionality to the Joomla framework such as allowing users to log in with their Gmail accounts, or allowing photos to be displayed a particular way.</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> These allow you to quickly and easily store and modify data in Joomla's mySQL database. Examples of these include contacts, polls, directories of all sorts, product catalogues, etc.</p>

<p><b>Content Management:</b> Keeping track and organizing your content is Joomla's specialty. You can create sections and categories (i.e. Section: Technology Category: Computers) and associate your articles with them. You can then choose which sections/categories/articles to display on which page(s) of the site.</p>

<p><b>Menu Management:</b> Making site menus is so easy. After creating a new, empty menu, you can then link each menu item to a particular section, category or article, or you can link to a component. Once the menu is complete, you only need to add a menu module to your site to display it. </p>

<p><b>User Management:</b> You can create new users, delete users, change permissions and send mass emails to everyone.</p>

<p><b><u>Innovation:</u></b></p>

<p>Although other content management systems exist, such as Drupal and Mambo, Joomla maintains its market share due to its powerful features and easy user interface. Most novices stay away from Drupal, as it gets very complicated technically, and Mambo — being the first popular content management system — is now dated. Combining power and easy-of-use was certainly a win for Joomla and for its users.</p>

<p><b><u>Value:</u></b></p>

<p>Oh yes, you did hear open source! No cost is associated with Joomla — it is free for all to use and develop.</p>

<p>In addition, it offers either a fairly quick and easy way to build a website, or a way to manage content on a custom site.</p>

<p>If you are a novice, you will love Joomla's simplicity and power, allowing you to build a professional-looking site in a few days laid out exactly as you want.</p>

<p>If you are a pro, you can build a custom side and include the Joomla framework to allow clients to easily management it once you hand if off. Or, you could use Joomla to expedite your building process.</p>

<p>This timesaving, powerful, free tool definitely has a lot to offer.</p>

<p><b><u>Conclusion:</u></b></p>

<p>Joomla knows people want top-notch, customized websites that are easy to build and manage, and has succeeded in making that happen. Being a system that novices and pro find value in, though perhaps in different ways, Joomla comes highly recommended for everyone that wants to create a content-based website.</p>
