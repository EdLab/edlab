<p><i>"BuildOn's mission is to break the cycle of poverty, illiteracy and low expectations through service and education. Students are creating lasting change in their lives, their communities and their world. BuildOn's service learning programs run in 62 high schools in seven U.S. regions, encouraging students in challenging urban areas to lift up their communities through intensive local service."</i> (from <a href="http://www.buildon.org/">buildOn</a> site)</p>

<p>BuildOn is the brainchild of Jim Ziolkowski, an activist dedicated to breaking the cycle of poverty and increasing literacy throughout the United States and the world. After travelling to impoverished countries like Malawi and Nepal, Ziolkowski recognized the incredible power of education to inspire hope and endeavored to create an organization focused on inspiring change in the minds' of young people. Globally, buildOn has constructed over 700 schools in some of the world's poorest countries, with a new school erected every 3 days. On U.S. soil, service-learning programs exist in some of the nation's toughest cities, helping students improve their academic engagement, self worth, empathy, leadership, and teamwork. buildOn leverages the power of technology to reach hundreds of thousands of people everyday, using social media to help raise awareness and funds to further the organization's dreams and goals for an educated world.</p>

<p><b> Creating Global Leaders, One Community at a Time</b><br>
BuildOn operates in 62 high schools in seven urban areas across the United States. Together, these students have completed over 1 million hours in community service, advocacy, and neighborhood projects. Through buildOn, students discover a world in which their actions produce real-time change. Supportive mentors work with underprivileged youth to guide, challenge, and encourage creative exploration and unrestricted forward thinking. On a global scale, buildOn's international programs focus on bringing education to struggling rural communities in countries around the world, building schools and creating partnerships to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn. Hundreds of thousands of students have benefited from buildOn's international efforts, effectively moving one step closer to ending the education crisis. Those interested in supporting this organization's mission can sign up to start raising funds for students in domestic programs and abroad. Through social media, word-of-mouth, and meaningful relationships, buildOn endeavors to raise awareness on, and effectively end, poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations.</p>
