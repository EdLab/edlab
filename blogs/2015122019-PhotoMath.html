<p>There’s probably no better way to silence a classroom than shouting "Who wants to solve equations?" <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photomath/id919087726?mt=8">PhotoMath</a> may have changed that. This app combines the image capturing functionality of your phone with the computational power of a calculator. Just point your camera at a mathematical expression and, bingo, PhotoMath will provide the answer.    </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>PhotoMath is the real deal. This app handles nearly any mathematical problem. It supports arithmetic, decimals, equation systems, fractions, linear equations and even several more advanced mathematical functions like logarithms. In sum, it can solve pretty much anything the young mathematician can think of or, more probably, what is assigned for homework. </p>

<p>PhotoMath doesn’t just solve a problem, it goes that extra step for understanding how to arrive at the answer. It provides a detailed explanation that goes step-by-step from the original equation to the solution. Helicopter parents can confirm their child's progress with the snap of their smartphone instead of aimlessly hovering over their stressed little one, suspended in mid-flight.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The current iteration of PhotoMath works exclusively on typewritten text. If you wrote down a collection of equations from the blackboard into your little spiral notebook, sadly, you are out of luck. You’ll have to type those infernal handwritten equations. However, as a saving grace, you can substitute a screen if you don’t have paper. If your device’s screen resolution is good, and the display is of good quality, PhotoMath can still work its mathematical magic. Just type the equation into your laptop, point your phone at the screen, and you are good to go—equation captured, solved, with steps provided. </p>

<p>By far, the worst potential aspect of PhotoMath is its very existence. Left in responsible hands, with students who want to learn, PhotoMath could be an absolute godsend. No need to bother mom or dad with a difficult problem they may not be able to answer—you can work through the problem on your own, getting the help you need at just the right moment. However, for a student who is averse to math, or has attention problems that make it difficult to wrestle with equations for the requisite length of time to really learn mathematics, PhotoMath could circumvent this entire critical process of perseverance and discovery. Consider yourself warned. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>PhotoMath is a fabulous app that will only get better. The developers actively solicit equations that their app presently can’t solve, promising that its problem-solving abilities will expand. Also, as character recognition improves, PhotoMath should eventually be able to solve handwritten equations, broadening its impact, and simplifying its application. For students who might skip steps and miss out on the hard work necessary to learn math, PhotoMath could mark the beginning of the end of a hallmark of math—working through homework problems as an essential method of developing true mathematical comprehension. However, for students with a sense of discipline and hard work, PhotoMath will help them become independent mathematicians—pint-sized Descartes of their bedrooms. I think I have PhotoMath, therefore I am able to solve any equation. </p>
