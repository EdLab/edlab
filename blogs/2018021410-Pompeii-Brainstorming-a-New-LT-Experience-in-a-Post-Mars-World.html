            <p class="p1"><span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width:initial;">As SpaceX blasts off a car into space, headed toward Mars, the curtain begins to close on the “Out of this World” Mars experience in the Learning Theater. This March we are projected to send the final groups of colonists out to redder pastures. So it’s time to start thinking about what the next big edu-taining experience for the LT space might be. I spent some time pondering the future of the space and here is a pitch for a possible way to transform the 4th floor in the coming months.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="-webkit-text-stroke-width:initial;"> </span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is time to look ahead to the future by traveling to the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><h6><span class="s1"><b>Welcome to Pompeii</b></span></h6><h6><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214104418-pompeilogo3_png_34772abaefcdf968e56ab7acc96ccfe3.png" style="width:25%;" /><span class="s1"><b><br /></b></span></h6><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guests enter the lobby to find Pompeii, circa 79AD. The space is set up much like the Basilica, in its original glory. The space was used back then as a place of business and commerce. They are given a colored rubber bracelet with a logo to wear during the experience. Visitors mingle with each other in the space. Then suddenly we hear the eruption begin and you can tell something is going on in the distance. Actors (played by EdLab staff) in the lobby area are certain it is Mt. Vesuvius.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214101406-basilica_jpg_7f2d3627a76bbe9da7362c73c85f778b.jpeg" style="width:50%;" /></p><p class="p1">(Basilica)</p><p class="p2"><span style="font-size:0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p class="p2"><span style="font-size:0.875rem;">Perhaps a black and white/vintage style video plays on the wall after the initial rumbling begins:</span><br /><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It's August 24th, 1:30pm in Pompeii. Mt. Vesuvius has just erupted about 5 miles outside of the city. We still have time to escape. But we must first grab the things that we need to take with us. We don't have much time to gather our belongings and leave. Please stick with your family/group and head off to your home or business in the square to decide on the essentials that you can pack. Welcome to Pompeii.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The head of the group, a townsperson (played by EdLab staff), leads them through the doors. The doors are opened to the main hall of the Learning Theater, where the visitors enter into Pompeii's bustling marketplace with shops (bakery, granary, spa, etc), Temple of Apollo,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and homes off to the sides. Farther off in the center is the amphitheater.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the middle we see the Arch of Tiberius.

In this game we learn about the different types of objects in the spaces, understanding what types of tools, crafts, art, language, foods etc, that the people of Pompeii used at the time. Each team learns about a different location and the objects and world in those specific places. (With different rooms and locations to discover, each experience through Pompeii in the LT will be different for the visitors)</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>END GAME 1</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Visitors exit their hubs back out into the open street/cobblestone marketplace area. All the while, Mt. Vesuvius continues to get stronger in the background. We learn that debris is hitting the northern part of the city and we must all gather in the amphitheater to pick our direction to head. It is evening time now</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>GAME2: Geography &amp; Strategy: Understanding the location of Mt.

The objects they have selected to take in the previous game will affect how much weight they have and how much time/distance they can cover based on the mode of transportation. (They will be given their options for transportation).

It is in 1748, the year the first explorers uncovered the City of Pompeii - untouched and preserved for all of these years. The back projection shows a slightly excavated city. A small video catches them up to what year it is and who they are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&quot;1700 years ago Mt. Vesuvius erupted, killing 2000 people and destroying the cities of Pompeii, Stabiae, Herculaneum and Torre Annunziata. Those who chose routes to those cities were most likely covered in debris and lava,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but those who chose the the routes to Neopolis, Surrentum and Salernum were able to reach safety.

They break off into groups of 3 based on the color or symbol on the badge/bracelet (different from previous grouping). They explore the space freely, heading to the amphitheater, the arch, the forum, etc. Each location has projections, decor and lighting that show it as city ruins. A few iPads in each location has an augmented reality app, where teams can search the space, scan over objects or visual cues and learn about real places and people from that specific location that were lost forever on that fateful day. For example in the cafe we will learn about people found in cafes in Pompeii or in similar locations of business. We will learn about objects that were found and what they were possibly used for. The Amphitheater will offer different historical information but based on what was uncovered at that location.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p2"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102017-houseofv_jpg_0c64b1bc1ee193fe868e0d5168217b22.jpeg" style="width:50%;" /><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102017-goldcoin_jpg_19a9cc03e74a91c56bbd3b87598bd5da.jpeg" style="width:50%;" /><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102017-artpreserve_jpg_aad4a80a3cd1329a708b4c54b621ac6c.jpeg" style="width:50%;" /><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102017-staircase_jpg_376a9b48752f2d08b249bbb4fbc0f890.jpeg" style="width:50%;" /><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p2"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102111-bodiesinshop_jpg_bf837111f8279066e1a9c748dba1bbc2.jpeg" style="width:50%;" /><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p2">(House of the Vetti, Coin, Art Preservation, Staircase, Bones found in shop)</p><p class="p2"><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>END GAME 3</b></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Voice over from the videos plays throughout the space, as the lights slowly dim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">&quot;Mt.

There is also a time-of-day reminder somewhere in the space, so visitors can gauge what time it is when the events are panning out. Perhaps the time of day can be indicated by lighting. Lighting can also be used to indicate how bad the air quality becomes over time, as people in Pompeii initially died from the debris and air quality, before getting covered with the massive flow covering the city. A good place to look for inspiration on this is the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. The sky changes over time indicated the changing time of day that leads to a show time when the sky darkens.</span></p><p class="p1"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102603-forumshops_png_091d11e774f32446b9742ed93115dbc0.png" style="width:50%;" /><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">(Forum Shops at Caesars Palace)</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Initial Sketches and Ideas</b></span></p><p class="p1"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102953-fullsizerender_3_jpg_3c193bdeebca647fefee39a22b9b396c.jpeg" style="width:100%;" /><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214102959-fullsizerender_4_jpg_e04a93ce03ee85bf089123f42f7fac9f.jpeg" style="width:100%;" /><b style="font-size:0.875rem;"><br /></b></p><p class="p1"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20180214110907-pompeilayout_01_png_e806dd5f680f324cbe93cfbb0c172d23.png" style="width:100%;" /><b style="font-size:0.875rem;"><br /></b></p><p class="p1"><b style="font-size:0.875rem;"><br /></b></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size:0.875rem;"><b>Sources<br /></b></span><span style="font-size:0.875rem;">https://www.britannica.com/place/Pompeii</span></p><p class="p1"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Pompeii"></a></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/fall-rise-fall-pompeii-180955732/</p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">https://www.thehistoryhub.com/amphitheater-of-pompeii-facts-pictures.htm<a href="https://www.thehistoryhub.com/amphitheater-of-pompeii-facts-pictures.htm"></a></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/85/24/48/852448a36d859cabaf7d1e68411482ff--pyroclastic-flow--august.jpg<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/85/24/48/852448a36d859cabaf7d1e68411482ff--pyroclastic-flow--august.jpg"></a></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">http://globalnation.inquirer.net/files/2014/03/mt-pinatubo.jpg<a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/files/2014/03/mt-pinatubo.jpg"></a></p><p class="p1"></p><p class="p1">http://lollieshopping.com/the-forum-shops/</p>
