          <p>
            <p dir="ltr">Yesterday,  I finished Nicole Krauss's beautiful novel <em>Great House</em>, a compactly  written, deeply poignant book that follows the lives of a handful of  characters influenced by a huge and majestic writing desk, which had  been stolen from a Jewish family's vacant house during the holocaust. <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2013/03/krauss2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18502" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2013/03/krauss2.jpg" alt="" width="92" height="140" /></a>Whenever I read Krauss's writing, I am struck with the thought: how could she so  deeply know her characters' innermost emotions? How can she know the insides--so well--of so many different people? How has she felt so  much? This novel, for instance, contains the line: "When at last I came  across the right book the feeling was violent: it blew a hole open in me  that made life more dangerous because I couldn't control what came  through it." Ahhhh! Heart explosion! And that sentiment describes pretty  well what it's like to read her own work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When  I finished the book, my Kindle told me I should read other books "like"  it. Specifically, it suggested that other people I've never met  finished this book and tended to buy Junot Diaz's <em>This is How You Lose Her</em>.<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2013/03/diaz2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18501" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2013/03/diaz2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a> This kind of advice can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophesy, and  yet: I have wanted to read that book since it came out, and it's not a  bad suggestion that I read it next. Thanks, Kindle! I originally bought  my Kindle because I appreciate the ink screen, and because I wanted to  highlight passages and add notes. In practice, the Kindle works best  when all you want to do is read, especially in a linear fashion, because  taking notes is arduous, and because something about the software makes  you feel boxed in to the text while reading it. Digital technology is  fantastic in so many ways, and I assumed those ways would translate  seamlessly into e-book reading (instantly searching passages by  keywords, or flipping ahead to chunks of the book with a touch of a  fingertip) but in practice, turning pages is way harder to do on an  ink-screen Kindle than in a paper book, where flipping pages with one's  finger takes microseconds, and where, because you can visually recognize  variations in the type on the pages themselves, the eye semi-instantly  recognizes passages of the book. Paper is amazing technology, after  all, as are fingertips. Kindle advertises that you will get lost in your  book, and this is true: many times while changing subway trains I  accidentally brushed the screen with my jacket and skipped ahead pages,  or chapters, depending on my jacket's movement, and I would return to my  reading on an unfamiliar page, with unfamiliar things going on--a  bewildering experience. And so because I recently bought an ipad mini  I've been reading my e-books there through a Kindle app, a far preferable  experience. But on an ipad I can purchase my e-books from any vendor, so  I finally have a chance to buy Junot Diaz's book from another book  seller.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It  surprised me that when I googled “Best Places to Buy E-Books” that most  bloggers recommend only the top five: Kindle, iBooks, Sony, Nook, and  Kobu. Do most people truly purchase objects non-politically? Maybe they  do! I have a perhaps old-fashioned desire to buy books from bookstores  rather than from tech companies, and so I searched instead for “Buy an  E-Book Through an Indie Bookstore” and here I found my answer. I want to  buy "indie" because it worries me that so few companies have so much  capital power, and yet, physical bookstores work for physical books  because their owners curate their selection, and because they have  physical warmth. Does an independent e-book store provide that kind of  service? I decided to find out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Independent bookstores were on the verge of striking <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/51377-google-ends-ebook-agreement-with-indies.html">an e-book deal with Google</a>,  but it fell through when Google decided to sell books through it’s own  service exclusively, instead. And so Kobu, itself an e-book reader  giant, stepped in and made a <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/kobo-to-help-independent-bookstores-sell-ebooks_b56721">deal with independent bookstores to sell Kobu e-books</a>, which strikes me as one of the more intelligent moves Kobu could have made. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/feb/21/booksellers-sue-amazon-over-ebooks">three independent bookstores are suing Amazon</a> and the Big Six book publishers over the market clampdown proprietary  e-book software has created, also an intelligent move if not an uphill  battle. What will come of the e-book industry and the publishing  industry at large? I can’t answer that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/ebooks">But I can tell you where to find independent bookstores across the US participating in e-book sales. </a></p>
<p dir="ltr">I have to go: I need to buy the new Junot Diaz book from Elliot Bay, my favorite bookstore in Seattle.</p>
