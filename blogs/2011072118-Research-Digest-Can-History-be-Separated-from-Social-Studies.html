Drawbacks and Blind Spots of a 'Disciplinary' Curriculum" Teachers College Record Volume 113 Number 11, 2011, p. - 'http://www.tcrecord.org' ID Number: 16106, Date Accessed: 7/21/2011 5:44:45 PM</a>

This article focuses on whether history education can be separated from social studies education, as many historians and history educators have preferred for a while now. At the crux of this issue is the differences held between history and social studies educators in the past two decades.

<b>Description</b>:
Professors Barton and Thornton investigate how social studies and history educators interacted with each other historically. Until the 1980s, social studies and history educators worked in tandem on curriculum development. Yet the fracturing of this coalition came when historian educators, professional historians, and other political interest groups came together to demand that history be treated as an independent discipline important in and of itself. As a result, history education ran into problems when it came to selecting content and often had to compete with social studies for classroom time and other resources. Ultimately, Thornton and Barton argue, history cannot stand alone as an educational discipline. History is so interdisciplinary that it needs to be integrated with other subjects, including economics and civics, to create a rich and meaningful curriculum and avoid competition for educational resources.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
I found this article incredibly enlightening for understanding the construction of the UFR curriculum and the need to treat social studies education with a thoroughly interdisciplinary. Part of the goal of UFR outreach should be to reconcile these differing views of education and ensure that UFR fits into both a specific subject's curriculum as well as a broader context for understanding public issues.
