            <b>Details...</b>
Nara (@xiehan) and I traveled downtown last night for @NYEdTech's newest Meetup event focused on API's at the @Knewton headquarters.  

The event was PACKED (approx. 250 ppl?) and we were forced to sit in the back... which thanks to Nara turned-out to be quite META!  Check-out the image below of Nara watching the live-streamed event on her smartphone via <a href="http://www.livestream.com/knerd">Knewton's "Knerd Cast"</a>.

<b>Takeaways...</b>
Overall, the event was interesting and the overall take-away for me was that to play a leading role in the current edtech community you need to integrate or have designs on integrating API's into your platform and development.  It was great to see the @SocraticLabs crew!  Please visit <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8921">this blog post</a> to learn more about the Startup Weekend EDU event Sharon and Heather (@heatherg) are hosting at SocraticLabs/Alley NYC this weekend!   

<b>NLT gets a NYEdTech Shout-out!</b>
<b>Most of all... a special thank you to the hosts for making a shout-out to NewLearningTimes.com at the end!!!  Thank you Adam & Sharon!</b>

But don't take my word for it.  Take illustrious <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4532">EdLab Seminar alum, Alex Sarlin's</a> (read the full EdSurge blog post <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-02-26-ny-edtech-meetup-showcases-new-apis-for-data-interoperability-and-integration">here</a>: 

<blockquote>
EdSurge friend Alex Sarlin filed the following report from the NY EdTech meetup.

NYEDTECH MEETUP: Since the Tower of Babel first came a-crumbling down, we humans have been hoping that a common language would allow us to build our dreams together. Educational technologists in particular tend to like our markup languages universal, our webs world wide and our cores common. It's easier to scale and collaborate when everybody can communicate with one another. That's why the February 26 NYEdtech Meetup focused on a new generation of educational APIs, which promise interoperability and seamless integration between LMSs, SISs, vendor applications and content libraries.

Steve Kann of Blackboard gave a history of LTI (Learning Tools Infrastructure) and a preview of LTI 2.0, an update to the most well-trodden, well-proven LMS integration tool on the market, integrating LMS's from Sakai to Canvas and beyond.

Knewton CTO Ryan Prichard hinted that Knewton's upcoming public API (described here) will allow content providers to borrow some of the company's special adaptive sauce for their own users.

Non-profit InBloom (formerly Shared Learning Collaborative) has live APIs on a GitHub portal that will allow seamless access to a huge variety of school data- performance, assessment, demographic, disciplinary, etc.- in nine pilot districts, including New York City. In the right hands, the possibilities are endless.

Anthony Cuellar showed off Pearson's content-based APIs, which encourage a developer community to access and expound upon the publisher's wide set of content libraries in creative new ways.

The TinCan API, presented by Megan Bowe, is the most idealistic, futuristic and flexible of the APIs; its grammar is specifically designed so that developers can collect, move and report types of educational data that haven't even been conceived of yet.

Dan Carroll claims that it was his own frustration as a teacher trying to integrate new technology that led to the founding of Clever, which allows schools to integrate educational vendor products with data systems (SIS's) easily and quickly. Clever's API is being used in over 3,000 schools and by more than 50 edtech vendors in its first year alone. Talk about getting up to speed.

Upon arrival you are greeted by a projected visualization of how many students are currently using their adaptive platform (35 at the time of the pic)... should we implement a similar viz at EdLab?!  If so how?  Janice... :)

Packed house!

Which is why... Nara brilliantly decided to access the "Knerd" live-stream mentioned above (felt a bit like we were looking at a virtual "periscope" - but helpful nonetheless):

"Knerd" tees on display and for sharing with guests... EdLab swag?!  Tees?

Nara... live-tweeting!
