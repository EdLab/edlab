<p>Mallory Dyer is the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.graphlock.com/">GraphLock, Inc.</a> Most recently, she was a Professor of Mathematics at Central Arizona College (CAC), where she won the 2015 National NISOD Award for Teaching Excellence. Dyer also was the Assistant Women’s Basketball Coach at CAC, where she won an NJCAA National Championship as both a player and a coach. She graduated summa cum laude from Arizona State University with a B. A. in Mathematics and received her M.A.T. in Mathematics from Northern Arizona University.</p> 

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at GraphLock?</b><br>
<p>I was very blessed to have excellent teachers growing up, and parents who really pushed us in our education. We were very involved in sports and 4-H, but our schooling always came first. Math was my favorite subject from the beginning, and I loved when my teachers would give me extra problems and logic puzzles to do in class. It was in high school when I first noticed how many of my peers struggled with math. Whether it was a self-fulfilling prophecy or a negative attitude towards the subject, they were falling behind or just wanting to "get through" the class. Once I got to college, many of the athletes were not eligible and able to compete because they were failing math. So, I found a big whiteboard and started holding tutoring sessions in the dorms, and that is when my love and passion for teaching began. After a brief stint as an actuary, I knew I was meant to be in the classroom, so I went back to CAC and became a Professor of Mathematics. My goal was to help make math more accessible to all students, so that it was not a roadblock to achieving their degrees.</p> 
 
<p>I soon noticed, however, that no matter what I did with my teaching, there was inequality in the classroom due to an expensive and outdated piece of technology: the scientific and graphing calculator. Many of my students could not afford one even though they needed the more advanced tool for college algebra. I saw them struggling, trying to do everything by hand, and getting left behind. I thought it was ridiculous in this day and age that students were still forced to purchase these expensive calculators, especially when most them already owned a smartphone.</p>
 
<p>There was one student that was the driving force behind GraphLock. She was on scholarship, very bright, and worked so hard in class. She needed to pass one more math class to receive her degree, but she could not afford this calculator. She borrowed one whenever she could, but it was never consistent, and told me she would have to drop my class. She explained that if she failed, her GPA would drop, and she would lose her scholarship. This absolutely broke my heart, and I knew it was not right that this promising student was being held back. So, with the help of my husband, I decided to solve this problem and help give students the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>
 
<p>I knew there were other calculator apps available, but these did not uphold classroom and testing standards. So, we found a way to lock down a student’s device for periods of time, so that the students can use the technology they have, to enhance their learning, while also upholding testing integrity.
 
<p><b>What has been the response from individuals who have used GraphLock?</b><br>
<p>One professor said, "students have been very impressed with how easy the app is to use and as an instructor, I am excited to be able to offer students a low-cost alternative." Last semester, we had students switch mid-semester from a handheld calculator to GraphLock because they really liked how using it was so similar to all the other apps they have. Students love using GraphLock because it is right on their phones, and they can access it at any time they want. The calculator was built in a way that students do not need data or Wi-Fi to access and use it. Then, teachers have enjoyed GraphLock for various reasons, especially when they realize it is so much more than a calculator app! Teachers have noticed a reduction in the amount of distractions in the classroom; they love that they can customize the calculator to ensure a level playing field, and that it’s a piece of technology built by a teacher for teachers. We also had many teachers say they wanted to use it at home for homework time for their kids, so we made a parent’s version of GraphLock as well!</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>One trend I would love to see have a big impact in the classroom is the use of virtual reality. So many students now are visual learners, and the number is going to continue to rise. Almost everything they do outside the classroom has some form of technological component in it, and they are used to tapping and swiping on screens. I am amazed at how even my two-year-old nephew can already maneuver around a smartphone and learns just by tapping along the screen! Could you imagine when you were first learning about the ocean and marine biology, if you were able to then put on a VR headset and actually get to see the waves and watch the animals on the ocean floor? VR could potentially enhance learning so much and give students the ability to see and experience things that they may have never known even existed. I also am really interested in seeing how online education continues to grow and improve. At first, I thought there was no way I could teach math online, and now there are so many resources to ensure you can provide a quality education in an online environment. I am excited to see how online education continues to evolve.</p>

<p><b>In addition to GraphLock, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>It’s a secret! Just kidding, besides constantly expanding our features in GraphLock, we are also looking to branch out into other school subjects. The calculator is just the beginning for us! We’re looking into utilizing our lockdown technology as a cell phone policy for schools to adopt, as well as expanding even more into assessment. I also still tutor on the side, because I really miss my students!</p>
