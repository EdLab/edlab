            <strong><a href='http://www.educause.edu/ECAR/Web20PersonalLearningEnvironme/163047' target='_blank'>Sclater, N. (2008). Web 2.0, Personal Learning Environments, and the Future of Learning Management Systems</a></strong>

<strong>Article Review</strong>

Learning Management Systems (LMS) have been widely adopted in almost every institution to host e-learning for students. LMS works well in that it supports a wide range of learning activities and the institution possesses centralized data for every student. However, LMS also has the bad reputation of being inefficient in every learning activity due to its inflexibility, non-personalizability, and lack of communication features. Therefore many students and lecturers choose to use online tools for certain learning activities instead of totally relying on LMS. It is increasing questioned whether LMS should incorporate social networking features, whether using tools other than the LMS should be allowed, and whether students should be allowed to choose whatever tools for learning.

Sclater (2008) explored the questions asked above. The author first highlights the popularity of Web 2.0 tools and explains why LMSs are often considered inferior to the rapidly emerging learning tools hosted elsewhere on the web. The author then explains the concept of Personal Learning Environment (PLE), and describes the three opinions towards implementing PLE. Particularly, the author discusses the third opinion, namely whether PLE already exists. The author points out it has been increasingly argued LMSs should no longer be developed in institutions because numerous desktop and online applications have been available with the PLE concept integrated in the design. But there are also serious limitations in entirely relying on those applications. For example, it is highly challenging to monitor and control learning activities across all applications in order to enforce access control, consistent learning outcomes, assessments, and so on. The author then proposes how he considers LMSs must evolve, which is what is going on at the Open University (OU) of England: all learning facilities are used individually with an information management system runs in the background that collects user data and optimizes the PLE for each user. Finally, the author also expresses his opinions as for setting e-learning standards, distributing LMSs, making LMSs flexible for both academic and casual use, and so on.

<strong>EdLab Connection</strong>

This article is very relevant to what EdLab has been doing. We have developed and been using a wide range of learning applications that supports formal (e.g. TC Record, Moodle, DocDel, etc.) and casual (e.g. Vialogues, Pressible, Pocket Knowledge, etc.) learning. The LMS model discussed in the article provides a good theoretical foundation for EdLab to design the <a href='http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7074'>Personal Learning Ecosystem</a> for students that incorporates all these learning tools. The Personal Learning Ecosystem is an ongoing research proposal that EdLab is working on to submit to the EDM 2012 conference.
