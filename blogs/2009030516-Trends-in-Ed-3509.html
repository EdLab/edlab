            Today's blog is brought to you by the creative thinkers of the world. And by the letter Z.  Zing!

<b>10 steps to design success</b>

Alan Chochinov, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.core77.com/">Core 77 (an industrial design mag</a>), spoke recently at <a href="http://www.compostmodern.org/">Compostmodern</a>.  He presented 10 steps to take when engaging in sustainable design.  I think the same steps can be applied to all design processes. <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/02/allan-chochinovs-10-steps-for-sustainable-design.php#ch04">Check out the article for more commentary on the steps!</a>
<blockquote>
1.	Acknowledge the privilege you have as a designer.
2.	Use the word “consequence”.
3.	Question authority.
4.	Surround yourself with the awesomest people you can.
5.	Don't play fair.
6.	Be intentionally dumb.
7.	Redistribute - then reduce, reuse, and recycle.
8.	Broaden your market.
9.	Indulge in discursive design.
10.	Talk to anyone who will listen.

<b>Meet: Saul Griffith</b>

You know who's a cool guy? Inventor, entrepreneur, and MacArthur Fellow, Saul Griffith. Never heard of him? You will.  When he was a grad student at the MIT Media Lab in 2002, he developed a machine that could custom mold prescription eyeglass frames for a few dollars each. He has since co-founded a company to produce these glasses and supplies them to countries that lack access to eye care professionals.  In fact, Griffith owns a lot of companies.  It's kind of what he does.  Instead of focusing on one subject at a time, he goes big.  "I need to be thinking about a few things at once," Griffith confesses. "I think it actually helps because you're cross-fertilizing yourself." His newest venture is to stop global warming by harnessing the energy of the  winds at 1,000-3,000 feet in the air.  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/mar2009/id2009034_875256.htm?campaign_id=rss_innovate">From the BusinessWeek article</a>, "Saul combines a scientist's notion of what's possible, with a low tolerance for conventional wisdom.” I like the way he thinks!

<b>iPhone App-a-Day</b>
I was inspired by Jess Hammer's comment yesterday at the seminar on games.  She was describing the difference between “regular” games and “educational” games and that, aside from marketing, there <i>is</i> a difference in the way ed games are both conceived and perceived.  With this in mind, I broadened my app search today to include a wider variety of options.  I came up with a “game” that is far from being put in the “educational” category, but still has potential to teach you something:
 <i> Ruben & Lullaby</i> is an interactive, graphic story game in which you choose the fate of the couple.  As they sit on a park bench, you can either shake the screen to make them angry with each other or stroke the screen to calm them down.  There is no dialogue, just sad jazz music.  Could be a good game to help sublimate some stress!
