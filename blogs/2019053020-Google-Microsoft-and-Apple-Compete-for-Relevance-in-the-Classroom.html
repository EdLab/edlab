<p>With the edtech market growing rapidly in the United States, the battle for dominance in schools is also growing. Google, Microsoft, and Apple are each trying to create the most dynamic, accessible, and effective learning devices, platforms, and programs for classrooms. Especially in K-12 spaces, all three of these companies are trying to find the best way to become the favorite of both present and future classrooms.</p> 

<p>Though Google has soared high above Microsoft and Apple in digital sales to American schools, the other two companies have been aggressively rolling out their own initiatives to get into schools. Apple has lowered the price of iPads, and Microsoft, which has built its presence in education internationally, has now developed three new programs to help it compete specifically in the United States. Despite these innovations, many parents, students, teachers, and administrators are still concerned about the ability to keep up as digital technology becomes more crucial to success but inhibiting costs create larger divides between rich and poor schools.</p>

<p>Which of these tech companies are doing the most for education? Are you convinced that they are fostering real learning with new rollouts? Share your thoughts in the ongoing conversation <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50521">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:29 Rebecca Sullivan:</b>I am skeptical about the motives of Google, Microsoft, and Apple in investing so much in edtech. Are they really interested in promoting learning, or are this race part of a marketing campaign?</p>

<p><b>@00:29 Anna Curry:</b> I agree. The primary incentive of these companies is to sell as much of their products as possible, not support student learning. It seems like schools get so caught up in providing their kids with the latest technology without investigating whether it will actually help the students. I think the key to success in implementing these tools is to get the buy-in and support of teachers, who will need to manage these tools in their class day-to-day.</p>

<p><b>@03:37 Betsy Harrington:</b> Does students liking iPads mean that they are good for learning? I am all for student engagement, but it's not the only learning goal. I worry that schools and tech companies sometimes see children as consumers more than students.</p>
