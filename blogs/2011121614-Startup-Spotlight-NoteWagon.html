<b>The Details and Back Story</b>
The co-founders of <a href="http://notewagon.com">NoteWagon</a>, Jamie Wong and Saif Altimimi, are undergoing a noble effort to address two of the most prolific problems that plague college students today: perpetual stress from class and being dirt poor.  

NoteWagon is a Canadian startup that was launched by a group of University of Waterloo students in Toronto earlier this year.  Wong and Altimimi created their social network in an attempt to “redefine college education.” With NoteWagon, students can help each other out by sharing their class notes and study guides.  There is also a Q&A forum that allows students to pose their puzzling questions in order to receive some direction from other students. 

The NoteWagon team appeared on the CBC reality show, Dragon's Den (which seems analogous to the US show, Shark Tank. By the way take note:  man-eating animal + small enclosed space = the next title for an entrepreneurial reality show. Grizzly Elevator, anyone?) 

One of the most interesting components of NoteWagon is its engaging pay model based on tokens.  

Within the NoteWagon environment, you can buy and sell your notes based on a token system.   Different kinds of notes bring in larger or smaller amounts of tokens.  For example, you can charge more for a study guide (100 tokens, or $5) than the class notes for the day (25 tokens, or ~$2). You can earn tokens by referring people to the site or you can just buy them.  NoteWagon retains 30-50% of transactions. The note-taker gets the remaining money.   

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>

NoteWagon not only moves people to use their network by offering cash for content, it also motivates them to write better notes! The sad truth is, sometimes doing well on a test isn't enough to bring out the best in students.  

NoteWagon isn't the first to propose a note sharing system among students, (see <a href="http://notehall.com">notehall.com</a> which, coincidentally, appeared on the aforementioned American reality show, Shark Tank) but it's their commitment to the improvement of education through technology that makes them stand out.  Said co-founder Saif Altimimi in a piece from <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2011/10/31/the-web-hit-that-got-away/">financialpost.com</a>, “There is a lot of potential for introducing technology and really accelerating and changing the way we learn to make it more effective,” he says. He continues, “We understood early that we weren't just building a note-sharing platform. That's not what we were passionate about. What we wanted to create was a piece of software we call the social learning network.”

<b>Takeaway</b>


I would disagree with those who say this is more like cheating than anything else. I think the fact that it is hosted on a social network and encourages students to share knowledge with their peers speaks to an element of collaborative learning that is inherent in education.  In fact, I only expect to see more such opportunities for students to work together across vast networks in the future.
