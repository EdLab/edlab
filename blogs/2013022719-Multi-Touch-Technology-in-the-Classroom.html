<p><b>Title:</b> Multi-Touch Tables and Collaborative Learning (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Steve Higgins, Emma Mercier, Liz Burd, & Andrew Joyce-Gibbons</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Large multi-touch tables, tablets, and smartboards let learners collaborate on educational tasks in a digital environment and allow multiple participants to interact with digital objects. This study, conducted through <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/">Durham University</a>, used a proprietary technology called <a href="http://tel.dur.ac.uk/synergynet/">SynergyNet</a> to produce multi-touch tables for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2236967/The-Star-Trek-style-classroom-future-replacing-blackboards-books.html">student study participants</a>. The authors of <i><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01259.x/full">Multi-Touch Tables and Collaborative Learning </a></i> focused their research on joint understanding of tasks in a collaborative exercise. They hypothesized that the technology could influence how the groups managed the problem space, how joint understanding and knowledge sharing developed, and how the groups constructed and created solutions.</p>
 
<p>The students, who were between 10 and 11-years-old, were asked to find solutions for a history problem related to an incident in a coal mine in 18th century North East England. The participants were already familiar with the location and period of history at the start of the study. Students were given an explanation of the historical event and were tasked with brainstorming the series of events that led to the incident. Students who worked on multi-touch were compared with those who collaborated using traditional paper-based tools.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors were able to observe collaborative behaviors in the multi-touch group, like joint attention, negotiating, elaborating, and higher levels of reasoning. These behaviors were quick to develop and contributed to productive collaboration in the early stages of the project. This may have been the reason that the multi-touch groups took almost 25% less time than the paper-based groups with no significant loss of engagement. The authors found that paper-based groups did not reach a higher or more complex level of reasoning than groups using multi-touch technology.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study revealed that there could be some benefit to the use of multi-touch technology in classroom group work. Current iterations of this technology are usually furniture-based, in the form of smart tables, and too expensive for many classrooms. Integration of multi-touch into more portable and affordable tablet and mobile devices may help to bring this technology and benefit to more students. Research in this field is emerging, but the results of this study suggest that group work with multi-touch surfaces could encourage more efficient collaboration.</p>
