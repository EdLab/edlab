          <p>
            Greetings from ALA! We’re all enjoying the beautiful San Francisco weather and being among our people. Here’s what I did today: 

<b>NISO/BISG 9th Annual Forum: The Changing Standards Landscape Access or Ownership: Evolving Business Models and Your Institution</b>

The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the Book Industry Study Group (BISG) co-hosted this forum which examined the standards that libraries and book publishers share. BISG is an organization that aims to horizontally and objectively represent stakeholders in the publishing industry, both companies and customers, to ensure that there’s standardization for things like ebook platforms, unique identifiers, metadata, subject codes, and distribution. For instance, one of the new things BISG has been doing is creating standards for publishers to opt in to subscription platforms like Scribd. 

The first talk was with BISG’s Nadine Vassallo and explained research that BISG has been doing into subscription models, which they consider to be the next big trend in book licensing. They identified several subscription models in use for books and other content: purchase for perpetual access, rental/short term loan, automatic PDA, all-you-can-eat (Netflix, Scribd), token (broad library of content, with limits on use eg. Audible), and freemium (WattPad). Content is not fixed in a particular model, it usually moves through “windows” of access, this is particularly apparent with digital media which usually starts its life as a one time purchase, moves through rental, and might end up in an all-you-can-eat access model after a few years. 

The second talk was by Stacey Marien, the acquisitions librarian at American University, who talked about the various patron driven ebook models in use at her library. Like us, they have a lot of different things going on in this area, but they have been experimenting with individual Amazon Kindles for reserve which is pretty interesting. We don’t do anything like this yet, but have been thinking about it as a detour around individual licensing agreements, especially for reserve and the cafe collections. 

<b>Unseated Events!</b>
I stopped by two different poster sessions in the afternoon. The first was called “Assessment in Action: Year Two Project Posters,” which showed the second year project reports from libraries that participated in an assessment workshop at a past ALA.

Most of these posters focused on assessing student learning in information literacy courses. This one on flipped information literacy was particularly interesting:

The second was the ALA Emerging Leaders project poster sessions, where I met up with the rest of the team. The poster session highlighted the progress reports that the Emerging Leaders working groups have been working on all year. 

We also stopped by a LITA (Library Information Technology Association) networking event and checked out the exhibits. All in all, a great day at ALA! 

Here’s the team, hard at work and <i>en silhouette</i>:
