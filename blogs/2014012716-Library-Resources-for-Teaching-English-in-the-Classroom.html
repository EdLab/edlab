            Over the past two decades, the number of non-native English speakers in the United States school system has more than doubled.i These demographic changes have put greater emphasis on the challenges involved in teaching English language Learners (ELLs), which range from issues in communication among teachers, students and parents, and the pace of lessons in the classroom, to the tendency to view English language instruction as a single course of study, lacking school-wide policies for application across all subject disciplines. According to the National Education Association, teachers often “lack practical, research-based information, resources, and strategies needed to teach, evaluate, and nurture ELL students, whether those students were born in this country or elsewhere.”ii

As teachers must find creative new ways to meet the academic needs of ELLs, librarians in schools, public libraries and teacher training institutions continue to play significant roles in ESL education by working closely with educators to provide supplementary materials that support the achievement of students learning English. Available through the Teachers College Library and online, the resources listed below cover a wide range of topics in English language instruction, from best practices, models and applied teaching strategies, to methods of assessment, and research into the evaluation of English-language instruction programs in the K-12 setting.
