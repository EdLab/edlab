<p>Watching a video lecture is not the same experience as watching a lecture in person, anyone can tell you that. But what are the specific characteristics that differ between the two? Researchers analyzed over 50 online courses to compile a list of six elements that make video lectures different from in-person lectures.</p>
 
<p><b>1. Cross cutting:</b> In an in-person lecture, both the student and teacher have full control over where they look. In an online lecture, however, that control is given to the video editor, meaning that students can’t naturally follow the motions or eye gaze of the instructor.</p>
 
<p><b>2. Modality alignment:</b> This refers to the instructor’s body language and gesturing that they use while presenting. In-person, these gestures might be toward a screen or whiteboard, and students can easily follow them. In a video lecture, poor editing might prevent this from happening.</p>

<p><b>3. Depth of field:</b> Video lecture designers must decide how close they want their shot to be. If the instructor is too close up, it might create an overbearing presence for the viewer. Yet if it’s too far away, the student might feel overly removed from the situation.</p>

<p><b>4. Jump cut:</b> The recordings may cut from an image of the presenter, to the whiteboard, to a PowerPoint, to text. This shifting between presenter and image might enhance the lecture if done well, but it could easily turn into a distracting back-and-forth between different images.</p>

<p><b>5. Scripting:</b> Lecturers in-person are much more likely to improvise based on the reactions or questions of the class. As this is not possible in a video lecture, the instructor may appear overly scripted. While this might help preserve the lifespan of the video, it might also make it disengaging due to this lack of spontaneous engagement.</p>

<p><b>6. Décor:</b> The decorations of an in-person lecture hall are generally minimal, but the presence of other students in the class makes it a social space. Although video lectures cannot create the same type of shared space, they generally incorporate background music or other stylistic elements to help create an appealing aura.</p>
 
<p>This list is not meant to find fault with video lectures, but rather to call attention to the fundamental differences between in-person and video lectures. These are important to realize in conjunction with the following three key features the researchers note that make lectures memorable and effective: presence, credibility, and brilliance of the instructor. To create sticky content, video designers must find a way to ensure these three elements are present in online lectures despite the six fundamental differences from in-person lectures. As online and blended education grows, this is certainly an important design challenge.</p>
