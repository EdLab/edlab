First off, thanks to the planning team that coordinated the event and helped prepare the space for our Open House! The turnout was amazing and it seemed like everybody really enjoyed themselves. As an "open house", I believe we accomplished our goal. 

As the profile of EdLab continues to grow, the quality and program of our events should grow as well. There will be higher expectations from the guests as a whole.  So, this blogpost is an opportunity for everybody to voice their opinions on how yesterday went and suggestions for other promo events. We want to experiment with new things for the future! The next one coming up: Academic Festival 2012.

<b>Some of my thoughts to help generate some inspiration for your comments:</b>

- The planning process for the event was quite short, only two days long. The open house definitely wasn't a top priority compared to our other projects, but should it have been? Should we have invested more time and effort into the planning?

- There were former clients, VCs, and potential clients who came yesterday. Could there have been more to engage them and peak their interest in EdLab even further? What could we have done to show them that they want to work with us / invest in us? 

- Did we need an official greeter at the door? Were there staff near the computers to answer people's questions at all times?  Should we have delegated "official jobs" and have people on a rotation system? 

- It would have been nice to have an official time where Gary could address the whole group and thank everybody for coming and just share a few words about EdLab. Should there have been an official program to the open house to help with the flow of the event? An MC to keep the flow of the event going? A speaker? A presentation? A surprise guest? A prize giveaway?
