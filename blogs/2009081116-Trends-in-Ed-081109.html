            <b>The Changing Climate Surrounding Novice Teachers</b> 

As someone with no professional teaching experience and only impressions of my own teachers to rely on, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080702046.html"><i>Schools Need Teachers Like Me.  I Just Can't Stay</i></a> really struck a chord with my curiosity into the attitudes of young teachers.  Sarah Fine, the article's author, taught at a DC charter school for 4 years and has now decided to leave the profession.

From her writing, Fine appears passionate and intelligent while providing a genuine description of her personal background and experience as a 10th grade teacher.  She sites two main reasons for her decision to stop teaching: (1) "burnout" and (2) "the way people, mostly nonteachers, talk about the profession".  In truth, it's a sad and disappointing story, though I think that in some (even minute) way, it's relatable.  What I'm trying to say is that readers will likely find her decision understandable.  

Fine cites that nationally, about 1/2 of all teacher leave within 5 years, and that percentage is higher for urban and charter school teachers.  She explains her challenges in engaging students and motivating their achievement, but also describes her moments of pride and satisfaction.  She also raises what I find to be the most intriguing philosophy on why she could no longer face her own disappointment with teaching and her yearn for what others tend to consider more "ambitious" professions:

<blockquote>In their book "Millennials Rising: the Next Great Generation," sociologists Neil Howe and William Strauss characterize the members of my generation as "engaged," "upbeat" and "achievement-oriented." This is why we become teachers. We seek to challenge ourselves, and we excel at pursuing our goals. Howe and Strauss go so far as to call us a "hero generation." Our engagement also explains why we are leaving the classroom. We are not used to feeling consistently defeated and systemically undervalued.</blockquote>

This post is a bit wordy; I suppose I am trying to raise a concept to ponder but want to do so with respect toward the teaching profession.  Fine's ultimate purpose (as is this post's) is to raise the need for teachers ready to hack it, highlight the strong points in their schools, and stay longer.
