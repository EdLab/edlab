            It wasn't long before there'd be an online high school. There's already classes that are taught online, and now a whole high school on the computer.
Although Formal education isn't as well as it should be, it's been around for years and it's necessary to not toy with it.
Formal school is visually learning, physical interaction, and more. An online high school is depriving kids from real life skills, which is one of the biggest problem America faces right now with how communication has been deprived because of advanced technology.
While reading the <a href=”http://www.eschoolnews.com/2016/01/04/this-online-high-school-could-change-education/”> article </a> it stated, "approved by the University of California system, Silicon Valley High’s state-accredited curriculum provides an ever-growing assortment of innovative, relevant and compelling online programs geared toward high school students, but available to learners of all ages." My only concern is, has it been tested? How do we know which kids can handle a school online, and does it actually work?
However I did agree with the U.S curriculum not being up to par. But how will incorporating full technology help?
Another flaw of this online school is, it cost money. Public/magnet schools don't need any kind of, "tuition." A change in how the U.S educated in the school simple is helpful, however an online high school is risky and pricey.
