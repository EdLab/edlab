<p><a href="http://www.fluencia.com/">Fluenica</a> is a Spanish language learning platform that was developed by the team behind <a href="http://www.spanishdict.com/">SpanishDict.com</a>. The platform offers questions to build learners’ Spanish vocabulary and help them to become more familiar with the language. The creators of the site claim that it gives individualized feedback based on user actions while completing a lesson. This type of personalization is possible through adaptive learning technology. Fluencia explains mistakes and then offers practice in the user’s areas of weakness. It also teaches users about Spanish culture and authentic language so that they can properly engage in conversations with Spanish speakers. Fluencia is accessible through the web, tablets, and smartphones. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The platform has a simple and beautiful design which makes it easy to navigate. Some humor is added to each lesson to make it more engaging. A good example of this is when Fluencia explains the subtle difference between the words <a href="http://translate.google.com/#es/en/año">año</a> and <a href="http://translate.google.com/#es/en/ano">ano</a>. The learning content also changes based on user actions, providing personalized learning. When users make mistakes, Fluencia provides similar questions to help them learn from their mistakes. Courses are grouped together by learning goals and users can complete them in any order they wish. Fluencia also provides a set of review questions each time a user signs in to refresh their memories of the previous session.</p> 
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The platform provides users with plenty of practice writing out Spanish words and phrases, though there is no support for gauging whether the learner is pronouncing the words correctly. Users can practice speaking Spanish while answering questions, but there is not a way to assess their pronunciation.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Fluencia’s personalized learning aims to provide learners with better instruction and practice. The platform's pedagogy is based on learning through repetition. The system repeats the same types of questions when users have trouble learning particular words or phrases. The best way to learn a new language is through plenty of practice. Fluencia helps facilitate this through review questions. These reminders are a great way to help learners retain a new language.</p> 

<p>Fluencia could improve by providing a functionality that assesses user pronunciation. A particularly effective possibility would be to offer simulated conversations in the platform, in which learners could only move forward in the conversation by correctly pronouncing a Spanish phrase.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Fluencia provides a personalized language learning experience. </p>
