            Hello Edlabbers!

Oh my gosh! What a Summer it has been, and how quickly it came to a close! I can't believe that I journeyed here 10 weeks ago. George said it would go by fast, and sure enough, here we are. 

I know I tried to make the most of my time in this place, including awkwardly talking to you in the bathroom, or between seminars and lunch, between floors 2 and 5 in the elevator- it was really such a darn pleasure to get to know all of you a little bit. And, still, I wish I'd had the opportunity to learn even more. You all are doing such wonderful, inspiring, quirky things in your lives. It's been so much fun taking little conversation vacations with you through the world of cheese and karaoke and the Kardashians. 

I know that I will be returning back to my very easy-going Seattle lifestyle with a greater insight into the education, technology, and library world of things. I can't wait to school my fellow colleagues on the ways of the East Coast library and education world. I learned so much here, thank you all. 

I wanted to give back to you my mostly-hidden secret talent. That is, making coffee. I happen to be a coffee wizard, and will be brewing a really great, solid batch of French press coffee for everyone on Friday. I would LOVE it if you could RSVP to this post and let me know if you are on the coffee-drinking train. If not, that's okay too! We can high-five.

 New York has a lot of work to do on their coffee game, and I finally found a cafe that does beans the way I like em (I didn't completely fail you, Jo!) and I can talk to everyone about coffee brewing at home if anyone is so interested. Otherwise let's just have a drink, as Santosh would say, as Jon Stewart would say. As it will also be Santosh's last day too, we can actually all, literally (sigh, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/22/according_to_the_dictionary_literally_now_also_means_figuratively_newscred/">though it doesn't mean literally anymore!</a>) have a drink.

Edlabbers, it's been a true pleasure. Thank you for everything.
