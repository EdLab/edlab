            Perhaps the most heartbreaking scene in <i>When the Levees Broke</i> is the funeral of five-year-old Serena Polk.  In her tiny pink coffin, Serena is laid to rest under the tearful eyes of her mother Kimberly, many months after the levees broke.  Serena, who had been living with her father on Tennessee Street in the Lower Ninth Ward, was missing for eight months, before authorities discovered the body of a young girl with a backpack.  Her mother knew it was Serena.  Serena always wore a backpack.  (If you have not yet seen this segment of the film, it appears at the end of Act III, Chapter 6, “Despair, Depression, Anxiety.")

In reality, there were hundreds of Serena Polks, innocent children lost to the floodwaters of Katrina.  In what promises to be one of the most moving commemorative events scheduled for the second anniversary of the storm, several religious and social justice organizations have teamed up to organize a series of <a href=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-10-2007/0004643650&EDATE=>"Lost Children of Katrina"</a> ceremonies August 18 and 19 in New Orleans.  

Scheduled events include the reading of the names of the children who died during and after Katrina and a tribute by surviving children to their lost classmates.  The children will be marching behind a single horse-drawn carriage bearing a child's casket.  There will also be several ecumenical worship services, addresses by such dignitaries as civil rights activist <a href =http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Young>Andrew Young</a> and New Orleans Councilwoman <a href=http://www.cynthiawillardlewis.com/>Cynthia Willard-Lewis</a> and a memorial concert by Gospel singer <a href=http://www.geocities.com/dorinda_clark_cole/>Dorinda Clark Cole</a> of the <a href=http://www.theclarksisters.com/>Clark Sisters</a>.  

“The Lost Children of Katrina” is being organized by the <a href=http://www.sdpconference.info/aboutus/>Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference</a>, a coalition of progressive African-American religious leaders, and the Greater New Orleans Clergy for Restorative Justice.

Organizers say the event is not only about the children, like Serena, who perished at the hands of Katrina, but those who survived and are still struggling.

“We must send out a clarion call to the nation and to the world to let them know that some families have not been able to bury their children,” Dr. Susan Smith, a trustee of the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference, said in a <a href=http://www.sdpconference.info/press/media-release-honoring-the.html>press release</a>.  “And some children who have survived do not have houses to live in and schools to attend.”

“We have not finished burying our children,” Councilwoman Willard-Lewis said in another <a href=http://www.sdpconference.info/press/media-advisory-honoring-2nd-anniv.html>announcement</a>.  “The nation needs to know that misery, despair and dysfunction are still alive in NOLA.  We are not yet healed or whole and our children still suffer.”
