According to <a href="http://daily.inc.com/2011/11/17/report-start-up-investment-will-wither-if-piracy-bill-passes/">this recent Inc.com article</a> this could be the case.  To piggy-back off of <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6821">this post</a> by Julia the Inc.com article makes a case that if SOPA legislation passes it will leave (not only librarians) vulnerable to additional legal action for interpretations of "fair use" law, but internet start-ups will be vulnerable as well.  What does this mean exactly?  Well, imagine you are a small agile team of developers creating a new web-based platform, you throw your site up on the nets to Beta test and wham! you are hit with a copyright infringement suit from a patent troll or content provider ... 

On the flip-side, copyright infringement and piracy is a huge issue for artists and entertainment companies.  Any time a group of people is used-to using a tool, service or structure a certain way, change is difficult.  I think an interesting analogy here would be pedestrian and automobile laws.  We put certain structures and rules in place to try to keep humans safe and moving in an efficient way, in much the same vein the internet has pathways and "road" that we have been engaging with in a certain way, to suddenly ask people to drive with someone always sitting in the backseat, does seem a bit ridiculous and unfair.  As the internet has functioned as an open plane and "frontier" correlations can also be made to the settling of the wild west or space exploration, if there were stricter rules and regulations around those events and periods in American history, would we be able to see as deeply into the cosmos as we do now?  Would pioneers not have pioneered?
