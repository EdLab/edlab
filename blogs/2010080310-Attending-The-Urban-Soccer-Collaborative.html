          <p>
            I spent all of last week attending the Urban Soccer Collaborative at Xavier University in Cincinnati. I attended the conference along with another team member from South Bronx United Soccer Club (SBU). The Urban Soccer Collaboration is an organization that focuses on "building the leaders of tomorrow." We were chosen to attend the conference by our coaches to represent SBU at the conference (we are both captains of our respective teams), which focused on enhancing leadership qualities, coaching, and building character on and off the field. The conference was attended by players from all across the country, who were also chosen due mainly to their leadership and work in their respective communities. <p>

The conference was a great experience as it afforded me a chance to interact with peers from different parts of the nation. Though we all came from different backgrounds, we were able to forge partnerships during workshops and learn from each other during the coaching sessions. I also learned how to coach six to ten year olds. The staff was amazing and made us all feel at home. <p>

One of my favorite parts of the trip was living on a college campus for a week. It was an eye opening experience as I was exposed to some of the things that inevitably await when I start college in a few years: sharing bathrooms, small rooms and living on junk food. During the final full day of the conference, I was awarded a rising star award for my work and contribution during the course of the week. <p>

I took a lot of things away from my time in Cincinnati. I came back a better leader and person having gone through numerous workshops on how to address certain situations that often arise during practices, games and life as a teenager in the inner city. Should the opportunity to attend the conference arise again, I will not hesitate to represent SBU once more though I hope some of my club mates also get a chance to attend in the future as it is a worthwhile conference.
