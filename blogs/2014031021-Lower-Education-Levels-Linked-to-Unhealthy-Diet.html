          <p>
            There are many studies that argue that a person's socioeconomic status often have an effect on other aspects of their lives such as educational outcomes, and future employment and earnings, among others. A <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131106202251.htm">recent study conducted by researchers in Germany</a>, Europe's most populous country and largest economy, found that one's education levels (often a consequence of socioeconomic status) plays in a role in their diet. The researchers studied a representative sample from a large data set of adults that sought to investigate whether there was any correlation between education level, food consumption, and physical activity. 
<p>
They found that individuals with low levels of education consumed more unhealthy foods than those with a high education level. Additionally, these individuals were also found to be more physically active and used more energy than those with high education levels. Therefore, the researchers concluded that these individuals engaged in more physical activity because they ate more fatty and unhealthy foods.  
<p>
The results of this study offer opportunities for policy makers, administrators and educators to improve health education opportunities for students. This is extremely important, as good habits tend to stay with people through to adulthood. Policy makers need to make regulations and laws ensuring that all people, regardless of their social economic background, have access to a quality education and healthier foods in their communities. School administrators and educators can create extra-curricular activities or include health as part of the school curriculum.
