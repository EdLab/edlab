            <a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112836308/gap-between-teen-materialism-and-work-ethic-grows-050213/">A new study by San Diego State University</a> looks at whether today's youth are more materialistic and less motivated than past generations or do adults tend to perceive moral weakness in the next generation. Psychology professors Jean M. Twenge and Tim Kasser reported that there is a gap for todays young adults between their desire to work hard and their materialism. Twenge stated “compared to previous generations, recent high school graduates are more likely to want lots of money and nice things, but less likely to say they're willing to work hard to earn them”. 

The researchers drew data from a national survey of 355,000 US high school students conducted from 1976-2007. It examined the materialistic values of the three generations between that time span. The survey questions focused on willingness to work hard and the importance of having lots of money and material goods.

Of the students surveyed in 2005-2007, 62 percent believed it was important to have a lot of money, while only 48 percent held the same belief in 1976-78. Also 69 percent of recent graduates think owning a home is important compared to 55 percent in the 70's. The trend reverses when it comes to work ethic: 39 percent of today's students admitted they didn't want to work hard. In the 1976-78 group, the number was only 25 percent. Data analysis revealed adolescent materialism was highest when advertising spending made up a greater percent of the US economy. The moral from this study is that teenagers are overwhelmed by their materialism that they forget to do what's right to work hard for their future. The media has also created unindustrious young adults in this generation.
