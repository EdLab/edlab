          <p>
            Several New York City <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/nyregion/100-new-york-schools-try-common-core-approach.html?_r=1">schools</a> are currently in the state of trying out a new educational curriculum standard known as the Common Core. First proposed in 2009, the common core is meant to provide a clear understanding of what students are expected to learn so that teachers and parents know what they need to do to help them. Furthermore, it is meant to better prepare students for college and future careers. It was originally brought about due to the general outcry for educational reform. Particularly, it's a response to the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">No Child Left Behind Act</a> which has been deemed widely unsuccessful, and fault-ridden by many experts. Such faults include the act's emphasizes on the use of standardized testing to evaluate student performance and academic growth. 

The NCLB mandates that a state must have EVERY student attain 100% academic proficiency by the year 2014 and along the way, show a steady yearly improvement (determined by state given standardized tests) or else risk losing federal funding. Such an ultimatum is said to be unrealistic and has actually led to many states lowering their standards as a means to offset the provision. Even with this deceptive tactic being practiced, about 80% of the nation's schools could be labeled as <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/duncan-says-82-percent-americas-schools-could-fail-under-nclb-year">failing</a> as recently stated by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Such a statistic isn't truly reflective of the number of schools that are not functioning properly. As a result, properly functioning schools are inaccurately labeled as failing which in turn hinders the federal government's ability to allocate resources to the truly dysfunctional schools. 

President Obama has openly expressed his desire to reconstruct the act and many believe that the Common Core will be at the fore front of the reform.

So far about 41 other states have agreed to introduce the common core into their standards in the near future in hopes of getting students to meet grade level requirements as well as to better prepare them for college. Several foundations have vowed to help schools adopt the core's standards such as the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110427/ap_on_re_us/us_gates_foundation_education;_ylt=ArMipCa5KLOPWH26GWqagGhQXs8F;_ylu=X3oDMTM0dWExN2E3BGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTEwNDI3L3VzX2dhdGVzX2ZvdW5kYXRpb25fZWR1Y2F0aW9uBHBvcwMyMgRzZWMDeW5fcGFnaW5hdGVfc3VtbWFyeV9saXN0BHNsawNnYXRlc3RvaGVscHM-">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>. The foundation pledged to donate $20 million dollars to the initiative through the use of social media, game based learning, and other learning tools; all aimed at captivating the minds of pupils to better help them increase proficiency in the core subjects. 

By the looks of it, the common core seems more of an efficient approach than the NCLB as shown in the results from the pilot program in which 100 NYC schools were a part of. Although it undoubtedly has its loopholes, they are miniscule compared to that of the NCLB. The future looks promising as we stand in that the standards are expected to be implemented in schools nationwide officially as early as the year 2014.
