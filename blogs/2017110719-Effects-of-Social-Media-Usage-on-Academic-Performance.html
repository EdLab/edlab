<p>Universities have increasingly adopted social media for a variety of educational and communication activities. This technology can boost student collaboration, ease resource sharing, and facilitate online instruction. However, student online behavior has also been a growing concern for educators and researchers. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4592">Research has dispelled</a> the notion of a generational advantage in multitasking, as the human brain can handle a limited <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4663/screen-time-and-unhealthy-behaviors-in-chinese-adolescents">"cognitive load."</a> Dr. Wilfred W.F. Lau’s research seeks to understand the disparities between the benefits and detractions of social media use by university students.</p>

<p>Lau sampled 348 undergraduates from a university in Hong Kong to participate in this study. The researcher surveyed participant habits related to media sharing, internet searching, video gaming, and video streaming. He also gauged student perceptions of the benefits of social media usage in their classes. For academic performance, he gathered student GPA information. </p>

<p>Through regression analysis, Lau found that using social media for academic purposes had no statistical impact on GPA. He posits that the students in the sample had less experience with education-related social media, meaning that they have not been exposed to their beneficial usages. He did, however, find that using online media for both non-academic purposes and multitasking was associated with a lower GPA. These results confirmed the downside of using these resources.</p> 

<p>While there are some benefits from the efficiency and functionality of social media, the effects are not universal and can vary wildly depending on the student. Gaming and socializing online certainly present potential for distractions and Lau hopes that universities will take steps to mitigate negative impacts from the growing role of social media.</p>
