'Hi Everyone,

For the last three days, I attended a 3 day workshop of a different sort called Landmark Education. Its basically a self help program that claims to transform your life at the least and achieve world peace if used correctly. 

It starts from 9AM and goes on straight till 10PM. There are 180 People and a 'forum leader' has a conversation with the audience . The audience share their stories time to time in oprah style. 

My friend had invited me to a introduction session a couple of months back. I was very disinterested but showed up an hour late anyway because I had nothing else to do that evening. I heard random people sobbing and narrating how their lives have transformed. Some got their partners back, others got their parents back etc. I was of course convinced that the whole thing was a scam and that all the narration was staged.

months later, I decided to finally give it a shot because I felt like spending some money on myself for a new year treat.

And boy, I was in for a treat. 

All I'll say is that the first day, I met a lot of people just as skeptical as me, and on the third day, Many had resolved and come to terms with past issues in their lives, and claimed to have had a 'transforming' experience.

But for those of you who have heard of it and considering it, I do want to vouch that all the common accusations are unfounded. Its not a cult/brainwashing/money-for-magic scam.  They're very upfront about who they are. A for-profit self help course that markets by word-of-mouth of its participants.

So am I transformed? I dont think so, but I do feel  more equipped with useful tools for any 'life' situation

So whats their secret? Its remarkably commonplace philosophy but delivered in a very intense setting. Which is why just repeating what they told is useless. You need to be in a room locked up with 180 people for 13 hours for three days to 'get' what they are saying. The conversation is generic enough for everyone to make something out for themselves, which works in creating an aura of mystery around it because 'graduates' are unable to explain why it worked.

Overall I would say my experience was positive and would recommend it if you're in the mood to 'get in touch with your emotional self' (as the liberal arts people say)
I refer you to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/dec/14/ameliahill.theobserver">this article </a> for a very good review of the experience. The forum leader was the same as mine: Jerry Baden. and the author went in the same mindset as me :)
