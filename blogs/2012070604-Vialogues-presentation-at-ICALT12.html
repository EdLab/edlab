            My presentation was in a session called the "Video Session". The session was in a small room of seating capacity for 25 people. The room was mostly full. 

The questions/feedback I received were mostly on the tool itself and less so much on the analysis: 

- Does it work on mobile phone?

- How do you show the discussion on the mobile phone since there is only as much space for the video ?

- Where do you host videos?

- Do the Youtube video someone pulls up, also gets stored on your server ?

- What about users uploading copyright content ?

- Is this free? How do you manage costs of hosting videos ?

- How is this different from youtube? 

- How many users did you have when you started the study?

- Who were these users ?

- Can you discuss live video lectures ? That would be weird because then nobody would attend the lectures. 

- What would I have to do to use it in my class ?


Later, I chatted with a teacher from New Zealand and he told me that he would introduce it at his school to see if children like it. He said that last time he introduced Prezi and children loved it and have been using it since. 

The keynote speaker from day one, Adrian David Cheok, was also there in the session and also told me that he really liked the tool and would try it out. 

-- <i> Updates on other presentations soon</i>

The conference day was yesterday and it was followed with a social dinner at a restaurant slightly outside the city. We had a nice 3 course meal which lasted three hours. Funny thing, Italian servers don't disturb you while eating and so everything was served as slow as it could possibly be. :|
