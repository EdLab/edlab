<a href="http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/EDUCAUSEQuarterlyMagazineVolum/AStudyofFourTextbookDistributi/242784">Graydon, B., Urbach-Buholz, B., & Kohen, C. (2011). A Study of Four Textbook Distribution Models. <i>Educause Quarterly, 34</i>(4).</a> 

Daytona State College spent 2-years studying 4 different distribution models in student textbooks. Print rental, electronic book rental, and device rental were investigated in existing faculty practice for financial and non-financial outcomes (such as performance, preference, and retention). They found that electronic textbook rental was significantly more expensive for students than physical book rental, in some cases rental was near the average textbook cost. 

Even more telling is the trouble DSC had beginning the study. It was more difficult than anticipated to find the right textbooks in the format and payment structure required. Courses and text assignments had to be adjusted based on availability. Even if there were significant financial gains to be had with a particular format and distribution model, there's no guarantee that publishers would offer textbooks in that model. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Like DSC, we too are working towards an e-text campus. The study effectively outlines the major barriers to that goal in cost, availability, and format. One of the steps that DSC took to alleviate the format barrier is device lending, which we have also recently begun to investigate. Moving forward, device rental will allow us to offer electronic titles for more required readings.
