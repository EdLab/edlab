            <b>Panel: Behavior Management: Dealing with inappropriate content, getting students motivated to participate, creating the right culture and relationships inside social environments</b>

The following is not verbatim.  

Q: How do you create a space for learning?
A: Students learn more from their peers.  So, how can you create a space for them to teach each other?  Kids are all about friendships at [adolescence].  The ties with each other can affect learning.  

Q: How do you encourage learning?
A: Here is my concern with high school. I didn't have a cell phone until college. From 14-19 years old, your ability for abstract concepts become real. You can understand "the other."  In middle school, the other was just either a bully or your bff.  My concern: the age at which they are knowledgeable about their relationships will be with others.  The internet is relationship without physical consequence.  What do we do now?  They don't face the same consequences as we did before.  You can say anything to anyone without consequence.  

Q: How do you get people to engage in these communities?
A: First start with an email list of the class.  Push them to find info outside of class and email the listserv.  The thing you don't want is for the teacher to end up as an administrator and approve all comments and posts.  As <i>facilitators</i>, we have to model how to use these networks so that students will want to run with it.  Also, allow for more open-ended student-driven projects that go beyond the traditional essay.

Q: Teachers ask if it's ok for them to friend students in social networks.  What role should they play?
A: A lot of teachers don't assign homework anymore because students are online  collaborating with each other.  The question becomes how do we take what exists and, not exactly work around it, but embrace it?  I hope we celebrate people who are using technology. We need to be using it, not be used by it.  
[I didn't hear a clear answer in there]

Q: What roles do people take at the college level?
A: Among my friends there is fear... and skepticism.  Many of my friends were afraid because they were entering the job market.  Call it the "Roaring 20s" of Facebook... now they realize that their pics/lives are public and potential employers can see them.  Random note- popularity is important among social networks.
