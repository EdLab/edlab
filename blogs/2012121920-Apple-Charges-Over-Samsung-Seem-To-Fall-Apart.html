          <p>
            Apple has been trying for quite some time now to get Samsung products such as the Galaxy SII and Tablets off the shelves as a result of their still ongoing patent issues. I've referred to this matter in previous blog posts: <a href="
http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7018">The Apple- Samsung Conflict</a> and <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7920">The Apple- Samsung Conflict - Part 2</a>. 

Apple sued Samsung for over one billion dollars for copying it's products and eventually succeeded in convincing a judge to rule in their favor. The result was Samsung's Nexus getting removed off store shelves in the United States, one of about 28 Samsung products that have also been removed. Apple accused Samsung of causing irreparable damages on their sales in the smartphone market. Their shares have dropped and the Galaxy SIII outsold the iPhone as of September.

While browsing on CNN Money, I came across this <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/18/technology/mobile/apple-samsung/index.html">article</a> about Apple's latest conflict with Samsung. In a recent ruling, a judge denied Apple's request for a ban on Samsung's products, and therefore allowed Samsung to keep selling its newer smart phones in stores. According to the judge, Apple has not proven their recent accusations against Samsung. If Apple can somehow prove Samsung copied their products, then their demands for a ban on the products in question might be satisfied. Ironically, Samsung recently dropped its charges against Apple regarding their products in Europe, as they wanted to respect the choices of customers.

Since mostly everyone in the EdLab owns some kind of smartphone, what do you think about this never-ending saga between the two giants, is there an end in sight?
