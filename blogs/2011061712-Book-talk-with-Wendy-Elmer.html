          <p>
            Education Program at Gottesman Libraries hosts different types of education related events in the library through the year. For instance, Socratic Conversation, book talk, workshop, news display, and film screening.Â  I always find those events resourceful and enjoyable.

This week, I attended a book talk hosted by Wendy Elmer: Book of Poems About Being a Teenager, and other works. I read some of Wendy's work at a poem reading event hosted by Education program earlier and was really touched by her work. Previously, she shared her works from one of her publications: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Poems-Bereavement-Grieving-Process/dp/0595300790">Books of poems on Bereavement and the Grieving Process</a>. In this book, she bravely and beautifully used poems to express and discuss her feelings of losing beloved ones.

This time, she shared some poems from another publication of her: Book of Poems About Being a Teenager. Different from the previous book which discusses heavy topics that people tend to avoid talking about, she used her unique humor and perspective to look at the emotional ups and downs of being a teenager.

Wendy is a full time staff at Gottesman Libraries who has a great interest in writing at her leisure time. If you are interested in knowing more about Wendy's work, you can find them here:

Happy reading!
