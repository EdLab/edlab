One of the things I’m noticing in my three online classes is self-pace and direction. Though the classes have suggested timelines and some, like my Organic Chemistry class, follow a traditional syllabus, I find that I can go at my own pace in terms of learning the material. The “self” in self-directed learning cannot be overlooked. The primary goal of taking these courses is to learn. Learning is sometimes an individual endeavor and people learn in different ways. I am self-paced learner. I essentially learn at my own pace. This is why I am enjoying these courses, especially the Leading Ambitious Teaching course on edX.

The course is self-paced and totally self-directed. Self-paced classes are meant to be flexible. This type of class requires less of your time in the course and assignments are due when you feel comfortable enough to complete it. Self-paced classes push the learner to not solely rely on the resources in the modules. It has forced me to search for other relevant sources on the web to supplement what I am learning in the course so far. For instance, in the aforementioned class on edX, I did research on my own outside the course. One of the modules focuses on ambitious instruction in elementary literacy.

In the module, the professor, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTk4S97S5D4">YouTube video</a>, talked about the ways teachers need to go about to motivate students to learn. Since I am unfamiliar with teaching from a theoretical perspective, I read more about these tools on my own. Overall, I found that most teachers rely on sticking to the syllabus and sometimes fail to make the course fun and engaging for their students. Students are motivated to learn when they are engaged in the coursework and learning resources.
