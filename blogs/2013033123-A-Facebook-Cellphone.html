            A rumor of Facebook developing a mobile phone of their own under the wing of HTC has surged as the company prepares an Android-related press event for the upcoming week. Rumors about Facebook releasing a cellphone has been circulating for about 18 months now, yet CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has denied the company's intention to release an Android phone. As a business, this might be a good idea, since the app runs slow in Androids and IOS and also lack of features. However, this can be a considerable challenge taking in count the Android market with big companies not knowing the success they had years ago. 

As mentioned in this <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/29/tech/mobile/facebook-phone-mashable/index.html">article</a>, a mobile app store would make much more sense than the phone itself. Facebook could develop an app store, in which it allows developers to build apps in connection with the company in a deeper lever. This can improve the company's appearance in mobile phones since its community is not that great in that area. As Zuckerberg said, "let's say we build a phone. We're not, but if we did, we could maybe get 10 to 20 million people to use it ... It doesn't move the needle for us." Creating an app store could have Facebook mobile users reach billions. 

I would like know my fellow edlabers opinion of the subject. Is a Facebook cellphone a good idea for the company? What do you think?
