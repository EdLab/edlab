San Diego Met High School is part of the <a href="http://www.bigpicture.org/">Big Picture Learning</a> network. If you’ve never heard of Big Picture Learning before, co-founder and co-director Dennis Littky sums up their raison d'etre nicely, "When we had the opportunity to create a new school, [we asked] ‘If we didn’t know there was such a thing as school, what would it be like?’" <p>

The answer involves pairing each student with an individual learning plan that matches their skills and interests. Going a step further, every student is also pushed into real world internships, 2 days a week beginning in 9th grade. This video follows the internship adventures of 16-year-old Noah, who has been protecting and restoring the waters of San Diego since he was a freshman. With his mentor Travis Pritchard, the quality lab manager at San Diego Coastkeeper, Noah studies water samples drawn from around the city for toxicity and nutrient levels of raw vs. filtered water. <p>

"When he graduates high school," says Travis, "he’s going to have 4 years of work experience in a lab." <p>

The internship program gives Noah and his peers a leg up on the competition as it prepares them for the world that awaits, post-graduation. Have you come across similarly extensive programs? Better yet, have you been a part of one? <p>

Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10863">on Vialogues</a> and let your comments flow like bacteria in the San Diego River. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@02:04 Clark:</b> I wonder what the rest of the day looks like for students. Does it match the hands-on appeal of the internship?<p>

<b>@02:20 JordaJean:</b> What's the process of matching students to internships? Is it just a matter of taking a survey? What say do the students have in the matter? And what happens if they find they hate the internship placement?
