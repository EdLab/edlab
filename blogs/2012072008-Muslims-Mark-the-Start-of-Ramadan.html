          <p>
            Muslims all across the world are marking the start of the holy month of Ramadan, where they will fast (no food or water) from sunset to sundown every day. Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and is perhaps the most famous pillar along with Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca that any active and able Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime (if they have the financials capability). Since the start and ending of Ramadan depends on the moon and geographic location, some will start and end Ramadan earlier or later. This variation in time has an influence on how people's mood reflect along the day. 

The Koran was revealed to the Prophet Mohammed during this holy month.The Koran, the holy book of Islam, covers everything about Islam, including the appropriate and expected behaviors of a Muslim. The main purpose of Ramadan is to purify not only your body but your soul as well from sins one's committed along the year. The last ten days of Ramadan are the most important in the Muslim's calendar. As cited in the Koran, these ten days' night prayers are worth 1,000 days of prayer, and anyone who completes these ten days praying accomplishes is guaranteed to have all their sins forgiven and an open door to Heaven.

As an athlete preparing the fall soccer season with my high school team, my performance on the field may decrease because I'll be lacking energy and lack of proper training. On the other hand, my commitment to EdLab potluck, D&R and seminar food will cease but I'll be back very soon.
