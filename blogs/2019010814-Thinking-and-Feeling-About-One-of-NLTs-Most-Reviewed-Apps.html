          <p>
            <p class="p1">One of the articles from my latest <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5899/helping-teachers-afford-pricey-tech-hubs-and">High Five</a> had a clickbait-esque headline (which I clicked on): "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-03/addiction-to-a-language-learning-app-can-be-good-for-you">Addiction to a Language-Learning App Can Be Good for You</a>." Unsurprisingly, the article doesn’t actually advocate that we become addicted to language-learning apps; rather, it explains how Duolingo adapted strategies employed by the designers of popular mobile video games like Candy Crush in order to keep users coming back–and, in theory, to keep them learning. The strategy proved effective in increasing users, but the article points to an additional element of the app’s success: the way it makes users feel.</p><p class="p2"><br /></p><p class="p1">Here’s an interesting quote from Duolingo's VP of product:</p><p class="p2"><br /></p><p class="p1">“When you’re done using the product, you feel like you’re a little bit better as a person. That’s really what people are going for. That’s what we try to give them.”</p><p class="p2"><br /></p><p class="p1">Aside from the sensational headline, this article originally got my attention since I, along with several other members of the publishing team, recently tested out Duolingo’s suite of new language offerings, including Hindi, Navajo, and Hawaiian. I’ll save our thoughts on these new features for the official EdLab Review article (coming soon to NLT!), but in light of that experience I found it interesting how Duolingo’s leaders seemed to be pitching the app almost as a form of wholesome, feel-good entertainment, a healthy alternative to scrolling through social media or (ironically) playing Candy Crush. They were also zeroing in on one of our key motivations for seeking out learning experiences: the idea of self-betterment. Even if Duolingo can't offer fluency, it can keep users coming back by providing them with the feeling of time well spent.</p><p class="p1"><br /></p><p class="p1">That, and digital "jewels" and other rewards for continuous gameplay that apparently make the app addictive.</p><p class="p1"><br /></p><p class="p1">In any case, I appreciated how honest this characterization of the app sounded. It was an interesting indication that improved self-concept is one of the most potent motivating factors in self-directed learning–and perhaps also a gentle reminder that if your goal is truly to become fluent in a new language, Duolingo can only take you so far.</p>
