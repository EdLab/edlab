<p>If there’s one subject that seems like an unlikely choice for gamification, it’s Calculus. Yet <a href="https://triseum.com/calculus/variant/">Variant: Limits</a>, created by <a href="https://triseum.com">Triseum</a>, not only gamifies the notoriously tricky subject, it turns it into a fantastical, whimsical, challenging video game. As a former Calculus tutor and lifetime lover of the subject, I had never before seen such an intricate game take on a specific Calculus topic: namely, limits. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Variant provides comprehensive practice on finite limits, continuity, and infinite limits throughout its four levels. In the first level, the challenges focus on the difference between right- and left- sided limits and discontinuous and continuous lines. The following levels deal with functions, including sine and cosine ones, as well as horizontal and vertical asymptotes. My avatar could only advance through the world by solving problems positioned throughout it, and there were enough activities and repeated exercises that most students should feel more confident with these mathematical concepts by the end of each level. The creators also offer teachers helpful strategies to incorporate Variant into their standard class curriculum and include a list of popular Calculus textbooks that Variant can easily supplement.</p>
 
<p>Variant’s gameplay is excellent, with easy-to-use controls and no glitch problems that I found. The virtual world is quite compelling; it was not only well designed, but also aesthetically pleasing. As my avatar marched across its exoplanet environment, I felt like I was playing a mainstream video game, albeit one where the enemies were functions rather than trolls or orcs (which, depending on who you ask could be scarier). Yet despite the fact that Variant is Calculus based, its strong narrative creates a detailed context as it guides the players from task to task.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although the given problems are well constructed, answering them is sometimes more of a challenge than it should be. In many of the challenges (especially in the first level), there are multiple parts to each answer, yet if you answer one part incorrectly, the game only alerts you that the entire problem is wrong rather than isolating that specific point. This could be a pedagogical strategy, but I think students who have trouble understanding these concepts would be able to improve while remaining encouraged if individual mistakes were highlighted. In addition, because the game does not provide much thorough explanation for any of the concepts, it will most likely only work as a supplement to course material rather than as a standalone piece.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Sometimes, educational video games focus too much on content and not enough on gameplay, leaving them dry and dull, yet Variant: Limits hits the sweet spot between entertaining and educational. With the feel of a mainstream video game and the problem set of a Calculus textbook, Variant will likely keep students engaged as they reinforce their mathematical knowledge.</p>
