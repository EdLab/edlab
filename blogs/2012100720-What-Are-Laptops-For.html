<p>One Laptop per Child (OLPC), the brainchild of Nicholas Negroponte, is a non-profit organization founded with the goal of providing low-cost durable laptops to students in third-world countries, thereby jumpstarting education and development.  Like many charitable endeavors, OLPC has enjoyed, up to this point, an excess of enthusiasm.  Over the past few years, over a million of these laptops have been shipped to a handful of participating countries, generating necessary data to begin evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  The early results are unpromising.</p>

<p>A few years after Peru enthusiastically embraced the OLPC project, <a href=" http://ftp.iza.org/dp6401.pdf">researchers at the Inter-American Development Bank</a> carried out a randomized controlled trial of the impact of these laptops at 319 public schools in the country.  They gave the students at both the test and control schools a variety of tests and interviews. As expected, computer use and mastery (e.g. fluency with Microsoft Word, or Wikipedia) was much higher in the OLPC schools, although the increased computer use at home didn’t seem to lead to an increase in homework completion.  Regarding academic achievement and ability, students with computers showed no improvement on specific subject achievement tests (Math and Language), but they did demonstrate minor improvements in general cognitive ability.  The authors suggest that this improvement may be a small instance of the famous Flynn effect, an ongoing global rise in I.Q. scores sparked, many believe, by similar encounters with information technology.</p>

<p>Of course the experiment was not ideal.  The students had little to no internet access, were often barred from taking the laptops home with them, and the laptops themselves were only loaded with a few basic programs.  That said, these results will provide more ammunition against what some have labeled as the "techno-utopianism" of the OLPC project.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this disappointing data on student achievement may be beside the point, hard as that is to comprehend in test-obsessed America. The real value of OLPC may be not in boosting narrowly defined school achievement, but rather in jumpstarting the globalizing process by plugging third-world students directly into the post-industrial information economy.  Although there are plenty of questions to be raised on this score as well, the positive scores on tests of computer and information literacy may be a better signal of OLPC’s potential impact. Whether or not this technological literacy will lead to economic and social development is a much bigger question and remains to be determined.</p>
