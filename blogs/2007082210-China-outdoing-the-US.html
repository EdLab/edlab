            Fareed Zakaria wrote an interesting article. In his piece entitled “Turning Toward China,” Zakaria suggests that China's regional leadership in Southeast Asia is on the rise because China has greatly strengthened its economic ties with States in the region through generous aid packages and free trade agreements. Contrarily, Zakaria claims that US influence has suffered by both decreases in its economic commitment and its participation in institutions with the Southeast Asian States, as well as through a collapse of America's image abroad. 

In Zakaria's analysis of China's leadership in the Southeast Asian region, he uses neoliberal explanations to explain the increase of China's leadership. Neoliberals see leadership as the ability to influence other States by virtue of strong economic ties and institutions with these States. China's economic ties with Southeast Asia, according to Zakaria, have been continuously on the rise. As he points out, China has outdone the US by offering Southeast Asia greater financial aid packages and has looked to strengthen relations by creating a free trade deal with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The United States has not been able to compare with these accomplishments. As States begin to rely more heavily on China, Chinese influence in the region increases especially as they realize that their dependence on China will be long-term. While Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong and Vietnamese officials are in opposition to Chinese dominance in the area, due to the nature of the histories between the countries, they are acquiescing to Chinese influence due to their reliance on the Chinese economy. 

The United States, in contrast, is slowly losing its prime leadership position in Southeast Asia because our economic commitment to the region has not been as strong as of late. Zakaria suggests that the US has done well in strengthening ties with Japan, India, Australia, Singapore and Vietnam, however, he is wary because the US has not made comparable commitments to the region as China has recently. Zakaria suggests that the Iraq War is distracting the US to the extent that it has not had time to give Southeast Asia strategic attention. The President and Congress, after all, have been in heated debates over how to handle the situation in Iraq and have resultantly caused our government to sacrifice attention to other regions. 

Likewise, Iraq has also led to a collapse of American legitimacy and has damaged its image abroad. Zakaria seems to believe the neoliberal principle that strong institutions have correlations with leadership and the United States' defiance of the United Nations Security Council has damaged the image of the US abroad. Further, he points out that the United States' unbalanced position on Israel-Palestinian issues have had implications on the image of the US amongst the Southeast Asian Muslim population. The United States has favored Israel in these conflicts but taking a more balanced position on the issue might improve the image of the US.   

What is really driving US decline in influence in the Southeast Asian region, as Zakaria sees it, is that Congress does not see the value in trade agreements and foreign aid for countries like Vietnam. He claims that ideological differences and lobbyists have played large roles in keeping our country from passing the type of agreements that China is. Ultimately this is negatively affecting our influence in the region because we are not focusing on improving economic ties with these countries when it has been the reason we have been influential in the past. 

His argument is logically correct. If he is right and economic ties are what drive leadership in the region, then China will have the advantage if it continues down the path of giving aid and having free trade because the United States neither has free trade with the ASEAN nor has it recently matched China's financial aid packages to the region. His recommendations follow that to improve influence in the region the US should focus on passing free trade agreements and reestablishing itself as the biggest economic partner with the Southeast Asian countries.
