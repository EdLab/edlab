<a href="http://bit.ly/1fRHh5t">Arezoo Miot</a> is a program director at the <a href="http://bit.ly/1IzGDR1">Institute of International Education</a>, where she oversees the <a href= "http://bit.ly/1MYdQf6">TechWomen</a> program. She has successfully managed international outreach and scholarship initiatives for government and private corporations. In her current role she is connecting the next generation of women leaders from Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East to innovative companies and startups in the San Francisco Bay Area. She is passionate about utilizing technology to drive positive change and empowerment. Miot earned her bachelor’s degree in international affairs from George Washington University and her master’s degree in public policy from the University of Chicago.

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I was born in Chicago, and my parents are from Iran. We didn’t live in a very diverse area, so as an Iranian in the Midwest, I stood out. This influenced my desire to study international affairs. During undergrad, I decided to focus on conflict and security. In 2001, I studied abroad in Morocco for a summer and this experience opened my eyes to equality issues and disadvantaged communities, which didn’t exist in the society I grew up in. After September 11th the world changed and so did my focus. I knew I wanted to go back to school, not only for the human rights aspect, but also to shape the dialogue of policy. I earned a master’s in public policy with a concentration in international human rights. I continued developing my interest in women, children, and human rights, and when I began looking at jobs, I found an opportunity to work in international education.</p> 
 
<p>Working at the Institute of International Education, I have the opportunity to touch on many of my interests at once: human rights, accessibility to education and women’s empowerment. The program I direct, TechWomen, brings women professionals in STEM fields from Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East to the San Francisco Bay Area for a five-week mentorship. These women exchange ideas, build networks, and get exposed to a professional landscape they otherwise wouldn’t have access to.</p> 
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
I hope programs like TechWomen expand what we define as learning. You usually think of education as students learning in a classroom. When you think of international education, you think of students going abroad. But what about continued learning when you’re a mid-level professional? What about an experience that goes beyond the classroom? That’s an area where programs like TechWomen fill the void. It’s a five-week program that changes lives, but in the traditional sense, it’s not considered international education. As we think of opportunities to continue learning, we can look at TechWomen as a successful model in shaping curriculum around new modes of learning.</p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
Moving forward, I think experiential learning and virtual exchange will have a tremendous impact on learning. We have to look at education with a learn-by-doing perspective—learning that takes place at internships and mentorships, learning outside of the classroom.</p> 
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
We’re preparing for the 2015 program taking place in October. We have many great events planned, in addition to placing the 99 Emerging Leaders (program participants) at mentorships in tech companies across the Bay Area. I’m especially excited for our Community Event, which will give the Emerging Leaders the opportunity to address issues in their home countries and how they could use technology to resolve these issues.</p> 
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
Working at Twitter, it’s no surprise <a href="http://bit.ly/1KztzRz">Kelly Shalk’s feed</a> is as lively as it is active. She’s a strong supporter of the TechWomen program and is active on Twitter’s <a href="http://bit.ly/1KXCqYY">Women in Engineering group</a>. I love seeing the different events going on at Twitter supporting women in tech.</p> 

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1LFTuWl">Paria Rajai</a> is another TechWomen mentor using Twitter to share her passion for women’s empowerment. I love the focus on social media and technology for good in Paria’s feed, especially considering her work with Hackbright Academy—an engineering school specifically for women.</p>  
 
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1hsb6uw">Jill Wetzler’s</a> feed is one of the most interesting accounts I follow! Also a TechWomen mentor, Jill’s feed is in a similar vein as the other two, but with a healthy dose of tweets featuring memes, Bay Area topics, and social justice. It’s hard to summarize her feed simply, so I’d say follow her—and Kelly and Paria! </p>
