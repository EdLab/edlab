Decades of neo-liberal reforms have established a market in secondary  schooling, where 'choice' and 'diversity' are expected to drive up  standards and maximize individual responsibility. This is known to  favour middle class people. But what of those middle classes  deliberately choosing ordinary and even 'low performing' secondary  schools for their children? What  are their motives, and how do they experience the choice? What is it  like for the young people themselves? Where do they end up? And what  does all this show us about contemporary white middle class identity and  its formation? This groundbreaking study offers some answers to these  questions. Based on detailed fieldwork with parents and children, it examines 'against-the-grain' school choices, looking in particular at family history,  locality, the nature of 'choice' itself and associated anxieties,  relationships to other ethnic groups and to whiteness, and the  implications for democracy. The book highlights an inescapable  acquisitiveness but also more hopeful dimensions of contemporary white  middle class identity.
