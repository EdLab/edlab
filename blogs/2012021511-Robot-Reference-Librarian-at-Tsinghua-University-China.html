I finally found an English blog of the robot reference librarian called <i>Xiao Tu</i> implemented at the Tsinghua University, China. Here's the <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/staffweb/kaleidoscope/#meetxiaotu
">link</a>.

Xiao Tu is a web chatting bot designed to help library users who need information but not totally sure what they are looking for. Xiao Tu was implemented with artificial intelligence technologies to mimic human capability in conducting conversations. In a large way it's an intelligent tutor for library information retrieval. Below is a screenshot from the above blog of the English translation of a conversation with Xiaotu.

The blog doesn't cover an interesting episode that happened a week ago. Xiaotu was taken down from the web because it had been mis-taught by <i>bad people</i>. Xiaotu was designed with learning capabilities intended to expand its information reservoir as it's being used over time. For example, if it was asked about something but it did not know, you can tell it the answer and it would incorporate this answer to its knowledge base. Next time when it was asked for the same question, it would come with the learned answer. But this capability apparently hadn't been used as intended because many students were teaching it funny things so that after being used for months Xiaotu sounds like a punk. The university was not happy with the fact that their library reference agent is a punk so Xiaotu was taken down. I don't know if Xiaotu is back to its post after been brainwashed because unfortunately Xiaotu is accessible only from Tsinghu's intranet. Further stories are on the way.
