Are you... or do you want to be a dj? Let us come and see your show, and let the good times go on n' on!

We are pleased to announce the expansion of the Everett Cafe <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/62104">music program</a> to include the art of the disc jockey. We invite TC students who are or wish to be dj's to share the music they love and develop their capacities as artists.

Not limited to contemporary dance, we'll experiment with classical, jazz, R&amp;B, swing, and other forms to suit a wide variety of musical tastes.

Our dj program will take place on the second floor of the library and include support for equipment and assessment of performances. We'll contribute ideas for the library's new <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/news.htm?articleID=9146">Learning Theater</a>, staying tuned.

"If I had to play only for people who liked the music because they heard it on the radio, it wouldn't make me happy. That's why I'm working so hard to have, yes, a profile as an artist, but also a profile as a DJ."
--<a href="http://www.davidguetta.com/en/us#!">David Geutta</a> (from <em><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/d/davidguett433058.html">BrainyQuote</a></em>)

"I've always wanted to be a DJ so I could play the music I love for other people. That feeling hasn't changed, but my sets are always evolving. In terms of tailoring to a specific crowd, certainly I do play differently depending on the situation. It's a different feel, for example, in a small club versus a festival."
