            Here we go — The pilot blog entry. Hopefully, I'll have a face for you along with that lovely “HELLO” sticker in the near future. 

Speaking of the future, I found a fascinating article that introduces exciting possible trends in the field of education that will emerge within the next 100 years. Except that… it was written in the year 1900, which means the “next 100 years” is actually right about now.

<center><img src="http://4-www-accel-pss.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=accel&gadget=www.howtobearetronaut.com&debug=0&nocache=0&v=vbnb2fcppu6dmomb95qf5v901s&rooe=1&html_tag_context=img&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtobearetronaut.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F07%2FLadies-Home-Journal-520x750.jpg"  width="228" height="300"></center>

John Elfreth Watkins, Jr. published <a href="http://www.howtobearetronaut.com/2011/07/what-may-happen-in-the-next-hundred-years-c-1900/">this article</a> in the Ladie's Home Journal in the cold winter of the year 1900. He writes about his general predictions for American life in the early 21st century — some that are true today and some that are still in the works. For example, he believed Americans will be taller (true) and that wireless telephones will span the world (true). He also predicted that there will be no wild animals (false), and that strawberries will be as large as apples (<a href="http://webecoist.com/2009/02/19/genetically-modified-fruits-vegetables/">Probably False?</a>) 

However, the predictions I found most thought provoking were for how children will be taught:

<i>“A university education will be free to every man and woman. Several great national universities will have been established. Children will study a simple English grammar adapted to simplified English, and not copied after the Latin. Time will be saved by grouping like studies. Poor students will be given free board, free clothing and free books if ambitious and actually unable to meet their school and college expenses. Medical inspectors regularly visiting the public schools will furnish poor children with free eyeglasses, free dentistry, and free medical attention of every kind. The very poor will, when necessary, get free rides to and from school and free lunches between sessions. In vacation time, poor children will be taken on trips to various parts of the world...”</i>

What a beautiful picture of education he paints right here.  The emphasis on free education and equal opportunity for children is compelling, but unfortunately Mr. Watkins Jr. was wrong. We can all agree that this is not what education looks like as of this moment.  My personal favorite is the prediction where underprivileged children will be able to travel and experience the world.  Although it seems like a far-fetched idea, I believe that with the ever-evolving technology: the internet, long distance communication, and multimedia, this prediction could come true in the near future in the field of education. And EdLab is playing its part in that movement.  

So although this article presented an incomplete picture of the future of education, I sincerely hope that is all that it is — incomplete, but not impossible.
