Review by Joann Agnitti and Gonzalo Obelliero


<i>OpenEnglish presents an online learning opportunity for native Spanish speakers who wish to learn or increase their proficiency in English.  It offers an experience similar to that of other online learning programs: a curriculum split into modules (lessons), assessments, and goal tracking. But unlike other programs, OpenEnglish offers some innovative and well-executed modes of instruction, such as the often hilarious and entertaining educational video lessons that call to mind episodes of The Office. The premise of OpenEnglish is familiar yet refreshingly different.</i>


<b>Pros.</b>
One of the foremost distinguishing features of this program is the personal advisor assigned to each student.  The advisor engages learners by way of phone conversations. Here they can answer questions, clear confusion, check in for comprehension, and motivate learners as they near their lesson goals.  This lends a “human touch” to the online learning experience, which can often be a lonely one. 

On a similar note, another famed feature of the program are the live classes.  Every OpenEnglish student may take an unlimited amount of live classes with native speaking English teachers. Class sizes average about 4-5 students and start every hour (almost 24/7). The class topics change daily and mainly focus on conversation and pronunciation.

The entire program is personalized to the learner. This alone separates OpenEnglish from many out-of-the-box language learning programs. Within a profile, each learner can specify his or her current English level (from pre-beginner to advanced) and also tailor lessons according to learning goals. These lessons are based on properties such as the learner's career, his or her skills, and upcoming tests (i.e. the TOEFL). As students participating in the program, we found the level placement within a course to be accurate and the content recommended based on our profile was appropriate.

As mentioned before, OpenEnglish takes advantage of the unique opportunity that online learning environments offer for personalizing content to the learner. One way in which they do this is by breaking down the entire curriculum into short lessons. The busy learner would be smart to take advantage of these.  They have lessons covering a wide range of subject matters.  Some lessons are as simple as how to pronounce one specific sound, and some tackle entire grammatical structures. A critical mass of content is crucial for adaptability.


<b>Cons.</b>
OpenEnglish is somewhat adaptive, but it would become a much more powerful tool if it fully embraced an adaptive learning environment. Currently, content is recommended based on the user profile and, I suppose, advisors' and teachers' input. But because OpenEnglish works through an online environment, it might benefit from integrating more robust adaptive learning technologies into the program. I imagine, for example, a system in which performances on tasks or even specific teachers might inform the recommendation of content automatically, without the mediation of an advisor or the user making changes to their profile manually.



<b>Final word.</b>
OpenEnglish stands out from the crowd of language learning programs because of the features it offers and the features it <i>could</i> offer.  OpenEnglish employs innovative uses of technology to engage online learners. Further experimentation and innovation from this company is an exciting prospect as it could serve to benefit and inspire a world of foreign language learners and teachers.
