<p>Everything old is new again. Maker spaces are once again a topic of renewed interest in education. By carving out a physical location where students can create products with their own hands, these idiosyncratic spaces provide evocative new ways to explore learning that invoke traditional conceptions of experiential, embodied learning. John Dewey would be proud. One of the newest and most innovative types of maker spaces involves electronic textiles, better known as e-textiles. A recent study examined e-textiles as a form of disruptive design unique to maker spaces. It also investigated different ways of supporting and challenging maker activities in schools. </p>
 
<p>E-textiles allow students to learn informally in community spaces, museums, and science centers in addition to more formal environments like classrooms. Researchers examined high school student experiences creating e-textiles, focusing on three workshops, involving 35 freshmen ages fourteen to fifteen. The study was conducted over the course of an academic year, with students creating a wide variety of e-textile designs. During this qualitative study, students discussed their learning experiences creating e-textiles. </p>

<p>The researchers discovered that e-textile workshops allowed students to explore new roles as designers and creators of technology. By foregrounding the idea of aesthetics, e-textiles promote the exploration of a topic generally excluded from today’s classrooms where high-stakes tests dictate the conversation. Investigating aesthetics within the context of e-textiles requires some technical skill and opens up the potential for a textured discussion of gender. Providing a space for young girls to combine analog materials and digital tools allows a conversation about—and a challenge to—more stereotypical views of computer technologies as solely a male domain, both in academic and professional realms.   </p>

<p>The study found that maker space activities emphasize the importance of at least two distinct modalities that are endemic to their form—the digital as well as the material. By combining these differing domains that are often separated in traditional educational spaces, students can learn a wide variety of content and skills. Finally, the researchers found that e-textiles promoted authentic learning that can invite new types of students into learning about design and aesthetics. </p>
