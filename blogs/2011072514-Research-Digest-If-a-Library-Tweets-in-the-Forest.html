How has our library social media use changed since 2009? This paper compares data from several studies of library Facebook use in 2009 to several current library Facebook pages.

<b>Description:</b>
Though there was no shortage of papers touting the benefits of library Facebook outreach in 2009, it was difficult for the author to find library Facebook pages that had been updated within the past 6 months. She selected for study only Facebook pages which were updated weekly. She found that most had 0-20 minutes of staff attention per week. Even amongst these “active” pages, the author found little patron use of the interactive features. The author found that the most successful active sites were using Facebook as a bulletin board to announce events, classes, and activities. 

Some of the 2009 goals for social media such as a hosting site for videos, classes, and library tutorials or serving as a portal to the databases and OPAC, found little or no use in the library Facebook pages of today. In 2009 it still seemed like Facebook, ubiquitous as it was, would transcend social sharing and become a hub for online interaction of all kinds. Instead, it seems that these educational goals have fragmented into sites of their own.

The Australian government has recently released a report called, <a href="http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/handle/1947/10131"><i>Don't Judge a (Face)Book by its Cover: A Critical Review of the Implications of Social Networking Sites.</i></a> The document primarily discusses the benefits of social networking in the workplace including marketing, privacy, and the increased productivity resulting from WILB (workplace internet leisure browsing.) It would be interesting to see the evolution of library social media policy since 2009, I would expect it to go the way of the Australian government in attempting to highlight the benefits of these technologies. I think the policies would reflect that even as our goals for Facebook specifically became less use-oriented, our policies for social media use in the office became less restrictive. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
A flexible social media policy is necessary for any library that wishes to reap the benefits of this type of marketing. The story this paper tells is not one of failure and abandonment, but of a migrating marketing strategy that isn't wasting time and resources on a spent trail. This attitude should be in our minds as we develop marketing strategies for our products and library services. 

I was talking with an older librarian a few weeks ago about social media and he admonished me for my generalizations and unfounded opinions about the culture of different communities and their users. It was such a deep cultural rift that it left me momentarily stunned. It was like telling a sailor to ignore her intuition and rely on the weather report. Opinions and generalizations are much of what we have in building social media strategies for the future. We'll have the data by and by, but to keep up we'll need a weather eye on the horizon.
