<p><a href="http://www.sophia.org/">Sophia</a> is platform that supports a large, community-created library of tutorials for very specific concepts from traditional school subjects. The tutorials include video or slide lectures accompanied by a short multiple choice quiz. These tutorials are created by users and are neatly organized by subject, sub-subject, and specific concept. For every concept, several tutorials are available, each created by a different user. This gives students an array of choices to help them find the right tutorial. Learners can also rate tutorials, which promotes the most helpful tutorials and de-emphasizes those that are less helpful.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The recommendation system makes it easy for users to find high quality tutorials because the highest-rated tutorials rise to the top of the list through user vote. This ensures that students find the best tutorial more efficiently. Sophia’s statistics dashboard provides activity data from  every tutorial on the platform. The platform also supports online study groups that are private by default and can only be accessed with a request code. Teachers can create playlists of tutorials and offer them to students as courses through Sophia’s platform .</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The tutorials themselves are very short and would benefit from more interactive assessment. There are some <a href="http://www.sophia.org/home-student">courses</a> offered through the system that are quite expensive, but still affordable when compared to traditional college. Students have 60 days to complete each course before the content expires which may interfere with the "learn at your own pace" mentality of online learning.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Sophia provides teachers with a large selection of tutorials for their students and the free content gives students plenty of choices for learning a single concept. Reviews help both teachers and students select high quality tutorials. The ability to offer a customized playlist of tutorials is a useful feature for teachers who are able to add tutorials from different subject areas to tackle more inclusive learning objectives. Sophia enables teacher creativity and the playlist concept is an interesting possibility for online learning.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Sophia gives learners their own personal library of online tutorials.</p>
