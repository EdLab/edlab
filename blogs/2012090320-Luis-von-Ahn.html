<i>For the last eight years, I have been working to develop an area of computer science called ‘human computation,’ which studies how to harness the combined power of humans and computers to solve problems that would be impossible for either to solve alone.</i> - <a href=" http://vonahn.blogspot.com/"> Luis von Ahn </a> </p>

<p><b>Bots, Books & Beyond</b></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a> asks the question, "Are you a human?" of millions of users a day.  In the case of 34-year-old, Luis von Ahn, we could easily answer, "superhuman."  Dr. Ahn is one of the pioneers of <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> technology, which was developed by Ahn and two peers at Carnegie Mellon and uses blurred text as a "test" to determine whether a user is a "spam-bot."  CAPTCHA technology was applied to and rebranded as Ahn’s startup reCAPTCHA (which sold to Google in 2009) and has contributed to the translation of millions of previously un-translated texts. </p>
<p>
Dr. Ahn, who coined the term "Human Computation," was born in Guatemala, received his BS in Computer Science from Duke and later his doctorate from Carnegie Mellon. It was at CMU, where Ahn is currently the Nico Habermann Associate Professor of Computer Science, that his latest human-powered project, <a href="http://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, was born. Duolingo takes the most remarkable element of reCAPTCHA, human translation, and unites this with adaptive language tutorials.   Never content to just run a company that turns a profit, Ahn wanted to provide something, as with reCAPTCHA’s translation of millions of books, that would give back to humanity. To date Duolingo, which utilizes human powered translation as a more accurate alternative to machine-based translation, has over 400,000 users working together to help to translate the web while gaining new language skills. A very human endeavor indeed.</p>
<p>
<b>"Are you a student?"</b>
</p><p>
Despite what you might think about having to decipher blurry text every time you make an online purchase (my first thought is that I need glasses!), the man who is protecting us from spam-bots, and who was once voted one of the "50 Best Brains in Science" by Discover Magazine, is using his personal passion to remind us that there are still things that humans do much better than machines. Such a stance is highly unusual and ironic from a man who was educated in a hotbed of machine learning and robotics. Nonetheless, this embracing of the uniqueness of the human mind and its ability to translate text better than a machine is an important reminder as we rapidly explore and continuously lean more on computers to teach, learn and manage our lives. </p>

<p>

Ahn’s belief in our ability to unite, through networked technology, around a goal or task is a powerful call-to-action for greater development and wider adoption of networked resources in education. Examples of these networked learning experiences range from Massive Online Open Courses that harness the power of crowds to collaboratively edit learner’s work, to VOIP-based technology like <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home">Skype</a> that allows a classroom in Tulsa to talk to students in Turin.  Ahn sums up this sentiment in his recent TEDx talk at Carnegie Mellon, "If we can put a man on the moon with 100K (people) what can we do with 1million?" His belief that technology can help us harness untapped human potential and in the case of Duolingo, to learn a language while translating the web, is truly inspiring and a good reminder to keep the human firmly centered in the technology equation. Educational technology should never completely eclipse the human need to interact one-on-one, instead, as Ahn points out, it should serve to, scaffold, add-to and augment existent learning opportunities and human abilities.   </p>
