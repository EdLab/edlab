<b>Description:</b> <a href ="http://www.moglue.com/"> Moglue</a> is an application that can be downloaded onto the Mac or Windows which allows users to create their own interactive story that can be published and downloaded from the Moglue app store onto an iPad or Android. In this application, users can drag and drop illustrations, include text and voice overs as well. The goal is to create a customized interactive story book that can be viewed on the iPad and Android. Moglue is a start-up company, and the founders met during a <a href ="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6600">Startup Weekend</a> event in Seoul, South Korea. 

<b>Pros:</b> This application's philosophy of letting amateur users create their own interactive story books for the iPad and Android is an excellent idea. The actual application is easy to use for the most parts: users can choose their backgrounds, what characters to put in, and adjust their sizes, rotation, etc. Users can also make it that objects in the page move, or jump when they are swiped on the iPad or Android. All this is done without needing to have any programming know-how.

<b>Cons:</b> It was a bit tricky to try to add your own pictures to include in the storybook at first, but of course with a bit of exploring I eventually found a way to import my pictures. I also had trouble with putting certain objects in the foreground, this sort of turned me off from continuing with the application. While there are short videos on how to use Moglue in general, I wish there were more videos how to fully use this application because it is a really great concept but it's a bit tricky to execute.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> I know this is not my usual STEM-tech related EdLab Review, but I wanted to do a review on a company that had met up at a <a href ="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6600"> Startup Weekend</a>. The application itself is interesting and it's geared towards creative people who would like to tell a story. This application provides them a way to create, and publish their story much quicker than the traditional way of publishing a normal book.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> Using this application in a classroom can be an interesting way to get students to show more of their creative side. They may be able to understand more about books since this app allows users to essentially build their own digital book. I wonder if the founders have ever thought about this.
