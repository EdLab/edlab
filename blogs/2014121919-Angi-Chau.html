<a href="http://angichau.com/cv_Chau.pdf">Angi Chau</a> is the <a href=" http://www.castilleja.org/page.cfm?p=941600"> Director of Bourn Idea Lab</a> (read the NLT <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1850">article</a>) and a Faculty Advisor for Robotics @ Castilleja School, an all-girl, grades 6-12, independent school in Palo Alto, California dedicated to innovation and cultivating the female leaders of tomorrow. The Bourn Idea Lab, a digital fabrication studio, also houses the schoolâ€™s robotics programs complete with a robotics and Lego League team. Chau graduated from Rice with a degree in engineering and received her masters from Stanford in electrical engineering. Chau also holds a Ph.D. in Bioengineering from UC, San Francisco and UC, Berkeley. Along with learning, she also enjoys teaching and has received numerous awards including the Teaching Effectiveness Award from UC Berkeley in 2006. Chau is a role model for the young girls she seeks to inspire.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> Five years ago, if you had asked me where I see myself in five years, the last thing I would have said is "director of a maker lab at an all-girls school." Why? Because back then, I didn't know such a position even existed! 
<p>
I have always been very interested in teaching, even back when I was an undergraduate working towards an electrical engineering degree. I worked as a teaching assistant in various engineering and computer science courses during my time at Rice. Later, when I was pursuing my PhD in bioengineering, I made sure to balance my dissertation research with plenty of teaching experiences, from mentoring in an after-school science program at a local high school to teaching lab sections at a local college. As I was finishing my PhD and trying to figure out how to craft a career in education, I remember having a conversation with a friend who pointed out to me that if I really cared about making an impact on students, I should really think about teaching not at colleges, but at the K-12 level. I don't even think my friend knew how that one comment affected me but she really is the one I attribute to landing where I am today.
<p>
I currently wear multiple hats at my school - as Director of the Bourn Idea Lab (our maker lab), as engineering faculty (teaching two engineering electives in our high school), and as faculty advisor to our middle school and upper school robotics teams. In all these capacities, the overarching vision I am working towards is to develop a cohesive program at Castilleja that allows all of our students to gain hands-on experience with making and engineering design, while providing opportunities for interested students to dive deeper into engineering. While my goal isn't to convince every student I work with to go into engineering, I do want to empower everyone, and young women in particular, to approach challenging problems like an engineer, to look at the things we interact with everyday not as mysterious black boxes but to understand them as products of the engineering process, and to find the joy in making and building things with our hands.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project? </b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
At Castilleja's Bourn Idea Lab, we are continuing to work with our teachers, of all disciplines and grade levels, to design innovative ways to incorporate making into the core curriculum. At the same time, we are teaching electives that allow students to explore engineering in more depth and offering open lab hours on "Maker Fridays" that get kids in the lab to make and tinker for fun. We are also piloting a "Maker Scouts" program, where students earn badges as they complete a series of projects that teach essential maker skills.
<p>
Our next big project in the lab is to design a robust program of professional development opportunities for educators, both inside and outside of Castilleja. Given the busy schedules of teachers during the school year, we want to make sure to offer a variety of options, from intensive deep-dive workshops to more informal gatherings that allow educators to share ideas, success stories, and seek advice from each other. 
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> I hope that the work we are doing in the Bourn Idea Lab at Castilleja, as well as the work being done at many other fantastic maker programs in schools and organizations across the country, will show everyone the value of hands-on, experiential learning. More than that, I hope it will lead to changes in education policy and more creative ways to assess students (and teachers) than standardized testing. It would be great if the work we are doing will also prompt college admission boards to imagine more innovative ways to evaluate applicants. 
<p>
On a slightly different note, I hope that by hearing about my story (as well as those of others who have entered the K-12 sector from less traditional routes), more people with advanced degrees in engineering and computer science will consider going into teaching and/or education policy, despite the obvious pay cuts they would have to take. Many schools want to incorporate engineering and computer science into the curriculum, but are lacking people who are qualified to teach these subjects. And without qualified teachers who are excited to work with students, we are depriving young people of opportunities to learn these important skills. 
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
The availability of tools that allow young people to make/build/construct and bring their ideas to life makes this a very exciting time to be a learner. Programming languages are now available that make coding accessible to elementary school students. Electronics platforms of all types make it easy and fun to build prototypes of all sorts of interactive devices. Digital fabrication tools empower everyone to build physical objects without the steep learning curves of traditional shop tools.
<p>
As someone who didn't come into K-12 teaching with an education degree, I have been learning a lot about pedagogy and learning theories. In particular, I am struck by the fact that much of the current work in integrating making into K-12 schools is really based on the ideas of Seymour Papert decades ago. Papert defined "constructionism" as learning through constructing meaningful artifacts. With the availability of so many accessible tools to construct, I think Papert's vision and ideas are finally being realized on a larger scale and that in itself will undoubtedly have major impact on learning.
<p>
Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)? Who are three people you recommend we feature in New Learning Times?
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/garystager?lang=en">Gary Stager</a> and <a href=" https://twitter.com/smartinez?lang=en">Sylvia Libow Martinez</a> are two educators who have taught me the most, both in person and in their writings, about constructionism and the work of Seymour Papert. I learn a lot from both of their Twitter accounts.
