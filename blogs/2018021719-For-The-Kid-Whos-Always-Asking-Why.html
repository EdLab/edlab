<p><a href="https://www.brainson.org/">Brains On!</a> is a weekly science podcast for children that takes kid-submitted questions and explains the answers with experts, dramatic performances, and any other creative means necessary. Produced by Minnesota Public Radio, the podcast is hosted by Molly Bloom and, for most episodes, a different kid co-host.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>A notable success of Brains On! is its ability to explain complex concepts in a way that is entertaining but not overly simplified. When a question is posed by a child, the host seeks to answer it through expert interviews and plenty of examples. Brains On! defines terminology and breaks down scientific processes through metaphor and acted out scenarios. The motto of the show, "We’re serious about being curious," definitely fits the program, as Molly Bloom encourages creative questions and entertaining discovery processes without speaking condescendingly or dumbing down real, useful answers.</p>

<p>The creative lengths to which this podcast goes to explore and answer kids’ questions results in some truly delightful outcomes. From a sea shanty about why the ocean is salty to a voice acted version of the body reacting to allergens, Brains On! is definitely effective in conveying knowledge memorably. In a live episode, a debate was even staged over whether cats are "evil" or "good," framing explanations of cats’ unique physical and behavioural characteristics as a comical showdown. </p>

<p>Kids are actively involved throughout each episode, from directing the podcast’s subject matter through their questions to being directly involved with interviewing experts. Kid co-hosts are also involved in interpreting information and explaining answers. For kids listening at home, the hosts encourage kids to write in, send illustrations for ongoing projects, and send in recordings for the weekly "mystery sound" game that always occurs mid-episode. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>After listening to hours of content, I’m struggling to find any real criticisms of this podcast. One thing to note is that it is perhaps best listened to with adults, as more questions might spring up for younger listeners in particular. In that regard, Brains On! might fall short as a purely stand-alone learning tool. Parents should know that this won’t function as a TV program replacement; while it does have entertainment value, it is also educational, and will therefore likely require further discussion after each episode is over.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Brains On! is an excellent tool for actively engaging curious kids in science learning. For children who have big questions about the world around them, this podcast can provide digestible, meaningful, and entertaining answers.</p>
