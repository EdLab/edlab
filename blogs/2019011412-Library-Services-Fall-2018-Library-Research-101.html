<ins datetime="2019-05-07T17:33:54+00:00"></ins>On October 11, 2018 in the evening, Services staff provided a library information session for Dr. Yoo Kyung Chang's course <em>MSTU 4000, Core Seminar in Mathematics, Science, and Technology</em>.  The event is documented in a Vialogue titled <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47306/">LT Spotlight: Library Research 101</a> produced with its usual cutting-edge professionalism by the library's <a href="https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/blog/13539-EdLabber-Spotlights-The-Video-Team">Video Team</a>.

When asked by a colleague from the EdLab Publishing Team to talk about some aspects of<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32818"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32818" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-1-300x200.jpg" alt="MSTU 4000 1" width="300" height="200" /></a> this presentation and of my meetings with classes in general, I supplied some answers that I think describe the event and why it seems to me to have been an important development in making use of the the Learning Theater for library instruction and exploration.  I wrote:
<div>

<strong>I meet with classes throughout the year, usually towards the beginning of each semester (Fall in particular), but it's rare for me to be asked to meet with a class of this size (approximately 90 students), which is one of the principal reasons we decided to use the Learning Theater, rather than the course's <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32819"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32819" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-2-300x200.jpg" alt="MSTU 4000 2" width="300" height="200" /></a>regular meeting place (actually 136 Thompson Hall, a lecture hall space, and a rather cramped one for a class of this size).</strong>
<div>

<strong>In other sessions with classes, my preference is when possible to involve students in hands-on experience searching databases and exploring search strategies, but because of time constraints and other factors, my presentations often end up being lecture-like sessions with time for some questions and answers.</strong>
<div>

<strong>In this case, the instructor, Yoo Kyung Chang, had in mind from the outset<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-3.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32820"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32820" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-3-300x200.jpg" alt="MSTU 4000 3" width="300" height="200" /></a> the students' involvement in searching the literature, and the idea of dividing the class into groups and making the session a competition among them developed fairly quickly.  A lot of the brainstorming and planning for using the LT to maximum effect was a collaborative effort of Dr. Chang, Kim Kefgen, our Head of Services and the Lead Learning Experience Specialist, and me (Yoo Kyung and Kim in particular); they deserve special credit for having made the event what it ultimately was.</strong>
<div>

<strong><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-4.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32821"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32821" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-4-300x200.jpg" alt="MSTU 4000 4" width="300" height="200" /></a>I haven't held an event of this exact kind in the past, but I absolutely hope to do so in the future, and I think the Learning Theater lent itself extraordinarily well to the experience.  I've been thinking about make use of the LT as a venue for library instruction for some time, and I think this adventure was a great first step and one I'd love to build upon and fine-tune over time.  Once again thanks to Kim, Kalli Mathios (who heroically came in to co-present with me despite having broken her foot a few days earlier), lots of EdLabbers, and the instructor, the session incorporated a number of immersive and constructivist elements that I wouldn't necessarily have thought of or known how to bring about, and I think the result was to engage the students in an active learning experience that I hope was memorable and fun and of value to them.</strong>

The event overall is covered in depth in the <a href="http://rhizr.com/rz/6JbHq9SmpGS3giaM3/the-library-workshop-for-mstu-4000-core-seminar-event">"Library Workshop for MSTU 4000 Core Seminar" Event Rhizr</a>, from which the following is an excerpt that lays out the basic rules of the session:

</div>
<div><em>Professor Chang welcomes students from the center of the space, near the expert panel. Students remain congregated in their work stations. Professor Chang uses a mic to address them. </em></div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Each group is assigned a unique problem statement. The goal of the evening is to<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-5.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32822"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32822" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-5-300x200.jpg" alt="MSTU 4000 5" width="300" height="200" /></a> refine/narrow the problem statement based on the outcome of three challenges. The goal of each challenge is to find sources that a) best fit the challenge criteria and b) will help them define a more concrete, significant, and focused problem statement.</em></div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Each round is timed. At the end of the round, whomever is in the "Presenter" role must come forward with their microphone and whiteboard and answer the following the questions:</em></div>
<ul>
	<li><em>What is your source?</em></li>
	<li><em>Why is it good?</em></li>
	<li><em>Which tool did you start with and why?</em></li>
</ul>
<div><em><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-6.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32823"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32823" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/01/MSTU-4000-6-300x200.jpg" alt="MSTU 4000 6" width="300" height="200" /></a>Each team has one opportunity to stop the clock and ask the librarians questions.  To play their "Ask a Librarian" card, a team member must step up to the table and Submit a Request.  All players must stop their research while questions are asked and answered.
After three minutes, time resumes.</em></div>
<div></div>
<div><em>At the end of the challenge, each judge will award a star to the team of their choosing.  At the end of the final challenge, each team will present their refined problem statement and the judges will announce the grand prize winner. </em></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>

I look forward to incorporating what we learned from this experience in planning for future library instruction sessions in the Learning Theater.  I'm needless to say grateful to have had the opportunity to collaborate on the event with Dr. Chang, my library colleagues, and the students in the class.
