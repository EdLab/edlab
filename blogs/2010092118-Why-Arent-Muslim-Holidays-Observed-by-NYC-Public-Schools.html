          <p>
            The recent completion of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Jews celebrating Rosh Hashanah and the recent controversy about the Ground Zero mosque got me suddenly pondering why Muslim holidays are not observed in NYC public schools and to a greater extent, around the nation. There are two major holidays observed by Muslims: <i>Eid Al-Fitr</i> and <i>Eid Al-Adha</i>. The former is a three-day feast and celebration that marks the end of the holy month of <i>Ramadan</i> while the later is usually celebrated after <i>Hajj</i>, a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, which is required for all physically and financially able Muslims at least once in their lifetime. <p>

Both Muslim holidays usually fall on months when school is in section. Both holidays also follow the Islamic calendar, which goes by the lunar calendar, and the days always vary in respect to the modern solar calendar. As a result of this, with each passing year on the modern calendar, the observed dates are pushed back approximately 10 days. Regardless of the dates been pushed back, there is still a greater chance the holidays will fall on days when schools are in session. <p>

Many of my Muslim friends are forced to miss school while their contemporaries continue their education and are often left behind on a newly discussed subject, which disrupts their learning. Also, some lose their perfect attendance record (an accomplishment greatly cherished by students, especially those in elementary and junior high school). My knowledge is that New York City public schools observe religious holidays based on the number of followers of that religion in the city. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are thus observed by the city's public schools since almost two million Jews reside in New York City, which also makes up about 23% of the city's population. <p>

New York City has the largest population of Jews outside of Israel and thus it reasonable to observe their religious holidays. Though there are not as many Muslims in New York City as Jews and Christians, it has a rapidly increasing population, approximately 600,000, and it's the second most followed religion in the world behind Christianity. <p>

In my view, I think the aforementioned reasons and facts should be reason enough to observe Muslim holidays. It will speak volumes about us as a nation, especially at a time when it seems there is still a stigma associated with anything Islam. First, it will help our foreign policy in that citizens of predominantly Muslim nations may view America in a different light. Second, it will show we do live up to our ideals of tolerance for everyone regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, and belief, etc. Third, it offers a teachable moment in the classroom as teachers may spend some time explaining or highlighting the major beliefs and practices of the religion when the holiday to be observed is drawing close. It will make us students more tolerant and since we are hailed as the future of the nation, it will make our future an even more tolerant and accepting society. <p>

We live in a time of great uncertainty about who we are as a nation. We are still bitterly divided on most issues: abortion, death penalty, foreign policy, etc. Gestures and recognition such as observing the religious holidays of the major religions may go a long way in easing some of the religious tensions and may propel a greater national debate about the subject, something I feel we seriously need.
