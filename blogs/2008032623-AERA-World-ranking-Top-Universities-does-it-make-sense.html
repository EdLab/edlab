          <p>
            March 25

I went to a lecture/presentation about the current big (marketing) trend of ranking universities and colleges internationally which apparently its a big business

at 1220 i arrived at the very friendly Crowne Plaza, with signs "No outside food or drinks allowed" on every single possible corner

the presentation is in a mid-size room, there's about 40 people

overall the presentation is really fun (information wise), i mean, they didnt present it in the most innovative way, their powerpoint is what i regard as "pdf" powerpoint = there are so many words on every slide they may as well just show us their paper......

anyway


about the presentation:

12:44
The 2 most popular ranking nowadays are from :

THES (UK) 
http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings
(website unable to load)
and
Shanghai Jiao Tong University and their website below features " Top 500 World Universijijisdsasadsads" (not my typo)
http://www.arwu.org/rank/2007/ranking2007.htm

so the lectures goes on, talk about how limiting these rankings are, as they emphasize alot on Science and research, but not on Social Science/ Liberal Arts

12:52
....European universities are often shocked when they hear that in USA, money comes not only from PUBLIC/government but also PRIVATE...

12:53
....person presenting makes a good point:
national ranking of universities are odd
but international ranking of universities are even odder!
thats just like comparing soufflÃ© with sushi
 
13:00
....the presenter shared his experience:
on a trip to india, he met a person who, without hesitation can RECITE the top 100 of both THES and Shanghai list. It turns out that this person is a recruitment agent (he's got talent man) for UK and Australia universities. So this shows that the marketing of universities through these rankings really work!!!

Another example of how this marketing works:

13:08
University of Melbourne
introduced as not particularly good in Research, not good in governance either
but they "mercilessly" marketed themselves as one of the top 100 universities in the world according to the THES

(way out of topic, but, Columbia can advertise as ranked #7 on the Shanghai list, we are the LUCKY NUMBER college???? hahaha)

1:13
from Teachers College's Gita Steiner Khamsi

In a "shocking" German study about international literacy, Germans are shocked to learn that their country ranked 22 out of 41 in terms of students' literacy. The top 5 are Finland, Korea, Hong Kong, Canada and Japan
On another study which examines the level of Civic Education in German students. Researchers found that only 59% of  the German students think that it is important for immigrants to preserve their lifestyle and custom. (International average is 86%)
what is most disturbing is, this study, receives minimal media coverage in Germany, as if no body cares about it

1:32
finally some maps/ graphics. no more words
striking!

in this last part of the presentation (there is a "last last" part, but its so awfully done i will just skip it), we went through the resources provided for tertiary education in different countries
as we can all predict, USA ranks top, but Japan, China, and Europe are following very closely. In fact, when we look at the GROWTH of the resources, China and Japan are the 2 leading countries
Overall, the spending in all the southern hemisphere countries are shrinking, making them hard to compete with the northern part of the globe


afterthoughts:

even though i think the presentation is quite good, no one asks any questions during the Q/A section
seems like everyone is too hungry and cant wait to leave

as for me, i couldnt think of any questions at that time
but after a lunch conservation with Luci and Jenny

hahaha

I have a question!!!

so,
given that students are so prone to this ranking hype and more likely to apply to highly rated schools, what about professors? and researchers?
is it true that, they, just like any other human being who is a victim of marketing, will prefer jobs from universities mainly because they are ranked higher????

so,
even though on the surface we tell everyone else that the rankings are limited/useless but deep down, unconciously, we are still drawn/attracted to top ranked insitutions???


who do you think???
