          <p>
            MMOG stands for Massive Multiplay Online Game, such as World of Warcraft, SecondLife, etc. I came across this game called <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/" target=”_blank”>EVE Online</a> and an interesting article published on their website reviewing the social structures and evolutions in the EVE Online virtual community: http://myeve.eve-online.com/download/devblog/CSM.pdf

The article alleges that the EVE Online community started as a hunter-gatherer society when the game was privately tested in BETA in 2003, where individuals were on equal status in gameplay. Then when the game was publicly released, those old players started building corporations and served as corporation leaders commanding newbie players because they obviously have better knowledge about the game. After that, the game community continued to evolve and gradually formed "complex social hierarchies and organized government institutes".

The game company says they highly support and facilitate the current democratic system developed in the game community where councils are elected among the players to represent the whole player community. The council will hold regular meetings and report to the game company about the players' advice on future development of the game. 

In my mind it's more important for a "democratic game" to teach about the procedure of democracy than the outcome of it. In other words, only by interacting with other individuals and executing the democratic procedures can kids really learn the spirit of democracy. Many game designer/developers are thinking about and arguing for games of democracy, and I recall one raised the example of kids playing "house" or "war" where negotiation on who will be dad and who will be mom is even more important than the gameplay itself (see http://www.titoonic.dk/2006-08/democratic-game-design/). However that kind of negotiation is only an informal and vague form of democracy. The EVE Online article makes democracy most explicit and formal in the gameplay.
