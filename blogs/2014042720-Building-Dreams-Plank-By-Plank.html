This inspiring movie trailer of "If You Build It" follows the story of two dedicated teachers, designer-activist Emily Pilloton and her husband architect Matthew Miller, who head down to rural Bertie County, the poorest in North Carolina. Pilloton and Miller work with ten students to build a structure for a farmer’s market, a significant contribution in a town known for obesity and poor nutrition. What begins as a building project becomes an experience that forces high school students to develop a sense of self and an activity that reinvigorates the community. The project was a small step, but it planted the seeds for greater change, both in the students and in the community. The story gives a specific example of the educational power of projects, the theme of Pilloton’s TED Book: <a href=http://blog.ted.com/2012/12/07/new-ted-book-tell-them-i-built-this/>Tell Them I Built This</a>.<p>

"What if you could bring back shop class, but orient the projects around things the community needed," Pilloton poses. The project recalls another popular book, "<a href=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft>Shop Class as Soulcraft</a>," which argues for the necessity of building things in order to have a sense of purpose in one’s life. The inspiring story shows that our educational initiatives do not have to be divorced from the community surrounding them, and in fact, when education can be linked with local community needs, the experience will be more meaningful for students, teaching them how to bring about positive changes in their world. <p>
