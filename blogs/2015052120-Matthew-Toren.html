Matthew Toren is a serial entrepreneur, mentor, investor and co-founder of YoungEntrepreneur.com, <a href="http://bit.ly/15PFsAO">iSmallBusiness.com</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1Eqp1u5">Blogtrepreneur.com</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1Cg83xw">SBBV.com</a>. He is co-author, with his brother Adam, of the award-winning and best selling books Kidpreneurs and Small Business, BIG Vision: Lessons on How to Dominate Your Market from Self-Made Entrepreneurs Who Did it Right. 

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I feel very fortunate to have grown up in a family that encouraged learning and an education that included not just books, but also experimenting. I largely credit the influence of my mom in my formal education and my grandfather in my early, informal education. My grandfather would take my brother Adam and I out to swap meets at a young age and show us how to handle money and create value through sales. His influence was invaluable in instilling the hard working, industrious and innovative spirit that embodies entrepreneurship. So I started learning young about the principles of business by actually being involved hands on. </p>

<p>My brother Adam and I used the entrepreneurial education we received to tackle our very first job straight out of high school: purchasing our first rehab project. Growing up in Vancouver, Canada, we were able to identify and purchase a local, struggling billiard hall and cafe and over the course of a year, rehabilitate and reinvigorate the property and the perception of the place to where we had built a Friday night line that went around the corner. It took a tremendous amount of work, sacrifice and long, long hours from both of us, but at the end we were able to sell the business for a profit and leverage that money into new business ventures. It just kind of kept going from there so really the only profession I’ve ever had is being an entrepreneur. I’m lucky enough that my business partner is also my brother.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
Formal education is hugely important. It provides the structured, layered learning and curriculum that everyone needs to enjoy a more fulfilling and rewarding life; however, as a born and raised entrepreneur, my brother Adam and I really saw a gap in the educational landscape for teaching education to our children. We had the benefit of learning through family, but most don’t have that experience. As the economies and global cultures change in today’s climate, there is definitely a need for kids to know the value of entrepreneurship, regardless of whether or not they choose it as a career path.</p>

<p>When I had my own children, I really became passionate about closing this gap in formal education to include entrepreneurship as a subject of study just as important as history, language and any other core competency curriculum. Entrepreneurship teaches children self-esteem, resilient attitudes, belief in themselves and creativity. It’s a wonderful set of character traits for any child, or adult, to cultivate. My brother and I set out to create <a href="http://bit.ly/1ESbl8A">Kidpreneuers</a>, our passion project of teaching entrepreneurship to kids, through first a book, then a learning guide and parent/teacher’s curriculum that we have had an overwhelmingly positive response to in the marketplace. Teachers and parents alike are seeing the positive impact of our Kidpreneurs curriculum in their classrooms and homes. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The rise of entrepreneurship not as a fringe option for the daring few, but more a set of skills for all to embrace, is going to reshape our economy and hopefully, in tow, our learning curriculum for children. With the rise in tech and engineering fields, kids should know about running their own businesses, embracing their own radical ideas and participating in an increasingly share-based economy. Our kids and grandkids will be the generations that change the world and entrepreneurship is the toolkit that is going to help them do it.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> As usual, I have several irons in the fire. Adam and I are currently working on the particulars of some very exciting, massive rollout models for bringing more Kidpreneurs curriculum and activities to more children and educators. Our hope is Kidpreneurs will grow in the years ahead to become not just a nationwide movement, but a global one as well. I’m also working with Adam on a new passion project called <a href="http://bit.ly/1HlP2wN">Self-Made Magazine</a>, a publication totally dedicated to bringing expert advice from self-made people to the masses, to show individuals step-by-step how to build their own entrepreneurial dreams to life. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
I’m very active on Twitter (<a href="http://bit.ly/1A3totv">@MatthewToren</a>) and I love the instant access to so many people around the globe. I think some of the most interesting people I’m following are the entrepreneurs and hustlers . . . guys like Gary Vaynerchuk (<a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee">@GaryVee</a>), Ryan Holiday (<a href="http://bit.ly/1yFrbh1">@RyanHoliday</a>), and also the visionaries like Supriya Hobbs (<a href="http://bit.ly/1CQlXFP">@SupriyaHobbs</a>), the CEO and co-founder of Miss Possible Dolls, a company creating empowering, inspiring dolls for girls based on real women, like Marie Curie. These guys and gals all started from scratch and I’ve loved watching them build their business over the years from all different ages and markets.
