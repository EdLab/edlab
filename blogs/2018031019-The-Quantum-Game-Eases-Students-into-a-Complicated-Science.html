<p> At first glance, <a href="http://play.quantumgame.io/">The Quantum Game</a> looks like a traditional online puzzle game, but it’s more than just another middling brain teaser. The creator designed this game to introduce students to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics and prepare them for the coming <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41362">quantum computing revolution</a>.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>There are 34 different levels in The Quantum Game that all involve shooting a photon beam into a light emitter while navigating through obstacles and other barriers. Each level has been designed around a famous quantum mechanics experiment, such as the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">Michelson-Morley experiment</a>, or introduces a new concept, such as how to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation">attenuate</a> a light beam.</p>  

<p>At the start of each level, new items are presented that affect the beam in a different way; for instance, polarizing beam splitters fire photons off in a certain direction, much as they would in a real physics experiment. By the end of the game, students should have a fluency in the basic terms and concepts of quantum mechanics.</p> 

<p>On a technical note, the game gives players the option of jumping around to different levels. Allowing players to skip over the more frustrating sections should keep them playing longer without giving up.</p>  

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>I must admit that I am not too interested in the puzzle game genre, so I found most of the levels annoyingly challenging. The solutions are quite difficult, and I had to skip over many sections as I failed over and over again.</p>

<p>The frustration almost compelled me to quit the review early, but I’m glad I didn’t give up. While I couldn’t see the learning value early on in the process, as I played further, I slowly began to understand the game’s innovative educational uses. </p>

<p>That said, without a teacher or other motivations pushing users along, they might give up early, just as I almost did. The game would ideally be used by an instructor who could pair the levels with actual lessons on the subjects. </p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>There might be a temptation to dismiss The Quantum Game as a run-of-the-mill puzzle game: good for killing time, but without much educational value. On the contrary, the game is actually an impressive interactive learning tool. Playing through the game will gently introduce students to dense scientific concepts and provide a foundational understanding of concepts related to the looming quantum computing revolution.</p>
