          <p>
            It is common for most people to use difficulties they encounter in their lives as the impetus to success. This is the case of <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/ugandan-entrepreneur-creates-education-opportunity-for-girls/2558397.html" target = "blank">Beatrice Ayuru</a>, a Ugandan entrepreneur who always had a vision of providing a quality education for girls. She is one of 16 children. At the age of 19, she received a land from her father. She initially used the land as a cassava farm.  After making enough money from the farm and two other side businesses, she used the land to open the Lira Integrated School. Since its inception in 2000, about 1,500 students (both boys and girls) have been enrolled in the school. The school goes from nursery to high school, and the tuition is $90 a year. 

I believe that Beatrice serves as an inspiration to many people, especially those children who are or have been enrolled at her school. Amid all the difficulties, she was able to fulfill her dream of building a school for Uganda's youth.  A few years ago, Beatrice broke ground to build a university.
