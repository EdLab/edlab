          <p>
            This morning, I woke up to find that the EdLab Blog <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5784"> had turned on my dear hometown of Chicago</a>. Feeling the need to redeem the library system at one of our foremost universities after it took such a heinous blow of defamation, I submit for approval an article about the slick tech that drives UChicago's newest library. 

"In high-density automated shelving systems, barcoded items are sorted by size and stored in bins. The technology underlying high-density automated shelving (known as automated storage and retrieval systems, or ASRS) has been used in other industries for many years. Ford and GM store new cars in such systems. The Chicago Tribune uses an ASRS for assembling its Sunday papers.

The Joe and Rika Mansueto Library's ASRS will shelve materials underground by size rather than library classification, in racks 50 feet high, with a capacity to hold 3.5 million volumes in one-seventh of the space of conventional shelves.

<!--break-->

All items selected for the ASRS will have their barcodes scanned and will be placed in barcoded bins that will be stored in the ASRS. Each item will be scanned whenever it is removed from and returned to the ASRS, as will the new bin into which the item is deposited. This will allow the Library's computerized systems to track the location of all materials stored in the ASRS at all times, and will allow Library patrons to request materials from any computer with an Internet connection, via the Library's catalog or search engine, Lens. Rare and archival materials from the Special Collections Research Center will be stored in boxes that will be barcoded and stored in special racks along with extremely large materials (elephant folios) and retrieved in a similar manner. Upon request, a robotic crane will retrieve materials stored in the ASRS almost instantaneously (within minutes of a patron's order)."
