            Hello!  I am new to the library services desk this past fall. I'd write more here, but there's no reason; the below penetrating questions say it all.

<strong>Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</strong>
No,  actually.  I am studying Library Science over at Queens College, CUNY.  If you find it difficult to find what you’re looking for in the catalog  or databases, don’t worry, there’s a Science to it.  Just ask for help!
<strong>
Where’s your hometown?</strong>
We  moved a lot when I was a kid.  What do I mean by a lot?  Well, I was  born in Florida, then we moved to Connecticut, then back to Florida,  then to Wisconsin, then to Swarthmore,  Pennsylvania, then to a small town outside Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  After this, I moved to Northampton MA to go to college, and then after  graduating, I moved to Seattle.  While I was there, my parents moved  twice.  People always ask me, “Is your dad in the army?” and, “Are you  in the Federal Witness Protection Program?”  But no, the real and  somewhat insane reason we moved so often is: my parents enjoy moving!

<strong>Your favorite meal?</strong>
This is an impossible question. I love every meal.

<strong>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it: </strong>
You  might laugh, but I like “Stay” by Lisa Loeb exactly the same amount  every time I hear it. It’s a perfect song; it’s quiet and loud, it’s  sentimental and practical, it has love and heartbreak, it’s insanely  cheesy. It has it all.  When I was in college I worked as a radio DJ at  the college station, and one shift I told my listeners I would play  “Stay” over and over again until a listener called me (an act of  desperation!) Five seconds after my announcement, a listener called in.  Apparently I am the only one who feels this way about “Stay.”

<strong>A country you’d like to visit?</strong>
I desperately want to visit Australia, because of Gay Mardi Gras.  Sounds like paradise.

<strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>
So  many things! When I was really little I created an imaginary store  called Bean Bins.  It was an all purpose store, for which I created an  elaborate catalog, and I would try to “sell” the items to my parents. In  elementary school I decided I wanted to be a magazine editor, and so I  made my own fake publication, complete with ads and letters to the  editor, which I gave out to my friends (I still do this, actually, but  now I call it a zine).  When I was in middle school I came up with this  fabulous future plan, which involved running a cafe with a magazine  production center down below the cafe, and offices up above.  I drafted a  blue-print of the imagined space on my dad’s architecture paper, and  showed it to him. He said, “You’re going to have to sell a lot of  coffee.”

<strong>What was your first job?</strong>
McDonalds, when I was 16.  I learned ALL about the value of the dollar at that job.

<strong>What has been your worst job?</strong>
Read the question above.

<strong>What has been your best job?</strong>
Oh, I’ve liked all of them, for different reasons.

<strong>What do you remember about your first day of school?</strong>
I  don’t know that this was my first day ever, but my earliest memory of  preschool is when my teacher asked us to skip in a circle and I couldn’t  properly execute the skip. How does one move the legs to make the skip  happen? I started crying and we had some kind of group hug and I got  over it. That’s my first school memory.
<strong>
A book you strongly recommend?</strong>
It’s not possible to choose just one, but I’m always jealous when a friend says they haven’t read<a href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=1949&amp;recCount=50&amp;recPointer=1&amp;bibId=6277265"> Alison Bechdel’s <em>Fun Home</em>. </a>Also, <a href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=1964&amp;recCount=50&amp;recPointer=8&amp;bibId=1535508">Joan Didion’s <em>Play It As It Lays</em> </a>(and <a href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=1964&amp;recCount=50&amp;recPointer=9&amp;bibId=1535504">Didion’s <em>The White Album</em></a>--fabulous!)

<strong>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)?</strong>
I used to play lots of sports but now I just love running.

TOP THREE….
<strong>…Best places to read?</strong>
In the shower.  While skydiving. While standing on my head.

<strong>Complete the sentence:
The strangest thing that has ever happened to me was…</strong>

Off the top of my head, here's a strange story:  you  know how when you get on a crowded subway the first thing you do is  look for your favorite spot?  Some like the chair by the door, some like  the chair by the pole, etc. I like to stand dead center in the car so  no one can accuse me of not “moving in.” Anyway, one time I got on a  car and moved in to my favorite “center of the car” spot, but when I  grabbed the pole to hold on, the pole moved.  Whoa.  Then I noticed that  I was actually holding a pole a woman brought herself.  I guess she got  the pole at Lowe’s and was going to install it somewhere in her home.   The pole looked exactly like the real subway pole.  So when I grabbed  onto the woman’s personal pole she started laughing, and then I started  laughing, and then most of the folks around us started laughing too.   I’m used to people pointedly ignoring each other on the subway, so the  whole car laughing was pretty strange.

<strong>Most fascinating person I’ve ever met was…</strong>
There  are so many characters in my neighborhood.  One of my neighbors is an  elderly man missing most of his teeth who barks at my dog every time we  pass.  Another neighbor likes to play classic rock out his window and  sets up his bongo drums on his front stoop so he can play along.  Then  there’s a group of guys who hang out by the corner store on lawn chairs  telling stories all day. That's what I love about living here: we're all a bunch of weirdos.

<strong>The weirdest thing I’ve ever done for money was…</strong>
When  I was 19 I was in a psychology experiment with the Brigham Women’s  Hospital in Boston (another place I lived, I forgot to mention) for a  sleep study.  They were studying whether you could change your circadian  rhythm by changing the light conditions both in your home and at work  to trick the body into thinking day was night, night was day--the study  was designed to help  folks who work night shifts.  Anyway, I was in the  control group, and so I had to stay awake for 36 hours straight in low  lighting conditions without getting up or really moving at all, while  performing a battery of “intelligence” tests over and over again on a  computer. Every half hour I ate a tiny turkey sandwich and a tiny cup of  water, so I was exactly the same amount of hungry/full throughout the  36 hours.  I hope my small contribution helped science, but I have no  desire to do anything like it again.
