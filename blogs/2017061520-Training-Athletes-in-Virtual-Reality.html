<p>A startup has created a new type of immersive performance sports training that relies on virtual reality (VR) to prepare athletes for the field. Started as a master’s thesis at Stanford University, <a href="http://strivrlabs.com">STRIVR</a> is now used by 24 professional and college sports team in four different sports. This includes Clemson University, the Dallas Cowboys, and the New York Jets. VR training is particularly helpful for athletes with injuries who can’t physically train with their team, but is also used as a supplement to regular practice.</p>

<p>To become a good athlete, a person must have both the physical and mental talent to perform at the highest level during a game. While VR doesn’t test the physical, it does help athletes practice the mental side of the sport by placing them in real sports situations where they can run through rep after rep from various perspectives around the field.</p>

<p>How do you think VR can help train athletes in a way that hasn’t been done before? Do you think athletes gain something more from experiencing drills in VR than they would from watching drills on TV or on the sideline of a real practice? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/37330/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:55 Evans.Asamoah:</b> I think it is a better experience because VR [includes] a scenario of you being in the game. It grants you with a better view as to what exactly is transpiring on the field. It requires [you] to also figur[e] out the right movements or actions to take in whatever scenario you are in. This is a way you can train without the physical punishment.</p>

<p><b>@01:49 RuthS:</b> VR seems to be more about the mental game than the physical game. To rise above the competition, a good athlete has to have a good mental game, and VR seems like it could help hone those skills even off the field.</p>
