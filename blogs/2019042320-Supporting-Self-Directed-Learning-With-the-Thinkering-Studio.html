<p> Birmingham Covington School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan is committed to supporting student inquiry and research. To encourage this, the school offers an elective called the Thinkering Studio, which allows students to select their own learning project and manage themselves throughout the process. Ideas for projects range from learning to play the ukulele to creating a Youtube channel for DIY videos. </p>

<p>The teacher doesn’t tell students what to do but acts as a facilitator by offering resources and asking questions to help students clarify their thinking. Students don’t have to go to the teacher for help and are encouraged to reach out to other students for support in their projects. There are also peer critique groups each week where students can provide feedback on each other’s work. Through this process, the program designers hope to set students up for lifelong self-directed learning.  </p>

<p>What are the advantages of this self-directed approach to learning? What would you have done if you’d had the opportunity to pursue your own project in middle school? What skills are students learning through this process? How might it impact their approach to work and learning in the future? Add your thoughts to the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48260">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:30 Betsy Harrington:</b> Self-directed learning seems like a great way to boost student engagement, but it is also important for students to learn things in school that they are not as naturally interested in. Some of the most valuable skills I gained in high school came from persevering through classes I didn't especially like.</p>

<p><b>@01:10 Melanie Hering:</b> I love that this course fosters lifelong learning. Teaching students that they can direct their own learning, and encouraging them to realize that it doesn't always have to happen at a desk, is such a valuable skill.</p>
