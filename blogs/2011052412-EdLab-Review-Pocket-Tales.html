<b>Description</b>:

Pocket Tales is an online social website where kids record the books they've read and want to read, at this point still closed to the public.  It is developed to promote reading by offering rewards for completed books, and encouraging reading competitions between friends.  The user must answer a short quiz to prove they've finished a book, for which they will receive points (the number of points based on the difficulty of the book).  After receiving a certain number of points, they gain a level.  Users can also win “amulets” by reading books, writing reviews, making friends, etc.  Children who sign up have to be authorized by a parent, and these parents can then keep track of their child's progress on a “parent account.”  There is no mechanism for communication outside of the friending, reviewing, and recommending features.  
<!--break-->
Pros:
The basic idea of encouraging reading through rewards and competitions seems very sound to me.  Even on sites like Goodreads or Librarything I think one can feel an implicit competition at work (who can log the most books) that Pocket Tales makes explicit and motivational.  The layout of the site is simple and attractive, and I found it fairly intuitive.  With the youth of their users in mind, they have not cluttered it up with extraneous options or windows.

Cons:
The downside of the uncluttered, simplistic interface is that the website is not as interactive as could be hoped.  The rewards so far are fairly minimalistic, and, as books aren't available on the website until a quiz has been written for them, the selection in the library is very small.  Granted, the website is still in development, and hopefully a much larger catalog will be available soon.  

Generally speaking, the returns to the user of a social website like this is largely dependent on the size of the user base, so at this stage in the process, I think the experience looks very different than it (hopefully) will farther down the line.  The competitive and rewards to reading aspect of the site is its best feature, but may only be attractive to already committed readers.

Relevance:
I have often thought that traditional learning should find some way to incorporate the motivational power of competition and structured rewards that we find, for instance, in video games, and this Pocket Tales, among other things, seems to accomplish.  I'm also impressed by the way social networking has been structured to eliminate extraneous conversations.   Of course a website designed for younger users is going to have to be more structured, but I think this approach may prove fruitful in other educational products.
