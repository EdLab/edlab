<a href="http://changetheequation.org/executive-office-staff">Dr. Linda P. Rosen</a>, is working to help "change the equation" of STEM (Science, technology, engineering & math) learning in the US.  Through her work as CEO of the aptly named nonprofit organization, <a href="http://changetheequation.org/about-change-equation">Change the Equation</a>, she has helped over 100 member organizations from the business community to, "...align their philanthropic and advocacy efforts so that they add up to much more than the sum of their parts."  Rosen has used her extensive experience as a leader in the business and policy communities to help Change the Equation to grow and make an impact in three focal areas: advocacy, inspiring young people, and improving philanthropic investments in strong STEM programs.  For example, in addition to leading Change the Equation, Rosen has worked as Senior VP for the National Alliance of Business, and as a Senior Advisor to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Riley">U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley</a>, led the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century and worked as the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.nctm.org/">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics</a>.  Finally, Rosen led the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, also known as the John Glenn Commission, and has worked as a mathematics teacher at the high school through graduate level, proving that she not only has deep industry and policy experience, but also equally deep education expertise.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My path to STEM started on the first day of junior high, when my math teacher introduced us to number bases other than ten. Yes, it was the New Math, and I couldn’t get enough of it! The beauty and order of mathematics were my siren call. As an undergraduate, I studied math at Case Western Reserve and George Washington Universities and went straight on to get my Masters from Teachers College, which set me on the path to teaching and education.  Over the course of my career, I have taught high school through graduate school. You can take a teacher out of the classroom, but you can’t take the love of the classroom out of a teacher. So, after completing my Ph.D. at the University of Maryland—College Park, I was hired at a ‘start-up’: the Mathematical Sciences Education Board at the National Academy of Sciences. It was an incredible experience to be able to work with experts in my field, whose research results I had been reading through my graduate career. And it was eye-opening to witness first-hand the trials and tribulations of a start-up. But what was most valuable was the amazing mentoring I received by the Executive Director. We were a staff of two at the beginning, so I was privileged to be a part of strategy sessions and nearly every detail of the beginnings of the organization. It was a quick yet in-depth lesson from a gracious teacher. At this point in my own career, I’m especially mindful of opportunities for me to ‘give back’ through mentoring.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Two things stand out as particularly significant to my current work.  My first professional job, after I got my Masters, was as a high school math teacher. I found it alternately inspiring and frustrating – inspiring because I had the opportunity to light the same spark in my students that had been lit for me through an introduction to and mastery of mathematics, the language of STEM, and frustrating because the curriculum materials were often inadequate in meeting my students’ learning needs. I was constantly supplementing the materials distributed by the school system—and long before the days of teacher websites—I was creating all of these materials on my own. In retrospect, I’m sure many of them had their own drawbacks. But my major take-away (that motivates my thinking to this day) was the critically important role of the teacher.
<p>

While the Math and Science Advisor to Secretary Richard Riley at the U.S. Department of Education, I came to see how sound policy can emerge from competing priorities and beliefs. And I learned about the importance of ensuring that different points of view had a voice at the decision-making table. I also learned a lesson in how to gain a seat at the decision-making table -- not by insisting that your way is best, but rather by acknowledging the challenges others are facing and the ways in which a solution to those challenges might be found.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Corporate America cares deeply about strengthening the pipeline of those with solid STEM knowledge. My work at Change the Equation is helping our coalition of major corporations become more strategic in their philanthropic giving, ensuring a return on investment  -- which is more critical to them now than ever before, and more effective in their advocacy for smart policies that impact STEM learning on the local, state, and national level.
We’re able to do this through our work, which focuses on proven effectiveness—among programs and education policies.  Our Design Principles for Effective STEM philanthropy is a hands-on tool that corporate leaders and funders can use to make meaningful decisions about funding STEM programs.  And our Vital Signs state-by-state reports provide the most comprehensive collection of data about STEM learning to illuminate areas where new policies and practices are most needed.
<p>
We’ve also been able to make clear what funders are looking for so that STEM programs are able to improve.  We seek to change the conversation amongst program developers, program implementers, and funders – and, we hope, making each more effective.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> As I look ahead, I think that the sound implementation of both Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards will have a significant impact on learning, teaching and assessing what’s important.  The corporate community is rallying behind these standards and supporting the states that have signed onto them because they believe, like I and many in the education community do, that we have to hold all of our students to high standards and then teach to those standards to ensure a strong school to college or career pipeline. 
<p>
The movement towards hands-on learning and real-world connections to content is critical. Although these phrases have been in the lexicon for many years, they are taking on new significance in the knowledge economy. Occupations that we can’t even imagine today will require tomorrow’s workforce. Knowing how to take messy problems and apply core knowledge to identify the solutions — whether they are workplace issues or challenges of a participatory democracy — is a skill needed by every educated individual.  Emerging technologies have impacted – and will continue to impact – student learning significantly.  The technology is changing, growing, expanding in ways that optimize and personalize student learning. Technology can enable students to draw valid generalizations from computer simulations.  And that’s just today – what tomorrow holds hasn’t even been dreamt of yet!
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> Change the Equation is entering our fourth year.  Having accomplished an ambitious agenda in our first three years, we are refocusing our work and looking at how best to channel corporate resources, passion and gravitas for STEM learning.  It’s critical that we focus on what inspires young people to go into STEM careers and how Corporate America can support that through their investment in high-quality STEM learning programs and smart policy advocacy.
