            <i>I know Joanna has written about the same <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7038">article</a>, so think of this Trends in Ed as build on that article, (I was halfway through when her article was posted).</i>

An <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/technology/idaho-teachers-fight-a-reliance-on-computers.html?ref=education">article</a> from the NY Times describes how high school teachers in Idaho are resisting a statewide plan that dictates how computers should be used in classrooms. State legislators passed a law in the previous year that would require all high school students to take some online classes to graduate, and that students and teachers receive laptops or tablets. One issue is that to pay for these two programs, the state may have to take millions of dollars from teachers and school administrators. This will remove more teachers from the classrooms to ensure that every student gets a laptop or tablet. It's easy to see why teachers would be upset over this, as it seems like the state wants to replace teachers with computers. 

It does not seem like the state legislator has an exact plan on how these computers will be used in the classrooms, which seems like they are just throwing technology around schools to say that they're “high-tech”. There will be some training for teachers on how to use the devices and integrate them into their classrooms, although details are yet to be revealed. Most frustrating of all is the fact that they'll be less teachers so that there's more computers in the classroom. We need more teachers now than ever to guide students, not only through their traditional school subjects, but how to actually use the technology to perform tasks like proper online research! What we are still seeing in Idaho is a different kind of way to force a “one-size-fits-all” solution to educators and students, making everyone learn online will not necessarily be beneficial for everyone. Not every student learns by the Socratic Method but also not every student can learn through computers, what we need to do is cater to the different ways students learn and that's why we need more teachers.
