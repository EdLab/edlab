<p><a href="http://duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a> hopes to harness the energy of language learning in order to translate the Internet. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_von_Ahn">Luis von Ahn</a>, creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">reCAPTCHA</a>, worked with the amazingly-monikered <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~shacker/">Severin Hacker</a> to produce the tool which, like reCAPTCHA, crowdsources humans to do what computers cannot. DuoLingo has been running in beta since November 2011 and opened to the public this June, with <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/duolingo-goes-public-after-125000-users-translated-75-million-sentences-during-beta-2012-06"> 75 million translated </a>sentences already in the bank. 
</p><p>
One of the few language learning startups aimed at intermediate and advanced language learners, DuoLingo lures language learners to the program with the potential rewards of contributing to the greater good. After a brief lesson that introduces grammar and vocabulary points through a variety of rapid-fire challenges, users are able to put their new skills to work translating snippets from Wikipedia and around the web. von Ahn <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQl6jUjFjp4">brags</a> that with one million site users, DuoLingo could translate Wikipedia to Spanish in 80 hours. According to von Ahn, the crowdsourcing and crowd-checking features of the site also mean that translations produced in DuoLingo are as accurate as those done by professional translators. 
</p><p>
<b>Pros:</b>
The site employs a mixed-methods teaching approach common to online language learning: In each session users see pictures, translate text, listen to audio, and choose from drop-down multiple choice lists. DuoLingo is noticeably cleverer than most of its language system kin. Features like advanced awareness of misspellings and automatic pronouns that pop into the drop-down menu when typed prevent the frustrating bête noires of similar software and allow learners to focus on vocabulary and grammar while moving quickly through the lesson. Students are rewarded for their efforts with coins, trophies, and progress bars, but the real translation work is the most satisfying aspect of DuoLingo. The real content is challenging and gratifying enough to draw users in. DuoLingo is globalizing human knowledge and the taste it provides to learners, of formerly inaccessible content becoming accessible, comes intoxicatingly close to the heart of our desire to accumulate language. 
</p><p>
<b>Cons:</b>
DuoLingo has a lot going on and the path is sometimes unclear. The gamification elements are extreme and it’s easy to get lost amongst the coins, calendars, progress bars, and flow charts. The active sessions are very simple and intuitive and the variety of translations available allows even beginners to get in on the fun right away. However, some users might be frustrated by the lack of concrete lessons in the system. DuoLingo is action-oriented and only explains concepts on the fly. It adapts to user challenge areas and it never takes the time to explain problem concepts. The system is clearly built for the Web and is well aware that language learners are only a quick tab away from any straightforward answer they seek. Pricklier questions are crowdsourced in the forum, naturally.
</p><p>
<b>Future Possibilities:</b>
Language learning is expensive, human translation is valuable, and merging these two realities is genius. If DuoLingo can muster a significant user base, it could flat-out change the business of translation. The pedagogy of the site might not be utterly sound, the system itself might be a tad distracting, but DuoLingo is doing something and that just might keep users coming back. 
</p><p>
<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
DuoLingo is a gratifying system that has the potential to be extremely powerful.</p>
