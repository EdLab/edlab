          <p>
            I just came across this <a href="http://www.accenture.com/NR/rdonlyres/0E2A280F-EAB9-47B6-8980-C25C29869275/0/accenture_survey_growth.pdf">survey commissioned by Accenture</a> which lends another voice to our discussions of creativity and innovation.  Analysis of open ended questions to members of the private sector, and at multiple levels of management, suggested a few relevant themes:

1. Companies associate innovation with growth
2. At every level, leaders are more enthused with their organizations ability to plan for innovation than to implement it.
3. Managers are more process oriented than C-level executives.
4. At all levels, leaders perceive a lack of internal collaboration to be the greatest hindrance to innovation.

The latter point is most relevant to the lab and warrants some thought.  

However, if you look through the data, you'll find another potential puzzle.  Organizations cite increasing specialization as a primary driver for growth, while at the same time pointing to the need for collaboration.  Most research points to the benefits of collaboration as resulting from multiple vantage points.  And this is commonly done by cross-cutting teams.  So how will the increasingly specialized companies (if they are to exist) maintain the necessary variety of perspectives to promote innovation while maintaining a single raison d'etre?  

This tension is commonly seen in companies dealing with increasingly changing environments (all companies?).  For example, gas companies now have specialized subunits dedicated to production, and specialized units dedicated to new energy research and exploration.  But the two rarely intersect and often look more like two distinct organizations who share a name by happenstance, not practicality.  

How will the successful organizations maintain specialized subunits with sufficient horizontal integration?  To clarify, if my company needs to divide into several specialized subunits (e.g. TSI, MDC, CSG, TCR...), how do I maintain sufficient collaboration between these groups given the increased specialization?  What is most interesting here may not be the management perspective, but the question of "sufficient horizontal integration."  Current research and management perspectives suggest that we may use variety of perspective as a reasonable measure of predicted group creativity.  But is there some critical threshold of between group interactions which predicts sufficient variability in perspective?  In network analysis terms, is there some critical max flow between cliques which is sufficient to inundate clique B with a contagion from clique A?
