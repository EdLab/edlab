Michael Warshaw has held various leadership roles with multiple business-focused publications over his expansive journalism career.  Most recently, Warshaw was an editor of the business section of The Boston Globe, for which he still contributes through their boston.com website.  Specifically, Warshaw curates content for their <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/state-of-play/">"State of Play"</a> blog which he runs for <a href="http://www.massdigi.org/">Mass DiGI</a>.  Warshaw is also the Director of Communications and Public Affairs at Becker College (Mass DiGI is housed here) where he oversees outreach and "digital storytelling" for the 225 year-old institution.   Warshaw credits his early journalism experience as playing a pivotal role in cultivating his "perspective on what makes a good story" and ultimately allows him to help Becker College to tell theirs.    
<p>
<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> Not much. I did not study journalism in college, but made my way into it through radio, moving to print in my 20s.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Just prior to joining Becker College, I spent five and a half years as an editor in the business section of The Boston Globe. Before that, I was the editor of a local alternative newsweekly for six years, and earlier, an editor with several business magazines. I managed staffs and budgets, ran projects, and responded to deadlines in atmospheres that encouraged professionalism, engagement, and creativity. I could also see the effects of my work; I was held personally responsible for the effects stories had on individuals and the community. That experience deepened my appreciation for the role of the storyteller and the components of the story itself. At Becker, it feels as though my perspective on what makes a good story and how it is best told can help the college and its people.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Becker has a history that dates back to 1784, but is a small college that until recent years did not have much of a profile in its community. Now, though, it is bucking the trend of small institutions that struggle with the forces of rapid change unleashed by innovations in online education and mounting financial pressures faced by students and their families. It is aggressively seeking a new model on its own, surfing the waves of change rather than standing still to be drowned by them. The future is still unknown, but we’re taking some bold steps, and we’ve had some real wins. And by virtue of being a professional storyteller, maybe I can help the institution communicate its journey to its community. That helps bring people together towards common goals. If Becker successfully remakes itself for the century to come, it will provide a model for modest institutions of higher learning to emulate. My best hope is to make some small contribution in that direction.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Clearly, higher education is taking a path that is not dissimilar to the one newspapers have been forced into in the last few years. Think of the parallels; newspapers reacted to the Internet by placing their expensive content online for free, not realizing how fast their traditional business model could collapse. After many were devastated by cutbacks and losses, newspapers are now struggling to get readers to pay.
The connection to readers is not broken. It’s the connection to the money that pays for the content that snapped. The unbelievable has already happened. Cities that need news organizations to maintain an informed citizenry or simply keep officials honest have lost their newspapers. The foes of a free press are smelling blood, which is why some politicians feel free to call for prosecution of journalists that report on the leaks that revealed the NSA’s digital surveillance of Americans.
<p>
Higher education faces almost exactly the same pressures, and an equally dire prospect, as newspapers. The business model was already beginning to become untenable, as a college education got more and more expensive and fewer citizens could afford it. Then there is the new competition from online college education from efforts like <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, which was built by Harvard and MIT, which have enough money to weather storms that may bury smaller institutions.
<p>
The key characteristic of college courses over the Internet is that they’re affordable, if not free. More and more are becoming accredited and valid towards degrees. A lot of colleges are leaping on the online learning bandwagon, and like newspapers did, are trying to give away digital versions of their very expensive core products.
Consider the pressures faced by colleges today: There’s a nationwide dialogue beginning that questions the value of a college education; traditional higher ed is too expensive for too many people; and cheap online college educations are experiencing explosive growth. No wonder a Howard University trustee warned recently that it has about three years to live.
<p>
The irony is that it seems unlikely online learning will replace traditional higher education. Like the laissez-faire brand of 1970s college that I attended, it cannot do enough to offer the personal attention and guidance individuals need to grow and flower. It certainly can’t offer the socialization experience that helps round out a young person’s identity, or expose him or her to people from different backgrounds and sensibilities.
<p>
We don’t know yet what the shape of higher education, online or off, will be. There are interesting efforts like the Minerva Project, which seeks to offer inexpensive online degrees combined with a campus experience; but it is unknown whether that will blend the advantages of both online and traditional higher ed, or the disadvantages.
It does seem likely that online learning will become a component of higher education. The question is whether it will do so before or after the turmoil surrounding its adoption claims many of our institutions of higher learning.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I just finished helping to produce a video for the 225th Commencement of Becker College from its origins to the future it is beginning to craft. (You can see it <a href="http://www.becker.edu/videos/centuries-of-tradition-becker-college-from-1784-to-the-21st-century/">here</a>). I’m now working on a number of publications for print and web, and am helping with outreach for the college and the <a href="http://www.massdigi.org/">Massachusetts Digital Games Institute (MassDiGI)</a>, a video games industry group which is headquartered here, for which I help run <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/state-of-play/">this blog</a> on The Boston Globe’s boston.com web site. </p>
