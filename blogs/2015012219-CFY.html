<p><i>"CFY is a national education nonprofit that helps students in low-income communities, together with their teachers and families, harness the power of digital learning to improve educational outcomes. CFY pursues this mission through the combination of its K-12 learning platform and its on-the-ground direct service initiative, the CFY Digital Learning Program."</i> (from the <a href="http://cfy.org/what-we-do/the-cfy-digital-learning-program/">CFY Digital Learning</a> site)</p>

<p>CFY’s (short for Computers for Youth) mission is to help low-income communities engage with digital learning. To this end, the organization works with teachers, parents, and students to help improve digital educational opportunities. CFY uses their free learning platform, <a href="http://cfy.org/what-we-do/powermylearning/">PowerMyLearning.org</a>, to introduce educators and students to the best in educational technology; they also offer <a href=" http://cfy.org/what-we-do/the-cfy-digital-learning-program/">digital learning programs</a>, including support for school leaders, teacher professional development, family learning workshops, and support for at-home technology.</p> 

<p><b>A Learning Community</b><br>
PowerMyLearning is funded by the Gates, Broad, Kellogg, and SCE Foundations. It is designed for K12 parents, students, and educators and includes thousands of resources that are tagged by area (e.g., Common Core aligned, History, etc.) and by type of media (e.g., interactive simulation, academic game, etc.).  PowerMyLearning is free and accessible online. A favorite feature is the "playlist" function that allows students, teachers, or parents to create a playlist or sequence of activities. This allows teachers to develop a progression of activities or students to save favorite ones for the future. </p>

<p><b>Seeing Results</b><br>
CFY works with public and charter schools in grades 6-8 that have at least 75% of students on free or reduced lunch. An report in the <a href="http://cfy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-Digital-Tool-to-Unlock-Learning-NYTimes.pdf">New York Times</a> found that 6th graders with learning disabilities at one New York City middle school using PowerMyLearning saw a 36% improvement in test scores in 2011-12.  A <a href="http://cfy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CFY-Program-Impact-Summary-2013.pdf">survey CFY conducted in 2012-13</a> showed that 89% of student participants felt that "control over their learning was improved that year by how their teachers used computers and how their family supported them." Only time will tell whether CFY’s impressive work putting the right technology in the hands of low income students is enough to bridge the digital divide.</p>

<p>CFY has five US locations: New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, San Francisco and Santa Barbara. They are having their annual innovation learning awards this year in New York City at Chelsea Piers.</p>
