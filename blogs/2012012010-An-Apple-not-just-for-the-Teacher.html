            Big news in education, and it's an apple of <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/#video-textbooks">another kind</a>.

Apple's major education play seems poised for impact with textbooks, iBooks 2 and the new (and free) iBooks Author software tool.

Very interesting development, love (or hate) Apple, they are usually thinking 10 steps ahead contemplating quite complex issues and dynamics. Will these new tools 'solve' the educational issues in the US? Undoubtably the answer has to be yes for at least some issues, and I expect there are many areas that will be effected by this new initiative and educational tools that we haven't yet even considered.

One thing is a sure thing: our educational success-rate, as judged by the high school drop out rate in the US, has remained at a dismal 70% success-rate, also looked at statistically in reverse as a 30% failure-rate. That's for the last 30+ years. Unchanged.Â 

No finger pointing, there are just too many issues contributing to the failure-rate.Â 

I'm not sure how the landscape will be transformed by this Apple development, but it will be transformed. Only time will tell of the impact level for society. I do like Apple's approach to the troubling issues in their presentation highlighted in <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1201oihbafvpihboijhpihbasdouhbasv/event/index.html">this video </a>from their event launch, hosted by the Guggenheim Museum.

Biggest Plus in the new initiative: Engagement.Â 

Student engagement and interest in learning is one of the fundamental factors in the failure-rate. Many points to debate as to who may be at fault: Students? Parents? Teachers? Administrators? Curriculum? No easy answer to that, but if we focus on ways to engage students, that seems like a better starting point to define solutions than focusing all the discussion on blame.

These new textbooks are very engaging from what I see. They make it incredibly easy to study with user-friendly experiences built in to help do some of the heavy lifting in the learning process: getting the students interested in participating in their own education. Study, note-taking and Flash-card aids built-in. Text and audio visuals in one place. Amazing interactive glossary and index provide another learning route for students.

There are many other plusses from an initial review: cost savings on the textbooks (aggressively priced at $14.99 or less); books that can be kept up-to-date easily; books that can be created from a less limited supply source of experts; ease of flexibility that removes the issue of one or two states over-influencing the textbook's content, etc.

But the positives go far beyond traditional school education. The ease of creating the new books (with a free tool from Apple), combined with the ease of distribution to an end user, will transform much more than textbooks.

All books will likely take advantage of this type of tool very soon to create better learning and reading experiences. In the corporate world, it's easy to see how this will eventually transform a company's workforce development and training programs. You can imagine and every expert in every field will quite easily have their own book, not just the select few that could previously catch a publisher's attention.

We all are certain of one thing: education needs improvement. This is one step, and there may be many others. My take is to let this spark our imagination of what's possible for future tools, and how to potentially maximize learning opportunities.
