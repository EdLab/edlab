            I think we've all heard a lot about <i>Social Learning</i> from a successful case - <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. The idea is basically having the students coming in to the class with a little prior knowledge via watching the videos at home, then the class time will still be entirely devoted to the teachers, to help students with their understanding. This approach utilizes the <i>best</i> explainer out there substitutes the classroom teachers. Such platform can allow the class time be used in a productive way. Learning from the crowd definitely improves the pedagogy and allows all the audience to be in control and let the one who does the explaining to all. 

However, there are indeed several other approaches toward social learning. Yet, another one, which is rarely used, utilize the power of students in every class to teach, and learn from each other. So called, true peer-to-peer learning. The concept is not entirely new. We all know about the class activities are methods for promoting active learning in class, no matter how we group our students into pairs, teams. But technology mediated and facilitated peer to peer for in-class learning, that's considerably a new realm.
Professor Eric Mazur from Harvard's Physics Department, soft launched <a href="https://learningcatalytics.com/"><i>Learning Catalytics</i></a> system last late summer. (if it hasn't been discussed in EdLab, i can do another post to talk about this tool.) Basically, the idea returns the power of teaching back to students, and allows students learn from learning, making sense of what they are teaching and assimilating that information. 
<br><br>
Several successful examples of dissecting the peer-to-peer learning approach, including one of my own early projects :)
1. <b>peer discussion</b>
In an undergraduate genetics course, peer discussion enhances understanding, even when none of the students in a discussion group originally knows the correct answer.<br>
<i>Why Peer Discussion Improves Student Performance on In-Class Concept Questions
M. K. Smith, W. B. Wood, W. K. Adams, C. Wieman, J. K. Knight, N. Guild, and T. T. Su
Science 2 January 2009: 323 (5910), 122-124.</i>
<br><br>
2. <b>educational content construction by peers</b>
Having students as creators rather than consumers for producing educational content (i.e. word problems for Math ITS (Arroyo, 2003); programming code explanations (Hsiao & Brusilovsky, 2007) etc.). Several studies demonstrated that this approach works really well: not only the students were able to produce content that was useful for their peers, but they also learned a lot in this process. & Students are likely to learn more by constructing hypermedia instructional materials than by studying hypermedia created by others (Jonassen & Reeves, 1996). During the peer collaborative construction process, “Self-explanations,” is likely to happen and formulate the unwritten steps of an example or concept, and help students understand the problems (Chi et al., 1989). 
<br><br>
3. <b>peer tutoring</b>
learn from tutoring an agent (i.e. SimStudent (Matsuda, et. al, 2010)); adaptive help for reciprocal peer tutoring, the assistance improved the conceptual content of help and the use of interface features (Walker, et. al, 2011).
