            <a href="http://www.danagoldstein.net/dana_goldstein/2011/06/a-glut-of-new-reports-raise-doubts-about-obamas-teacher-agenda.html">Dana Goldstein recently posted</a> on the number of policy papers coming in against the push to incentivize teacher quality from a variety of sources (including AEI). This sentence really stuck out to me, "meanwhile, the National Center on Education and the Economy reported that high-achieving nations have focused on reforming their teacher education and professional development pipelines, not on efforts to measure student "growth" and tie such numbers to individual teachers."

Goldstein seems to be right-on in some sense. I do not think the education and testing system as it exists now serves as a good foundation for creating an effective merit-pay system. Assessments are simply too flawed and too limited in the information they offer in order to make major decisions about pay and employment. Thus, we should focus more on other ways of hiring more effective teachers in the first place. While there isn't a silver bullet indicator for whether a teacher is going to be effective, there are a suite of measures to look at to be sure. 

On the other hand, if you create a merit-pay system that has no sense of absolute measurement and is purely a matter of relativism, you create perverse incentives that can easily lead to cut-throatedness between teachers. Knowing how much a teacher is contributing absolutely is nearly as important as knowing how much a teacher is contributing relative to her peers
