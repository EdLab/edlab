            As a contemporary alternative to the now famous historical list of the <a href=http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/list.html> Seven Wonders of the Ancient World </a>, the New Wonders idea was developed by the Swiss-based New Open World Corporation (<a href=http://www.new7wonders.com/> NOWC </a>).  The NOWC nominated a number of global monuments through their website and began the voting process through the internet and text messages. With the slogan “Our Heritage is Our Future,” the popularity of the contest grew with nominated countries voting furiously for their own. On July 7, 2007 (07.07.07, how clever) the new winning seven were announced in Lisbon, Portugal in a ceremony with <a href=http://www.new7wonders.com/index.php?id=476 > celebrities </a> from around the world. From the fourteen nominated landmarks the following stood out: the Great Wall of China, Petra in Jordan, the Christ Redeemer Statue in Brazil, Machu Picchu in Peru, ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡ in Mexico, the Taj Mahal in India and the Roman Colosseum in Italy. To view a list of the other candidates click <a href=http://www.new7wonders.com/index.php?id=633> here </a>. 
<p>
Personally, my favorite contender was Machu Picchu. I mean, just <a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Peru_Machu_Picchu_Sunset.jpg>look at it </a>.That may, of course, be a biased opinion. But nevertheless each site has a wonder of its own. Let's break them down.
<p>
The Great Wall of China:
Built around the 5th Century BC to keep invading Mongol tribes from China, the wall is the largest man-made structure, stretching over 6,400 km. It is even visible from space! Renovated through many years, it was the Ming Dynasty that rebuilt it with bricks and brought it to its current size. View picture <a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Greatwall-SA3.jpg/800px-Greatwall-SA3.jpg> here </a>.
<p>
Petra, Jordan:
This archaeological site lying on the Arabian Desert in Jordan was once the capital of the Nabateans, an ancient people of Southern Jordan who were experts in creating aqueducts within the desert city which in turn formed an oasis. The water reserves could therefore be employed during the severe droughts which affect the area. The city prospered tremendously in this way. In general, the site demonstrates the impressive value of Middle Eastern culture. (Of course visiting Petra might be a bit dangerous…).

<p>
The Christ Redeemer Statue in Brazil:
Yes, it's Jesus. But how cool does he look just standing randomly there in Rio de Janeiro? Thirty-eight meters (that's over 100 feet) in height and weighing in at 700 tons, the Christ Redeemer is located at the peak of the Corcovado mountain some 2,000 feet above the city. With its construction overseen by Heitor da Silva Costa and its design by Paul Landowski, the monument was opened in 1931. Its appeal lies far from Catholicism and more within the scenery surrounding it. The true winner is Rio de Janeiro.

<p>
Machu Picchu in Peru:
Now you KNOW this is the best one because obviously the Incas built this hidden city in the Andes and damn straight it's still around. Also, the Incas were ONLY the best ancient civilization of the Americas. Okay, enough favoritism. Here's the deal. This pre-Columbian city was built by the Incas under the Incan emperor PachacÃºtec and is located at 8,000 feet on the Andes Plateau deep within the Amazon. Discovered by American archaeologist Hiram Bingham in 1911, Machu Picchu represents the community and dedication of the Incan people. It is breathtaking. Literally, since the altitude is so high.

<p>
ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡ in Mexico
Built by the Mayan civilization between 700AD and 900AD, ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡ is the most famous Mayan temple city. Exhibiting a series of architectural style (from a variety of ancient Mexican groups that display non-Mayan influences), ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡ represents the center of Mayan civilization and culture. With 92 steps on each of its four sides, it is truly a marvel. View picture <a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Chichen.JPG/800px-Chichen.JPG> here </a>.
<p>
The Taj Mahal in India
Located in Agra, this mausoleum was commissioned by Mugal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632. It is often considered the finest example of Muslim architecture. Built from white marble, the structure is highlighted by its vast garden. It is a symbol of Muslim culture and passion. The splendor of this Taj Mahal inspired Donald Trump to build his <a href=http://www.oneandonlymagazine.com/images/TajMahal.jpg> hotel </a> aptly named Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey. View picture of the real thing<a href=http://bulgar.no-ip.info/downloads/snimki/wall/Taj%20Mahal,%20Agra,%20India.jpg> here </a>.
<p>
The Roman Colosseum in Italy
Of course the Romans had to get in on this too. The Colosseum is located in Rome and was used as a giant amphitheatre for Gladiator contests and spectacles. Built around 70AD, the Colosseum was in use for nearly 500 years. It is a staple of the Roman civilization and its ruins have been preserved as best as possible since. Today, the Colosseum still stands as a symbol of Imperial Rome and the importance of Italy in history. View picture <a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg/800px-Colosseum_in_Rome%2C_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg> here </a>. 
<p>
The New Seven Wonders of the World are a mark of pride for the countries represented and will serve as excellent symbols of great ancient civilizations and architecture.
