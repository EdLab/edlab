<p>There is no better way to learn a language than by talking with native speakers. At least, this is the philosophy that led to the creation of <a href="https://www.hellotalk.com/#en">HelloTalk</a>. On this app, you can communicate with others around the world both to practice a foreign language and to help others learn one you speak proficiently. With more than 5 million users, the app provides connections in over 100 languages.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>HelloTalk feels like a social media app for language exchange. It’s an informal, low-pressure way to practice conversing with others, and its great number of functions makes it a valuable tool for all aspects of learning a language. You can practice a new language in several different ways. One way is to search through different profiles and start a one-to-one or group message thread with them. Each profile includes their country of origin, their native language, and the language they want to learn.</p>
 
<p>Another way to practice is to post on the message board. When you do this, people can correct your grammar. I found this an incredibly useful way to receive almost immediate feedback. Within twenty minutes of posting a question about Wonder Woman in French, three people responded to my post with grammar corrections and answers. HelloTalk can also translate sentences for you, either typed or spoken, and can put them into characters for a non-Roman alphabet language such as Mandarin. Finally, HelloTalk allows you to make free calls over the app to people in your network to allow you to practice verbally conversing.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>For me, the only negative aspect of HelloTalk was that, despite the creators’ best efforts, some users still treated the message boards like they might a dating app. Although the app consistently reminds users that it is a learning platform, I still received several "hey" messages from random guys that made me feel a bit uncomfortable. That said, these messages are easy enough to ignore.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I really like the idea behind HelloTalk, and I think it pulls it off well. Receiving grammar feedback from native French speakers created a space where I learned without feeling pressure to construct sentences perfectly the first time I tried writing. HelloTalk creates a multilingual social media platform where you can be both a student and a teacher. Besides the unwanted messages from some users, I really enjoy using this app and feel like it’s the type of innovative idea other language-learners will find valuable.</p>
