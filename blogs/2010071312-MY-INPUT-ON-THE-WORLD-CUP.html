          <p>
            As one of the only interns who doesn't watch soccer or let alone play soccer, I found myself drawn to the World Cup these past few weeks. I'm not a big fan of soccer yet, when your nation plays you feel an urge to support them. I found myself drawn to the games when my family huddle around the television and watch the games when I was around. After a while I found myself watching the games, which involved Ghana, with my family. I began to yell and shout when Ghana missed vital opportunities to score. I thought to myself why am I so excited knowing I hate soccer and hated playing it even more.

 With each passing game I became more and more excited, especially when Ghana defeated the United States 2 - 1 in the round of 16. When Ghana played Uruguay in the quarterfinals, I had the pleasure of watching the game with some of my co â€” workers and when Ghana ended up losing on penalty kicks, I could feel the sadness of those co-workers who were supporting Ghana. I didn't understand why I was sad since I'm not a big fan of soccer, but the connection I have with my Ghanaian roots probably was in play.

By they way congratulations to Spain for winning the World Cup!!!
