<p><i>"We believe in making education and growth accessible to anyone–especially underrepresented groups in the tech industry."</i> (<a href="https://www.galvanize.com/about">About Galvanize</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Educating Students</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.galvanize.com">Galvanize</a> is a learning community that intends to foster mutually educational relationships among students, entrepreneurs, and companies. Galvanize offers full-time, semester-long courses in web development and data science at eight urban campuses across the country. The courses offered, however, are more expensive and demand more time than those offered by similar organizations, or even many universities: you can learn to become a web developer in 24 weeks for $21,000 or a data scientist in 12 weeks for $16,000. Yet Galvanize claims this investment pays off: their NYC graduates apparently have an 87% placement rate and a $70,000+ starting salary. It’s unclear to me, however, who is teaching these courses, whether they are actual professors with pedagogical experience or just business people without teaching training stepping into the roles. In this already saturated alternative education space, it will be interesting to see whether students and companies jump on board with Galvanize’s costs and promises among all the other, perhaps less costly, options.</p>

<p><b>Mentoring Entrepreneurs</b></p>
 
<p>In addition to the full-time course load offered at the Galvanize campuses, the organization offers services exclusively for budding entrepreneurs creating startups. Through workshops and mentorships, aspiring entrepreneurs can learn skills such as how to scale their startup, fundraise, and lead their team. Some upcoming workshops have titles such as <i>Amazon Alexa: Skills Development Workshop</i> and <i>Am I, or Can I Be a Data Scientist?</i> Galvanize currently has over 200 mentors, each an entrepreneur in the tech industry willing to provide guidance and advice to navigate the hurdles that come with creating a startup.</p>

<p><b>Training Employees</b></p>
 
<p>Finally, Galvanize also works directly with companies to grow tech skills from within. Because businesses are changing so rapidly as they spread across digital platforms, employees don’t always have the skill sets required to keep up with the progress. Galvanize has a series of courses designed specifically for companies and workers to address the digital demands of modern times.</p>
