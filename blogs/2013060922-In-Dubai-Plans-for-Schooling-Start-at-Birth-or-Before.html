            How would you feel if your parents registered you for school before you were born? I personally feel like things would have been easier if my parents knew and had taken such a decision. However, I also understand why they couldn't make that kind of decision because of how the school system is set up in my native Ghana. In this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/world/middleeast/in-dubai-cost-and-waits-for-school-pose-hurdles.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=education&">article</a>, parents in Dubai search for private schools for their children during pregnancy. The reason why parents in Dubai have started to take this action is due to rising tuition fees. Parents fear that in the future, they will not be able to afford their children's tuition fees. For instance, private schools earned an estimated 4.1 billion dirhams or about $1.1 billion in total revenues received from tuition fees during the 2011-2012 academic year. This number was 16.4 percent increase from the previous academic year.

All in all, this shows why parents are rushing to look for schools and register their children before they are born. The rise of tuition fees has also led to the creation of a group that allows both higher fees and lower fees for parents who cannot afford to register their children for the expensive schools. The group, called GEMS Education, "operates several schools in the United Arab Emirates charging fees that vary widely, starting as low as 3,670 dirhams per year, or about $1,000." On the contrary, there are some schools that have created competition for the GEMS Education: elite private schools. These schools are similar to American schools, which can charge a 12th grade student for his or her school fees up to 82,000 dirhams or about $22,325. This idea of registering a child for school before he or she is born demonstrates that parents are very concerned about their children's education and want their children to obtain the best education possible. Though a parent can search for a school and register his or her child, enrollment is not guaranteed, which is the only bad side to this tradition.
