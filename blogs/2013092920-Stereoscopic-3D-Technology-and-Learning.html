<p><b>Title:</b> Exploring Stereoscopic 3D Technology in Teaching and Learning (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b>  Carole Hruskocy & Sandra L. Foster</p> 
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.editlib.org/p/111957">Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What is the impact of stereoscopic 3D technology on student academic achievement, retention of content knowledge, and student engagement?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Stereoscopic 3D technology, the same 3D technology used in movie theaters, is defined as "the visualization of pairs of images intended to give the human user an enhanced sense of depth in the content they are viewing or interacting with" (AMD 2011).  This paper, <a href="http://www.editlib.org/p/111957">Exploring Stereoscopic 3D Technology in Teaching and Learning</a>, focuses on exploring the impact of stereoscopic 3D technology on three major areas of learning: academic achievement, retention of content knowledge, and student engagement. As researchers across the world are trying to find solutions to increase student engagement and achievement, could the incorporation of 3D simulations play a useful role in the future of education?</p>

<p>For the study, data was collected primarily from classroom observations and interviews with teachers and students to evaluate the impact of the integration of 3D technology.  The authors also analyzed secondary data from student essays, class discussions, teacher journals, researcher field notes, and pre and post student surveys and test scores.  Six classrooms from four elementary and secondary schools participated in the study, with classrooms equipped with 3D projectors and glasses for every student.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results of the study revealed that classroom incorporation of 3D technology really did improve the learning process in terms of achievement, knowledge retention, and engagement.  Looking specifically at the results of the teacher surveys and tests, the impact of 3D simulations increased student engagement, helped with memory and retention of information, and improved student discussions, illustrations, and writing.  Moreover, this study found that there were also gains in special education student scores, which suggest that the 3D technology can be incorporated into classrooms of students with varying learning abilities.   Overall, the realness of 3D images and simulations helped students understand concepts covered in class (measured by the before and after surveys and tests), which may explain why this technology facilitated deeper comprehension of topics for special education students.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
We will need further research on the effects of 3D technology on other aspects of learning such as descriptive writing, critical thinking, and spatial skills across various learners with different capabilities.  However, the demonstrated impact of 3D technology on student achievement, engagement, and memory among both regular and special education students shows promise for the incorporation of 3D simulations in future classrooms. </p>
