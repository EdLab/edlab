            "If you've spent money on an e-learning course in the last five years, you're entitled to a full refund. We now admit that our courses don't make you any smarter."

OK, no one has said that yet, but if you've seen the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/education/24baby.html">recent news</a>, then you know that Walt Disney has taken the bold step of responding to the threat of a class action lawsuit by offering refunds for "educational" materials sold in recent years — Baby Einstein videos.

<blockquote>
“The Walt Disney Company's entire Baby Einstein marketing regime is based on express and implied claims that their videos are educational and beneficial for early childhood development,” a letter from the lawyers said, calling those claims “false because research shows that television viewing is potentially harmful for very young children.”
</blockquote>

While the real danger probably isn't a young child's eyes burning out from frequent of extended use of television, the point seems to revolve around "fostering parent-child interaction."

Having seen Baby Einstein material, I am somewhat shocked that Disney has acquiesced to removing the label "educational" from these products... it seems to acknowledge that products so labeled would literally have to raise a child's IQ. Doesn't that seem like a pretty tough new standard for education? (One that, perhaps, most "educational" products would have difficulty achieving? At least it would prove to be a new, hard-to-prove evaluative standard...)

But even more interesting, I think, is the apparent agreement that the videos are more or less worthless as learning tools — that you might as well turn off the tv and have a face to face conversation with your child. Could it be that this same outcome will be demonstrated all the way up the educational food chain?
