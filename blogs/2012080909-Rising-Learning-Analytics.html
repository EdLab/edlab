            Analytics are frequently cast as primarily technical or statistical activities. Including a wide range of use: warning systems, recommenders, tutors, finance, learner models, network analysis, educational data mining, etc. Nowadays, there's a transition in analytics from a technical orientation to one that emphasizes sense making and decision-making. It somehow follows Google's philosophy that <i>“we don't have to know why this page is better than that one: If the statistics of incoming links say it is, that's good enough.”</i>. Is somehow showing aggregated stats enough? Do we have enough information seeking literacy? Chris Anderson, the  editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> & the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Tail-Business-Selling/dp/1401302378">The long tail</a>,  published a piece of article discussed about how big data is making theory obsolete. He said: 
<blockquote>
This is a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every other tool that might be brought to bear. Out with every theory of human behavior, from linguistics to sociology. Forget taxonomy, ontology, and psychology. Who knows why people do what they do? The point is they do it, and we can track and measure it with unprecedented fidelity. With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. 
</blockquote>
Will big data eventually drive toward the end of theory? 

<a href="http://analytics.ncsu.edu/">North Caroline State University </a> and <a href="http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern</a> have started offering masters programs in analytics, focusing on business intelligence, however,  many techniques are transferrable to education.

Learning analytics really evolves as an important research discipline as well as a domain practice. In spite of the currently limited publications between researchers, vendors, and practitioners, the existing learning analytics implementations DO indicate significant potential for generating novel insight into learning and vital educational practices.

Here are some useful resources & I'm glad we are riding the big data trend :)
