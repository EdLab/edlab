<p>Faced with an increasingly crowded job market, a mound of debt, and the onset of imposter syndrome, PhD graduates face a daunting future, because after seven years of study, students aren’t guaranteed a job. To help demystify life after doctoral studies, <a href="https://www.imaginephd.com/about">ImaginePhD</a> provides free online career exploration and planning for PhD students and recent graduates in the humanities and the social sciences. This tool was created by the <a href="https://www.gradcareerconsortium.org/index.php">Graduate Career Consortium</a>, a professional association of higher education administrators. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>A key function of ImaginePhD is its assessments. The platform offers three different varieties (career, skills, and values), reminiscent of the aptitude assessments students take in high school. After completion, the results show users which career paths are aligned with their scores. The career paths are broken down into 15 <i>job families,</i> including more traditional routes, such as faculty and higher education administration, or nonconforming paths, such as diplomacy and advocacy. Each of these sections offers information about these specific careers and access to related job boards. </p>

<p>ImaginePhD encourages its users to establish an individual development plan, with short and long-term goals for up to seven years. Their online tool gives options to set goals related to five key categories, such as degree completion or funding, and tracks progress through a calendar sync. Writing down goals and getting periodic reminders certainly forces some extra motivation.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>ImaginePhD’s appeal is targeted at a fraction of the population: PhD students in the humanities and the social sciences. For those working or studying in unrelated fields, this platform will not be of much use. Hard sciences students and advisors will need to look <a href="http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/">elsewhere</a> for this career guidance.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While it isn’t a complete replacement for real world advice that PhD students should be getting from their advisors and other mentors, ImaginePhD competently offers all of the services that it claims. It will put life after doctoral studies into focus and could help lay the foundations for a future career. Doctoral students in the humanities and the social sciences should consider checking out this free tool.</p>
