            <b>TED-Ed Launches in BETA:</b>
As <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7402">JoAnn reported here</a>, TED announced the addition of a dedicated "Ed-focused" site about a month ago.  Now, <a href="http://ed.ted.com/">the site </a> has officially launched in beta and is ready for educators and anyone interested in new online learning opportunities to explore (check-out the tutorial embedded below). 

<b>Review of the Details:</b>
The final version of the site allows educators who are nominated by their peers to record lessons using "an audio recording booth" that the TED-Ed team provides, to capture their "best" ten-minute lesson.  The audio is then paired with an animator (also peer nominated) and an animated version is uploaded to the TED-Ed site.  Educators and learners can then search for these videos by either "subject" or thematically by "series."  

<b>The "Flip:"</b>
Additionally and perhaps most compellingly, the TED-Ed site provides the option to "flip" videos.  Users can select from existent TED-created animated video or those uploaded from YouTube to customize their "flip" with supplemental elements like multiple-choice quizzes, short questions and additional text-based reinforcement material. "Flips" are then searchable by any user in the TED-Ed video library.  Additionally, anyone who flips a video is then given a unique URL to share with each learner, this URL allows the behavior of each interaction with the flipped content to be tracked and shared.    

<b>How is Vialogues Different?</b>
One element that TED-Ed misses and <a href="https://vialogues.com/">Vialogues</a> (Video + Discussion = Vialogues) really excels at is easy-to-use, beautifully integrated annotation.  These time-stamped comments are displayed to the right of the vialogue; thereby creating a 1:1 ratio of video content to comments.  TED-Ed videos, as on YouTube, display user comments with static time stamps at the bottom of the page (unless they are quiz questions).      

Additionally, Vialogues offers the ability to easily embed a vialogue on any site, share a secure, private link to vialogue and create, track and record quizzes and polls.  Users are notified when comments have been made in their vialogue and a daily digest is sent-out that lists these comments.  Finally, Vialogues provides an easy way to upload video in (almost!) every format and to easily create a vialogue using a YouTube link.   

<b>Our Takeaway</b>
While the TED-Ed project is noble, animated lessons are beautiful and the method of capture is revolutionary (though expensive!), Vialogues still excels as a just-in-time solution for sharing, annotating and embedding asynchronous video content for the flipped classroom.
