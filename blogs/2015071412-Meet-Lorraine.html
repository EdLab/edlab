Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?
No, I am not a TC student. I am a recent graduate of Long Island University’s Palmer School Library Program.

Where’s your hometown?
Baltimore, Maryland

What did you want to be when you grew up?
In elementary school I was sure I’d be a singer (I watched the “Moonwalker” movie many, many times…). Somewhere around 6th or 7th grade I decided I wanted to be a writer, since I always enjoyed telling stories and being imaginative. I like to think that I am living-out my childhood dreams at the moment.

What was your first job?
Does canvassing for cleaner cars in Maryland count? It was my first summer job and I lasted for all of one week…

My second “first” job was working as a Processor/ Decorator at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. My first days on the job resembled the “chocolate factory scene” on Season 2 of “I Love Lucy.”

What has been your worst job?
Canvassing. (That’s, why I only lasted a week).

What has been your best job?
Teaching self-defense to elementary school kids and teens.

What do you remember about your first day of school?
I remember walking to school with my mother carrying my brand-new, purple “Minnie Mouse” backpack.

Are you a morning or night person?:
Night.

A delicious dessert:
Warm, crisp apple pie with cold vanilla ice cream.

Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:
Oh, there are so many…I happen to really enjoy Motown and “Oldies” and have a tendency to, without warning, sing-along to songs that I know.

A country you’d like to visit:
Costa Rica.

A book you strongly recommend:
Infants of the Spring by Wallace Thurman.

A sport you enjoy playing (or watching):
I like watching the X-games and snow boarding/ BMX biking competitions. But I am too afraid of heights, falling, and breaking bones to try any of it myself.

Complete the Sentence:
The strangest thing I’ve ever done is: twirl and skip through the streets during a snowstorm.
