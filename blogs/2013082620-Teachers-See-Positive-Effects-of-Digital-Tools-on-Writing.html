<p><b>Title:</b> The Impact of Digital Tools on Student Writing and How Writing is Taught in Schools</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristen Purcell, Judy Buchanan, Linda Friedrich</p>

<p><b>Source:</b><a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teachers-technology-and-writing.aspx"> Pew Research Center </a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What are the impacts of digital tools on student writing?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of Advanced Placement and National Writing Project teachers in the spring of 2012 to assess their views on technology’s effects on student writing habits and how they incorporated digital tools in the classroom. The survey included 2,462 participants who taught at middle and high school levels in diverse public schools throughout the US. The data was collected through an in-person focus group and a 30-minute online survey. The survey required teachers to rate students’ writing skills (such as structure, tone, style, and ability to provide references and give constructive feedback) on a scale of excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor.
</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results of the survey indicated the majority of teachers had a positive view of social networking sites, cell phones, and texting and thought they fostered creative self-expression in teens. Teachers claimed that their students became more invested in their work because of the way digital tools made writing easier, allowed for greater personal expression, and provided a wider readership. The students assessed in this survey received high scores for structuring their assignments and taking multiple viewpoints into account.
<p>
While most teachers acknowledged that digital tools were beneficial to writing processes, they recognized that some platforms were responsible for the creep of informal language into more formal areas of writing. Teachers also expressed concern that technology made students more likely to take short cuts and allowed them to put less effort into their writing. Significantly, students received the lowest scores on questions about understanding plagiarism and fair use issues. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The results of this survey are encouraging for proponents of technology integration, especially so because a majority of teachers had already taken proactive steps to address concerns about the downsides of digital tools. 75% of teachers used class time to discuss fair use issues, and 94% still required students to complete some writing assignments by hand. Even so, as the bad habits wrought by ‘text-speak’ become more pervasive, educators should continue to place strong emphases on proper form and differentiating among registers. And as more sophisticated applications are developed for peer-to-peer editing, digital tools have the potential to evolve from platforms that encourage creativity to platforms that more precisely focus on correcting for appropriate spelling, grammar, and register.
