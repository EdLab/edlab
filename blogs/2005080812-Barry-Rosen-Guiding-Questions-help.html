            Barry Rosen: Guiding Questions	

(Sorry that the topic sounds like the teacher's edition of a textbook. Ugh.)

I want some help thinking of specific questions for our Wednesday conversation, not necessarily just for Barry (at all!) but for ourselves and the (so far quite a few) people from outside the lab who will join us. 

A reminder that the organizing concept is to use Barry's visit to hear about his education project in Afghanistan and then use his experience as an opportunity to examine our educational system — to “seeâ€? with new eyes. 

(Organizationally, I'm thinking 20-30 minutes for a conversation-within-a-conversation -- that is just Barry and a couple of us with everyone else “eavesdroppingâ€? -- and then a conversation-of-the-wholeâ€? (as it were)  for the remaining hour and a half.)

So, how about I start with a few, and you all add to the list? I'll look at the final collection Tuesday night and post a conversation framework by Wednesday morning. 

My questions are all over the place, not because that is how my thinking is ï?Š, but to encourage brainstorming. That said, feel free to annotate your questions re whether you mean them conceptually or specifically, whether they're for first or second conversation, whatever. . .


-	How important are religious and cultural values to the traditional forms of Afghan education? (Are they important here? And I don't mean just the red states.)
-	Is it possible to reform/change Afghan education in ways that are not completely consistent with the religious/cultural values of the country? Is that a proper goal of reform? (Could we change the way in which knowledge is acquired in the U.S. if we didn't take account of community and football?)
-	How much of the challenge of the Afghan project is technical, how much educational — or are the two intertwined? (Ditto here.)
-	Since tradition always seems to have the upper hand, is it possible to reform education in meaningful ways that does not directly challenge existing or past practice? 
-	What are the goals of the Afghanistan project? To what end? (Innovative solutions to scarce/non-existent resources? Conflict resolution? Better standard of living? More readers/thinkers? ) And here re edLab?
-	What does it mean to know something in Afghnistan? What knowledge is valued?
