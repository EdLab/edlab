<strong>Title:</strong> Talking Adolescence Perspectives on Communication in the Teenage Years

<strong>Editors:</strong> Williams, Angie and Crispin Thurow, Eds.

<strong>Publisher:</strong> Peter Lang

<strong>Call No.: </strong> HQ796 .T345 2005

<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

As a major economic, relational, and identity resource, communication is  crucial to the well-being and success of young people. And yet  adolescents are typically characterized in the media as inadequate  communicators, whose language practices adults bemoan as unintelligible  and deleterious. In looking to critique these pervasive stereotypes, the  editors of <em>Talking Adolescence</em> have brought together some of the  world's leading experts on youth and adolescence, whose  interdisciplinary research demonstrates how communication powerfully  structures and meaningfully facilitates the lives of young people.  Adding to the growing literature on intergenerational and lifespan  communication, <em>Talking Adolescence</em> is the first substantive volume devoted to young people.

<strong>About the Editors:</strong>

<strong>Angie Williams</strong> received her Ph.D. in communication from  University of California, Santa Barbara. She is Senior Lecturer in the  Centre for Language and Communication Research at Cardiff University in  Wales. Her main research interest is in intergroup communication,  particularly as it relates to culture, age, lifespan, and health issues.  She is co-author of <em>Intergenerational Communication Across the Lifespan</em> (2001).

<strong>Crispin Thurlow</strong> received his Ph.D. in language and communication from University of  Wales. He is Assistant Professor of Social Interaction in the Department  of Communication, University of Washington in Seattle. His research on  "discourse and difference" examines the ways language and other semiotic  modes are used to make sense of boundaries of dissimilarity and  inequality. His work on young people's communication has been published  in a wide range of international journals.
