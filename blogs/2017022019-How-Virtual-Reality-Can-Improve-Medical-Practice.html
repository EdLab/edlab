<p>Researchers at the University of Basel have developed a new virtual reality (VR) system to improve medical practice and study. The program recreates visualizations of patients’ inner systems in VR using actual medical data taken from radiology scans. The researcher in the video has isolated part of a patient’s skeletal system and is able to rotate it, zoom in and out, and cut across portions of it. This could allow doctors to have a realistic, 3D visualization of a patient’s interior systems before starting surgery or diagnosing a problem.</p>

<p>Although this VR system is primarily intended for doctors, it could also be used as an educational tool for medical students. Images can be viewed either as 3D visualizations or as a radiology scan. Because of this, students can test their ability to read radiology scans by flipping back and forth between the two options. Although this tech is currently only available at the University of Basel, the developers think it potentially has wider implications for the medical field.</p>

<p>How could this technology change medical practice or study? What do you think VR brings to the experience of viewing a visualization of the human body? Do you think it adds something that cannot be achieved elsewhere? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/34118/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:49 RuthS:</b> Case Western University is using <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3494/why-the-next-step-for-medical-school-is-virtual-reality">a similar technology at their medical school</a>, although using the Hololens instead of a VR headset. It seems like the Hololens gives them more freedom in what they view and is likely a better educational tool.</p>

<p><b>@02:01 Joseph.Banks:</b> I can see this helping doctors practice more risky procedures. I think it could provide a different approach to learning beyond the way doctors normally learn by observing each other. It also would likely be very realistic.</p>
