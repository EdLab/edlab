            Drought, like many other natural disasters, is nothing new to many parts of the world, especially around the horn of Africa in countries like Somalia and Ethiopia. The first memorable of such droughts occurred in Ethiopia during the 1980s and one of the most unfortunate aspects of drought is famine. The famine in Ethiopia led to the deaths of over a million people and was the inspiration behind the now memorable charity song “We Are The World.” 

There is currently a severe famine affecting Somalia.  The only thing most Somalians affected by the famine can do to survive is to move to other cities or nearby countries.  Many have already migrated to Garrisa, Kenya, which even in the rainy season hasn't had much rain. This kind of situation has separated families and has even led to heads of families abandoning their loved ones and running off with whatever they have. Usually this means animals such as cows and camels as the main job for workers in the east side is taking care of animals and selling them for income. 

To complicate matters, the terrorist group al-Shabaab, which controls a large amount of territory in Somalia, has warned all aid groups trying to bring food to those suffering from the famine. For some reason, the famine hasn't received much media attention as I would have expected since I feel more attention will bring awareness to the issue and lead people to act on behalf of those suffering in the horn of Africa.
