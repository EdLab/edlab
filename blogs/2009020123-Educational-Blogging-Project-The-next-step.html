            Some members of the Development and Research group (Zhouzhou, George, and I) have been working on the Educational Blogging Project since last October. The potential purpose of the study is to understand how classroom blogs support teaching and learning. We want to find out how teaching and learning happens within and beyond classroom through blogging. Using open and axial coding as well as typological analyses (Baker, 2007), we explored 60 classroom blogs and generated an initial statistical summary on features and discrepancies of blogging in K-12 classrooms. We also looked at aspects of parents' support and other functions in blogs as revealed by the collected data. We also aim to bring up suggestions and recommendations to further improve the current blogging features on k-12 classroom bogs.

The data collection (N=60) at the beginning involved a general Google search with the key words "classroom blog." We were concerned that the first search was too broad to gather enough data for future analysis. So, we further conducted two advanced Google searches specifically through two blog-featured websites with the key words: "classroom blog site:blogspot.com" and "classroom blog site:edublogs.org". From the three major searches, we collected the first 20 blogs from each search, which were non-repetitive from each other.

The attached is an initial statistical summary. 

We are considering the next step(s) of analyzing the data: (1) how learning happens in different subjects (i.e., literacy, science, social studies, and technology) through blogging; (2) how learning happens within different audiences; and/or(3) how technological tools help teachers to involve parents in lower grades...

We are eagerly looking for suggestions/comments/questions regarding this project.
