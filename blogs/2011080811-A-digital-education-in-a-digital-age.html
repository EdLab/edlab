          <p>
            A NYT Op-Ed titled <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/education-needs-a-digital-age-upgrade/?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=thab1">"Education Needs a Digital-Age Upgrade"</a> posits that, since a study concludes that 65% of today's grade school students will end up in careers that haven't been invented yet, the content we teach and the way we teach it needs a major overhaul. This is hardly news, but I was interested in the way the modern classroom reflects a century-old economy:

<i>The contemporary American classroom, with its grades and deference to the clock, is an inheritance from the late 19th century. During that period of titanic change, machines suddenly needed to run on time. Individual workers needed to willingly perform discrete operations as opposed to whole jobs. The industrial-era classroom, as a training ground for future factory workers, was retooled to teach tasks, obedience, hierarchy and schedules.

That curriculum represented a dramatic departure from earlier approaches to education. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-You-See-Attention-Transform/dp/0670022829/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1312817645&sr=1-1">“Now You See It,” Ms. Davidson</a> cites the elite Socratic system of questions and answers, the agrarian method of problem-solving and the apprenticeship program of imitating a master. It's possible that any of these educational approaches would be more appropriate to the digital era than the one we have now.</i>

The author goes on to suggest that, instead of traditional paper-writing, teachers should create assignments that advance digital literacy. Students should be encouraged to not only learn how to access information on the internet, but to create it as well.

But one commenter asks an important question: <i>As so often happens, a discussion of American education turns on two pivot points: 1) are we developing our children's intellectual capacity or 2) are we preparing them to be productive participants in an economy?</i>
