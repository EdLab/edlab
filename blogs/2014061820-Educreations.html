<p>At its core, <a href="http://www.educreations.com/">Educreations</a> is about developing educational videos. With a recordable interactive whiteboard, teachers can create the hands-on feel of the classroom in their students’ homes. A promising tool for distance learning, videos can be watched on Internet browsers or iPad. The site features a public directory, a handy place for finding videos related to a certain topic, and a showcased lesson, the spot to find the best videos on the site. To share videos more widely, or via a learning platform such as Moodle, they can be marked as "public" so that those without an Educreations account can view them.</p>

<p>One of the great benefits of Educreations is the part of its platform dedicated to teachers. Teachers can create courses on the site and have students enroll by creating registration links—an easy way to streamline the process of signing up for students. Students can even create their own lessons, comment and evaluate each other’s lessons, and engage in dialogue through videos within a course.</p>


<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Educreations offers many features to explore. For example, users can animate their images while recording. Overall, it makes the process of creating, sharing and the encouraging peer-to-peer discussion around videos easy and fun.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>The quality of many of the ready-made videos is not very high, so it might be best to focus on using the program to make unique videos. A quick browse reveals that many of the videos have been created by students, perhaps as final projects as a way of demonstrating understanding, which makes the videos valuable as instructional tools. The product is not yet optimized for mobile.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Educreations has a loose subject structure, but its main mission is to teach anything on any platform that can support video and as a peer-to-peer learning site it holds great promise for teachers and students.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b> Who can resist a DIY video program?</p>
