            <p>I encountered a great book by Curtis J. Bonk and Elaine Khoo titled <a href="http://tec-variety.com/TEC-Variety_eBook_5-4.pdf" target="_blank">Adding Some TEC-VARIETY: 100+ Activities for Motivating and Retaining Learners Online</a>. This book proposes the following framework for educational technology design in order to engage learners in proactive knowledge acquisition and application:</p><p><br /></p><blockquote>1. <b>T</b>one/Climate: Psychological Safety, Comfort, Sense of Belonging<br />
2. <b>E</b>ncouragement: Feedback, Responsiveness, Praise, Supports<br />
3. <b>C</b>uriosity: Surprise, Intrigue, Unknowns<br />
4. <b>V</b>ariety: Novelty, Fun, Fantasy<br />
5. <b>A</b>utonomy: Choice, Control, Flexibility, Opportunities<br />
6. <b>R</b>elevance: Meaningful, Authentic, Interesting<br />
7. <b>I</b>nteractivity: Collaborative, Team-Based, Community<br />
8. <b>E</b>ngagement: Effort, Involvement, Investment<br />
9. <b>T</b>ension: Challenge, Dissonance, Controversy<br />
10. <b>Y</b>ielding Products: Goal Driven, Purposeful Vision, Ownership</blockquote><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20171117134907-screen_shot_2017_11_17_at_1_47_59_pm_png_5df6905cbd98a8b60dd4c2c014d24909.png" style /><br /></p><p>The Read, Reflect, Display, and Do (R2D2) Learning Model (Bonk &amp; Zhang, 2008)</p><p><br /></p><p>This framework is an awesome resource for us in designing educational technology products <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">to promote learning and instruction</span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">. For example, we should consider how to improve the design of Vialogues, Rhizr, and the Library App in order to effectively support the learning activities discussed in the book and offer optimal learning experiences to our clients.</span></p><p><br /></p><p>Also, it is worth mentioning that this book cited Vialogues a dozen times as an exemplary software to promote &quot;intense interaction&quot; and reflection around videos. However, the book was published in 2014 so it only discussed the &quot;asynchronous&quot; but not the &quot;synchronous&quot; discussion-based learning model now both supported in Vialogues.</p><p><br /></p><p>About the authors (from the book):</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Curt Bonk is a former corporate controller and CPA who, after becoming sufficiently bored with such work, received his master’s and PhD degrees in educational psychology from the University of Wisconsin. Curt Bonk is now professor of Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University and president of CourseShare. Drawing on his background as a corporate controller, CPA, educational psychologist, and instructional technologist, Bonk offers unique insights into the intersection of business, education, psychology, and technology. </p></blockquote><blockquote>Elaine Khoo is a research fellow at the Wilf Malcolm Institute of Education (WMIER) based in the Faculty of Education at The University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand. Her master’s in psychology with an emphasis in cognitive science is from Vanderbilt University and her doctorate is in education from the University of Waikato. Elaine Khoo’s research interests include teaching and learning in environments supported by information and communication technology (ICT). She is also interested in online learning settings with a particular concern for how to build and sustain online learning communities as well as participatory learning cultures and collaborative research contexts. </blockquote>
