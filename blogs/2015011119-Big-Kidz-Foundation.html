<p><i>It is my hope that the children in these underserved communities officially become part of this national conversation that we have been left out of for years.  The efforts within this program will not only stress education, but will stress exposure to culture.</i> (from <a href="http://www.bigkidzfoundation.org/">Big Kidz Foundation</a> site)</p>
 
<p><b>Education in a New Dimension</b><br>
The <a href="http://www.bigkidzfoundation.org/">Big Kidz Foundation</a> is an organization intended to inspire and nurture youth with culturally diverse experiences by exposing them to literary, musical, and other humanities expressions. The organization encourages children to hone their leadership skills, communicate more effectively, increase self-confidence, and develop social and conscious awareness in their communities. The organization was founded by legendary rap artist Big Boi of Outkast in 2006 and offers six different programs for young minds: Big Voices, Big Moves, Big Talent, Big Dreams, Big Business, and Big Hearts. The foundation also offers a summer program for young aspiring musicians, artists, and dancers that enables participants to connect with peers and mentors with similar passions and drive.</p>

<p><b>Real Teens, Real Change</b><br>
At the Big Kidz Foundation, teens have the chance to win scholarships and other opportunities by exploring their creativity and self-expression through music, writing, and leadership. Big Boi believes "creating, and having a positive contribution to the world we're living in, takes knowledge on another level; takes expression on another level," and he wants to help make that happen. Annual summits, essay competitions, and presentations give these young individuals an opportunity to voice their multi-faceted struggles and triumphs in a safe and encouraging space. The Big Kidz Foundation also gives students the opportunity to participate in community outreach programs, helping support local schools, shelters, and individuals in need. Programs like "Big Business" teach youth about money management, owning a small business, and entrepreneurial endeavors while "Big Dreams" gives teens the opportunity to discuss everything from career paths to home life with a caring and responsible adult. </p>
