<p><a href="https://www.buildwithchrome.com">Build with Chrome</a> fuses LEGO with Google Maps to create the world’s biggest LEGO set. Not only can users choose any empty plot of land around the earth to build on, they can also see creations made by others, making the experience both creative and interactive. Build with Chrome is an out-of-the-box approach to a classic children’s toy. Also, don’t let the name fool you; Build with Chrome also works on internet browsers that aren’t Google Chrome.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>To put it simply, Build with Chrome is fun. The entire world is one giant LEGO baseboard that users roam until finding a good plot of land, and then build away using the available blocks, each of which comes in 10 colors. Once finished with a creation, users can publish it to the map for all others to see. If anyone needs help getting started, the site’s Build Academy will help them master the basic LEGO building skills.</p>
 
<p>There are many creations already on the map in Build with Chrome, and the experience is more enjoyable because of it. Users can search for buildings by area on the map (colored dots mark LEGO creation plots) or by most popular structures. Some of the latter are truly sites to be seen. I felt like a tourist in a 3D LEGO world with a passport that could take me anywhere. And it was all fun. The world map is so saturated with LEGO creations that I was able to find a structure in my 1,000-person hometown in West Virginia. Thrilled, I added another one for good measure.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The LEGO selection is small, which limits the types of creations possible. Users can easily create buildings and boxy vehicles, but they shouldn’t expect to construct the Millennium Falcon (though Hogwarts might still be in reach for a very skilled and patient soul).</p>

<p>Although there is truly an element of wonder as you first browse the site and begin plotting LEGO architecture, there is little incentive to continue building. Build with Chrome would benefit if it had a greater gaming or social element to it. As it stands, though you can explore other creations, there was no way to view specific profiles or comment on particularly cool pieces. Because the available LEGOs are limited, the site could also be more fun if it offered unusual pieces as incentives for building more.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Despite some of its limitations, Build with Chrome is an exciting new take on LEGO blocks. It’s the type of site that will entertain both children and adults, at least for a while. Overall, I’m impressed. The creators of Build with Chrome found a way to keep much of the joy and wonder of LEGO intact in the shift from tangible blocks to digital ones. Build with Chrome certainly won’t replace real blocks, but it does offer a fun new way to play with them.</p>
