Rich is also the Director of Online Learning for Palisades School District in Pennsylvania where he was recognized as the Outstanding Contributor to Blended and Online Learning with <a href="http://bit.ly/1IFlTKN">blendedschools.net</a>. He has been awarded the "20 to Watch" award by the National School Boards Association and has served in many roles that combine his expertise in both technology and education including Classrooms for the Future Coach, eLearning Architect, and Creative Design Consultant. Rich has recently been recognized as one of the top 20 educators in social media at the Bammy Awards. His consulting work at <a href="http://bit.ly/1MWkGAh">Kiker Learning</a> includes creating, incubating, and delivering eLearning solutions, social media, and professional development with a focus on Google solutions for educators worldwide. <p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I was fortunate to be a teacher at Palisades School District in a Media Technology Academy designed to be inquiry-based, interdisciplinary, and driven by restorative practices. I eventually became the department chair of this Academy and was able to hone my pedagogy around student-designed inquiry and a holistic instructional culture. It certainly was the best place for me to be early in my career.

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape? </b><br>
I hope my work with Google EDU and online learning continues to help schools create time and space in the student school day. We have been fixed to school day schedules that are painful when looked at closely. Anytime, anywhere access to learning, the nearly endless online learning options available, and national initiatives like ConnectED and Future Ready will finally help us improve education for the modern world. <p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
Mobile and blended learning seem to be taking hold. There is a lot of evidence supporting high quality blended design and I feel that the tipping point is coming where most classrooms will begin to blend instruction. Further out, I see virtual reality adding a lot of value with immersive experiences for learners like touring the human body or traveling through the solar system. <p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project? </b><br> 
My biggest project right now is starting as one of the first professional development partners at Google EDU. Some of my efforts will be to increase access for all learners, help teachers find the most relevant strategies for technology integration in their classrooms, use technology as the great equalizer, and to increase global competency for students.

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I am on Twitter at <a href="http://bit.ly/1Go27SY">@rkiker</a>. But some of the folks I learn the most from are <a href="http://bit.ly/1LboXyr">Tom Murray</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1ShWkDY">Joe Sanfelippo</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1JTrOgB">Joe Mazza. </a>
