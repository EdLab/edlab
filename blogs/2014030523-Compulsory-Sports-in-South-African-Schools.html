            Several countries around the world have different ways of developing sports programs in schools. In America and several other countries, sports are mostly optional and are often regarded as extra curricular activities for students. However, in most developing countries students who want to participate in sports are often denied the opportunity due to lack of sports facilities or sports programs in their schools. This <a href="http://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/New-plan-for-sport-in-schools-20110203">article</a> gives a brief overview on how the Department of Education in Johannesburg, South Africa is on the verge of making sports compulsory in schools.
<p>
One of the reasons for this new regulation is that there are a lot of students in South Africa who are very talented in a variety of sports. By making sports compulsory, schools can nurture their talents and help them reach the highest levels in sports and academics. On the other hand, questions might be raised as to why these children are forced to play sports in school. The article added that, with physical education being compulsory as well, children would learn about health related issues and how to live a healthy lifestyle.
Another equally essential part of the plan is to build 100 sporting centers across South Africa at schools that lack sporting facilities.
<p>
Personally, I believe this proposal by the Education Department is a very good initiative. As a student athlete, I think it is every athlete's goal to see their classmates and friends engage in sports. I have a strong passion for sports and this passion increases every time I play with my friends. Sports do not only help the individual but also help in building a mutual relationship between participants. These will provide a conducive environment for students (also teammates) to learn, both in sports and in the classroom.
