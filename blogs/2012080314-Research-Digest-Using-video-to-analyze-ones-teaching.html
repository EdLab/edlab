(2012). <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CFkQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1467-8535.2011.01234.x%2Fabstract&ei=JR0cUPfMLuPV0QGhxIDYDQ&usg=AFQjCNHJIAZuMx5r6YQcAEiWSy1Xu61lPA">Using Video to Analyze One's Own Teaching</a>. British Journal of Educational Technology. 43-4, 678-704. 

This study is really a meta-analysis of research concerning teachers use of video for self-evaluation. Video has become a viable tool for reflection as technology costs have fallen drastically in the past 10+ years. The authors attempt to define a framework upon which video evaluations can be based, as well as answering the following questions:
<blockquote>
1. In what ways have teachers used video to reflect on their own teaching?
2. What practices were used to facilitate reflection on videos of one's own teaching? 
3. How has video-facilitated reflection affected teachers' subsequent teaching?
</blockquote>
The study draws from 60+ previous articles on the subject, the vast majority of which were published after 2000. These studies differed by six dimensions as identified by the authors: type of reflection tasks, including coding/checklists, collaborative reflection, and written reflections; the guiding or facilitation of reflection, that is how the reflection process was facilitated; individual vs. collaborative reflection, video length, number of reflections, and ways of measuring reflection, or how the studies determined the usefulness of video as it applies to teacher evaluations.

Among the findings of their study, the authors concluded that generally teachers prefer to go over their assessment videos with peers and mentors as opposed to going it alone. Teachers also favored having a number of guides to choose from to assist their evaluation process. Additionally, they found it beneficial to review video before and after the actual evaluation as a way of comparing impressions. 


A couple of the dimensions, like length of video, were inconclusive and thus no determination of effectiveness could be made. Further, no conclusive results were drawn on the effectiveness of video self-evaluations.

<strong>EdLab Relevance</strong>
We've had a few seminars done by entrepreneurs seeking to improve teaching through video evaluation, and we've seen individuals use Vialogues to evaluate their teaching (in this example, as a sermon <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4446">https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4446</a>. The article doesn't expand much on existing research, but it's a useful digest of work that's already been done in the field.
