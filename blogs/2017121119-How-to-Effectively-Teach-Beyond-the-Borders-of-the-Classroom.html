<p><a href="https://www.goosechase.com/edu/">GooseChase EDU</a> is an app that blends old-school scavenger hunts with mobile technology. Free to anyone with an edu email address, GooseChase EDU allows educators to create competitive missions for their students to complete at different locations throughout a school or neighborhood. Students can download the app, form groups to complete the tasks assigned to them, and submit answers in the form of photos, videos, written responses, or location pins.</p> 
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I tested GooseChase EDU on my coworkers, and they all reported thoroughly enjoying the experience. They found the app easy to navigate, and thought the variety of response formats was a particularly fun way of keeping players on their toes. Additionally, many of them appreciated the fact that completed missions were removed from the list so that only remaining tasks were left on their feed. This led to a greater sense of accomplishment and fueled urgency and competitive spirit.</p>

<p>From a facilitator’s point of view, I found the process of creating a game very straight-forward and intuitive. I could easily create my own location-, photo/video-, or written-based missions or pull from GooseChase’s "mission bank," which allows you to utilize other users’ missions if you are struggling to think of your own.</p> 

<p>GooseChase EDU gives the creator a lot of control, including the ability to launch your game to the public at a specific time and date, pre-assign teams or let players group themselves, set time limitations, and end your game at any point. During game play, the most useful aspects are the three different ways to view student progress: through the "activity feed" (which shows all tasks completed across teams, from most to least recent), "leaderboard" (rankings of teams by points), and "submission hub" (report of how many groups have responded to each mission).</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>A common complaint about the app was the lack of notifications. I had to refresh my webpage constantly to see a team’s progress. Additionally, I was not notified when teams entered an incorrect answer for a mission. To use this tool in a classroom, I would want to know how many times students submitted an answer, since this would help me assess learning. From a player’s perspective, being notified of other teams' completed tasks would encourage competition.</p>
 
<p>The most frustrating experience involved one of the written answers required of a mission. Because the "answer" that I had entered had an accidental space in front of it, players’ answers were not recognized as being correct. Additionally, even after I revised the answer and players entered their responses, it still took a long time to register as correct and I was not notified of their answers. Being notified of these attempts would have alerted me to this problem, but as mentioned above, this is a major failing of this app.</p> 

<p>Other suggestions for improvement include lengthening video responses beyond the current 11 second limit, and creating the capability to submit a single answer in two formats, such as a location pin and a photo together.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>GooseChase EDU could definitely be a fun and effective way to facilitate learning outside the classroom. However, some functional upgrades should be made if the usefulness of this app is to be fully realized.</p>
