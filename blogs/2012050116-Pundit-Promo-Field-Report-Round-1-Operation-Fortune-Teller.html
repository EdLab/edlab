            <b>Promo Field Report...</b> 

Yesterday, I launched the first round of Pundit promotions "Operation Fortune Teller" in-front of TC's Everett Library Cafe!  Listed below are my take-aways and thoughts after this first adventure in solo-product promotion. I plan to run another round of table-based promo on Thursday... this time with a "Stress Star" theme (see attached fliers).

Please feel-free to add your thoughts on how to best promote our apps here at TC, suggestions and any questions you might have about the set-up and results.  

<b>Goals of Round 1 promo table:</b>  
To capitalize on course sign-up momentum as students consider Summer and Fall 2012 registration.  In addition, I wanted to continue to test the "connect package" from the TC Academic Festival to generate interest in ALL EdLab apps and projects. 

<b>Set-up:</b>
Table, chairs, fortune cookies, postcards, paper-based connect package on clipboard, signage and fliers designed by Janet, laptop and... PUNDIT COSTUME (see pic below)! 

<b>Takeaways and Learning:</b>

1) Costumes are best left for standing demos... sitting and wearing a cardboard eye is not conducive to typing... or being taken seriously!  The outfit did get additional attention...   

2) Have more than one laptop/iPad for sign-up and more of the "app" cards listing our apps & projects left-over from the Ac Fest. 

3) Great opportunity to talk about our work at the EdLab and to generate interest in ALL projects/apps... promo should almost never be just about 1 product or project.  

4) When you have only 1 person it is challenging to demo, sign-up and hand-out cookies... but if you strategically position all your materials definitely doable!  

5) Despite being doable, it seemed that the best use of time is to demo, generate excitement and provide take-aways + collect a simple email address... with one person sign-up slowed down the flow. 

6) 4-6:00pm is the best time to capture the rush of TC students!  

7) Everyone loves cookies and cute cartoon characters! 

8) Everyone was interested in the platform and wished they had known about it sooner... 

9) It was helpful to have "something for everyone... through providing the EdLab app card and additional resources for alumni. 

10) We received 2 sign-ups for Pundit and 11 people requested additional info about the EdLab's apps and projects through the "connect package."
