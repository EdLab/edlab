The internet has quickly become a significant part of our daily lives. We are spending more and more time looking at glowing screens to connect with each other and to learn about what is going on in the world. But what effect does this have on our bodies, both physically and mentally? What about the influence it has on child development? </p>

<p>Perhaps what is most disconcerting is the way that the brainâ€™s filtering method changes. Rather than favoring important information, we instead become fixated on the <i>newest</i> information. Finding the latest tidbit for our brains to take in provides us with bursts of endorphins. We are always looking for that next rush. This has, in essence, made our relationship with technology comparable to a drug addiction. We have grown dependent on having access to the internet wherever and whenever we want, and turn to it for a quick fix when the flow of information seems to halt. Just like any drug, this lifestyle has its affects on the brain. </p>

<p>How do you feel about the way technology is altering the functions of our brains? Are you concerned that it will replace human memory? Share your opinions<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23245/"> on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i><p>

<p><b>@01:22 mpowers:</b> worth mentioning that it's also somewhat reversible... neural pathways can be reinforced, but you can go back and reinforce other neural pathways, too. (Definitely best if kids have a variety of interactions, true, but even adults can reinforce new paths.)</p>

<p><b>@01:29 beckieb:</b> Babies have figured out how to use devices the same way that adults do. I remember being appalled years ago, while watching a 2-year old navigate an iPhone with the swiftness and agility of a regular technology user. Now, it is seems as though this ability is just as natural as learning how to walk.

<p><b>@03:07 CTerracino:</b> A lack of diverse experience and over-distraction prevents deep and thorough learning and understanding...definitely a phenomenon in need of attention.</p>
