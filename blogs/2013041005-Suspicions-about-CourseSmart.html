          <p>
            An article in today's New York Times (4/9/13) entitled “Teacher Knows If You've Done The E-Reading” touched on the heart of many puzzles about e-learning, and elicited a range of thoughtful responses in the comments section.  This article should interest many of you, especially those doing data mining in the context of post-secondary education.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/technology/coursesmart-e-textbooks-track-students-progress-for-teachers.html">The article is here</a>, and my analysis follows.

CourseSmart, owned by Pearson McGraw-Hill and other major textbook publishers, employs embedded statistical data collection that is used to make judgments about the quality of, among other things, a student's “engagement” with an e-text, taking into account such things as the number of times the student has opened the book, which pages the student has read, and whether the student has highlighted key passages.  Such judgments are computed as metrics, such as the so-called “engagement index,” which are then supplied to the instructor.  The raw data are also subsequently mined by CourseSmart.

Many will be immediately suspicious of this practice.  Given that this reflects an increasingly widespread educational convention, it might be useful to examine two kinds of suspicions more closely.  The first is suspicion on semantic grounds, and the second is suspicion on grounds of the purposes of the various agencies involved.
<!--break-->

Suspicion on semantic grounds.

The suggestive use of the term “engagement” as a part of an “engagement index” should draw immediate suspicion.  Is this a genuine, veridical use of the term “engagement”?  In contemporary philosophy, our ordinary language terms refer to things in the world (as well as doing some other work) such that a genuine use, in order to be genuine, must preserve reference.  I could not point to a lamp and call it a “dog,” because this would not be referring to the same thing as a dog, and would not be a genuine use of the term “dog.”  Moreover, I could not point to a lamp and stipulate “this is now what 'dog' means.”

This is a problem that is often encountered in squaring the use of many kinds of technical terms, especially in the social sciences, and especially those that are named using ordinary language terms.  Attempts to capture “happiness” or “utility” in terms of a “utility function” draw criticism on the same grounds.  Happiness is surely whatever we are referring to in our ordinary uses of the term, no matter whether we are right or wrong in our beliefs about the referent.
  
The use of “engagement” here as a part of the term “engagement index” beckons a thorough analysis, but short of that, it clearly does not refer in this use to the myriad things involved in the ordinary idea of student engagement, nor does it account for the idiosyncratic nature of learning.  Its use appears to be merely suggestive.  Setting aside the possibility of metaphoric use, one might say it is “dereferenced.”

To get the force of this, you should understand that once a term is dereferenced, its word form is arbitrary.  The term “engagement” here can be replaced by literally any string of characters as a name, for example, “xyz123.”  This is a helpful way to understand a technical term as stripped of all its suggestiveness, leaving one with the responsibility for explaining its meaning otherwise.

So what is the true meaning of the “engagement index” — or rather the “xyz123 index” — here?  We would look first at the statistical calculations which supply its explanans, at least in part.  This might, in turn, involve dereferencing further terms along the way.  Under this view, you would see this as a process of giving up — by degrees — the appeal to commonsense meaning and suggestiveness.  In the end, I think one would end up conceding that CourseSmarts' use of the term “engagement” has little or even nothing to do with the ordinary language meaning of the word of the same spelling, or its uses in education.  

In the final analysis, we would look at the social function of the symbols (whether used veridically or otherwise), and the customs involving their uses, in order to explain them.  Let's consider social function more broadly as a source of suspicion.

Suspicion on grounds of purposes.

In the social ecosystem of education as occupied by CourseSmart, we might scrutinize a number of the agents at work.  We look at administrators, instructors and students, of course.  But we also look at the social agencies such as schools and publishers.  We could go on at length examining the ecology of beliefs and belief systems, as well as the linguistic symbols themselves and the rules, customs, and conventions involving their use.  But if there is one central dogma I want to advance here, it is that each of these entities seeks to serve, among other things, its own self interests.  And this raises the question: Whose interests are being served in this picture, and at the expense of whom?

A telling quote from the Times article gives us a cue:  

“<i>CourseSmart is owned by Pearson, McGraw-Hill and other major publishers, which see an opportunity to cement their dominance in digital textbooks by offering administrators and faculty a constant stream of data about how students are doing.</i> “

The immediate suspicion here is that the self-interests of the publishers, in pursuit of their own well-being, have outweighed the interests of the well-being of the student.  [Indeed, students are not allowed access to their 'engagement index'.]  And we cannot ignore the interdependent and divided interests of administrators and instructors, under constant pressure to provide glowing results using the new technology.  But a deeper suspicion is that publishers, administrators, instructors, and students alike are being lulled by the apparent charm of a suggestively-named metric, a selfish meme that enjoys a life all its own.
