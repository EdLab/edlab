          <p>
            I had a very peculiar experience on Friday during my Spanish Conversation and Composition II class. Are you ready for this?

My professor <i>touched</i> me. 

Uh-huh. She. <b>Touched</b>. Me. 

Not in a creepy, inappropriate way, or anything out of line. But I was a bit surprised because she touched my <b>head</b> when she wanted to demonstrate a point to our class. 

She laid her hand on the back of my head and gently, but firmly, turned my face away from here to stare straight ahead so she could demonstrate what one of the characters of the story we were analyzing was doing. 

There wasn't anything wrong in what she did, but I was surprised because I couldn't remember the last time I was touched by a teacher. 

Different cultures and societies have different etiquettes when it comes to physical contact. But in the Office and Classroom culture, the less physical contact, the better. Accusations of pedophilia and sexual harassment lawsuits have done well to reinforce that touching is a big no-no in the professional world. 

Is it really necessary to go out of your way to never accidentally brush shoulders with someone, or heaven forbid - accidentally touch hands? I had a teacher in high school who used to walk down the hallways with his hands up in the air as if he were in surrender. Why? Because he did not want to accidentally touch someone and be accused of being inappropriate. 

If humans are really the communal creatures that people say we are, then are we devolving? (Terrible word for reverse evolution I know, I apologize) Cause from what I've been seeing, we're retreating further and further behind our gadgets and can go days without being physically and emotionally touched because we have to respect boundaries. 

Touch is the least used of all our five senses in today's society, I believe. When was the last time you were touched willingly by a person?
