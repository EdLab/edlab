<p>Educators active on social media have likely come across <a href=" http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/">Larry Ferlazzo’s Websites of the Day</a>, a thorough compilation of resources and tips for teaching English and integrating technology in the classroom. Multiple resource-rich posts are authored daily by <a href="http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/about/">Larry Ferlazzo</a>, a teacher at <a href=" http://lutherburbank.scusd.edu/">Luther Burbank High School</a> in Sacramento, California who works with English Language Learners and mainstream students. In addition to developing content for his site, he has written six books on education (most recently, <a href=" http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2013/10/02/education-week-releases-my-newest-book/">"Classroom Management Q and A's: Expert Strategies for Teaching"</a> and <a href=" http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2013/01/17/heres-the-table-of-contents-link-to-pre-order-my-upcoming-book/">"Self-Driven Learning: Teaching Strategies for Student Motivation"</a>), and writes weekly posts for <a href=" http://www.edweek.org/tm/">Education Week Teacher</a> and <a href=" http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/">The Learning Network</a>, a resource sharing community for teachers created with materials and ideas based on New York Times content. His robust presence in online communities (including enthusiastic <a href=" https://twitter.com/Larryferlazzo">social media engagement</a>) serves as a model for how teachers can successfully leverage online platforms to share best practices.</p>


<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think it’s more my professional background than educational one that has affected my work. I was a community organizer for nineteen years prior to becoming a high school teacher ten years ago. I saw what people were learning through organizing -- about how to make political and personal change, the importance of diversity and developing allies, reflecting on personal responsibility and successes/mistakes -- and how dramatically those lessons were changing their lives for the better. People were learning these lessons in their twenties, thirties, forties, fifties, and beyond. And, I thought, "Boy, maybe I can do something to help people learn these things at a younger age." That's what led me to teaching.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Clearly, my organizing work has been the professional experience that has informed my work the most. I learned through it that I can't really "motivate" someone else over the long term. What I can do, however, is help people identify and connect with what they can use to motivate themselves.  In other words, elicit from them their hopes and dreams, and then work together to figure out the most effective ways for them to achieve them.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 


<b>Answer:</b> I'm not sure my work will "change the learning landscape."  I hope that, perhaps, a few more educators will make it a higher priority to emphasize intrinsic motivation instead of rewards/punishments in the classroom.  And, maybe, my organizing experience and experience can be useful in developing effective strategies in the education policy arena.  But, to tell you the truth, I'll be satisfied if I can just have some positive impacts on my students' lives.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think one key issue is if some so-called "school reformers" are going to be successful in making test scores the be-all and end-all measurement of teacher and student success. The outcome of that battle will go a long way to determining what life in the classroom is going to look like -- is it going to be focused on teaching to the test or is it going to also emphasize the broader life skills our students and communities need? I think a similar fight will be taking place about the role of technology, which is clearly going to be expanded in education – will it be a useful tool teachers can use to engage students and genuinely use to differentiate instruction, or will it become a depersonalized learning system where the essential human connection is devalued?
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Besides working hard -- and enjoying -- teaching classes at our high school, I'm writing my seventh book. It will be the third in my series on student motivation. I also write a weekly teacher advice column for Education Week Teacher, and a weekly post for The New York Times on teaching English Language Learners, and pieces for other publications. I'm also hoping one of the basketball teams I play on wins the tournament we play in next week.
