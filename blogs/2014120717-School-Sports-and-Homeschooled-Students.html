            Homeschooling is not a new phenomenon. It has been part of the educational landscape for quite some time now. Parents prefer homeschooling for various reasons: educational, social, cultural, health, political and religious. Some parents see it as an opportunity to bond with their children while also closely monitoring their academic progress. However, the one constant complaint against homeschooling is the social development of the students.

This <a href="http://www.messagemedia.co/millelacs/community/education/article_14dbb1c4-7a3e-11e4-b2a3-37a319cafaf9.html" target = "blank">article</a> highlights the efforts of several schools to increase social experiences for homeschooled students. These include allowing resident homeschooled students to participate in school sports and other school related extra curricular activities. However, the students have to meet certain requirements related to their academic work and attendance. This is a tricky road as the academic and attendance requirement reports come the student's parents. There are also restrictions. Homeschooled students taking online courses through another school district may not qualify to participate in their district's extra curricular activities.
