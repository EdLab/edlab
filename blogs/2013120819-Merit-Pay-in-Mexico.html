<b>Title:</b> The impact of Merit-Pay Systems on the Work and Attitudes of Mexican Academics
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Jesús Francisco Galaz-Fontes & Manuel Gil-Antón
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10734-013-9610-3/fulltext.html">Higher Education</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Reforming the American school system through merit-pay for teachers has been a hotly debated proposal for years now. However, little attention has been paid to higher education, and the potential for reform in our colleges and universities. Although merit pay has been implemented in many such institutions, it often covers such a small percentage of an academic’s salary, as compared to the eternal quest for tenure and grants, that it can’t have very much impact, positive or negative. Merit-pay in Mexican universities, on the other hand, is a far more extensive practice and has been in place for decades, with increasing impact and rigor.
<p>
The authors of this study took data from a 2008 survey of Mexican faculty, along with supplementary historical information, to analyze the effects, over the last few decades, of the various merit-pay programs that have been implemented.  
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Merit-pay can account for around half of the take home pay for a typical academic with much of this pay being tied to the acquisition of further credentials. In general, merit-pay in Mexico, which encourages publication and academic impact, pulls highly qualified faculty from teaching into research, and diminishes their involvement in institutional governance. 
<p>
Perhaps most significant are the effects of merit pay on academic work and Mexican higher education overall. Many surveyed academics reported that merit-pay programs offering money for academics who have completed various activities related to but not directly involved in teaching or research have produced a culture of "academic simulation," where professors will, for instance, unnecessarily include each other as authors in conference presentations, logrolling for merit-pay points.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study offers a clear warning for future policy designers.  As the American statistician W. Edwards Deming once pointed out, "you can expect what you inspect." Any incentive system is, at its best, only as good as the specific behavior it’s incentivizing, and oftentimes the actions or achievements that the designers thought of only as proxies for the desired behavior become in themselves the goals for those working within the system.
