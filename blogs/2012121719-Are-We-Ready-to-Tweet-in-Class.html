<b>Title:</b> Tweeting for Learning: A Critical Analysis of Research on Microblogging in Education (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Fei Gao, Tian Luo, & Ke Zhang
</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01357.x/full">Tweeting for Learning: A Critical Analysis of Research on Microblogging in Education</a> examined 21 empirical studies on microblogging completed between 2008 and 2011. The selected studies were either qualitative or quantitative and discussed one or more of the following learning dimensions: effort or efficiency of learning, learning outcomes, convenience of access, motivation, and engagement.</p>

<p>Because the selected studies did not have enough statistical information for a meta-analysis, the authors conducted a three-part assessment of the information. First, they analyzed each study for settings, participants, sample size, duration of intervention, educational practices, research types, data types and educational effects. They then identified common themes around learning community, participation, engagement, reflective thinking, and collaborative learning across the learning practices and effects described in the studies. Finally, they considered the challenges and made suggestions for implementing microblogging in education.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors found that, across studies and diverse settings, microblogging encourages participation, engagement, reflective thinking, and collaborative learning. They found that the biggest challenge across studies was participantsâ€™ lack of familiarity with microblogging. Though microblogging is gaining popularity, it is an "older" social technology, and this bias was reflected in the studies: only 3 of the 21 studies focused on microblogging in K-12 educational settings, most examined higher education. According to the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2010/PIP_Social_Media_and_Young_Adults_Report_Final_with_toplines.pdf">Pew Internet Project surveys</a>, only 8% of 12 to 17-year-old internet users are active on Twitter, in contrast to 19% of adult internet users.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> From this and other studies, it is becoming clear that social media in education inspires engagement and collaboration. Most studies on the subject are highly structured, so it is unclear that these results reflect real user behavior in education or whether the effect is related to a higher acceptance of technology in general. It is also difficult to extrapolate the long term implications and macro changes to education that widespread acceptance of these technologies will inspire. These studies model best practices, but microblogging "in the field" may have unexpected results. Microblogging was flagged in many of the considered studies as beneficial for language education, as the 140-character text limit helped young learners write concisely, but social media education has been equally <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750">critiqued</a> for reducing emphasis on critical thinking. Future research in this area could focus on the long-term communication effects of learning through social media.
