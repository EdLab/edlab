I'd like to begin inviting you all into my mind to share my thought processes when designing and drawing for VisualizED. When there's so little space (600x450px), and such short attention spans, it's imperative to get as much of the point across in just a glance. 

The following is about an article from Pop Sci Online about a Netherlands research team that developed software to read and recognize a student's facial expressions. I guess it looks like this image, provided in the article:

<img src="http://www.popsci.com/files/imagecache/article_image_large/articles/fraunhofer-face-mood.jpg" width="300px"/>

Sounded like a cool story... I wanted to convey that it shouldn't be too hard to "detect" when a student is frustrated... So here is our final visual and thematic interpretation of this story:

<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/facialcue_524e9606e660465aa1c59c1354cc3e23.jpg" width="300px"/>

Here's how this piece got started...
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/crackedscreen_03_b784837658f44d8fa7951d5f5b1a140b.jpg" width="300px"/>

But something was missing... The tension was already released in the previous sketch. So Fred suggested we show the student BEFORE smashing in the screen (out of frustration). And thus the next sketch:
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/crackedscreen_04_process_02_6062b770a28843cab8a9e88409e3f35a.jpg" width="300px"/>

When it came to executing the final piece, lines and perspective are always strategic to draw the viewer's eyes to the points that matter most. In other words, the greater stimulus should always be on the things that matter most to the viewer (i.e. use of color and lines). Text is there only to support the image --not to tell the whole story. 

I.e. The gauge meter is one example of a visual that can speak for itself (its shape is familiar, plus red is the ultimate attention-seeker)... but the text simply reinforces its meaning. Also, the perspective of the elements in the image should cause the viewer's eyes to go back and forth from the baseball bat to the screen (see my faint red lines)... and that's how this illustration (hopefully) comes to life! 
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/crackedscreen_04_process_01_0307d5b752ce4f58bca3ebb2b0041391.jpg" width="300px"/>

So in the end, hopefully this illustration doesn't take up too much cognitive load. 
When drawing, I encourage you to be conscious of where your lines cross. Do lines converge awkwardly? If they are parallel, are they so close that the viewer might get confused about what is what?

If you have any suggestions of comments for greater improvement, let me know!
