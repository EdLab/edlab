          <p>
            People who've never played or do not understand soccer often ask question the world's infatuation with 22 people running around on a big field chasing one ball. The answer is quite simple: there is more to soccer than what catches the eye. 

Soccer is the only sport that can end wars, build common ground for people with opposing views, among countless other reasons; quite simply, it is beautiful. Close to two billion people tuned in to watch Italy beat France nearly a year ago for the World Cup title. There is no single game in the world that can grip the attention of so many people at the same time. For 90+ minutes, the world stood still to watch 22 men chasing a round ball, and one is expected to believe soccer is just a sport? It is a life, a movement, and a religion worshipped by the masses. As a player, but more importantly, as a fan, I understand and appreciate the culture that is soccer, but the non-player or fan need to understand and appreciate it as well because it is special. 

Most club teams, regardless of the level, are comprised of people from all corners of the world. If people with different beliefs, views, skin color, social class, ethnicity, and upbringing can come together to share a single ball, why can't societies do the same thing? When the national team of Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 World Cup, their nation was embroiled in civil unrest. When the ball was kicked between them and Argentina in their first ever World Cup game, the whole nation came to a standstill; the warring factions laid down their arms and realized for a single moment that they were one-united in solidarity with their fellow brothers thousands of miles away on a pitch in Hamburg. The factions never raised their arms again as they found in one single moment that if their fellow countrymen can find a common ground with just one ball, why couldn't they? 

Soccers biggest stars gather every year to play in various charity matches to benefit the most disadvantaged people of the world and FIFA (soccer's governing body) has a special development program aimed at helping impoverished countries. The stories of soccer's influence are countless. When Europe's major countries spread their love of soccer to their overseas colonies, they had no idea that they were creating a movement, a passion, a dream, and more importantly, a change. When you see people dying or protesting over a soccer game, you must understand for all the aforementioned reasons that it is much more than a game to them. It is all their hopes, aspirations, beliefs, and fears.
