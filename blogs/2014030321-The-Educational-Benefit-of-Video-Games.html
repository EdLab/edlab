          <p>
            I will be focusing my theme on gaming and its impact on education and innovation. I am an avid gamer (e.g. NBA 2K, FIFA 14) and though I mainly play for leisure purposes, I think there exists an enormous potential for gaming to improve one's critical thinking skills; especially at a time where there is increased public and private sector interest in improving K-12 students' critical thinking and reasoning skills. For instance, when I am playing FIFA 14, I am constantly finding ways to out-think my opponent, whether setting up to play defensively or offensively. These critical thinking skills can be carried into the classroom.
 
Some might argue that games that are created for purely entertainment purposes have no role in the classroom. However, I feel games have enormous power to change students, especially those apathetic to coursework that requires a lot of critical thinking, since they are doing something they enjoy and/or are familiar with. Additionally, it can also lead students to create their own games for issues they feel strongly about. For instance, one of my avid game friends is interested in creating a game/app for students in his native Ivory Coast (where my parents are also from) to learn about crucial issues in that country. A grant was <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/02/grants-awarded-to-youths-making-games-that-address-social-change/">recently awarded to 20 minority teens</a> that have created video games based on a social issue of particular interest to them.
 
Do you think video games have potential in the classroom? What are some interesting use cases you can think of?
