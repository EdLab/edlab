            Many refugee children struggle excessively in all aspects of their life. It is not easy living on a foreign soil, and trying to acclimate to its system and culture. Another problem is adapting to the educational system. Math, Science, and Literature are subjects that are taught globally, but every country has a method of teaching these subjects. The difference in languages and curriculums is the primary reason why a refugee student may struggle to excel.

For instance, in Syria, the turmoil that began in 2011 has forced many people to leave the country. It is estimated that more than one million Syrians have found refuge in Lebanon, a neighboring country with its own political, social and economic problems. More than half of the refugees are children and about 400,000 are of school age. These refugees may have found a new home and safer environment but Lebanon is a country with limited resources. The Lebanese curriculum is developed in English or in French, but “In Syria, even English was taught in Arabic.”

As expected, some of the refugees wish to receive the educational privileges they had back in Syria. But it won't happen. They must learn to adapt to the Lebanese educational system. To read more about the risks, assets, and processes that influence the achievement of Syrian refugee children in the Lebanese public schools, <a href="http://www.al-fanarmedia.org/2014/10/simple-effective-ways-improve-refugee-education/" target = "blank">click here</a>.
