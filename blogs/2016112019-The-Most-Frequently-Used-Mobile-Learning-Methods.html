<p>Mobile learning, or m-learning, is gaining respect in the classroom as an increasing number of students have their own mobile devices. Not all m-learning activities are equal, however, so it’s important to understand what real teachers consider the most useful and effective pedagogical approaches to this emerging form of learning.</p>
 
<p>A recent study in New Zealand collected data from 24 middle school classrooms implementing m-learning where each student had their own mobile device. The research aim was to figure out the most frequent uses of m-learning, as well as which uses enhanced classroom learning the most. The researchers found that the main way students used mobile tech was to augment learning with task activities, such as receiving immediate feedback from their teachers. In addition, classes also frequently used mobile tech for information access, such as online searches, and innovative media production, such as using iMovie for class projects. These approaches were each used at least weekly in the participating classrooms.</p>
 
<p>This study also found that mobile tech allowed students to simultaneously collaborate both in and out of the classroom and to engage with informal learning (i.e., learning that takes place outside an academic institution). In addition to the uses highlighted above, m-learning can also assume several pedagogical approaches, including collaboration and informal learning.</p>
 
<p>As more students have their own mobile devices, more teachers are figuring out ways to effectively use them in the classroom. This study highlights some of the key uses m-learning can have and suggests that this emerging form of pedagogy may make transformative changes in teaching and learning. After all, with mobile tech, learning is literally in students’ hands.</p>
