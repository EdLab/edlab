<p>For decades, it has been man’s mission to walk on Mars, and the <a href="https://lt.tc.columbia.edu">Smith Learning Theater</a> finally accomplished this herculean task. The Out of This World Learning Experience took participants from the fourth floor of the Teachers College library to the faraway surface of the mysterious red planet in an interactive theatrical phantasmagoria both educational and awe-inspiring. The EdLab team manned the two-hour expedition on multiple occasions throughout the 2017-2018 school year, debuting in October and dispatching its last mission in March.</p>

<p>As Kim Kefgen states, the experience was designed both to introduce people to the far-ranging capacities of this innovative learning space and educate them about Earth’s planetary neighbor. At EdLab, Kefgen designs and creates learning experiences for the Learning Theater, and also leads the services team and education program at the Gottesman Libraries. Kefgen and a team of creative technology designers, video producers, and other EdLab staff members prototyped activities, games, and settings throughout the entire year in order to design the Mars learning experience. The educational event was both theatrical and interactive, with participants taking on scientific roles, moving around the Learning Theater space, and completing activities and games in order to succeed in their Mars mission.</p>
 
<p>Kefgen, who worked professionally in NYC theater for over 15 years, and the team of EdLab staff members worked together for months to create a learning experience at once aesthetic, hands-on, challenging, and exciting. The Learning Theater is designed to create awe-inspiring and unique educational experiences. By creating the Out of this World Learning Experience, Kefgen and her team demonstrated the space’s potential to transport learners to completely different contexts, and in doing so expanded the limits of educational experiences to new frontiers.</p>
