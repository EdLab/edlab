          <p>
            The Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) has <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/07/07/36parcc.h30.html?tkn=LOMFAJ3KSV%2BWVXEqMzhoTem5s8v1F8IyblOp&cmp=clp-edweek">decided to curtail</a> some of its efforts to create a common standardized assessment for mathematics and language arts. PARCC, one of two state assessment consortia, initially aimed to build an assessment system around four quarterly <a href="http://www.nmsa.org/Publications/WebExclusive/Assessment/tabid/1120/Default.aspx">summative</a> tests that were intended to be used for accountability purposes. These summative tests were intended to include a variety of formats, including essays and computer-based examinations as the article indicates.

Ultimately, states are showing much resistance to this model of assessment because of the impact it has on individualized pacing of course material, the financial cost, and the time-consuming nature of the assessments. As a result, PARCC has dropped two of the assessment components and moved the remaining two components to the end of the year. The two dropped components will still be offered as optional resources for formative and diagnostic purposes, although they will probably not be utilized.

It seems like there is good news and bad news in both what PARCC was initially proposing and what their new model is going to be. On one hand, pushing assessment towards the end of the year is only going to raise the stakes of testing further, which is particularly undesirable given the testing scandals we have been witnessing recently. While continuous assessment is a viable way to lower the stakes if done correctly, using summative tests throughout the year was probably a bad move that has rightfully been shot down. As many states have complained, using summative tests throughout the year leads to strict control over curricula and their pacing. On a final note, it saddens me that formative assessment will only be made optional and will thus not be adopted by most states.

It seems to me that the only way to test throughout the year, a crucial element to ending the problems that come with high-stakes testing, is to utilize formative tests. Formative tests have been shown as an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/science/21memory.html?_r=2&src=me&ref=general">empirically effective</a> teaching tool, and thus would not eat into "learning time". Moreover, formative tests are not as rigid, thus allowing for greater flexibility in the pacing of curricula. The trick is how to offer low-cost, flexible formative testing resources.
