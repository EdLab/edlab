          <p>
            On Thursday April 11th, my Virtual Enterprise class attended a trade fair in New York, in which firms from around the United States and a couple other countries showcased their products in trying to win costumers from across the globe. Virtual Enterprise is an imaginary company run as any other company out in the real world, with a CEO and other branches. The main objective of the class is to get students to have an abstract vision of what it is to run a company in the real world, and how to face economic problems and adversity in the market. 

<a href="http://imaginationinc2.wix.com/omnitool">Imagination</a> is the name of my company, and our main brands are Kadabra and Omitools. Every business is to present their products to a panel in the borough and the city competition in order to win best firm of the country after the nationals. Unfortunately, our company lost in the nationals to the veterans, the ones used to wining every year. I plan to major in business marketing in college so being in this class helps me to have a basic outlook of the kind of work I will be doing in the real world and how to bring creativity in order to contribute to the evolution of the company. 

I have been able to develop leadership, collaboration and salesmanship skills during my seven months in the Virtual Enterprise class. Since the class consists of only seniors, we interview and get a certain amount of juniors to run the company smoothly and successfully for the next academic year. Can my fellow EdLabbers give me a few pointers on how or who to hire? Any feedback would be appreciated.
