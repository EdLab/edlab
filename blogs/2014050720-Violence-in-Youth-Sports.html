          <p>
            Sports in general have several benefits for  individuals that participate in their respective sports as well as their families. For some time now, the success rate of most professional athletes who have proved to be consistent throughout their years in school till they made it to the professional level, has made a lot of people view sports as investments. Considering what this <a href="http://newsinfo.iu.edu/web/page/normal/4727.html">article</a> sheds more light on, it is evident that violence in sports has become rampant due to the notion of most athletes and their families that, sports is probably the best investment for them in terms of being succesful in life. As a result of people viewing sports as a culture or as an investment, fans mostly engage in acts of violence that go beyond just yelling. Parents sometimes go as far as striking coaches and fans also throw objects at players and sometimes officials.
<p>
 In order to minimize these acts of violence, it is necessary to put several measures in place. These measures include the implementation of silent matches where fans are only allowed to applaud and not cheer or yell. Another way to eradicate violence in youth sports can also be to make sure officials are on their toes in terms of ensuring that unsportsmanlike behaviors are not tolerated on the field of play. Sports are meant to bring people together. Violence should not be tolerated at any level of sports.
