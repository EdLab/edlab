          <p>
            There are many research projects conducted to determine whether sports help individuals become better students. According to this <a href="http://educationnext.org/behind-headline-americas-challenging-high-schools-2014/">article</a>, the first major research of this sort found that 67 of the 100 most challenging academic high schools in the U.S. do not have football teams. This was done to analyze whether sports teams (e.g. football) are bad for students. Another study was conducted and the results of which included a proposal for schools to removes sports and replace them with other academic programs. The most interesting research found that high schools that spent more time and energy on sports tended to produce very good results in terms of academics as well.

I think academics and sports should be merged. Most people tend to make claims that schools that devote too much time to sports tend to perform poorly in academics. This could not be far from the truth. Sports, for the most part, involve calculations and other exercises that require critical thinking and analysis. Undoubtedly, an athlete who is able to apply the skills of critical thinking into academic work will most likely be successful. High Schools should be encouraged to have more sports programs because that will help develop academics as well.
