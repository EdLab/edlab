<p>There’s growing concern about the impact of frequent internet use on adolescents. Having grown up in the digital age, young people’s lives are completely enmeshed with the online world, and some adolescents end up engaging in compulsive and unhealthy internet use. Although some research has been done analyzing the extent of the problem, few studies have examined the risk and protective factors of this addictive behavior.</p>

<p>Researchers at the University of Córdoba set out to examine the relationship between social and emotional competencies and technology abuse in adolescents. They also looked at the impact of emotional content in online communication as well as experience with bullying. This study surveyed 2,139 adolescents from randomly selected schools in the Andalusia region of Spain. Researchers then analyzed the results from the questionnaires using correlation and regression analyses to understand the relationship between the various variables. </p>
 
<p>The results showed that adolescents with high levels of social-emotional competence were less likely to abuse technology. Specifically, high levels of self-motivation, self-management, and responsible decision-making skills were least associated with this abusive behavior. More experience with school bullying (whether as a victim or perpetrator) and high emotional content in online communication were related to increased technology abuse. </p>

<p>This study suggests that building an adolescent’s social and emotional competency is a key strategy for preventing this abusive use of the internet. Schools can invest in programs that nurture these skills and in programs to prevent bullying. In addition, providing more opportunities for students to interact with each other face-to-face may help build these skills and help form in-person relationships that make going on the internet less appealing. </p>
