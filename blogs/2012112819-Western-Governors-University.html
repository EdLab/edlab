<i>The principal mission of Western Governors University is to improve quality and expand access to post-secondary educational opportunities by providing a means for individuals to learn independent of time and place and to earn competency-based degrees and other credentials that are credible to both academic institutions and employers.</i>
<p>
<b>An Online University for the 21st Century</b>
<p>
Olympic athlete Chaunte Lowe recently made news for more than just her performance in the London 2012 games; this time her education was on the podium.  Lowe recently enrolled at <a href="http://www.wgu.edu/">Western Governors University</a> (WGU) in the online M.A. in Teaching Mathematics program.  In the news for the past few years for its unique combination of a "competency-based" approach and affordability, WGU offers a new model of post-secondary online learning.  Fully accredited and established by nineteen U.S. Governors, the overall focus of the non-profit institution is affordability and accessibility.  The programs all have a focus on self-paced learning and are aimed primarily at older, non-traditional students who need to improve their marketability in the lackluster job market.  Educational resources are aimed at helping off-site, self-paced students succeed and include an <a href="http://www.wgu.edu/about_WGU/library_bookstore">online library</a> that links students through an interlibrary loan program directly to the University of Michigan’s library.  Additionally, many e-texts are available as a low-cost alternative to traditional textbooks.  Incorporated in 1995, the university has enrolled over 30,000 undergraduate and graduate-level students in fields ranging from business to information technology and various health professions.  The University also includes an NCATE-accredited <a href="http://www.wgu.edu/education/online_teaching_degree">Teachers College</a> with subject and grade-specific undergraduate, post-baccalaureate and graduate tracks.  Rapidly growing in acceptance and popularity as a viable alternative to traditional institutions, the program just might soon exceed Time Magazine’s assessment as, "The best relatively inexpensive university you’ve never heard of."     
<p>
<b>Unique in a Sea of For-Profits</b>
<p>
What is unique about this program as compared to for-profit online institutions like <a href="http://www.phoenix.edu/">University of Phoenix</a> and <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/">Kaplan</a>?  The answer is a "competency-based" approach.  Students who demonstrate mastery of a subject area are able to "test-out" of certain classes, thereby graduating faster and with less financial burden.  Unique to both online and brick and mortar institutions, this approach helps to lower the cost and time commitment for busy, working students.  Another way that WGU is different is its hybrid approach to online learning that blends, self-paced home study with in-person testing at dedicated centers located around the country.  While not entirely new, this approach cuts down on what many critics feel are, along with quality of instruction, major disadvantages of online courses, cheating and credibility.  The final major distinguishing point is perhaps price.  WGU charges a flat rate ($2,890) per six-month term, regardless of the number of credit hours, with the average WGU Master’s Degree weighing-in at just under $12K.  
 
While the WGU model is a viable option for better-than-average students and content experts, what remedial resources are available to serve students who fall behind? Will these students ultimately have to pay more to remain in the system longer?  Are there WGU tutoring resources as well as testing centers in the works?  Perhaps not a perfect alternative for everyone, WGU is a valuable non-profit voice in a cacophony of for-profit noise, which according to <a href="http://www.help.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=45c8ca2a-b290-47ab-b452-74d6e6bdb9dd&groups=Chair">this recent U.S. Senate report</a>, may ultimately end up costing everyone from students to taxpayers MUCH more in the end.
