            "In a world in which information is like air, what happens to power?" A film project about the power of mass collaboration, government and the internet.

The film "US Nowâ€œ describes itself as a film project on collaboration of the masses, government and the internet. It shows British Social Media initiatives that are based on the collective intelligence. The main argument of the film is, that basically any institution or corporation like hotels, football teams, the government, banks and schools can be replaced by social media, which are controlled by humans. 

"New technologies and a closely related culture of collaboration present radical new models of social organisation. This project brings together leading practitioners and thinkers in this field and asks them to determine the opportunity for government."

Just some quotes and things I was reflecting about while watching (Critter would be helpful now...;-))

Check out: Couchsurfing, Mumsnet.
Old rules in society (sharing information in your community like mothers on the playground) are just taken to another level and tools support and foster these old human behaviors.

There is a very positive development in society: more and more people help each other and share. Not like the traditional knowledge management model of "knowledge is power", but instead "the cost of giving information for you is a lot less than the benefit you get back" is becoming more and more visible. The idea of: "you got one thing to teach but a lot of things to learn" is omnipresent.
Theses social media systems are highly specific and individualized.

Companies have to clean up because of transparency and customer power. Every company is getting naked! We will have a positive supply side shock!


About the film:

SYNOPSIS
"In his student flat in Colchester, Jack Howe is staring intently into his computer screen. He is picking the team for Ebbsfleet United's FA Trophy Semi-Final match against Aldershot . Around the world 35,000 other fans are doing the same thing, because together, they own and manage the football club.  If distributed networks of people can run complex organisations such as football clubs, what else can they do? Us Now takes a look at how this type of participation could transform the way that countries are governed.  It tells the stories of the online networks whose radical self-organising structures threaten to change the fabric of government forever. Us Now follows the fate of Ebbsfleet United, a football club owned and run by its fans;  Zopa, a bank in which everyone is the manager; and Couch Surfing, a vast online network whose members share their homes with strangers. The founding principles of these projects -- transparency, self-selection, open participation -- are coming closer and closer to the mainstream of our social and political lives.  Us Now describes this transition and confronts politicians George Osborne and Ed Milliband with the possibilities for participative government as described by Don Tapscott and Clay Shirky amongst others."
