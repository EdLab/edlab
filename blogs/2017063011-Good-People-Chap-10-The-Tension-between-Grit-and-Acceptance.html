Angela Lee Duckworth’s work in psychology has helped popularize it in discussions about the purpose of K-12 education (see her TED talk above).</div><div><br /></div><div>Not opposite of grit, but rather a tempering behavior, is “acceptance.” From what I glean from the chapter, this is a vaguely religious behavior akin to making a decision to stop persevering.</div><div><br /></div><div>Tjan offers two big examples of good people who balanced their inner grit with acceptance, to different ends: a fire chief who decides to end the fight against deadly fire, and a sailor who survives eleven weeks adrift in the ocean.</div><div><br /></div><div>Interestingly, both stories are about facing death, which, to my mind, is a pretty extreme case for thinking about grit. (Extreme cases are often narratively compelling at the cost of being philosophically simpler and unhelpful.) Of Tjan’s eight strategies for balancing grit and acceptance, I found his call to “be receptive to new inputs” personally most compelling.</div><div><br /></div><div>The fire chief, for example, felt certain that “more firemen would die” if they kept battling the fire. The old adage of “throwing good money after bad” comes to mind (though I apologize for the incongruity between an adage about gambling and a true story of a gruesome fire). Leadership, Tjan implies, is about knowing when to “throw in the towel” for the sake of a greater vision. Sorry for the sports idiom.</div><div><br /></div><div>Oh, unless it’s a matter of literally having no reason to give up. Yes, if you’re a man dying on a raft, there is no reason to ever give up. No one wins and you lose. That’s it for you: shark dinner. So, try to make it a long time and you might get a lucky break.</div><div><br /></div><div>Duckworth has some really interesting things to say about grit, and how individuals can balance different goals in different contexts. Learning to contextualize immediate struggle within a broader goal is a very valuable habit.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are some nice ideas in this chapter if you get the drift and reflect a bit about how quickly you give up, and if it’s a pattern, and if maybe you should be a little more tenacious. You know who you are.</div><div><br /></div><div>My summary (liberties taken):</div><div><br /></div><ul><li>There are really interesting things being said about grit as a character trait, but Tjan isn't the one saying them.</li><li>Be gritty, except when too many people have died already.</li><li>There is also a bullet point list of some really vague things to think during job interviews.</li></ul>
