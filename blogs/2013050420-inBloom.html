<i>inBloom is bringing together states and districts from across the country to improve and align technology systems and teaching resources. There is no reason why each state should have to tackle this challenge alone â€“ together, we have the potential to change the way education works for students on a large scale</i> (<a href=" https://www.inbloom.org/our-vision">inBloom</a>).
 
<p>
<b>inBloom to Provide Data TLC</b><br>
Currently, there is both a learning and data problem in American schools.  Learning, in that US students <a href= "http://hechingerreport.org/content/despite-gains-us-students-lag-behind-asian-peers_10539/">consistently fall behind their global peers</a> and data, in that there are <a href="http://www.turningdataintoaction.org/sites/default/files/reports/deliverable_2_vendor_summary_report_v17.pdf">many disparate options for the management of educational data</a> and very few real connection points between these applications.  inBloom hopes to provide a solution to this problem by both supporting open source edtech development and working to create a shared data infrastructure to funnel student data to these new technologies.  
 <p>
<b>EdTech Alliance</b><br>
Through an alliance of, "states, foundations, educators, content providers, developers and vendors who are passionate about using technology to improve education" and by creating the technology and data services to support a "shared learning infrastructure" (SLI), the group hopes to lay the groundwork to create a secure, networked infrastructure through which all learning data from US schools would flow and avoid the added burden to educators involved in managing often conflicting data streams and collection points. This centralized infrastructure would host student and school data, eliminate the need for multiple accounts and the often overlooked "sticking point" of password management.  As Dian Schaffhauser notes, "To date, the number of elements in play that supply the necessary data that would help teachers truly differentiate learning are so numerous and complex that no one organization or company has been in a position to help schools take on this holy grail of instruction."   
<p>
<b>Connecting the Data Dots</b><br>
inBloom has worked with nine states in nationwide pilot programs, hosted EdTech hackathons and workshops throughout the country and launched both the alpha and v1.0 of their SLI.  Beyond these initiatives and the laying of a tech infrastructure, the group, hopes to move in a twofold direction towards data standardization, by operating as both a 501c3 organization and standalone SLI platform.  To help accomplish this goal the group recently elected a CEO, Iwan Streichenberger.  Streichenberger will help lead the non-profit arm of the group from a project to a full-blown non-profit organization.  This new entity has an overarching goal of "making personalized learning a reality for every state, district, school, teacher and student in the country."  They hope to accomplish this goal by providing the resources for developers to openly access tools that encourage greater ed tech development while fostering a nationwide "data commons" that is aligned with the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/the-standards">Common Core Standards</a>.  As anyone who has taught in a classroom can attest, simply managing attendance, never mind a myriad of random data points, can be overwhelming at best, and it is these often overlooked management tasks that get in the way of educators implementing game-changing initiatives and pedagogy.  Perhaps as the inBloom alliance of states and partner organizations grows they will build a nationwide bridge between educational technology companies, educators and the students who will eventually benefit from the custom-tailored lessons these systems aim to enable.  Now if we can just give already over-taxed teachers the time and resources needed to learn how to access and use these new resources. Is professional development also in the inBloom pipeline?
