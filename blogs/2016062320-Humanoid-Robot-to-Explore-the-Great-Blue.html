 <p>Man has climbed the cruelest of mountains in the world and traversed the most treacherous of terrain, yet he has far from discovered all its secrets. More than 70% of the earth’s surface is water, yet ocean exploration is the most dangerous expedition for humans to undertake. A team at Stanford University is working to change that with their new invention, a humanoid robot that can dive to a depth of a thousand meters in the great blue sea. With this robot, the team created a way for humans to explore the ocean virtually, without placing themselves in a dangerous situation. </p>

 <p>The robot, called Ocean One, is shaped like a scuba diver and controlled by humans on land. Using haptic technology, the person controlling the robotic diver is able to feel with it and control it with touch. With this, "The human can be connected to the robot in a very intricate and meaningful way," says Oussama Khatib, the leader of the team. "The two brains together form this amazing synergy." The robot’s maiden voyage was in April of this year to explore the abandoned shipwreck of La Lune, one of King Louis XIV’s flagships, off the coast of France. The robot returned to the surface with a vase in hand, a treasure from a wreck once forgotten.</p>

 <p>Do you think Ocean One is a useful tool for underwater exploration? Why do you think it’s worthwhile to connect human and robot in such a unique and intricate way? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/29498/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:07 dinosossi2:</b> I wonder what regular divers think of this technology. I imagine they might be amazed at the amplification of their normal abilities but think it is only a fraction of their normal experiences of discovery under water.</p>

<p><b>@02:18 saraehardman:</b> The use of haptic technology for this project is incredibly interesting and innovative. This syncs the robot with the human in an interactive way and lets the human actually feel and see in real time with the robot.</p>
