<p>People are increasingly watching news videos in a 360-degree format, but questions remain regarding how this experience differs from 2D news consumption in terms of both enjoyment and understanding. Unlike normal videos, 360-degree clips are best watched using a virtual reality headset such as Google Cardboard. A recent study compared how viewers responded to 360-degree news videos versus normal 2D news videos in four different areas: understanding, enjoyment, credibility, and sense of presence.</p>

<p>The study included 83 participants split into two groups: one group watched a news video in 360-degrees and the other watched the same video in 2D. Each did so in a headset, even those watching the flat 2D video. The clip itself was 3 minutes and 40 seconds long, and the content focused on people in a Middle Eastern country during wartime. After the video, each participant filled out a questionnaire measuring their reactions to the content.</p>

<p>Based on the participants’ responses, the 360-degree news video was altogether more enjoyable and surprisingly didn’t negatively affect viewers’ understanding of the content. In fact, those who watched the 360-degree video reported higher levels of trust regarding the video’s credibility than those who watched the 2D version. In addition, the viewers of the 360-degree video also reported a greater sense of presence in the story. This means that they felt like they were absorbed into the news story more than those watching the 2D version. Presence has been shown to improve understanding and memorization, meaning that 360-degree news stories could have greater potential than regular videos to help viewers retain information.</p>
 
<p>Altogether, the 360-degree news videos show a great amount of promise for viewers. These stories did not negatively affect comprehension, and only increased viewers’ enjoyment and trust in the news site.</p>
