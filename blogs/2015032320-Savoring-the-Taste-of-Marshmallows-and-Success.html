<p>Walter Mischel, a psychologist specializing in personality theory, tells us why the Marshmallow test on delayed gratification can be an indicator of a student’s academic success. He explains the role self-gratification and self-control play in education; in short, we aren't born with these strategies—we learn them.</p>

<p>Mischel’s experiment is described in his book, <a href=" http://www.amazon.com/Marshmallow-Test-Mastering-Self-Control/dp/0316230871/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423690336&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Marshmallow+Test%3A+Mastering+Self-Control">The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control</a>. Mischel first conducted his experiment in a Stanford University pre-Kindergarten classroom. In the experiment, a child was seated at a table with a treat in front of her. She was told if she waited while the experimenter left the room, she would get two treats when the experimenter returned. If she couldn’t wait, she just had to ring a bell and the experimenter would come back, but she would only get one treat. Mischel found that children who waited longer were able to achieve greater success in their lives—academic, professional, health and otherwise. </p>

<p>Mischel is careful to underscore that self-control is not only genetic; it can be learned. One strategy he offers, by way of example, is the technique of viewing what you desire as a picture. "Put a frame around it in your head," he says. Mischel found that students who saw the marshmallows as a picture could wait a very long time. Critics point out that the study was conducted with the children of faculty, but Mischel emphasizes that self-control can be learned and cultivated, even by children in unstable households or uncertain learning environments. </p>

<p>Do you think the Marshmallow test is a good indicator for a child’s future success? How can self-control be a good and a bad thing? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18992">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
<p><b>@5:23 Sappho:</b> It seems there is ambiguity between these "natural differences" and the fact that students can "acquire the skills." How do these remarks factor into the way teachers organize a classroom?</p>
<p><b>@5:29 Carla:</b> His knowledge of the literature on self-control in children is admirable!</p>
<p><b>@00:35 Anthony123:</b> "Seeing a picture of the marshmallows" helped students wait.</p>
