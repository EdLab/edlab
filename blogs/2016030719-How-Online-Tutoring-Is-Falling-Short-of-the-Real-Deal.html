<p>The global reach of digital technology has the potential to make educational resources more accessible to a larger population than ever before. However, successfully incorporating technology into classroom settings has proven difficult. The Los Angeles Unified School District’s iPad initiative suffered from <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">numerous setbacks</a> and demonstrated that despite technology's promise, moving it from one context to another without a plan isn't effective. </p>
 
<p>A recent study took a deeper look at the characteristics of successful tech integration in the context of digital tutoring. Researchers conducted interviews and tracked student attendance patterns to investigate the impact of digital tutoring on the reading and mathematics achievement levels of low-income students. </p>
 
<p>They found that students who were tutored on a face-to-face basis reached almost three times the level of math achievement as those who only received online tutoring. The least effective configuration for math tutoring was tutor-with-software-driven instruction. And for reading, curriculum-based software instruction was significantly less effective in increasing student achievement. </p>

<p>The researchers found that there is a negative association between math performance and curriculum accessed online when compared to programs that include face-to-face learning. The study also found a very strong association between the number of tutoring hours that a student received and increased student achievement. </p>

<p>The study outlined factors that should be considered when implementing digital tutoring. For example, when deciding on curricular formats, providers should consider whether curriculum is highly structured by software or more fluid where content is shaped by a live tutor. They should consider curriculum drivers. Are companies developing in-house curriculum without the input of expert teachers? Tutor types are important; is there no physical tutor at all? Or is there a technical assistant who responds to prompts? And lastly, location is a consideration; is tutoring completely online or face-to-face? </p>
 
<p>As digital tutoring expands throughout K–12 education, these programs should be studied to assess the quality of feedback and educational outcomes. Given the evidence that some urban students have significantly better access to technology at home than at school, digital tutoring may help narrow the achievement gap. </p>
