<p>If anyone has ever tried to give you multi-step instructions all at once, you may know just how important it is to organize information to reduce cognitive load. This is especially true for younger students taking online courses, where information can often be presented in an overwhelming way. Researchers therefore studied a group of seventh graders taking an online geometry class by presenting them with three different conditions when solving problems.</p>
 
<p>The first condition was a "split-attention" method, where the diagram of lines and angles was separate from the problem’s instructions. The second was an "integrated" approach, where the text was laid out amongst the diagram’s lines. And the third was a "self-managed" presentation, where the textual information was presented in movable boxes separate from the diagram. The participants could freely shift these boxes around as they solved the problems.</p>
 
<p>The students were then evaluated based on performance and responses to a survey on the degree of mental effort used for each condition. Results revealed that students who were able to physically move the text—the "self-managed" option—performed better than those who were not given that capability. However, there was no significant difference in performance between the integrated and self-managed options.</p>
 
<p>As the authors discuss, this study has potential implications for designing print and online learning materials. This is particularly salient for web-based courses that have the additional capacity to give students the opportunity to <i>physically</i> self-manage the content. Giving students the power to manipulate the information on the screen, allows students to organize it in ways that make the most sense to them.</p>
