            This impressive online prototype of Resource Description and Access (RDA) is a rule book, tutorial and productivity tool combined.

RDA will replace AACR2 in 2008 as the catalog librarian's bible.

Give it a try and send some feedback to the committee.

================================================

RDA: Resource Description and Access is a new cataloguing code for the digital world.  Built on the foundation established by AACR2, RDA will provide a comprehensive set of guidelines and instructions on resource description and access covering all types of content and media.  RDA's first release is anticipated in mid-2008 in an online format. 

While the Joint Steering Committee for AACR and the RDA Editor have been concentrating on the content of RDA, the Co-Publishers (the American Library Association, the Canadian Library Association, and the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals) have been developing the online product.  To that end, they have created a prototype for RDA Online. 

The Co-Publishers have made this prototype available for you to view.  

The URL is  http://www.rdaonline.org/

This is the same prototype that has been demonstrated to several focus groups and individual during the last two American Library Association conferences. 

Some suggestions for viewing the prototype: 

First, the prototype is available for viewing in four versions depending on resolution with sound and without sound (eye-readable text).

Depending on your internet connection, the audio in particular may take a few minutes to load.  So please be patient.

Second, the prototype is a is a snapshot, created for you to view and assess the functionality of the software and not the content of the RDA rules.  

When viewing the prototype, please focus on it as an online tool rather than critiquing the rules that have been included as examples. 

Finally, a short questionnaire has been attached to the prototype.  We are very eager to receive your impressions of the prototype, to know if we're on the right track in its development.  Please take the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire.  Let us hear from you while we're in this early stage of development.
