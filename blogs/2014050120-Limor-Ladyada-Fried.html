Engineer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">"DIY/Maker"</a> crusader and electronics evangelist, Limor "Ladyada" Fried, has done more to support STEM education than almost any other entrepreneur twice her age. After graduating from MIT with a <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Masters in Electrical Engineering</a> completed at the <a href="http://compcult.media.mit.edu/">Computing Culture Group</a> in <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT’s Media Lab</a>, Fried went on to found <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit Industries</a>, one of the world’s first "community-led" electronics companies. Founded in 2005, Adafruit now has a team of over 50 with a 15,000+ sq ft. factory space in which the group creates <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/">original educational content and video tutorials</a> while shipping thousands of "DIY" electronics supplies to home "makers" and institutions around the world. Fried also completed an <a href="http://eyebeam.org/people-fellows/fellows">Eyebeam fellowship</a>, was the first female engineer to be featured on the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/03/16/limor-fried-on-the-c.html">cover of <i>WIRED</i> magazine</a> and was named <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225213"><i>Entrepreneur</i> magazine’s Entrepreneur of the Year in 2012</a>. 

<p>
<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Working in and around open-source really influenced all of my work. The idea that you can publish and share software & hardware and others can build upon and improve is the how Adafruit was started.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Teaming up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman">Mitch Altman on the TV-B-Gone</a> (amongst other projects) was, and is, great. Mitch goes around the world teaching electronics at hackerspaces using the kit and project we worked on together.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
Right now if you're an electronics company a community of makers seek you out if you have great tutorials, videos and customer support - I would like to see more companies outside our industry adopt this approach. It's seems counterintuitive.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think learning will need to move more and more towards online + video with projects as part of the goal. At Adafruit we're teaching electronics which is a really challenging subject; we've found that the combination of a well designed learning system (<a href="http://learn.adafruit.com">learn.adafruit site</a>) along with a frequent video publishing schedule (visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/adafruit">Adafruit’s YouTube page</a>) - all centered around completing a project - gets the most number of people learning skills.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We're currently working on the new version of <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com">learn.adafruit</a>; with the new updates we'll be able to have more people sharing their projects and interacting with hardware directly while they are learning!
