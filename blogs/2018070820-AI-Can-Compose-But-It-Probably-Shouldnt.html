<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notella-sight-reading-trainer/id1342983624?mt=8">Notella</a> is a sight reading trainer that claims to help you learn to sight read ten times faster. Created by a team at Georgia Tech, it utilizes AI and "cutting edge music analysis algorithms" to assess what kinds of mistakes you typically make and then generate sight reading exercises that target your weaknesses. While the app is initially free, after the first dozen exercises you are asked to upgrade to the "infinite music" subscription for $4.99 a month.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Notella provides easy access to an unlimited supply of unknown passages of music, making it, in theory, an ideal resource for anyone hoping to improve their accuracy at playing music they’re not familiar with. The fact that passages are generated by AI ensures their unfamiliarity, and the randomness of a non-human composer means that the user is given a true test of their ability to read whatever notes and rhythms are thrown at them.</p>

<p>Though the app can be utilized by any instrumentalist at any age or level, Notella is a tool primarily intended for middle and high school students trying to get into an All State ensemble. For students who are comfortable playing their practiced piece but need a confidence boost on the sight reading portion of the competition, Notella can be a great resource. Just knowing that the app is determining and targeting your weaknesses can make a difference in your playing and improve your chances at qualifying.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While AI-generated compositions do technically test sight reading, they ignore the reality that compositions are never random. While passages might not always have immediately obvious patterns, composers are intentional about the notes and rhythms they use, unlike AI. Notella compositions don’t sound like real music, which means they don’t encourage players to use their musical intuition and apply learned prediction skills when playing. </p>
 
<p>Even Notella’s ability to accurately assess the user’s sight reading skills is shaky. While it can easily detect wrong notes, accuracy is dependent on a very strict metronomical beat moving the tracker and the player forward. If you’re even slightly off tempo, none of the your notes will be marked as correct. This is not an authentic rendering of sight reading, and while I understand the need for a metronome to track rhythmic accuracy, the ability to change the tempo is desperately needed.</p> 

<p>Not only is the tempo unchanging, but the key signatures and time signatures hardly vary either. None of the pieces included any accidentals, complex time signatures, or key changes, all elements that are likely to be present in a human-composed, All State-qualifying sight reading piece.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you want to become a better sight reader, Notella is a fine place to start. However, beyond an initial trial, I honestly don’t believe it is worth $5 a month. You’re better off exchanging sheet music with friends to hone sight reading skills based on real music at your own tempo.</p>
