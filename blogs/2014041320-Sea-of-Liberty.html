<p>The Thomas Jefferson museum at his home in <a href="http://www.monticello.org/">Monticello</a> has produced an interactive website, <a href="http://www.seaofliberty.org/">Sea of Liberty</a>, to provide students and teachers with easy access and support for the primary source materials available at the museum, most notably an ongoing museum exhibit called <i>Thomas Jefferson and the Boisterous Sea of Liberty</i>.</p>

<p>Visitors can browse or search through the collection, with entries consisting of pictures and short descriptions. The meat of the website, however, is in the "challenges" provided, which typically involve exploring and making use of the resource archive to answer some historical prompt, either with a written or digital media response. These challenge responses can then be shared with other visitors to the site. Teachers who visit the site can also create their own challenges, and use the "class accounts" provided by the site to manage assigning these challenges to their students and sharing the results.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
<p>The site is well organized, and the "challenges" function is a clever way to scaffold engagement with a collection that students might not otherwise experience. In addition, the tools for answering these challenges are simple and effective, so that relatively young students can still produce attractive and effective presentations. The class accounts provided to teachers may also come in handy for teachers who want to support their students’ use of the site.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>As of yet, the site shows signs of only light use, so that the social elements aren’t able to come into play as much as would be desired. In particular there isn’t a large variety of challenges for students to fulfill.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Sea of Liberty admirably accomplishes its goal of providing students, teachers, and the general public with useful and motivating tools for engaging with the museum’s collection. As yet, however, it’s still waiting for a few more adventurous teachers to make use of it before it can really shine.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Definitely worthwhile for middle and high-school teachers in history and social studies courses who are looking for ways to make American history more engaging.</p>
