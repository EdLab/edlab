          <p>
            Check out the <a href="http://cci.mit.edu/index.html">MIT Center for Collective Intelligence</a> which opened this Friday.  The goal of the center is to connect groups of people and computers to create an organism which behaves more intelligently than any prior.

The concept is driven fundamentally by two ideas: (1) Metcalfe's law, which says the value of a network grows in proportion to the square of the number of members; and (2) The Chinese Room:  in short, if a black box performs a task successfully, then to an outsider it is immaterial what is inside the box (Searle was concerned with the insider's perspective).  

These ideas drive Amazon's Mechanical Turk, Google's Image Tagger and could someday generate self-regulating systems (or so I say).

The interesting dilemma which I believe is underplayed is that in practice, large networks are often used to divide a problem and attack it in pieces.  However, this is a reductionist perspective of knowledge which is incapable of addressing overarching themes - a dissertation cannot be evaluated by a network of people who divide it into 50 pieces for separate analysis.  <i>(Read on sucka!)</i>

However, this divide and conquer approach does allow many individuals to each put in minimal effort and produce a high involvment product (hence the use by Amazon and Google).  So how do we address the reductionist dilemma?  As a member of the network, if I'm responsible for grading a paragraph of a paper, I can't tell whether or not the paragraph fits well (part of good writing).  But perhaps if my paragraph also came with an executive summery or some other input to describe the larger context - then I could assess the fit!  Can computers be used to put each minimal effort into a context which adequately represents the full problem?  

I've realized divide and conquer actually can address large problems out of context - but only through an iterative process with measurable outcomes and a mode of selection.  Evolution works this way and in computer science, optimization problems are now often solved with "genetic algorithms."  Can this be utilized as well?  The Evolving Dissertation!
