<span style="font-weight: 400">No, I am currently studying economics at the New School.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Where’s your hometown?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Albany. But I’ve been all over the place. For most of my childhood I lived in Madison, Wisconsin.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">What did you want to be when you grew up?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The first career I ever wanted to have was to be a train conductor. I watched way too much Thomas the Tank Engine as a kid.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Your favorite meal?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a tough question. But I’d probably have to go with a good curry.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Solidarity Forever.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">A country you’d like to visit?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve always wanted to visit Russia. For a while Russian literature was all I read. I think Russia has the greatest writers in the world, a beautiful language, and a fascinating history.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">What was your first job?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Sales associate at Party City.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">What has been your worst job?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Sales associate at Party City. If you’ve ever been to a Party City - and I hope you haven’t had the misfortune of going to one, but if you have - you probably know that the place reeks of cheap rubber masks and cardboard and has the appearance of a depressing old warehouse. If you’ve spent enough time there, you will also note that the same ten awful, somewhat party-related, songs play on repeat (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I want candy…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">).</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">What has been your best job?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Working at Gottesman Libraries of course!</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">What do you remember about your first day of school?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t remember my first day of school but my mom says that I was kicking and screaming from the moment I got out of bed to the moment I entered the school. That sounds like it accurately describes how I felt about my K-12 education.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">A book you strongly recommend?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I’m currently working my way through Robert Caro’s biographical series on Lyndon Johnson. I’m only on the second volume but the first volume, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Path to Power</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, is easily the greatest work of nonfiction I have ever read.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve never been very athletic but I’ve played (that is, warmed the bench and went to practice) football and I enjoy watching football.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">...Best places to read?</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At a library. There’s nothing to distract you from reading and it’s the only place I can think of besides church that’s supposed to be quiet.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Complete the sentence:  </span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Most fascinating person I’ve ever met was…</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">My grandpa. Probably because he was my grandpa but still, I find his life story fascinating. For a while he was charge  d’affaires at Sri Lanka's Foreign Office. A firm believer in the Non-Aligned Movement, he had the chance to meet with other like-minded individuals that were not interested in being pawns in the political game America and the Soviet Union were engaged in during the Cold War. He befriended the leader of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito, and met with Zhou Enlai, Jawaharlal Nehru, and others in an effort to keep the developing world out of the orbit of the two superpowers. He was a representative on the UN Security Council from 1960-61 during the only time Sri Lanka was elected to it. Afterwards, he worked for the UN Development Program, dealing with problems such as the “brain drain”, a phenomenon where developing nations invest in the higher education of their citizens, only for those citizens to emigrate and find higher paying work in the developed countries. After retiring he worked for the Vatican, keeping it up to date on developments at the UN, and was knighted by Pope John Paul II.</span>
