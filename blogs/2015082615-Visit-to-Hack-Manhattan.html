          <p>
            I'm sharing a short experience and pictures of my visit to <a href="https://hackmanhattan.com/">Hack Manhattan</a>, <a href="https://www.nexttopmakers.com/blog/6-wonderful-friendly-maker-spaces-new-york-city">one of the first hackerspace in Manhattan</a>.

Unlike makerspaces, which are a newer, more often commercialized model, hackerspaces are essentially spaces full of material accessible to people in the community. People would bring their own projects to and access tools and exchange knowledge.

Hack Manhattan is known for being a "radical" hackerspace (as in keeping its own beehive farm on the rooftop and brewing its own beer). Anything that's hackable and DIY from making a toaster to hacking a <a href="http://store.neurosky.com/">neurosky headset</a> are welcome here).

Last night I decided to drop by for one of its open night. Members and visitors were cramming the tight space, and there was no more space at the central desks for me (which I didn't mind since I didn't have a project to work on) There were around <b>seven 3d printers</b> (workable and not), all which were "made" and assembled in DIY manners (yes, no Makerbots) and <b>three CNC machines</b> (again, self-assembled). Even the door's lock (on the inside) was hacked with servos and arduino to allow remote locking of the door. (Not photographed, and not sure if it worked)

<i>This is pretty much all the hacking space</i>

<i>All the tools, microcontrollers, leds, servos, parts</i>

<i>The toolshed for heavy drilling and handsawing etc.</i>

Impressively, most answers I received from a few people who seemed to be elite members were along the line of "Gee, I don't know. Guess you have to try it yourself." Yes, they were makers and hackers, not engineers. They make things work through relentless experiments and curiosity, not by knowledge picked up from schools.

Many of the members of the so-called Maker Movement do not have a degree in engineering. They come from various background. What they share in common is the passion of "knowing" how things are made and not being a mere consumers of today's commercial, break-it-and-throw-it-away world, abiding to all or parts of the <a href="http://archive.makezine.com/04/ownyourown/">Maker's Bill of Rights</a> and the dare to break things apart.

Hack Manhattan is currently accepting members and have open (abandoned) projects for anyone to pick up and work on.
