            Some folks are built like this
Some folks are built like that
But the way I'm built
Now, don't you call me fat
'Cause I'm built for comfort
I ain't built for speed
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PfkXkbBTTQ">‘Built for Comfort' --Willie Dixon</a>

When I was growing up in the 1960's, nearly all the gynecologists in the U.S. were men. Today, nearly all the nutritionists are thin. Is this progress?

We are in the midst of an <a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/obesity-epidemic-astronomical">“astronomical” Obesity Epidemic</a>, according to WebMD (the Fox News of medical literature). Everybody knows what causes obesity: eating too much and lack of exercise. As a respected physician once advised me, “If you don't eat, you won't gain weight”. 

‘Everybody' is wrong.

What causes obesity is appetite; and the causes and mechanisms governing appetite are complex and poorly understood. There is ample evidence that being fat carries serious health risks. But it is cruel to castigate and humiliate people (especially children) for a condition over which they have no effective control, and for which you can present no safe and practical remedy.

A mentally healthy person, in the presence of an adequate supply of food, will eat until they are no longer hungry. Unfortunately, mental health is not the prevailing human condition.

‘Overweight' is one subject in which the gap between education and knowledge is particularly insidious. I see three sources of learning on this topic for the mythical average person: popular culture and stereotypes, well-meaning but ignorant health care professionals, and the advertisements of weight loss corporations. (Try <a href="http://www.fatnutritionist.com/index.php/if-only-poor-people-understood-nutrition/">this link to fatnutritionist.com</a> for a different point of view).

According to U.S. News and World Report, Americans spend <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/01/02/the-heavy-price-of-losing-weight">more than $60 billion dollars a year</a> trying to control their weight. Someday, perhaps soon, a safe and effective means of controlling appetite will become available. Until then, save your money for something useful like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock">pet rock</a>.
