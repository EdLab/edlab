          <p>
            National Geographic Channel's <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/explorer/4820/Overview#tab-Videos/08560_00">Explorer</a> recently did a documentary on a soccer team composed entirely of Albinos who traveled around the southern African country of Tanzania to not only to compete but prove to others that they are capable of doing tasks done by normal individuals as well. Throughout the journey, they faced obstacles that made it difficult for them to achieve their stated objective.
 
Albinism is defined as an inherited disorder characterized by a reduced or complete lack of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes that affects all vertebrates. The primary cause for this disease is mutations in the specific genes that are vital for the production of melanin pigment. Many albinos, as a result, suffer from poor vision, vulnerability of sunburn and are at a high risk of skin cancer.  Unfortunately, these are not the only problems associated with this disease as in Tanzania, which has the largest population of Albinos in Africa: they are hunted and maimed for their body parts, which is then incorporated in the spiritual rituals of witch doctors. It is believed that the body parts of albinos hold benefits and can lead to prosperity.
 
No one really knows how this trend came about but there is a popular belief being that Nigerian movies (very popular in sub-Sahara countries) are part to blame due to their constant depiction of spiritual practices. Innocent albino children are often stripped from their own home by hunters, in some cases by family members, and dismembered for their body parts which is then sold to witch doctors in exchange for large sums of money. Even in their grave they're still vulnerable so many are often buried with concrete covering the graves to prevent grave robbers from digging up their bones. Albino teenagers now are running away from their homes out of fear of been targeted and seeking refuge in any safe haven they can find. The Tanzanian government has declared war on these hunters due to the fact that it has become a serious issue. I first discovered about this inhumane practice in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/africa/08albino.html?ref=tanzania">New York Times</a> article as well ABC's <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/journey-tanzania-reporter-exposes-albino-killings/story?id=8712754">20/20</a>.
