<p>People are afraid of failure. The fear of being publicly embarrassed can be daunting, possibly even preventing us from reaching our true potential, and maybe even our destiny.  </p>

<p>Audri is a 7-year-old boy who has more resilience than most adults. And he puts his money where his mouth is. He wants to study robotics at MIT—a pretty big dream. So what does Audri do to realize his audacious ambitions? Study? A little bit. Enter a science fair? That’s a little too cliché for our pal Audri. Instead, he creates his very own Rube Goldberg machine to trap his toy monster!  </p>

<p>For the uninitiated, a Rube Goldberg machine is an overly complicated way to solve a relatively simple task. They often involve doodads and spin wheels, widgets and gadgets that move to and fro in haphazard, seemingly nonsensical, ways. They are often used as a fun way to explore a problem through science, technology, and engineering.  </p>

<p>As you can see from Audri’s Machine, he may not be an adult, but he has learned a valuable life lesson when it comes to learning and technology. Try. Fail. And try again. </p>

<p>Have you ever created a complicated contraption? Have you ever taken apart something complicated to get inside its guts? Tell us about any experiences you’ve had with complicated technology in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25829/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:45 jennyshen:</b> This seems like a great way to add engineering concepts to a classroom. In what ways can teachers (especially those who might have limited resources) incorporate this in their classrooms?</p>

<p><b>@01:47 jennyshen:</b> It's great that he poses a hypothesis for his creation! It's clear that science thinking can start at a very early age.</p>
