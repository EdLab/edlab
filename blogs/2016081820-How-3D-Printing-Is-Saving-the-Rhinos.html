<p>A company is trying to decrease rhino poaching by 3D printing rhino horns and selling them in countries where the practice is still alive. In many countries, rhino horns are used as medicine and status symbols; their ivory is worth more than gold. Because poaching has increased in the past years (over 1,200 rhinos were killed in 2014 alone) the species is critically endangered and has a chance of becoming extinct in the next 5-10 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://signup.pembient.com">Pembient</a> believes their 3D printed horns will save the species. The company designed their own 3D printer and creates each horn using minerals, metals, inorganics, and real rhino DNA. The shape, structure, and feel of the engineered horn are virtually identical to those of a real one. "If you took it to a lab and had them test it," said one of Pembientâ€™s engineers, "it would come back as a rhino horn." Pembient plans to sell these bioengineered horns to people who can then sell them on the black market. They believe that if people can buy rhino horns at a low cost, there is less incentive for them to poach and a greater chance for the species to survive the next decade.</p>

<p>Do you think 3D printing rhino horns can save the species? Are there other areas we could use 3D printing to conserve and protect wildlife? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30079/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:33 JennyAbamu:</b> It will be difficult for people to accept the fake one in my opinion. It is like fake diamonds, maybe there is a chance at reducing demand for real ones, but in the end those who are willing to pay the steep price for what they want will get it</p>

<p><b>@1:33 dinosossi2:</b> As JennyAbamu writes, there is an aura that is attached to an authentic object. 3D printing is a challenging and novel approach but convincing consumers may be more difficult.</p>
