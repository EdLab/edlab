            Napoleone Buonaparte claims he is the Son of the French Revolution and gained much of his power through military, then as an Emperor. He was born in Corsica, France in 15th August 1969 to a Florentine nobility. He also had a scholarship to a military school and at 16 he was a Lieutenant in 1785. Napoleon reads about great military leaders like Alexander the Great, he was also interested in history, law and mathematics.Napoleon wa mad Brigadier General by Committee of public Safety in 1794 at 25 years. In 1796 Napoleon changed his name from Napoleone Buonaparte to Napoleon Bonaparte to make his name sound French. Napoleon commanded French armies to Italy and recaptured Toulon for France. Napoleon also commissioned an expedition to Egypt to fight the British to fulfill his Indian trade interest but lose that war. After the Egypt expedition, he participated in a coup and controlled France at 30 years of age. The 1799 coup declared Napoleon as First Consul (the highest ranking in office under an Empire), he had the whole executive government under his authority. In 1802, Napoleon was made Consul for life ( Monarchy) and crowned himself Emperor Napoleon I in 1804. Napoleon formed a concordat with the Catholic church and made it France's official religion.
