            <img class='nlt-image' src="https://cdn.tc-library.org/NewLearningTimes/edthena_f611814a5190403b8e8618dab88261a1.jpg" alt='article.title'><br />

<p><a href="http://www.edthena.com/">Edthena</a> is a professional development tool for teachers that uses video uploads and crowdsourced peer-review to deliver targeted feedback. The system was developed to streamline the evaluation process within schools and to let the greater online community of teachers evaluate one another. The site is also experimenting with hosting remote coaching to let experts weigh in on classroom teaching. Like <a href="http://www.torsh.co/">TORSH</a> and <a href="http://www.k12meets.com/">K12Meets</a>, Edthena is harnessing the power of video to improve teaching.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The founder of Edthena, <a href="http://www.adamgeller.com/">Adam Geller</a>, is a former teacher and familiar with the struggles and budgets of a classroom. The system is BYOD and teachers are able to use any existing camera or device to record their videos. The <a href="http://blog.edthena.com/">Edthena blog</a> also contains lots of tech tips for time-strapped teachers and covers things like <a href="http://blog.edthena.com/modern-browsers-enable-things-like-edthena">Microsoft auto updates</a> for IE and <a href="http://blog.edthena.com/104651646">easy strategies for video compression</a>.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Edthena is focused on institutional subscriptions, and currently doesnâ€™t list a good use case for the individual teacher who wants to improve his or her teaching. Catering to these self-motivated individual teachers may be something the site should consider in light of their recent addition of remote coaching. It might be worth it for Edthena to get some power users who could then be hired out (or lured out with in-site credentialing) as consultants.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Teacher evaluation has been a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/13/teacher-evaluations-at-ce_0_n_1880264.html">hot topic</a> in the past year and traditional methods of teacher appraisal seem ripe for a digital update. Edthena may be appealing in this field because it seems staunchly teacher-centric and earnestly interested in improving the profession. In digital professional development, self-evaluation and micro evaluations are becoming readily available. Though watching oneself on video is one of the great woes of modern life, this collected data from such teacher evaluations and the potential to share it across schools and states may help teachers communicate best practices and excel in their work.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Edthena is reflecting the future of teacher development.</p>
