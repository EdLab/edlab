          <p>
            This morning in Italy 497,296 students had the first written part of
the National Exit Exam for High School Graduation. The exam has
three written parts and a spoken one. The final grade will
determine admission to colleges and the student's chance to find a
good job. The exam committee in every school is composed of 4
teachers from the same school and 4 teachers and a president who
teach in different schools, to guarantee the committee' s
impartiality.


The exam is very hard, and I personally still have nightmares about
it, but it is also a kind of rite of passage for students entering
their adult life, thus it is named Maturita', maturity.

Today the students were asked to write an essay. They could chose
one among several different topics, like:
-        the 11th Canto of Dante's Paradise
-        what is law, justice, and rights, with texts from Aristotle,
Beccaria and other thinkers
-        how poets write about their soul's places
-        philosophy of science, the birth of modern science, with texts
of
Galileo, Einstein and Koyre'
-        an historical essay about neocolonialism and immigration
-        another about the Italian Constitution


Tough! I think of my students there, sitting for 7 hours during the
exam, and I hope they had the strength to manage their stress and
to write something meaningful. By now, their first day of exam is
over. They are at home, getting ready for tomorrow, when they will
have the most feared exam - Mathematics. Good luck!
