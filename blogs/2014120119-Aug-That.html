<p><a href="http://augthat.com/">Aug That</a> uses augmented reality to bring the classroom to life. Augmented reality is a view of the physical world that is enhanced through a mobile device with additional information or media like 3D images, videos, music, or messages. Aug That has a library of images that use AR to trigger video and 3D dimensional overlays aimed at K-12 learning. Teachers are also able to create their own augmented reality materials for classroom use. The company provides professional development to support teachers. The app is being used in schools across the country. Recently, the app has also been picked up by a number of universities and Aug That has developed a feature so students can scan their school’s logo to get updates about campus events.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16952/">promotional video</a> for Aug That shows how teachers can bring 2D images to life in the classroom to support learning. The app is meant to enhance classroom engagement and help students visualize the curriculum. Aug That has several streams to help support this including a parent involvement stream that provides parents with information on technology integration and a vocabulary stream that offers students a fun place to practice words for standardized testing.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Using augmented reality to increase engagement and allow students to conceptualize science and STEM-related concepts has clear potential, especially for younger students at the elementary level. Aug That’s multiple instructional videos for teachers will help educators new to the technology use the product and develop their own lessons. Aug That is suitable for both Apple and Android mobile devices, giving it added flexibility for BYOD programs and schools with a mix of different technologies.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Aug That is in its early stages. At this stage, the app is complex and challenging to navigate at times. Its multiple distinct streams might add more complexity rather than simplify. As it grows, Aug That will need to simplify the process of using the app and provide more templates and resources for teachers wishing to use it in their classrooms. Aug That’s library is free, but teachers have to pay to use the product more extensively and to receive support. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Aug That provides a safe, filtered learning place that other augmented reality programs, like Aurasma, do not currently offer.  It could be an interesting source of inspiration for teachers and other Ed Tech companies.</p>
