            My decision to take Psychology this semester was based on me wanting to learn more about the brain and its functions. Hence the name Psych, which means the brain. For the most part, people assume that the brain is just one big organ which performs the most of the human task. Though the brain is one big organ, it has different parts and each part performs its own task to help the brain function properly. If a disease affects a specific part of the brain, a part of the human cognitive function is also affected.  In today's world, most modern brain theories have formulated a concept called localization of function, which implies that the different brain parts perform different tasks. There are different brain parts: the brain stem, the cerebellum, the thalamus, the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, the amygdala, the cerebrum, and the hippocampus.

The brain stem's function is to hold two other structures of the brain called the pons and medulla. The stem is like a stalk rising out of the spinal cord. The cerebellum can be found at the top of the brain stem and looking toward the back part of the brain. The cerebellum contributes to a sense of balance and coordinates the muscles so that movement is smooth and precise.  The next brain part is the thalamus; the traffic officer of the brain. In other words, the thalamus directs sensory messages to where they belong. For instance, the sight of sunset sends signals that the thalamus directs to a vision area. Under the thalamus sits the hypothalamus (hypo means under).  Hypothalamus is involved in emotions and drives vital to survival, such as fear hunger, thirst, and reproduction. The next structure is the amygdala. The Amygdala can be found in the limbic system; a border between the higher and lower parts of the brain. Amygdala is responsible for evaluating sensory information. Another structure, which is also part of the limbic system, is the hippocampus. Hippocampus is involved in the storage of new information in memory.  Lastly, the next structure is called the cerebrum.  This is the largest part of the brain.  Cerebrum is where the higher forms of thinking occur. These are the structures and their function in the brain.
