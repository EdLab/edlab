<p>People have had anxieties about being replaced by machines dating back to the earliest days of industrialization, famously captured in the American folktale <i><a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/john_henry/analysis.html">John Henry, The Steel Driving Man</a></i>. In a modern day twist of this classic, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory invited Ken Loo, a world-class drone racer, to challenge their autonomously piloted drone in an obstacle course.</p> 

<p>The researchers prepared for this race between man and machine for over two years. Their AI-powered drone utilized state-of-the-art cameras to track its position and mapping software to memorize the course. In the end, the human racer prevailed in terms of speed, finishing the course on average two seconds faster than the AI, but the machine won in terms of course accuracy. Soon, though, the technology will become so advanced that humans will not stand a chance in either category.</p>  

<p>Like in the tale of John Henry, humans won this match, but will ultimately lose out to mechanization. In what other areas do you think humans still hold advantages over machines? Are there any jobs or tasks where you think they will never replace us? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41582">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:17 Dallas Milanovich:</b>Thank god, something to finally restore our human egos. All those chess masters and trivia game show folks have received such a severe beatdown, I was starting to feel like this would be another cruel act of humiliation. Though I'm sure the AI pilots will improve over time, good to know we've still got something going for us...for now...</p>

<p><b>@01:31 Dyranda:</b>I held my breath on that obstacle course and afterwards I realized that I'm terrified of the way we humans are submitting to done supremacy. I was disappointed at the researchers failure to congratulate Pilot Loo and instead to deliver a veiled threat about self-piloting drones just being a matter of time. I've said it before and I'll say it again: machines need to work with and for us, not against us.</p>
