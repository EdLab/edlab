<p>Colleges are increasingly assigning digital textbooks, which means more students can use built-in audio or e-book reader software to listen to their coursework, instead of reading on the page. According to a survey of a large community college, when given the option, 71 percent of students chose to listen. One of the reasons was that this enabled them to complete other tasks (e.g. doing laundry, cooking, etc.) at the same time. Does this choice between reading and listening to textbook information impact learning outcomes?</p>
 
<p>Researchers at Phoenix College and Arizona State University decided to find out. They gave 269 students at a community college a passage from a digital psychology textbook and had the students access this material in one of five conditions: reading only, listening only, reading and listening simultaneously, listening while doodling, listening in a simulated car ride, or listening while cooking. The students were then given a multiple-choice quiz to see how much theyâ€™d retained.</p>
 
<p>The study was conducted at a Hispanic-Serving Institution. This means that over 25% of their students identified as Hispanic, and many spoke English as their second language. The purpose of choosing this institution was two-fold. Given the lack of diversity in most psychological studies, the investigators wanted to bring in understudied student populations, while also studying the impact of input modality for non-native English speakers.</p>
 
<p>The study found that the way information is delivered affects retention. Students who read the passage retained the information better than those who just listened. This effect was particularly pronounced for the English-language learners and was relatively minor for native speakers. As might be expected, increased distraction led to lower performance. </p>

<p>This indicates that how students take in information impacts learning. It also highlights the importance of including subjects that are representative of the greater U.S. population in future studies. Approximately <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgf.asp">9.5% of public school students</a> are English-language learners, up from 8.1% in 2000. To better serve these students, we need to understand the unique challenges they face and tailor learning experiences to them.
