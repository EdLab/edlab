In the "I Dig Science" Program, high school students from Chicago and New York dig fossils alongside scientists doing fieldwork around the world. The only hitch: the whole experience is digital. The program, presented in a partnership with the Field Museum's Geology Department, Biodiversity Synthesis Center, and Global Kids, allows students to get all the benefits of hands-on, real-world learning experiences without having to travel to faraway places. <p>

The program kicked off with I Dig Tanzania and then moved onto another paleontological dig in Zambia. Computer simulations and remote video footage of a real dig in Zambia gave a sense of the culture and geography of the place. Activities were in Second Life and in real life. Students used Skype to contact scientists on the field and they used letter and picture exchanges to connect with youth there. The aim of the project is make students truly feel they are "on" the dig with the scientists. Part of achieving this aim involves mastering the tools of technology. <p>

The potential for virtual experience to level the playing field of learning has received a lot excitement, but not many promising models have emerged on the scene. I Dig Science is a pedagogically and technologically robust program allowing students to feel as though they were "there" and gain much of the experience of learning in the field with scientists. <p>

Can you see this coming to your school?  Do you think the virtual experience replaces the real world experience? Share your thoughts <a href=
