            Two weeks ago we had <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/10298">a seminar about offering great customer support in Higher Ed</a>. I really hope my story had happened before that day so that I could share it with everyone at the seminar. Anyway, here is my recent story to prove the old ways of customer support should die and social media should take its place.

I purchased a TCL HDTV from Amazon in 2010, which is a renowned Chinese brand but not so much in the U.S. Six months ago I was reviewing something else when I encountered the so-called "firmware update instructions" on Amazon. Unfortunately I did the update although I didn't have any problem with the TV. After that all my TV did was show me a black screen.

Unluckily my TV was out of the 2-yr warranty. Since I am a tinkerer-kind-of-person, I googled around hoping I can find a solution instead of paying $100+ to a service person. Nothing useful was found. So I contacted the TCL customer support via phone, which proved to be a waste of time because all they could do was to give me the number of a local service center. This was totally expected though because those outsourced support representatives do not know anything about the products.

So I continued investigating on and off at my leisure time because I really liked my TV. Last week I discovered someone on Facebook reported the same issue. He was blaming TCL customer support on FB and TCL USA@FB contacted him and helped him fix his TV. So I fired a message to TCL USA@FB asking if they could help me. I got a message from them the next day, asking for my email which I gave them. A few email correspondence later I received the correct firmware and instructions to apply the firmware when my screen is black. The firmware and instructions worked perfectly and my TV is finally rescued!

The FB channel has worked for me but the phone channel didn't because the former allowed the customer support to find the correct person who can help. This was done through FB and I am curious if I send an email in their official support channel will it be effective too? Anyway, an interesting experience to share.
