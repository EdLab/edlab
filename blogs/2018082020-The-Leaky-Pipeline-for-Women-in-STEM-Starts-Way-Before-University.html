<p>Why are there more men than women in the STEM fields? Debates surrounding this question have been raging in recent years, as the divide in these fields has not closed. A researcher set out to understand this topic through an exhaustive review of research related to gender gaps in the academy. He was specifically trying to understand if the gender divide witnessed in STEM relates to biases in the entry phase of academia, in hiring factors, or with other early career markers.</p> 

<p>The author reviewed several hundred studies on a range of topics related to gender disparities in academia: mathematical aptitude, hiring, funding, publishing, remuneration, and promotion. While the focus was on the STEM gender divide, he compared findings across disciplines. The review places an emphasis on experimental research because this type of design allows for greater scientific claims. The compiled literature covers societies from across the world.</p>

<p>Through the review, the author contends that once people reach graduate school, there is gender equity in interviewing, hiring, funding, and publishing, despite the overall outcomes. The findings suggest that women are often given preferential hiring to men in fields where they are underrepresented like the hard sciences. But in fields where men are underrepresented such as literature, there were similar biases for hiring male faculty over females.</p> 

<p>The researcher believes that academia still mostly operates meritocratically, as underqualified applicants were not given preferential treatment over higher rated counterparts, regardless of gender. Rather, in the studies, gender was found to be only a small part of larger holistic decisions.</p>

<p>This extensive review of research illustrates how entry into academia and early career markers do not appear to have exacerbated gender divides. The researcher suggests that earlier educational levels are to blame for the leaky pipeline of women into STEM. The disparities likely relate to barriers early on in life, which are carried into higher education.</p>
