<p><a href="http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/">Periodic Table</a> is a free app developed by the Royal Society of Chemistry that provides an interactive guide to the periodic table of elements. Each element has its own profile with key facts and information as well as podcasts and videos for further exploration. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app is highly customizable. When you sign up, you can choose the introductory, intermediate, or advanced version so you aren’t overwhelmed by information that isn’t relevant to your needs. For example, oxidation states and isotopes data is not included in the introductory version. It also has robust filters that allow you to view elements by group, period, and classification, with explanations for each of these categories. The app also provides interesting ways to visualize facts about the elements, such as an interactive slider that shows how elements change state as temperature increases.</p>

<p>The experience is enhanced by the videos and podcasts that are directly accessible in the app. This interactive content brings these concepts to life and helps the user connect to the history behind an element’s discovery and its real-world applications. I could see this being a great resource for exploration in any unit on the periodic table of elements.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It would be nice if the app had a stronger search function. As of now, you can only search by element name, but it would be helpful to be able to search using the other information in the elements’ profiles. It also took me a while to discover the filter button, which was hidden in the upper right hand corner. </p>

<p>One frustration I experienced was that the podcasts would cut out every time I switched apps or my phone fell asleep. This seems like a glitch that needs to be corrected. At the very least, it would be nice if these podcasts could be linked to the Podcast app, which doesn’t have this issue.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Periodic Table by the Royal Society of Chemistry is an incredible free resource for learning more about the elements.</p>
