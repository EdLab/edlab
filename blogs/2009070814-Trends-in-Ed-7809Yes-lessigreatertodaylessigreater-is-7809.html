            <b>Summer School Goes Virtual</b> 

Online summer school may be on its way to a becoming commonplace in K-12 education.  Not only does it reduce the costs of building maintenance and the chauffeur services of parents to and from school (at a time when they are ready for a break, too), but virtual summer school enables the students themselves to keep their summer plans while catching up on their schoolwork.  

<a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/07/06/summer_school_enrollment.html">This</a> article gives the account of one student who is taking an online summer course in order to meet his high school's freshman math standards.  His school, along with about 1,500 other private schools, uses <a href="http://www.kaplanvirtualeducation.com/">Kaplan Virtual Education</a> as the medium for its summer courses.  This student, for example, is able to attend his annual summer day camp while completing his coursework at night.

Online summer school does come with a considerable price-tag to parents.  Furthermore, it's not necessarily an "easy way out".  His particular 4-week course costs $600 and students are advised to commit 5 hours per day on the course.  For high school students, however, my feeling is that it might be a good preparation for college courses, since they are often more fast-paced and self-directed than what the typical high school student is used to.  Food for thought.
