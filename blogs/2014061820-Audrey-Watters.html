What do you do when you become frustrated with a lack of attention to a cause you feel passionate about? You create a platform to generate more awareness. This is exactly what <a href="http://audreywatters.com/">Audrey Watters</a> is hoping to accomplish with her blog and newsletter, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a>. She created the website to bring more attention to educational technology. Watters explores the relationships among politics, pedagogy, business, culture, and most often, edtech. Although she was two chapters into her PhD dissertation, she decided to abandon academia, and she now happily fulfills the one job recommended to her by a junior high aptitude test: freelance writer. In that capacity, she is a frequent contributor to the Huffington Post, Inside Higher Ed and Mindshift, among others.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am a serial dropout. I dropped out of high school. I dropped out of college. I dropped out of a PhD program. These days I drop out of MOOCs. As a result, I've had a lot of different educational experiences—private and public, distance and face-to-face. And as such, I recognize the importance and the limitations of access (and what technology can and cannot do to address that), the importance and the limitations of being "self-directed," and the prestige (not simply the competencies) associated with school completion.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> As a graduate student, I taught at the University of Oregon for a number of years. One of the classes I taught was "freshman writing." It prompted me to think a lot about literacy, about what we expect in "academic writing" (and why), about what college students are ready or reluctant or unable to do. I always started the term asking students to write an essay describing their experiences with reading and writing—a way to assess their writing skills, as well as their attitudes towards them. I love to write—I always have. So it was pretty eye opening to see students explore why they didn't (mostly, they didn't) like to write essays for schools. Sure, they'd figured out the way to do well enough to get good grades—or at least get by—in high school, many adopting the rigid form of writing that they'd been taught (5 paragraphs, with a thesis sentence at the end of the opening paragraph) without thinking much about rhetoric, argumentation, or analysis. 
<p>
How does schooling get in the way of learning? How does it get in the way of expression? In what ways does it make us worry about formal elements without thinking much about experimentation or inquiry?
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think it's important to be critical of both new education technologies and of old educational practices. I often cite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Seymour Papert</a> to help explain what I mean by this (because despite accusations by some folks, I'm really not "anti-ed-tech"). In 1987 Papert wrote about <a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/ComputerCriticismVsTechnocentric.html">" computer criticism versus technocentric thinking."</a> I think we've moved much closer to the latter in recent decades. He said of "computer criticism" that "the name does not imply that such writing would condemn computers any more than literary criticism condemns literature or social criticism condemns society. The purpose of computer criticism is not to condemn but to understand, to explicate, to place in perspective. Of course, understanding does not exclude hard (perhaps even captious) judgment. The result of understanding may well be to debunk. But critical judgment may also open our eyes to previously unnoticed virtue."
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> For better or worse, I think data and analytics will have a major impact on education. I'm not sure how much it will impact learning per se, but these will certainly shape education policy and practices, particularly as analytics are being marketed as something that can provide insights that we haven't had before.
<p>
I am encouraged by the "maker movement," and it's embrace of inquiry-based and project-based learning. Much of this is happening in "informal" settings, outside of the classroom. But I see more and more teachers and schools recognize that exploration, building, making, programming are crucial (and sadly absent as we've become more and more obsessed with testing and "data").
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I blog regularly on <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a>. I'm the editor of a new site, <a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a> that focuses on progressive education and progressive technology usage to that end. I travel and speak a lot. I get in fights on the Internet.
<p>
And I'm currently working on my first book, Teaching Machines. It's a look at the cultural/technological history of education and what I see as a long-running drive to automate teaching and learning. The book will be out at the end of the year.
