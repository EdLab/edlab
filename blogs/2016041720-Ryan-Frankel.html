Ryan Frankel is the CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="http://bit.ly/1LpFw9l">VerbalizeIt</a>, a language translation platform for businesses with global aspirations. VerbalizeIt was honored by PhoCusWright as the 2013 Travel Startup of the Year. In 2014 Frankel was named by Inc Magazine as a Top 35 Under 35 entrepreneur. He is an MBA graduate of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and an undergraduate alumnus of Haverford College where he studied Economics and Spanish, and pitched for the varsity baseball team. Prior to Wharton, Frankel was a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs in the Special Situations Group in New York City where he focused on middle market private equity transactions and the operational management of the portfolio companies. He is also a recipient of the 2013 Class of 35 Top Travel Innovators, and a frequent columnist in Forbes, Inc. Magazine, Wharton, and OPEN Forum by American Express.</p>
 
<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>My current work has been shaped by the tools I’ve developed over the years as a professional and as a student. My educational experiences as an undergraduate at Haverford College and as an MBA student at Wharton coupled with my professional experiences at Goldman Sachs have enabled me to continually add to a tool belt of skills and experiences that shape my perspective together. Of course, it’s still an ongoing learning experience and not a day goes by where I’m not learning from others or from my own successes and mistakes. I credit my development as an entrepreneur to friends and family, college classmates, peers in the workplace, and advisors and mentors who have invested their valuable time into making me a better person and professional.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I’d love to look back one day to see how my work has facilitated learning opportunities for people across the globe. In my role at VerbalizeIt, I’ve witnessed firsthand how eradicating language barriers can facilitate cross-cultural relationships, and as a mentor to other entrepreneurs, I hope that I’m able to impart valuable advice based on my past personal and professional experiences.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I see a number of interesting opportunities taking place in the decentralization of learning. It used to be that students and intellectuals needed to be physically located proximate to the top academic institutions, however, the advent of technology has democratized learning for those across the globe. We can now stream into classrooms around the world to learn from leading academics and professionals, regardless of our physical location. It’s super interesting and the implications are incredibly powerful and exciting for all of our futures.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>I wish that I could say that I have grand plans for the next pursuit, but thus far I’ve been heads down and solely focused on growing our current language translation businesses. In the future, I’d love to get more involved in the educational space and I also have an undying love for the fields of health and wellness.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I love following <a href="http://bit.ly/1ObOB5y">Brad Feld</a> on Twitter and his blog. He’s a really interesting entrepreneur, investor and thought-leader and he’s been a huge resource to me as I develop as an entrepreneur. I also follow <a href="http://bit.ly/1ojo3uv">Adam Grant</a> quite closely.</p>
