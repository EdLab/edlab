Fortunately, the current growing demand for green jobs in fields like  environmental engineering and environmental science is encouraging  scientists, teachers and policy professionals to develop new tools for  helping students in city schools to learn about the science of  conservation and the vital role that nature plays, even in concrete  jungles.

“<strong><a href="http://www.nature.org/about-us/careers/leaf/resources-for-teachers/leaf-anthology-of-urban-environmental-education.xml" target="_blank">LEAF: A New Anthology for Urban Environmental  Education</a></strong>” is a new comprehensive resource for high school teachers  focused on natural world that includes lesson plans about areas such as  the health impacts of air pollution, urban water management, and how  climate changing is affecting cities. Compiled by the non-profit group  The Nature Conservancy, the anthology includes a wealth of free  downloadable lessons for educators to help “green” their curricula and  spark student interest in environmental topics.

With  contributions from high school teachers in New York, Los Angeles, Denver  and other cities, the anthology includes a wide assortment of lessons  focused on building high school students’ environmental literacy and  getting them interested in conservation topics through learning that  takes place outside of the classroom. In fact, many of the projects  presented include opportunities for schools and students to help solicit  further involvement and interest in environmental conservation within  their own urban neighborhoods. In one lesson contributed by teacher  Melissa Dowd from The New York Harbor School, for instance, students  have the chance to learn about urban ecology by creating a field guide  of their local urban waterway. After introducing students to how field  work is done through activities such as water quality testing and local  species collection, students are called upon to present their field  guide to the local community, such as by making it available and easily  accessible online, or by presenting it at a school or local community  board meeting.

For students, learning about conservation  and the real world applications of environmental science often serves  to get them thinking about career options they might otherwise not have  considered and study tracks geared to conserving nature. The project has  also been well-received by school administrators, who have noted its  importance to teachers in the community and its positive approach to  helping develop high school students’ environmental values. Asked about  the anthology, Steven King, Founder and School Leader of the<a href="http://obamagreencharterhigh.sharpschool.net/" target="_blank"> Barack  Obama Green Charter High School</a> in Plainfield, NJ noted "I'm very  impressed with the detail with lesson development.  It's a great tool  schools and something that will serve as a great resource for our  teachers."

To supplement the learning that  takes place in school, the Nature Conservancy runs a program called LEAF  (Leaders in Environmental Action) which offers paid internships on its  preserves that give students the chance to learn about conservation  careers by working alongside practicing scientists. According to the  conservancy, approximately one third of students who graduate from the  LEAF program go on to pursue environmental science careers, a full six  times higher than the national average.
