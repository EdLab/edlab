            On March 6 of this year, my birth nation of Ghana celebrated its Golden Jubilee to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence from the British. On that fateful day in 1957, Ghana became the first nation in sub-Sahara Africa to gain independence from their colonial powers. Ghana's independence started a ripple effect, leading most of sub-Sahara Africa to gain independence in the years that followed. For the people of South Africa, the independence boom that gripped its neighbors across Africa failed to persuade its apartheid government to cede any power to them. That all changed on a fateful day in 1976 when the movement to change South African society took a momentous step with <a href=http://img.search.com/thumb/a/a0/Soweto_Riots.jpg/300px-Soweto_Riots.jpg>one unforgettable photograph</a>. <p>

In 1974 an order from the apartheid run government held that schools in <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto>Soweto</a> and other townships in South Africa had to teach only in Afrikaans and English. For many black South Africans, Afrikaans was the language of the oppressor and they took great pride in learning in their native languages. On June 16, 1972, high school students in Soweto started a quiet protest towards Orlando Stadium in an effort to voice their disapproval of the decree. Soon, the protest had grown to thousands of students from all grades, but before the students could reach their intended destination, they were met by the police. The sequence of events that ensued has been the source of constant debate, but the aftermath was clear cut. The police opened fire on the unarmed students, leaving many dead. In the midst of the melee, photographer and news reporter Sam Nzima grabbed his camera and took a photo of a mortally wounded <a href=http://www.joburg.org.za/october/hector.stm>Hector Pieterson</a>, a 12-year-old student who had been shot and then carried by Mbuyisa Makhubo and accompanied by Antoinette Pieterson, Hector's older sister. The photograph was on the front page of every newspaper the following day. The international outcry was loud and thunderous, with many calling for an end to apartheid. The photograph had opened the world's eyes to the injustices that faced many black South Africans. For the first time, their cause had an unforgettable image, an image that signaled the beginning of the end for apartheid as a practice in South Africa. International sanctions followed the outcry, and South Africa was essentially isolated from the global community. <p>

When F.W. de Clerk took office in 1989, he engineered the release of many political prisoners of the apartheid era, notably Nelson Mandela, and moved forward with goal of ridding South African society of apartheid. When Mandela was subsequently elected as South Africa's first black president in 1994, the transformation from apartheid to an open and equal society was complete. I have a few South African friends who were mere teenagers when the historical events of 1994 transpired, but they never fail to inform me that the Soweto uprising in 1976 was the day apartheid symbolically ended, because it showed that the youth of the nation deeply cared about the future of their nation, which was intrinsically tied to their futures. A whole generation of South Africans have grown up with the spirit of that day in 1976, knowing that they owe a great debt to the young men and women who risked their lives so one day their nation might also enjoy the riches of equality. It was a long time coming, but thanks in large part to Nzima's photograph and those who lost their lives, contemporary South Africa is a symbol of everything that June 16, 1976 was intended to stand for.  <p>

I never fail to remind any ear willing to listen about the lack of activism among the youth in America today. Time and again, history has shown that young people have a very special power to influence their society. There must be something about the youth fighting for change that strikes a chord in most people. The Soweto uprising serves as a fine example of the power of how today's youth can change the way tomorrow's youth will live. <p>
