<p>A recent study explores the use of iPads in four English classrooms. The authors provided each classroom with 20 iPads and technology support and conducted observations and interviews over the course of one year. The teachers selected for the study had little or no prior experience using the iPad in the classroom.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the project, the iPads were mostly used for individual learning tasks. While students liked to use this novel tool, teachers were uncertain about how to track individual studentsâ€™ learning on mobile platforms and how to integrate this knowledge into their daily classroom curricula. After this initial observation phase, the teachers and researchers worked together to revise their approach based on the initial observed learning effects.</p>

<p>They made three changes to their approach: purchasing an online content system that allowed students to read customized informal texts on their individual iPads, adopting a learning management system that allowed teachers to design learning tasks and students to review video lessons and engage in asynchronous conversations, and providing apps that encouraged student online collaboration. They used interactive iPad apps such as <a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rabblebrowser/id432616026?mt=8">RabbleBrowser </a>, an app that lets students share their web-browsing experiences, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whiteboard-lite-collaborative/id301962306?mt=8">Whiteboard Lite</a>, which enables students to draw on the same whiteboard screen by using separate iPads, to accomplish the last enhancement.</p>

<p>At the end of the study, the authors identified both positive and negative effects in the classrooms. Overall, the project motivated teachers to design differentiated curricula and promoted student engagement and interest. Both teachers and students reported that the iPads became part of their classroom lives and helped on all kinds of classroom teaching and learning tasks including digital writing and discussion, organizing daily schedules, and tracking individual to-do lists. As the project unfolded, the authors noticed several negative effects. Students frequently dropped the iPads and many experienced shattered screens due to the fragility of the device. Another negative effect was the endless support costs related to iPad apps including researching new apps, updating apps, teaching new apps to students, and hosting teacher workshops on the pedagogical uses of new tools.</p>

<p>The study suggests both the great potential and the challenges in teaching and learning with digital technologies. In this research project, the teachers had the luxury of technological support and professional development, but this case does not accurately represent most school settings. Successful pedagogical innovations with digital media will require support, training, and continued collaboration among teachers, technology specialists, and students.</p>
