Today there was a conversation amongst the first floor services desk workers about Thanksgiving. It seemed that almost everyone was in agreement that Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday. We talked about how Thanksgiving can be a great excuse to relax, spend time with family, eat good food, watch football, and take a moment to recognize what we are thankful for. We started to wonder what Thanksgiving resources our TC library has in its collection.

The first book I came across in EDUCAT after conducting a keyword search on Thanksgiving is, <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/XThanksgiving&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/XThanksgiving&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=Thanksgiving/1%2C79%2C79%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=XThanksgiving&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;1%2C1%2C">Thanksgiving: The Biography of an American Holiday (Revisiting England) by James W. Baker</a>.  The book description reads, <em>In this, the first in-depth study of the most American of holidays,  James Baker sweeps away lingering myths and misconceptions to show how  this celebration day was born and grew to be an essential part of our  national spirit. Thanksgiving: The Biography of an American Holiday  opens with an overview of the popular mythos of the holiday before  discussing its possible religious and cultural precedents. This classic  Yankee holiday is examined in historical and contemporary detail that  embraces everything from proclamations, sermons, and local and regional  traditions to family reunions, turkey dinners, and recipes.  Thanksgiving's evolving face is illustrated with charming and often  revealing period prints that chart our changing attitudes: the influence  of Victorian sentiment in Thanksgiving's development, Progressive  utilitarianism, intellectual "debunking," patriotic wartime reclamation,  and 1960s-era protest. Thanksgiving remains controversial up to the  present day, as Mayflower descendants, Native Americans, and commercial  exploiters compete for the American public's opinion of the holiday's  contemporary significance and its future status. This is an intelligent  and illuminating introduction to a beloved holiday and a fascinating  cultural history of America and Americana.</em>

Another<em> </em>popular book in our collection about Thanksgiving is <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/XThanksgiving&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/XThanksgiving&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=Thanksgiving/1%2C79%2C79%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=XThanksgiving&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;2%2C2%2C">Thanksgiving: The True Story by Penny Colman</a>. This book also aims to reveal the true Thanksgiving story,<em> Every year on the fourth Thursday of November, Americans celebrate  with a Thanksgiving meal. But what is the origin of this tradition? Did  it really begin when the Pilgrims and Native Americans got together in  1621 in Plymouth,Massachusetts? In her signature narrative  nonfiction style, Penny Colman paints a fascinating picture of this  cherished American holiday. She examines numerous Thanksgiving claims  which were antecedents to the national holiday we celebrate today,  raises the turkey question—does everyone eat turkey on Thanksgiving?—and  shows Sarah Josepha Hale’s instrumental role in establishing the  holiday. Get ready to delve into the rich past of Thanksgiving in an  enlightening history that uncovers the true story</em>.

We also have a number of children's books that focus on Thanksgiving including<a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/Xthanksgiving&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6/Xthanksgiving&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SUBKEY=thanksgiving/1%2C79%2C79%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=Xthanksgiving&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;6%2C6%2C"> The story of Thanksgiving by Robert Merrill Bartlett and illustrated by Sally Wern Comport</a>, and <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/Xthanksgiving&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6/Xthanksgiving&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SUBKEY=thanksgiving/1%2C79%2C79%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=Xthanksgiving&amp;SORT=D&amp;searchscope=6&amp;4%2C4%2C">Celebrate Thanksgiving by Deborah Heiligman</a>.

Of course we can't mention Thanksgiving without discussing food. We have a wonderful baking book in our collection,<a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/Xbaking&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ/Xbaking&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBKEY=baking/1%2C41%2C41%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=Xbaking&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;2%2C2%2C"> The art of fine baking by Paula Peck drawings by Grambs Miller</a><strong> </strong>. This book is a great baking resource for beginners and more experienced bakers. This book is sure to provide you with the perfect baked good for the holiday.
