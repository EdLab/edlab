<p>The push for the adoption of edtech often falls short of addressing the environmental challenges for doing so. However, new research took a deep dive into the perceived possibilities and constraints of instituting <i>bring your own device</i> (BYOD) policies in schools and pointed to environmental conditions as the primary constraint.</p>

<p> This case study looked at 17 teachers and their approaches to implementing BYOD policies in their classrooms, meaning students were allowed to bring laptops, cell phones, tablets, and other devices to supplement their learning. Over the course of two years, researchers collected data through class videos, teacher interviews, field notes, and other website resources.</p>

<p> The results showed that teachers and researchers were able to identify several BYOD affordances. For example, there was an increase in resource access allowing students to download instructional materials to assist with their learning; however, there were also a considerable number of constraints including the smaller screen sizes of mobile phones making it more taxing to type. Yet, the majority of these limitations revolved around issues like plugs for chargers and WiFi availability. These environmental limitations appeared to be a pervasive issue across the different classrooms.</p>

<p> In spite of the constraints, most people will agree that it is high time we encouraged devices to become part of the classroom as their affordances far exceed the textbooks currently used. Yet, it appears that full implementation might require an entire overhaul of the classroom environment as we know it.</p>
