<p><a href="http://tradeschool.coop/">Trade School</a> connects teachers and students through bartering. Students "pay" for learning with participation, offerings for the teacher, or course contributions like materials and snacks. Most of the askings are modest and the course topics are often cherished hobbies which seem to reflect a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/03/ourgoods-bartering.html">labor of love</a> on the part of the instructor. The school <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679931/trade-school-a-learning-space-that-runs-on-the-barter-system">got its start</a> in New York as the learning arm of bartering website <a href="https://ourgoods.org/">OurGoods</a>. Founder Caroline Woolard, <a href="http://www.good.is/posts/trade-school-will-barter-for-skills/">describes</a> the Trade School process as a meeting of like creative minds, a peer-to-peer learning network that enables everyone to contribute and learn.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>During its initial run in New York, Trade School <a href="http://www.stories.coop/stories/video/trade-school-learning-space-runs-barter">educated</a> over 800 students in 76 classes. The school <a href="http://tradeschool.coop/about">went global</a> in 2011 and now has a large following in cities across North America and abroad. The schools operate from a central dashboard and independent, per-city websites.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.stories.coop/stories/video/trade-school-learning-space-runs-barter">all accounts</a> the initial Trade School experiment went well and it seems to be working in other cities, but New Yorkâ€™s community fell apart when forced to interact with the moneyed world. The group has had chronic issues finding donated space for classes and the concept absolutely relies on the work of a devoted group of organizers willing to donate time. The good news is that Trade School will reopen in New York City in May of 2013. Check the <a href="http://tradeschool.ourgoods.org/">website</a> for details.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Bartering is at the core of the Trade School culture, but it is not necessarily important to the educational concept. Communities like <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/">Skillshare</a> seem to be carrying on the dream of adult peer-to-peer learning; though it is monetized, teachers seem attracted to the site because of their desire to share knowledge with interested students. The web has been instrumental in bringing these niche learning communities together, and Trade School might be able to find revival in moving toward online instruction as Skillshare has done.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Trade School is a utopian riff on adult skill sharing.</p>
