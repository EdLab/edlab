          <p>
            The college application process can be a daunting task for most college bound high schoolers. They have to inform themselves on a lot of relatively new college related information and research hundreds of colleges before narrowing their list. College fairs are attended and colleges are visited; all of these are done as a precaution to ensure that the best possible decision is made and the transition from high school to college go as smooth as possible.
 
A few admission terms that seem to bewilder some of these applicants is the subject of early action, early decision, early admission, and early colleges. The prospective students who usually explore these “early” decisions are usually high achieving students either eager to receive an early decision or enter college early. Early action and early decision are the two main terms that are usually mixed up and differentiating between the two is crucial.<p>

In early action, applicants are notified of their acceptance to a college earlier than most of the other applicants. Although accepted early, they are allowed to apply to other colleges for regular admission or early action colleges and can decline an acceptance in case they have a change of heart. This liberal approach is part of the reason why most colleges exercise this option. Early decision on the other had requires applicants to apply to only one institution and accepted individuals are required to enroll in that college and not permitted to enroll elsewhere. This term is very binding and the only way to withdraw is usually is financial aid reasons. Some notable <a href="http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/tally/">colleges and universities</a> that enforce early decision are Brown University, John Hopkins University, Cornell University, Dartmouth University, Duke University, Northwestern University and Emory University, among others. Knowing the difference between these two surely avoids an inadvertent mistake that can ruin a student's quest for the right college or leave an individual without a college to attend after senior year.
 
There are some positive aspects to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/2009/09/30/colleges-where-applying-early-action-helps.html"> early action</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/education/21admissions.html?_r=1">early decisions</a>. There is a higher acceptance rate for early action or early decision applicants than regular admissions, especially in selective colleges. This is mainly because the applicant has demonstrated interest in that particular college by applying early and that greatly improves their chances of admission. Applicants who have also received notification of entrance to college early are less stressed since they don't have to worry about decisions from other schools.
 
Early admission and early colleges are another set of terms that usually confuse college bound students. Early admission colleges accept only dedicated juniors who chose to bypass their senior year or have completed their high school requirements. To the contrary, early colleges accept high school sophomores and juniors that wish to forego their senior year. There is currently only one college that is an early college and that is Bard's Early College at Simon's Rock situated in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Students should be cautioned in deciding whether to enter college since many students that receive early admission into such colleges <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-02-12-early-admissions_N.htm">regret</a> their decision. 

The college application process is all about finding the right college in which you can explore and find your niche so students should exercise theirs options well and make they're content with their final choice.
