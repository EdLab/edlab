<p><a href="http://www.scholastic.com/home/">Scholastic</a> has created a fun app to help kids practice their math. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sushi-monster/id512651258?mt=8">Sushi Monster</a>  is a game that helps users practice addition and subtraction as they choose the correct numbers to complete number sentences. A monster stands in the center of a table while a waiter brings various plates of sushi, each labeled with a number. Players have to choose a combination of numbers that either add or multiply together to find the solution displayed. Be careful, though. One wrong move, and the sushi monster throws a monster tantrum!</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This game pushes users to get better and quicker at addition and multiplication. There is a different sushi monster on each level, motivating players to beat each one with their mathematics skills. The game gets progressively harder as the levels advance, and it keeps track of time to continue to encourage the player to be swift. The animation is cute and comical, particularly when the player solves something correctly and gets to see the monster gobble down sushi in bliss.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>When looking for numbers to add or multiply, users choose from a single group that remains in use during each mini-level. Sometimes, even if the user correctly solves the first few problems, they are unable to finish the rest because the remaining numbers cannot be made to equal the new sum or product. This is counterproductive in teaching players to solve problems quickly, since players are required to work out the entire set of problems in their head on each mini-level before even completing the first one to ensure that this wonâ€™t happen.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Aside from that slightly frustrating issue with the number groups, Sushi Monster is a great app. It is an enjoyable game that helps the user practice addition and multiplication, a significant accomplishment during an era when calculators reign supreme in mathematics classrooms. The animation of the monsters rampaging and munching on sushi rolls is a cute way to keep users entertained during math drills. Anyone looking to practice addition and multiplication and to be amused by the various sushi monsters would definitely benefit from checking out this free app from a company highly dedicated to education.</p>
