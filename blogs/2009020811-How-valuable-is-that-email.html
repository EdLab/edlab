            I love it when bands record songs by other bands. There's just something satisfying and really creative about taking something that has been done and we all love, and putting a new spin on it to make it different and dare i say it...better? 

So what is the technology equivalent?  What about taking a classic internet utility and adding some imaginative twists to make it better?  This is what I think <a href="http://www.seriosity.com/">Seriosity</a>, a company that "uses psychological and economic principles that drive successful multiplayer online games to improve collaboration, innovation and productivity", might have done with their new email client.  

The idea behind the client is simple - the modern world communicates by email and as a result we are inundated daily with a barrage of emails. However, this presents a challenge in deciding which to respond to first. We all have a system of deciding who and what to focus our attentions to, but wouldn't it be easier if we had a way to gauge how important the email is to the sender? 

Enter <a href="http://www.seriosity.com/attent.html">Attent</a>, and email program that has been developed to help us evaluate the relative importance of the emails in our inbox. How? Well they have combined basic economic principles with existing email systems and have created an online currency which can be 'spent' to indicate how much you value each one. The idea is that each time you send an email it costs you currency which is limited, forcing you to decide how important and therefore how 'valuable' it is. When you receive an email with no currency attached, it obviously was not that important to the sender, so it cant be that important to you!

I like the idea but suspect there will be problems.  For example, how much 'currency' is enough to get you through the day? That said, I think the idea is brilliant and a great illustration of how the gaming revolution is even shaping traditional work tasks!
