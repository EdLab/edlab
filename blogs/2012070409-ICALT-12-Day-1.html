            Day 1 of the conference:

Conference Venue : National Research Council (CNR) HQ in Italy 

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/IMG_1653.JPG"/>

<b>Opening ceremony</b> by conference chairs: Message in the opening ceremony: Process of learning is changing/ will change in the next few years. We cannot run an organization like we did 10 years ago. 

<b>Keynote Speaker</b> : Adrian Cheok, Director of <a href="http://mixedrealitylab.org/">Mixed Reality Lab</a>, 
National University Of Singapore
Keio University Graduate School of Media Design

- A new form of society is emerging which is not an extension of the industrial age.

- Individuals are connected through many networks.

- Learning is playing, school will no longer have any primary importance in the constant networked communication. It is first time that humans are growing in such an environment. 

- People can process discontinuous information, which is intensive and requires multiple information processing, e.g., research has found that people can figure out key points in a TV program by mere channel flipping. Learning is becoming non linear. 

- Most of the skills we learn today are going to be obsolete soon. 

- How to learn in this age ? Learn new things and embrace change. 

- The speaker then talks about tacit knowledge and its applicability to learning on the fly. Experimenting and creating knowledge at the same time. Tinker with things and share in real time.

- Mix learning in field with technology augmented learning experiences.  

- Speaker shares different ubiquitous learning prototypes that he and his students have been involved with: 

1. <a href="http://www.mixedreality.nus.edu.sg/micro/kidsmedia/coucou.html"> CouCou</a> It is a social networking device for children. When they meet another child they would like to be friends with, both children touch their respective device with each other. The device is connected to an online web interfaceI which sends message/email to the parents who can see the location of their child and approve/disapprove of the friendship.

2. <a href="http://mixedrealitylab.org/projects/all-projects/human-pacman/ ">Human Pacman</a>

3. <a href="http://youtu.be/ryHtpRAXFLg
">Amagatana Umbrella</a> 


4. This one was pretty intense: Interactive cooking and printing food through internet. Prepare food through collaboration. physical connection between users and use a rice printer to send messages. interfaces with social media tools, and also has a 3D Food printer.
