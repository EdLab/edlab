            When the iPad was first introduced several years ago, there was a rush by consumers to get their hands on one. The iPad also offered a lot of learning and educational opportunities for students, parents and administrators. For instance, students believed that it would be an easier way to carry books without feeling the weight of the books. Additionally, students could use it to study, and browse the web, among others. Employers also believed that they could use it for work purposes. 

This Vialogues portrays how useful the iPad is or has become for students in South Africa. The use of iPads in South African schools has helped enhance some students' ability to learn. It encourages them to go to school everyday to learn because they don't want to miss using the iPad. Moreover, the iPad has helped students showcase their talents and creativity by developing their own apps. 

Since the iPad was introduced at a primary school, the number of absences during the school year has decreased drastically. The idea of students using the iPad to study in school is great because technology has become a new way for students to learn. However, one thing that still baffles me is what happened to using pens, pencils, and textbooks as learning tools. In other words, can the use of technology be more effective in learning than the “old way?”
