<p>Brain training games have had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/06/lumosity-brain-training-app-maker-to-pay-2-million-settlement-to-ftc/">contentious past</a>, but new research shows they might be able to play an important role in education. In this study, children played brain training games that focused on increasing attention, flexibility, pattern recognition, and spatial memory. Although the games were mostly computer-based, they also included a physical exercise component led by the teacher.</p>
 
<p>Researchers evaluated the effects of brain training games on over 500 second grade students in two different ways. First, they examined the effects of 5-minute long games completed immediately before computerized math and reading exercises. Second, they examined how playing games over a 12–16 week period affected scores on school-administered, paper-and-pencil tests.</p>
 
<p>In the first part of the study, the researchers found that student performance improved on computerized activities after completing the assigned brain training games. They suspect that in this situation, the games acted as mental warm-ups that naturally directed students into the assignments.</p>
 
<p>In the second part of the study, the researchers found that children who played brain training games over an extended period of time improved their math and reading test scores significantly more than students in the control group who did not complete the training games. In fact, even though the children in the brain training group started with overall lower levels of academic proficiency, by the end of the study, their test scores surpassed students in the control group by 12.8%. Even more striking, the brain training games improved student math scores more than is normally seen with one-on-one tutoring and afterschool programs.</p>

<p>All of these results show that skills developed in brain training games can transfer to other activities such as school-administered tests. It should be noted, however, that the physical exercise component could have played a significant role in making the cognitive skills stick. Yet this also demonstrates that the right brain training format could improve student learning. Maybe it’s time to stop being skeptical and start being trained.</p>
