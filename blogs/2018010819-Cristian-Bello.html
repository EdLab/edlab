Cristian Bello is the founder of <a href="http://landing.bomberbot.com/">Bomberbot</a>, a game that encourages children to code in a simple, fun, and visual way. Bomberbot has been used by more than 100,000 children throughout Finland, the Netherlands, Suriname, and Hong Kong. Bello studied business administration and has since founded three companies.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Bomberbot?</b><br>
<p>When I went to school, I had ICT classes and I loved it. I learned about hardware, the importance of the Internet, and Internet safety. When I was a child, I thought this was normal at every school, but unfortunately it's not and even today most children are not learning about technology. I think it's essential that children develop these skills to understand how the world around them works and to be better prepared for their adult lives.</p> 

<p>I still think we have a long way to go, as our goal is to bring Bomberbot to children in developing countries with the ultimate hope of giving them skills applicable for adulthood.</p>
 
<p><b>What has been the response from students who have used Bomberbot?</b><br>
<p>They love it! When youâ€™re in the classroom and children are using Bomberbot, you can really feel how concentrated and enthusiastic they are. We constantly receive feedback from teachers who tell us that their students keep asking when the next Bomberbot class will be. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Definitely the use of project-based learning. I believe that in the next 10 to 15 years, schools worldwide will continue implementing project-based methods that will help children develop problem-solving skills, think and study analytically, as well as investigate different subjects.</p>
 
<p><b>In addition to Bomberbot, what else are you working on?</b>
<p>Most of my focus is Bomberbot and the development of new digital content to keep up with the fast growth. I am also part of the board of the Dutch School, a foundation to help Dutch Educational companies grow and expand to international markets.</p>
