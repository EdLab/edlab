<p><a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a> is an online data storage and sharing site geared towards academic research. Researchers can upload their datasets or materials and others can download the information. The founder hopes the service will promote open-access research.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>figshare has been described as <i><a href="https://figshare.com/services/institutions#features">dropbox for academic research</a></i>. This is an apt comparison. Files as large as five gigabytes can be uploaded for free, while the service provides 20 gigabytes of free private storage. Additionally, there is no data cap for public storage, which is an impressive feature that competitors like Dropbox or Google Docs do not even offer.</p> 
 
</p>The most useful features for academics are the dissemination functions. Cloud-based storage allows users to share resources and datasets with customized audiences or collaborators. Researchers can define citations for their uploaded materials, which can be exported directly to popular citation managers, such as RefWorks and EndNotes. Conversely, people can download data and information of corresponding papers, promoting a transparent research environment that is much needed in academia.</p>

<p>Anyone can access figshare through the website or from a desktop app. Individual users can use figshare for free. The institutional service, which comes with expanded features, such as a university-branded portal, varies in cost. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The open-access model is a double-edged sword. Anyone can upload anything, including bad research. I found many low quality publications riddled with mistakes on figshare. I would hesitate to use datasets found on the site for serious research. In the future, figshare will need methods to ensure quality control through a verification process. </p> 

<p>On the technical side, some of the site’s filters don’t work well when perusing materials. For instance, I filtered a search specifically for datasets, but my query still brought in papers randomly mixed with the results. The site should have more precise search functions.<p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>A move toward more transparent research is becoming a popular trend in the academic community. For too long, academic research has been stuck in an Ivory Tower, accessible to only a few. figshare provides an impressive outlet for fostering this open-access movement. Scholars will enjoy the ease of sharing their work and finding new resources. However, quality control is an issue that the site needs to resolve before it can truly become an indispensable tool for researchers. </p>
