<p><a href="http://www.dreambox.com/k-8-math-lessons">DreamBox Learning</a> is an online learning math program for K–8 students that adapts to their individual needs and tracks data for teachers to use. This game-based program is mostly used to complement math instruction both in the classroom and at home to bring an exciting element to routine curriculum.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>DreamBox is a data-based adaptive learning system, meaning that it keeps track of how each individual student progresses and customizes hints, pace, sequence, and level of difficulty accordingly. And when we say it tracks data, we mean it tracks <i>a lot</i> of data: 48,000 points per student per hour. Because of this, each student who uses DreamBox learning will have an entirely personalized experience, adapted to their learning needs. Teachers can use the data DreamBox collects to identify learning gaps among their students and create personalized interventions.</p>
 
<p>This web program has three different levels (K–2, 3–5, and 6–8), each with a distinct design that feels appropriate for the age group. For instance, while the K–2 level is designed as a cartoon world with a clear storyline, the latter two levels have a more mature feel. The program is aligned with national standards and is entirely game-based. Players choose among different skill areas to complete tasks and earn points. The challenges are generally short and will hold students’ attention.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to find any seriously negative aspect of DreamBox, but there is at least one potentially complicated element worth noting. Because DreamBox is game-based, there is little instruction at the beginning of activities explaining the game or the skills needed to complete it. This could make some challenges difficult to master, particularly for younger students or those who need more guidance.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>DreamBox Learning is a fantastic, data-based, adaptive online learning math program. Although the cost may deter some, the adaptive nature of the program seems almost guaranteed to help improve a student’s math prowess. Whether you’re school a administrator, a teacher, or a parent looking to bolster math curriculum with fun practice, DreamBox can provide an exciting game-based learning experience.</p>
