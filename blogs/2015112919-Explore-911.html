<p>Where were you when you witnessed 9/11? The tragedy was an era-defining event that created shockwaves still reverberating today. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/explore-9-11/id387986451?mt=8">Explore 9/11</a>  is an app that guides users through the 9/11 Memorial and Museum as well as the World Trade Center site, allowing us to experience the history of 9/11. The app brings the enormous impact of 9/11 to life for a new generation, and invites older people to revisit a delicate wound in the American psyche. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Explore 9/11 features maps of the impacted downtown area and stories of those unfortunately directly affected by 9/11. Many of the stories are breathtaking in their sadness. Explore 9/11 makes good use of the portability of your phone or tablet to honor these memories. The app can be used interchangeably at the Memorial, Museum, or anywhere else in the world, so that nearly everyone can deepen their understanding of the defining geopolitical event, even if the site is too distant to visit. </p>

<p>Explore 9/11 includes a wide range of videos, photographs, and text to allow users to explore in their preferred medium. For example, transcripts are provided for audio testimonials, allowing users to ponder stories and address deeply personal feelings in a safe, supportive environment. The videos are particularly effective in breathing life into projects with prolonged trajectories, like the rebuilding of the WTC site. They also bear testament to easily dismissed elements, such as a simple tree that survived the falling towers, which became a poignant symbol for the resilience of the survivors who could have easily tumbled. Finally, on a wider educational note, 9/11 was not directly experienced by those born after fall 2001, becoming a tragic piece of history that they most likely learned about in Social Studies class or watched during televised specials. Explore 9/11 is a perpetually open invitation for successive generations of students to directly experience an integral piece of recent U.S. history that still impacts the world today. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are no problems with Explore 9/11. The visuals of the site are striking, but lose potency when viewed on smaller mobile devices. In comparison, the podcast-style stories have more affective depth due to their intimacy. Voices resonate with emotion and embody the event in ways that are still heartbreaking close to a decade-and-a-half later. More information could be embedded within the maps to provide greater context to the buildings and inhabitants impacted by 9/11. Itâ€™s a sign of its effectiveness that Explore 9/11 makes you want to learn more; we are left with a sense of emotional loss that can only be filled by reflection. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>After 14 years, some people not directly affected by the tragedy are unfortunately beginning to forget 9/11, letting its emotional residue settle like a distant memory. This type of sentiment is especially true for younger students born after 9/11 occurred, who can only conceive of this bitter tragedy as a remote historical event from another time. Explore 9/11 performs an admirable role providing a respectful space for people to revisit a tragedy we desperately want to forget but must always remember.</p>
