Need to represent the rigid structure of America’s school system? Why not Lego? <p>

From the wild imagination of burgeoning stop-animation film maker, Michael Hickox, comes a stark look at what the typical school day is like for millions of students across the country. Hickox uses Legos to craft the everyday world of our protagonist, a young boy whose behavior more resembles that of a prisoner than a student. Yet, from being forced out of his home and into the bus to being repulsed by an unrecognizable school lunch, it would seem this is an unremarkable tale of an ordinary kid. <p>

It isn’t until we see how our Lego boy reacts to being outside during recess that we realize why the caged bird sings. In a whirlwind of endless energy, he slides, he swings, he runs. At the sound of the bell, he must be physically dragged back to class against his will. When finally his school day has come to an end and he joyously leaps from the bus, the driver calls to him and mindlessly chirps, "I’ll see you first thing tomorrow morning!" causing Lego boy to dissolve to pieces. You can’t wake from this nightmare, buddy. <p>

Does the story depicted here read more like a parody or a tragedy? What does this say about the current way we educate children? Check out clips from the Vialogues discussion below and <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/5725">chime in with your thoughts!</a> <p>

<b>@00:24 Katezvdp:</b> How many of us had to literally be pushed-out the door to go to school? <p>

<b>@1:47 DLales:</b> Whoa! Exorcist Lego boy! If that doesn't convey being bored to death in class then I don't know what will. <p>

<b>@4:11 Flight307:</b> Accurate representation of how many students feel about life in school AND there are many places where that is the past and the present and future look way flippin' awesome.
