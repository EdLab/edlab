<p><i>"Disrupting tech education by helping students become Rockstar Engineers." </i> (<a href="https://www.nexgent.com/">NextGenT</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Empowering the Next Generation of IT Engineers</b></p>

<p>The NextGenT team doesn't believe in the effectiveness of the popular developer bootcamps that many aspiring computer engineers flock to. While these several-month-long training programs are intended for individuals to quickly build up the technical skills necessary to land an IT job, their one-size-fits-all model values breadth over depth. Instead of teaching a wide range of digital skills, NextGenT argues that training a developer in specific, teachable skills is more efficient and effective and makes graduates industry ready.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from their military training, the founders of NextGenT believe that the best education system is one based on real-world skills training that prepares students to succeed in the workforce. With their full learning platform launched by Y Combinator at the beginning of this year, NextGenT offers tech degree programs, individual courses, hands-on projects, and in-person workshops with specific aims based on studentsâ€™ interests and needs.</p>

<p><b>A Practical, Affordable Investment</b></p>

<p>The first online program NextGenT has launched is for a full stack network engineer certification, which requires no previous experience and promises to teach the most in-demand skills. Additionally, programs in cyber security, DevOps, sales, blockchain, voice, and cloud engineering are in the works. Once students complete a program, NextGenT provides career coaching to help them get jobs.</p>

<p>NextGenT recognizes that everyone should have access to quality education, and that typical developer bootcamps are very expensive, ranging anywhere from $9,000 to $21,000. The network management program is at the lower end of that spectrum at $12,500, with opportunities for discounts.</p>
