<p><b>Title:</b> Understanding Needs Embodiment: A Theory-Guided Reanalysis of the Role of Metaphors and Analogies in Understanding Science (2012)<P>
<b>Authors:</b> Kai Niebert, Sabine Marsch, & David F. Treagust</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> In science, metaphors and analogies are pedals on the bicycle of learning. The authors of <i><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.21026/full">Understanding Needs Embodiment</a></i> suggest that these strategies are essential for teaching, thinking about, and understanding science. Metaphors and analogies are a part of all learning discourse; the authors state that "metaphor is not merely a linguistic phenomenon but also a fundamental principle of thought and action." Essential as they are, using metaphors and analogies can be a tricky thing. The literature review suggests that instructional analogies and metaphors are often difficult for students to understand. To make sense of metaphors and analogies, students must have a good understanding of the source components and a clear link to how they apply to the new concept at hand. Students and teachers’ experiences and knowledge may not align and this often causes confusion and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Many studies have already been done on the effectiveness of metaphors and analogies in science education. The authors used these studies to analyze 199 instructional metaphors and analogies in 17 peer reviewed publications to look for patterns in the success or failure of these techniques. They selected publications with supplementary data and student interview transcripts to ensure they could verify the results of the teaching strategies tested. The authors extracted all the relevant metaphors from the material and coded them by conceptual level, potential issues, and likely differences in interpretations of students’ and teachers’ source domains.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors found that metaphors and analogies often fail in science education because the source of the metaphor is not linked to direct student experiences, the concept is misunderstood, or the learner does not have enough context to understand the concepts being taught. Instructors must ensure that students have an experience of the source, the imaginative capacity to apply this experience to new concepts, and enough background knowledge to apply the concept. The researchers called the concept of having sufficient background knowledge to apply an analogy or metaphor "embodiment."</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Metaphors and analogies are important in science education because they can help students and teachers scaffold ideas, but instructors should be careful to ensure these strategies draw on existing student experiences. It’s important to recognize that student and instructor experience often differs and that metaphors and analogies should be embodied to be effective. This is increasingly important in online education and for science education startups. Because e-learning has the capacity to reach a wide audience with diverse experience, careful thought must be given to metaphors and analogies to ensure that they are being understood correctly. Online networks will give science educators the ability to share best practices and their own experiences with effective or ineffective metaphors and analogies.</p>
