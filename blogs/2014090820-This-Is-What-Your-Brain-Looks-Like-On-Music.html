Why is music important to every culture? How do human brains react to music? Are some brains hardwired to be more receptive to music than others? <p>

In an effort to reveal the effects of music on the brain, a team of researchers at Columbia University examined Oliver Sacks, a well-known neurologist and writer. Dr. Sacks has always loved the music of Bach but doesn’t think as highly of Beethoven. While he listened to two pieces of music, one by Bach and one by Beethoven, he rated his emotions and had his brain scanned. The scanning results showed that his brain was much more activated, meaning excited, during Bach’s piece, which was consistent with his own feelings. Later, Dr. Sacks listened to a piece of music but wasn’t sure if it was Bach or Beethoven. Could his brain tell the difference? Watch the above video for the answer.  <p>

Understanding the power of music at the neurological level has tremendous applications and could help resolve lingering questions. For one, does music foster intelligence? How might music therapy benefit the healing of various diseases? While many answers are yet to be found, reading Dr. Sacks’ book <a href= "http://www.oliversacks.com/books/musicophilia/">Musicophilia</a> is a great start.

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:00 zjjhfy:</b> Does the brain love something as much as you do? <p>

<b>@03:56 Carla:</b> This video would be a valuable asset during conference presentations. More researchers should make short videos summarizing their work! It would make it so much more shareable, too. <p>
