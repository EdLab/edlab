          <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Rhee">Michelle Rhee</a>, the Washington D.C. Public Schools Chancellor, is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/education/13tenure.html?hp">in the news</a> again with a controversial new program that could spell the end of tenure for teachers in the D.C. school system. Under the program,  teacher would choose between a green or red compensation plan. Teachers choosing the green plan would see their salary almost double by 2010. The catch is that they would need to give up tenure for a year, after which they would need a principal's recommendation or face dismissal. Teachers choosing red would also get big pay increases but lose seniority rights, meaning if their school closes and they are not hired by another school, their options are early retirement, a buyout or eventual dismissal. 

This is not the first time Ms. Rhee has raised controversy. At the time of her selection (June 12, 2007) by Mayor Adrian Fenty, many asked how a 37-year old Korean American with no experience running a school system manage a urban district where 82 percent of the students were African American (Prior to coming to D.C., she was Chief Executive Officer and President (as well as Founder) of <a href="http://www.tntp.org/">The New Teacher Project</a>). 

Here are some of the more newsworthy sound bites from Chancellor Rhee: 

<i>"It's embarrassing to be a Democrat when you hear Democrats talk about education... I believe that until the Democratic Party breaks ties with the teachers unions, we are not going to see the true reform in this country that we need."

“Tenure is the holy grail of teacher unions, but has no educational value for kids; it only benefits adults. If we can put veteran teachers who have tenure in a position where they don't have it, that would help us to radically increase our teacher quality. And maybe other districts would try it, too.”</i>
