<p>How can teachers overcome students’ resistance to change? When educators try to implement innovative instructional methods, students can be unwilling to engage with the new methods. A recent case study explores why students reject change; findings reveal critical themes in the students’ responses that assist in developing a planning tool for teachers. </p>

<p>From the data collected, the study identified eight key barriers: experience with methods, instructional conceptions (e.g., perceived appropriateness), risk tolerance, environmental constraints (e.g., class size), influence of others, perceived risks, perceived workload, and context-specific motivation (e.g., interest in subject matter, self-efficacy). Several of the reasons students resist new instructional methods are tied to social and cultural norms. When teacher behavior, assessment methods, and classroom interactions don’t fit into students’ beliefs about the roles that students and instructors should play, for example, students may resist engaging. This can even be self-reinforcing: many students in the study indicated that they were often discouraged from participating in group activities because of their classmates’ lack of willingness to participate. </p>

<p>Although the findings are based on a single course at one institution, the study provides insight into the kinds of barriers that can prevent students from engaging with new teaching methods. The reasons that students often resist change fall into three main categories: fear of negative academic consequences, worry that the new process could violate social, educational, and cultural norms, and concern that they would lose control over their environment or activities. Attending to these main anxieties can enable educators to prioritize their efforts to reduce the resistance to classroom changes.</p>
