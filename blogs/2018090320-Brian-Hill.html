Brian Hill is the CEO of <a href="https://www.edovo.com/">Edovo</a>, a Chicago-based venture that aims to reduce recidivism by bringing tech-enabled education and communication tools to incarcerated people. Hill was in his first year of a JD/MBA at Northwestern University when he began work on a Social Impact Bond initiative for the largest single-site jail in Chicago. This exposure prompted him to create the Edovo platform, which has scaled nationally and served well over 50K incarcerated students. He was named one of Conscious Company’s "Social Entrepreneurs to Watch in 2017." He earned a B.S. in Economics and Business from Brigham Young University, is a father of four, and is committed to making serious changes in corrections and reentry through technology.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Edovo?</b><br>
<p>I define education much more broadly than most. Maybe it's because I dropped out of my JD/MBA program knowing the startup was too important, but mostly because the greatest learning experiences I've had aren't framed by the classroom, but have actually taken place out of the classroom. </p>

<p>When I was growing up my father taught college courses in Folsom Prison. At night he would share the essays and stories with us, they were our bedtime stories. You could feel the hope, the brilliance, and the struggle of his students, and it was disheartening even at the age of 10 to see so much human potential locked up. This led me to lead and serve in organizations that worked with people suffering from mental health problems and substance abuse over the next decade. </p>

<p>Here, and in other efforts, I saw the successes of nonprofits and NGOs, but too often structural or organizational deficiencies inhibited their ability to scale or impact beyond a small geography. It was really this framework that carried me into the JD/MBA at Northwestern seeking  impact that could scale with tactical (not just emotional) solutions to complex problems. It was a few months in the program when I was able to lead a county project in Chicago looking to use a Social Impact Bond (SIB) to reduce the population of Cook County Jail. The access I was granted and the time I was able to spend in the jail sprouted the seeds that had been planted years before. While the SIB wasn't going to work, I knew I'd found my passion and place to innovate and push tactical solutions at scale.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Edovo will change the way we rehabilitate and educate incarcerated individuals?</b><br>
<p>The question presupposes we currently rehabilitate and educate incarcerated users, which sadly is not the case for the majority. Most spend the majority of their time sleeping and watching daytime television with 1 out of 5 gaining access to meaningful educational programming. When my father taught in prison, he reached a class of fewer than 20 in a facility of about 4,000. If Edovo is successful in our overall mission, we will help transform the correctional industry completely, first by granting daily meaningful access to education, and second by shifting the focus toward evidence-based rehabilitation and the delivery of truly beneficial programming at scale. </p>

<p>Our hope is that state and county funding will be allocated for specific educational and vocational training initiatives, and that government contracts will be weighed more heavily on the merits of providers’ ability to provide results and focused reentry preparation. We also hope that by utilizing distributed devices we will be able to create custom re-entry paths and highly personalized learning pathways for individuals to complete tangible and specific steps toward educational attainment and job placement. Edovo is hoping to reduce recidivism and continue to decrease the incarcerated population, ensuring that individuals are prepared for re-entry when they are released.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The trends in corrections often lag about 5-10 years behind traditional education. The unquestionable trend in corrections that will have the greatest impact is tech-enabled learning since there is a complete absence of access today. In education more broadly, and what must follow in corrections, is the necessity to engage the support networks of the student and AI to drive further non-judgmental student support. Learning is challenging. Digital self-driven learning can feel impossible. Without the aid of a supporter (tutor, mentor, TA, coach), probabilities of success drop tremendously. Without the use of AI, that supporter may never scale to the reach needed.</p>

<p><b>What, if any, are future plans for Edovo?</b><br>
<p>Edovo's focus in the near future is to continue to deliver educational services to as many incarcerated individuals as possible, while also disrupting the predatory prison communication space. As a technology company, we are constantly innovating our product line and service offerings, continuing to utilize the data and insights we gather to further explore the most effective ways to help make the most of each individual's period of incarceration. As we are developing new methods of communication and more sophisticated individualized learning curricula, we are also developing a more robust suite of operational tools for administrators. Our intent is to help correctional facilities maximize operational efficiency and use correctional technology to digitize their workflows, gather actionable intelligence, and better communicate with the incarcerated population and their support networks at home.</p>

<p>Edovo is also working with nationally recognized researchers and research institutes to study the effectiveness of correctional education technology on things like mental health and reentry preparation. Our goal is to continue gathering this important data, exploring research opportunities, and working with both facilities and community service groups to find the best ways to improve the lives of those affected by incarceration. We recognize that corrections and custody are only one part of the equation. If we're to have the breadth of impact we want, we must also look to expand our technological reach both toward pretrial services or courts and to post-release support. Without this expansion we will forever be limited in our impact.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I avoid Twitter. I fear the complex issues are too often synthesized into soundbites that oversimplify solutions. The world needs more deep conversations and doers that build solutions.</p>
