<p><i>"LearnLaunch is dedicated to connecting, supporting, and growing greater Boston’s education technology ecosystem to drive innovation and transform learning. It offers a vibrant community, educational events, a collaborative co-working space, and a selective accelerator program to promote the growth of the education technology sector in greater Boston, a world education hub."</i> (<a href="http://learnlaunch.com/about-us/">About LearnLaunch</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Fostering Community-Based Education Innovation</b></p>
 
<p><a href="http://learnlaunch.com/">LearnLaunch</a> is an edtech accelerator that fosters educational innovation across the greater Boston area. Its work is divided into three major parts—an accelerator, a campus, and an institute. <i>LearnLaunch Accelerator</i> provides support, funding, and coaching for promising edtech startups. Through a selective process, applications are carefully vetted to match LearnLaunch’s resources with the needs of these burgeoning startups to ensure success. With the support of McGraw Hill and Pearson, over 19 startups have been "LearnLaunched."</p>
 
<p><b>Physical Space Promotes Digital Creation</b></p>
 
<p>Despite Boston’s renown as a global education center boasting academic heavy hitters like Harvard and MIT, LearnLaunch is the area’s only collaborative work space exclusively reserved for edtech startups. Through this focus, <i>LearnLaunch Campus</i> provides mutually-beneficial networking opportunities within a flexible office space that can be tailored to startup needs. The Campus currently houses 100 edtech entrepreneurs and 30 edtech companies. As a result, the space has reached a critical mass of highly trained educators and technologists who can provide real-world, real-time help for digital creation.</p>
 
<p><b>Student Achievement at the Fore</b></p>
 
<p>Edtech startups can be notoriously heavy on the "tech" but light on the "ed." Not LearnLaunch. <i>LearnLaunch Institute</i> prides itself in improving student achievement through fostering the purposeful use of technology. A diverse lineup of classes, conferences, meetups, and services create a serendipitous environment where edtech stakeholders can meet, greet, and work. This includes teachers and students on the educational side, as well as entrepreneurs and investors on the tech side. This mashup of a diverse cross section of interested stakeholders promotes the best in edtech.</p>
 
<p><b>All Work...</b></p>
 
<p>Community is a priority at LearnLaunch, and so is having fun. LearnLaunch boasts a number of incredibly fun events that are also useful to its growing number of constituents. The programming agenda includes a higher education pitch competition, marketing opportunities, and a branding tips session that will connect educators, entrepreneurs, and investors. If you are located in Boston and have a great new edtech idea, visit LearnLaunch to bring it to new heights and meet like-minded people. And by the way, bring a ping-pong paddle! </p>
