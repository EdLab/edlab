<p><a href="http://www.writeabout.com/">Write About</a> is a social publishing platform for classrooms. The site provides images paired with writing prompts and students can respond in written or audio format.  Teachers can add their own images, create writing prompts and provide individual feedback.  Write About is a web-based program that can be accessed on desktops, laptops and tablets running on IOS and Android. Teachers can sign up, participate, and create up to 40 student accounts with up to 3 posts each for free. Teachers pay $4.95/month for unlimited posts, or $7.95/month for up to 250 students with unlimited posts. For students under the age of 13, parental consent must be obtained through the website.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<p>Write About lets teachers visually inspire students or provide a prompt for writing exercises. The simplicity of the interface allows teachers and students to operate and learn the program quickly with little instruction. The social publishing platform could also help teachers teach media literacy (how to post and what to post in digital spaces), push critical thinking, and tap into students' interests and creativity.</p>

<p>Once a student publishes a post, only the teacher can view the post, but the student and teacher can agree to change the settings to public view. Posts can also be published to the "classmates only" privacy setting, visible to peers but not the greater Write About community. To decrease the potential for cyberbullying, there is no peer-to-peer messaging or friending, and all activity is visible to and removable by the teacher. Teachers can leave feedback for students in the form of text annotations, audio messages, private written comments, or public written comments. Following teacher feedback, students can view the comments, edit, and republish posts.</p>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<p>Students can only register with one teacher, which is a problem if a student has more than one teacher using Write About. The only work around Write About has to offer is for teachers to co-administer a group so two (or more) teachers can view the work of one student. The FAQ section suggests that this is an area Write About is working to improve. Users cannot record audio clips on iPads and all other devices must have an up to date installation of Adobe Flash.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Write About provides a controlled, safe space for students to learn and practice media literacy while exploring critical and creative writing. Teachers can bring the classroom to a virtual publishing space.  The fees are reasonable for teachers who want to expand their use of Write About. The interface and feedback methods are easy to learn and use due to the simple design. Write About is a good way for teachers to introduce their students to web-based publishing platforms with a focus on writing and online safety.</p>
