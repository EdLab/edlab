<p><a href="http://www.fooducate.com">Fooducate</a> does exactly what the name suggests: educates about food. Whether you want to lose weight or just eat healthier, this app could help you achieve your goals by teaching you how to avoid certain foods and giving you target nutrition counts daily.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The best feature of Fooducate is the food finder feature. Take a picture of any barcode, and the app will recognize the food product and pull up a large amount of nutritional information about it. This information includes the nutrition label and ingredient list, an overall nutrition grade (on an A-D scale) and explanation, comments from other users, and healthier alternatives. It’s a tough grading scale; I was surprised to find my favorite granola bar only received a C, which is only one letter grade above Little Debbie Swiss Cake Rolls (my sweet-crazed, straight-A childhood self is reeling at this one). The grade explanation, however, elicits exactly why products receive a certain grade and offers facts about certain difficult-to-pronounce ingredients, such as soy lecithin.</p>
 
<p>Fooducate also helps you keep track of your calorie intake if you choose, as well as daily amount of fiber, carbs, protein, and so on. The app also has a social media component. Users can share recipes or health tips, comment and like articles and food products, and follow others. Fooducate also publishes regular "diet tidbits" that offer information on foods and ingredients to avoid as well as on the inner workings of the digestive system.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Fooducate provides a lot of information in its grade explanation section, not all the facts are detailed enough to provide future guidance. For instance, I learned that my favorite granola bar has multiple sugar ingredients listed (something healthy eaters want to avoid), but it didn’t explain which ingredients those were. Because of this, it might be difficult to apply the facts related to one food product to those of another.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Fooducate is a helpful companion for anyone seriously trying to eat healthy. While it can be helpful to track food intake, the most exciting aspect of the app is the barcode scanner. Instead of standing in a supermarket aisle staring at a nutrition label I can’t decipher for far too long, this app will help me click, learn, and decide with ease. (Although this doesn’t mean that I’ll abandon Little Debbie altogether. Sorry, future Sara.)</p>
