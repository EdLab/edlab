<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RexBrynen">Rex Brynen</a> is a professor of Political Science at McGill University. He advocates for innovative learning through simulation-based games, often centering on conflict, disaster relief, and peace-building. He runs the simulation-based learning blog  <a href="http://www.paxsims.org">PAXsims</a> where he sells educational board games designed by himself and his colleagues, such as  <a href="https://paxsims.wordpress.com/aftershock/">AFTERSHOCK: A Humanitarian Crisis Game</a> and the <a href="https://paxsims.wordpress.com/magck/">Matrix Game Construction Kit</a>. These simulation games allow players to explore how stakeholders must work together through a disaster and are loosely based on real events like the 2010 Haiti earthquake. All profits from game sales are donated to UN humanitarian agencies.</p>
<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>My work on the application of serious games to teaching and policy analysis really arose from the intersection of two interests. The first was research and teaching on how complex peace, stabilization, and humanitarian operations are conducted. How does one best convey the effects of differing organizational and political perspectives, imperfect information, and coordination challenges in a classroom setting? How can you get students to think about adversarial responses and second- and third-order effects? Simply reading about it doesn’t fully communicate the dynamics at work. </p>

<p>Second, I’m a gamer, with a longstanding hobby interest in boardgaming, wargaming, and role-playing games. Games are often about imperfect information, interactivity, and coordination, so it seemed a natural route to go. Classroom simulation games can also be far more interesting than lectures and class readings!</p>
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Several years ago I set up a website, <a href="http://www.paxsims.org">PAXsims</a>, devoted to conflict simulation. It really started as a mechanism for thinking out loud about gaming issues and sharing some interesting tidbits. The whole thing has taken off in a major way, however, and we have now had more than a quarter of a million visitors to the website.</p> 
<p>We’ve designed and marketed a couple of games, <a href="https://paxsims.wordpress.com/aftershock/">AFTERSHOCK: A Humanitarian Crisis Game</a> and the <a href="https://paxsims.wordpress.com/magck/">Matrix Game Construction Kit</a>. My colleagues and I are also often called upon to provide and contribute to projects around the world, ranging from high school and university teaching initiatives to games for humanitarian agencies and governments. I even delivered a scenario game on post-conflict transition in Benghazi at the height of the Libyan civil war.</p>
<p><b>As screens are being incorporated into all facets of education, do you feel it is important for your simulation games to be hands-on?</b><br>
<p>Digital simulation games can be, and are, wonderful things. However, they tend to be more expensive and take longer to develop, and they can be harder to adapt on the fly to pedagogical needs. With a manual game it may only take a felt pen or printer, some cards, and five minutes to incorporate a new idea or adapt the game for a particular learning purpose. The face-to-face social interaction in manual games can be especially rich. In some formats–<a href="https://paxsims.wordpress.com/?s=matrix+games">matrix games</a>, for example, or <a href="https://paxsims.wordpress.com/?s=megagame">megagames</a>–they can also allow for emergent, creative game play which potentially exceeds the designer's original vision. </p>
<p><b> What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>In February I will be running a large crisis simulation at McGill University examining <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-dire-straits-megagame-tickets-39563017049">strategic issues in East Asia</a> based on a very successful game we first delivered at <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41172485">King’s College London</a> in September. I’m also designing a game on religious conflict in urban areas to support an academic workshop on that subject in March. In April, I’ll be running our annual McGill University simulation of <a href="https://paxsims.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/ending-civil-war-in-the-classroom/">civil war termination and peace operations</a>, a massive event that will involve more than 70 hours of real-time game play over a week with more than one hundred students participating. Most immediately, I’ll be helping to design games-based learning tools for election officials later this month.</p>
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter, other social media, or in academia? </b><br>
<p>Regarding national security gaming, there’s an entire network around the <a href="https://connections-wargaming.com/">Connections Wargaming Conferences</a>, which are held annually in the US, UK, Australia, Netherlands, and now Canada.</p> 

<p>I am very active on Facebook with gaming, teaching, and policy colleagues (and much prefer it to Twitter because of the greater opportunity for thoughtful discussion). On Twitter, game designer <a href="https://twitter.com/Volko26">Volko Ruhnke</a>–who both designs hobby wargames and uses games to teach the US intelligence community–is a great person to follow, as are various folks from the <a href="https://twitter.com/lastturnmadness">megagaming community</a>. The <a href="http://activelearningps.com"> Active Learning in Political Science blog</a> is certainly worth following as well.</p>
