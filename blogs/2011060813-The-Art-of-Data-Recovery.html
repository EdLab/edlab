Have you been paying for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_recovery" target="_blank">data recovery</a> when your warranty runs out? Services like that can run you into the  hundreds of dollars in many places. However, doing it yourself has  gotten easier over time.

Let's assume that your <a title="laptop" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop" target="_blank">laptop</a> has stopped working. You push the power button and nothing happens.  After a while you determine that something is faulty, which prevents you  from using the machine. However, you have an important paper or file  that you need access.

The video above demonstrates how you can remove your hard drive and put it an <a title="hard drive enclosure" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_drive_enclosure" target="_blank">enclosure</a> which makes it become an external drive that you can attach to any machine (laptop or desktop).

Of course, make sure that you verify that the machine is not under  warranty before tinkering with it. That's just one of many disclaimers  that I should throw out there (though I will probably forget to do so).  By the way, my favorite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mj6TXGIT0A" target="_blank">disclaimer</a> is used from the movie "Dogma."

After you have determined that it is kosher to open the machine, make  sure you have the proper tools necessary: a static-free environment, a  safe place to put your screws (not demonstrated very well in video), a  screwdriver (<a title="Phillips screwdriver" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_screwdriver#Phillips" target="_blank">Phillips</a> likely), an enclosure for a 2.5" hard drive, the wires that came with  the enclosure, and a working machine to attach the enclosure to if you  are looking for imminent data retrieval. Enclosures can be found in many  technology stores or online for between $10 and $20 (look elsewhere if  you find the price higher where you go). A <a title="SATA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA" target="_blank">SATA</a> enclosure is likely for most machines produced in the last few years, though you might have to get a regular <a title="EIDE / PATA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Attachment" target="_blank">EIDE</a> 2.5" enclosure (check your documentation). If you see two rows of pins  sticking out when you remove the hard drive from the laptop, you are  dealing with an EIDE drive.

You can find out how to remove/replace the hard drive in the manual  that comes with your machine. The manual is also available  online if you go to the company website (Dell, HP, Toshiba, etc.) and go  to the support site. From there, you will enter your model number  and/or express code which will bring up all documents and drivers  specific to your machine. For more complicated parts removal, you can Â find schematics and how-to's on Google.

This procedure can also be performed on desktops. The enclosures for  those are typically bigger (3.5" HDD) and the concept is the same.

So enjoy the video... and sorry for the hairy legs...

DISCLAIMER #2: Never do this on a machine other than yours. They <em>WILL </em>find you.
