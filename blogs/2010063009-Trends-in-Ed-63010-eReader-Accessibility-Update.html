          <p>
            Earlier this year, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3717">Arizona State University (ASU) was sued by the The National Federation of the Blind (NFB)</a> and the American Council of the Blind (ACB) because ASU chose the Kindle  for a pilot eReader program.  The Kindle has some text-to-speech functionality, but no user interface or navigation voice over for users who are blind or have low vision. Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Education released the following  <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-20100629.html">warning to universities</a>:

<span style="color: #888888;">Requiring use of an emerging technology in a classroom environment when  the technology is inaccessible to an entire population of individuals  with disabilities — individuals with visual disabilities — is  discrimination prohibited by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  (ADA) and Section   504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) unless those  individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit  them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology  in an equally effective and equally integrated manner. </span>

<span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some individuals believe the nonprofit <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/06/30/kindle" target="_blank">universities are being treated as scapegoats </a>and the federal government should be focusing on the companies creating the devices instead, and that the warning would deter pilot programs and innovation. One commenter responded:</span></span>

<span style="color: #999999;">The DOJ's argument (as stated) is not to summarily punish  institutions for trying new technology. Rather, it is a message to  device and software designers - and institutions - that the design  process (and equipment evaluation process) should include the widest  range of users possible from the beginning. The argument that designing  for accessibility is time-consuming and expensive is absolutely true <strong>IF</strong> you wait until the product is at market to fix it. Including these  concepts in the original design reviews and revisions mitigates this  challenge almost entirely.</span><span style="color: #999999;">Why should students with disabilities  have to wait around for innovators to remember they exist? This  contributes to an unnecessary and discriminatory atmosphere that keeps  students who are otherwise able to fully participate in education at the  back of the line.</span>
