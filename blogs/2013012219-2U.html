<p><a href="http://2u.com/">2U</a> (formerly 2tor) is the Rolls-Royce of learning management systems. Well-funded and markedly traditional despite their progressive functionality, the system selectively partners with universities to create equivalent online versions of existing in-person programs. Founder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Katzman">John Katzman</a> is part of the old guard. In 1981 he founded the <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/">Princeton Review</a> and has been involved in the edtech scene since, launching such ventures as <a href="http://www.noodle.org/">Noodle Education</a>. 2U is one of the most <a href="http://2u.com/news/gw-school-of-public-health-and-health-services-launches-online-public-health-graduate-program/">heavily funded</a> education startups in the United States and their programs, which reject the quick and dirty image of online education, have the gravitas and price tag of on campus programs. 
</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>2U is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2012/11/05/97500-for-an-online-degree-2u-is-worth-it-say-students/">picky</a> about its partnerships and prides itself on quality content and delivery. The company’s brand rests heavily on the idea of physical program equivalence. From their dignified website, pointedly synchronous classes, mobile support, and hybrid lab components to their robust social features (which have <a href="http://techonomy.com/2012/10/97500-for-an-online-degree-2u-is-worth-it-say-students/">reportedly</a> resulted in at least one marriage between online classmates), the site offers a level of connection beyond most modern online programs. 
</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Students pay a price for the luxury of 2U’s system; tuition is equivalent to in person programs and their partners, which include public and private graduate programs, are not inexpensive. In this way 2U feels less democratic than many online programs, but as is the case with <a href="http://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/">Washington University’s Master of Laws in U.S. Law for Foreign Lawyers</a>, the programs have a global reach that may more than make up for their limited domestic scope.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>In some ways 2U feels like a regression; its synchronous courses and face-based interactions borrow much more from traditional programs than systems like <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> or <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a>, though 2U’s stodgier elements may be the step back that online education needs to move forward. The palatable, flexible, and social interface may appeal to students left behind by the often emotionless landscape of online learning, and its selective partnerships and quality offerings may help validate digital education.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>2U’s plush programs are good (and good PR for) online learning.</p>
