Title: <b>Learning Analytics for Generating Intelligent Information in
Heterogeneous Educational Environments</b>

<b>July 22, 2pm, Thompson Hall 229</b>

Speaker: <b>Pedro MuÃ±oz-Merino</b>

Abstract:
Nowadays, there is an overload of data in different learning systems.
Although many low level data is usually present, it is not always easy
for teachers, students and other stakeholders to use and interpret
this data and reach useful conclusions for the learning process. In
heterogeneous educational environments, different platforms provide
different contexts and functionality, which condition the type of data
that can be collected and the information about the learning process
that can be inferred. This intelligent information should be useful
and presented to teachers and students in a clear and precise way,
stating clearly the exact meaning of the information, e.g. with
visualizations or recommendations.

This talk exposes different examples of generation of relevant
information for the learning process from heterogeneous educational
systems. Specifically, different works will be presented for
generating useful and intelligent information from low level data for
platforms such as Google Course Builder, Khan Academy, a competition
system, or a distributed environment in a course. Some relevant
information that can be inferred in each case will be presented, as
well as the differences of possible information depending on the
educational platform. Moreover, some possible visualizations and
recommendations will be shown, as well as the way to process the low
level data to obtain intelligent information and the different meaning
depending on the type of processing.

A complete case study at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid will be
presented using the Khan Academy platform. This case study took place
in year 2012 for a course in Physics. Results of this study will be
shown based on the generated intelligent information. There will be a
reflection about the connection of the intelligent information with
the learning process and how to take advantage of it.

Bio:

Pedro J. MuÃ±oz-Merino is a lecturer of Telematics Engineering at
Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain. He received a M.Sc. in
telecommunications engineering in 2003 from the Polytechnic University
of Valencia and a Ph.D in telematics engineering in 2009 from
Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. He received the award for the Best
Master's Thesis in Telematics Engineering by the Spanish Association
of Telecommunications Engineering. Moreover, he was given a special
PhD award by Universidad Carlos III de Madrid for his work on
intelligent tutoring systems and the semantic web. Pedro has made
research visits to Intel in Ireland (for more than 3 months) and the
Fraunhofer Institute of Technology in Germany (for more than 6
months). Currently, his main areas of research are learning analytics,
educational games, semantic web in education, and intelligent tutoring
systems. He has participated in more than 20 research projects
including regional, national and international ones. In addition, he
is co-author of more than 40 papers in conferences and journals, and
has served as Programme Committee member or reviewer for many
conferences and journals related to technology enhanced learning.
