<p><b>Title:</b> The relationship between frequency of Facebook use, participation in Facebook activities, and student engagement (2013)<br>
<p><b>Author:</b> Reynol Junco</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131511001825">ScienceDirect</a></p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Previous studies have shown that student engagement, both in-class and out-of-class, is important for student psychosocial development and academic success.   Because an increase of student engagement has been seen to directly result in an improvement of grades, the author of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131511001825">The relationship between frequency of Facebook use, participation in Facebook activities, and student engagement</a> explores more about how the use of the most popular social media site for college students, Facebook, can affect college students’ levels of engagement to help boost student development and success.</p>

<p>In the study, the author compares the relationship between Facebook use and student engagement in general, time spent preparing for class, and time spent participating in co-curricular activities. Participants, all students attending 4-year public colleges in the Northeast, were sent surveys to complete.  While some questions asked the students how many hours they spent doing a certain activity, the <a href="http://nsse.iub.edu/">National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)</a> was used to measure the level of student engagement.  The results of the survey were then used to see how different levels of Facebook use could affect student engagement.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The survey results showed scores on the engagement test ranging from 23 to 74 out of 100, with a low average of 49.4. Participants spent an average of 12.5 hours preparing for classes and 5 hours participating in co-curricular activities a week. The average time spent on Facebook was 101.09 minutes per day. Overall, the results show some Facebook activities such as playing games were negatively predictive of student engagement, studying, and on-campus involvement, while others were positively predictive. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> As digital students may be discouraged from using Facebook by parents and teachers, it seems that there is a common misconception that students who frequently use Facebook perform more poorly academically.  A study like this sheds some light on research about the influences of Facebook and academic performance, whether positive or negative. For a deeper exploration of how Facebook can influence college students’ social development and academic success, a future study would have to be more specific in examining the different types of Facebook activities and their direct influence on student engagement, time spent preparing for class, and time spent in co-curricular activities.</p>

<p>This study shows that the relationship between Facebook use and academic achievement is complicated and depends on many factors.  Though the article does not state ways in how Facebook could be incorporated into the educational experience, if used productively to gain real-world engagement, Facebook could be a tool for teachers and faculty to use for academic purposes.</p>
