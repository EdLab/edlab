            April 29

Stephen and I arrived in Denver a little before noon. We rode the Super Shuttle to the hotel where we will be staying until Sunday. It is called the Comfort Inn Denver Downtown, a great place, even greater than the Sheraton Hotel partnered with AERA this year. I learned this point a day later when I found we had free WiFi and free breakfast at CIDD while my friends at Sheraton did not. This point is further validated when Faisal checked in at CIDD on Friday and magically got a huge suite on the top floor to stay alone (he told me he didn't do anything special).

Denver is cool, about 20 degrees lower than NYC. Stephen did not wear enough clothes. By 5 PM, Stephen and I were surprised to find most stores were closed (including Seven Eleven). It took us a little while to find an Irish restaurant to have dinner. Hui Soo later told us he did not like Irish foods when Stephen and I recommended this place.

This is a great day for Critter. In the Instructional Technology SIG, we presented the Critter pilot study paper with Critter (I mean it. Check out our presentation slides at http://critter.tc-library.org/player/55#/?discussionId=28 ). /*thanks Arianna for writing the paper!*/ We got more questions from the audiences than other presenters. And a couple of people (including a presenter from Cyprus) came to us saying they would like to use Critter to do teacher training programs. Good sign.

Things were less great in the evening when I received an email from the discussant hosting my symposium on Saturday. She was asking me where my paper was. I swear I didn't know I had to submit a paper to a symposium. But I later found out it was indeed my fault because symposium is not a round table.

Anyway, I had to type up my paper in three hours and send it to the discussant. Luckily, the discussant did not say anything bad about it. She was really nice.

April 31

In the symposium session named Constructing learning Through Technology: Where Repetition Ends and Understanding Begins, I presented my study using a Flash game I previously developed with several other members at Teachers College. Basically the study shows even a simple exercise game has the potential to foster strategy learning in math problem solving, but proper scaffolding may be required to help players completely implement the new strategy and use it in various scenarios. I received very helpful feedback from the discussant as well as from the audience.

The other three presentations are also intriguing. The first paper compared interaction and learning using mouse versus Wii remote in a computer-based numberline game. The second paper discussed the potential of virtual manipulatives in acquiring abstract math concepts. And the third paper reported that the trial-and-error approach is effective in teaching webpage development in an asynchronous video tutorial. 

I am interested in these papers because I always wanted to do a video game project that uses new technologies such as Wii remote, touch screen (iPad), augmented reality, and so on. And also, it will be a good topic to see whether Critter is a useful tool to coach skills such as programming, skiing, and even cooking.

The semester is ending and guess new projects should be underway.
