<p>Brick-and-mortar schools may still be the typical educational institution, but some researchers believe that virtual schools will surpass them in number of students enrolled within the next 10 years. Currently, schools in almost every state offer fully online or blended learning education, and that number is only increasing; enrollment in virtual schools is growing by about 30% each year. Researchers examined this changing landscape of K–12 virtual education by observing the largest virtual school provider in the U.S.: <a href="http://www.k12.com/">K–12 Inc</a>.</p>
 
<p>In light of this data, the researchers noted that one of the biggest advantages of enrolling in a virtual school is the flexibility it provides students. Because virtual schools tend to follow asynchronous models (students can engage in course material at any point of the day), they provide flexibility for highly mobile families (such as those in the military) and those who live in rural areas. In addition, virtual schools can give students the opportunity to take courses that may not be available locally.</p>
 
<p>Despite these advantages, there are three huge concerns facing K–12 virtual schools. The first is their high attrition rates. Students are much more likely to drop out of virtual schools than brick-and-mortar schools. In fact, only 49% of students graduated on time at K–12 Inc., as opposed to 79% of students in public schools in the same areas. The second concern is students’ performance results. Out of all students fully enrolled in virtual schools, only 27% showed Adequate Yearly Progress, compared to 52% of students enrolled in public schools. The third issue is that teachers don’t feel like they get enough training to teach an online course, and they don’t have an adequate support system while teaching.</p>
 
<p>The authors of this article believe that virtual schools must adapt in several ways to meet the needs of a growing student body. For one, teachers should receive both more training and support in an online education system. In addition, virtual schools should make use of a different range of speech and touch activated tools to support differently-abled students. Finally, virtual schools should provide student online counseling, which is currently missing from many online education models.</p>
 
<p>There’s no denying that enrollment in virtual schools is growing, and it will likely continue to grow in the years ahead. This research cautions us against blindly expanding online education systems without taking seriously the concerns identified. The question is, will a virtual school ever be able to fully overcome these concerns?</p>
