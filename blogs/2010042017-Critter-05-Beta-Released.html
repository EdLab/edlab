            *** PLEASE KEEP PRIVATE ***

For the past several months, D&R has been actively working on an improved and production-capable version of the Critter tool. We're pleased to announce the initial internal release of this tool. Important features and improvements over the initial prototype include:

- Easily upload videos in multiple formats, including .flv, .mov, .mpeg
- Create or update discussions easily and quickly.
- Use an improved and evolving UI designed to optimize commenting and viewing others' comments while watching videos. 
- New architecture that will support exciting new features in the coming weeks (integration with social networks, mobile versions of Critter, etc., higher throughput and performance)

You can check it out at:

<a href="http://dev-critter.tc.columbia.edu/dev.critter.tc-library.org/0.5/">Here.</a> (our apologies for the long URL, we are working on a much friendlier one in the next week or two)

Please feel free to upload videos, create discussions and comment on content you are viewing. We'll be adding lots more features and improvements in the coming weeks and I'll post additional updates regularly as we incrementally release new versions. Critter is being integrated with the new CAS account capabilities for Edlab apps. In the future, this will allow a seamless way to share data across our applications. We are currently working on automated registration for Critter and CAS (hopefully by end of April), but until that happens we ask that you email myself and Pranav <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4160">the details outlined in this blog entry</a>. We will email you back in a day with your account information.

While this is an internal Edlab release, we would love to see select groups of people who you want to discuss videos with join as well. If you have some small group of people outside the lab who you would like to create discussion groups for, just send us the same registration information for them as you are sending for yourself.

This version of Critter and the features that will be added in the coming weeks are a strong reflection of the feedback you guys have provided in previous seminars, blog posts and one-on-one conversations. Please keep the feedback coming. To help make it easier, we've included a feedback button on the Critter site that you can fill out no matter where you are browsing.

Finally, a big thanks to all the folks who have worked on this: Zhou, Jeannie, Pranay, Pranav, Arianna, Jo, Hui Soo and everyone in D&R and the Edlab who have supported this project.
