<p>Those who remember <i>Schoolhouse Rock!</i> will be very enthusiastic about <a href="http://grammaropolis.com/index.php">Grammaropolis</a>. This app had me singing the famous "Conjunction junction, what’s your function?", since the inhabitants of Grammaropolis reminded me so much of the friendly and endearing characters from that 1970’s classic. However, after playing with this app for a bit, the song of Noun Town stuck in my head, a catchy tune that introduces players to the first section of Grammaropolis. Each animated character is a figure of speech, and in Noun Town, the characters are nouns. Verbs, adjectives, prepositions, they all reside in Grammaropolis and lead you through an interactive journey to learn the basics of English grammar. Watch interactive videos, flip through virtual comic books, and then test your knowledge with quizzes, while you are guided along by the denizens of the great city of Grammaropolis.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app is bright, cheery, and totally effective. Even adult native English speakers might be able to use a refresher course on the grammar basics, and this app reinforced concepts that are not formally taught after elementary school. The short videos are funny and smart, and give a great visualization to go along with the grammar explanations. There is a feature that allows you to check progress reports, so that teachers and parents can see which lessons players are completing and how well they are doing on the quizzes. If two or more people have accounts, a separate report for each of them may be viewed as well. It's also possible to access the content directly if you want to skip the lessons and just access the digital comics, games, and videos.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>This is a great product with few drawbacks. This teaching style should be expanded into other subjects. Algebratropolis, anyone?</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>No matter who you are, Grammaropolis will grab your attention. It is quite thorough, and dedicates an ample amount of information and interactive media to each subtopic of grammar included. For those who want to use it as a pedagogical tool, the progress tracker is a great way to ensure that the app is being successfully used by students to learn more about grammar. For anyone else who simply wants to review grammar concepts and have fun while doing it, this is a must-have. Grammar is a crucial but often overlooked field that is the very foundation of our ability to clearly express ourselves. If you aren’t in the mood to consult a textbook, head over to Grammaropolis to consult with these adorable grammar experts.</p>
