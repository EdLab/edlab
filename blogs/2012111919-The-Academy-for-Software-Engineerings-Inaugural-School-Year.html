<b>@00:11 BridgetJane1:</b>  I think this is a great point... most people don't associate creativity with software engineering!
<p>
<b>@1:23 Clark:</b>  I'm hearing the same statement over and over in this video (for good reason), and that is that software engineering teaches you a framework by which you can solve really any problem that you come to face. Logic rules!
<p>
<b>@1:29 Katezvdp:</b> "The NYC school system has never had a school dedicated to software engineering."

Ask any developer you know how young they were when they broke their first computer just so they could put it back together, and I bet you’d find their interest in technology is deep-rooted. The problem is, there are few outlets that allow young people to exercise these interests outside of after-school clubs. So, many students are hopping from an extracurricular hobby to a full-blown four-year career path with little in the middle to ease this transition. <p>

That’s why New York City’s new public school, the Academy For Software Engineering (AFSE), is a major win for the city, its students, and a burgeoning tech industry in the area. With the need for skilled developers on the rise (the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics projects an increase of 30%</a> in job opportunities this decade), AFSE is answering the call many employers have been making. <p>

Aside from the obvious competencies that students of software engineering pick up, they also learn the valuable skill of creative problem solving. Add to that, as computational geometer Hugo Boyer points out in the video, "computers are an extension of your brain, so the younger you get to play with them, the easier it is for you to get them to do tricks for you." <p>

With Silicon Alley merely a stone’s throw away from the school, eager new talent and relieved employers are no doubt welcoming future opportunities to collaborate. <p>

Do you wish a school like this existed when you were in high school? Do you think more schools like AFSE will open in response to the high demand of programmers, or will another, more accessible option become available? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/3264 ">Join the conversation</a> on Vialogues to add your thoughts!
