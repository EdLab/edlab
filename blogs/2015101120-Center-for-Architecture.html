Design educator, Howard Stern puts his passion for architecture simply, "I like building things." And so do many students throughout NYC but, more often than not, the typical classroom curriculum doesn't leave much room for children and teens to tap into their love of design and construction. Fortunately, since 2003 the <a href="http://cfa.aiany.org/"> Center for Architecture</a> has functioned as the hub for anyone fascinated by the built environment. With famed skyscrapers, tunnels, and detailed facades as the perfect backdrop for celebration and study, the Center for Architecture is home to many exhibitions, special events, and educational programs that cater to the general public, professionals in the field, and young enthusiasts. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cfafoundation.org/summer"> Summer@theCenter </a> invites children grades 3-12 into the design studio for a week of exploration in different topic areas including playgrounds, pop-up shops, neighborhoods, and the ever awe-inspiring bridges. Through site visits to some of Manhattan's most notorious exemplars, practice in to-scale drawing, hands-on building and experiments, the students start thinking differently about the features and physics of these structures that stand as the perfect combination of the functional and the aesthetic. They then apply what theyâ€™ve observed and absorbed to their own design concepts as they delve into 3D computer modeling to create bridges of their very own using SketchUp. As a result, participants' emerging passions are encouraged, nurtured, and guided. Best of all, they will forever be inspired to look up.</p>
