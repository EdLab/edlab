<p>
<a href="https://www.dothedata.com/">DoTheData</a> helps teachers <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8259">collect data, track progress, and report results</a>. The site was created by a special education teacher and a speech pathologist who were frustrated by the limitations of paper-based data. In need of a solution, the two decided to solve this problem themselves.  DoTheData allows teachers to input data, not only on what a student is learning, but also how they have learned the material. The ability to record learning methods is an interesting aspect of the site. For instance, teachers can record if a student learns how to count to 10 independently, with a verbal or visual prompt, or with physical assistance. Teachers can also report if students refused to learn or failed to learn. The platform provides a visualization of the data collected and can export this data to a pdf for easy distribution to parents.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>DoTheData tracks how a student has learned a concept or fact, which is a more valuable piece of data than just knowing how many questions a student answers correctly on an exam. When users first sign in, the default goals and activities fall mostly under math and reading, but users can add their own learning goals and the activities performed in class to reach the learning goal. For each activity, users can define a list of ways that students learn the material and record the action when students exhibit a learning behavior in class. Users can also customize how they will input the data, whether by checklist, dropdown list, multiple choice, or scale.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Teachers can only view data for one student at a time, and the platform in general focuses the learning progress of each individual student as the system was made to be used in <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/positive/learning/iep.html">individualized education programs (IEP)</a>. If there was a way to compare the learning progress of multiple students at a time it could help inspire teachers to experiment with teaching strategies such as pairing stronger students with weaker ones for <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/201">peer-to-peer learning</a>.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Most other data input tools limit how users can input and report their data. DoTheData opens a variety of data possibilities by giving users full ownership of their data-recording preferences. Teachers can record how students learn certain concepts and possibly understand how they learn in order to adjust their teaching to individual <a href="http://www.learningrx.com/types-of-learning-styles-faq.htm">learning styles</a>. The creators of the site say that the platform was created to help special needs teachers collect learning data for themselves and report to parents. With the customization options available DoTheData is a learning data platform that could help teachers across many other disciplines as well.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>DoTheData gives teachers full control of their learning data needs.</p>
