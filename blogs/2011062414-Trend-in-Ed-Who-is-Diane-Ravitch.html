          <p>
            In our first podcast, Skanda and I briefly discussed the education policy expert Diane Ravitch and her mercurial views.  For those of you unfamiliar with the reference, Dana Goldstein, the popular education reporter and blogger, has a <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/41083/diane-ravitch-the-anti-rhee/full/">profile of Ravitch</a> up today on the Washington City Paper.   Although an early advocate of charter schools and standardized testing, Diane Ravitch “around 2006,” writes Dana Goldstein “now believes that the “corporatist agenda” of school choice, teacher layoffs, and standardized testing has undermined public respect for one of the nation's most vital institutions, the neighborhood school, and for one of society's most crucial professions: teaching.” 
<!--break-->
The sprawling profile helps illuminate Ravitch's unique political career, which has seen her seesaw several times from left to right, and right to left.  Goldstein places her in the “”disillusioned independent liberal” camp, like Jane Jacobs, an obvious influence, but from reading this profile I have a different impression.  She is quite obviously a political animal, with enormous energy for activism and intellectual combat (sending out, Goldstein writes, 58 combative tweets per day on education policy), I don't see anything behind her career more complicated than a strong contrarian streak.  This is not to say, of course, that her current policy views are wrong, but she does seem to generally try to move against ideas with momentum.

Goldstein, as a journalist, doesn't seem too interested in Ravitch's original research, which has taken up the majority of her career.  Although I'm not familiar with her work, I'm surprised that the several books she's written on the history of education in America are given no relevance to the current phase of her career.  I'm going to check them out this weekend, but in the meantime, if anybody has read her books I'd be interested in hearing what they're like.

(As an aside, I had assumed that Jonathan Alter's <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-03/don-t-believe-critics-education-reform-works-jonathan-alter.html
">characterization of Ravitch</a>: “the education world's very own Whittaker Chambers,” was merely descriptive of her very public change of heart, but he shows up in the comments section of Goldstein's article to inform us that he meant it as an insult.  I thought the Venona decrypts had generally washed away any lingering doubts about Chambers' post-espionage career, and firmly cemented his reputation as a good guy.)
