          <p>
            A couple of weeks ago, Stephen posted a blog about how two friends used <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2601">Facebook to crack a burglary case.</a> Though Stephen saw it simply as more evidence of “Facebook hype,” it seems that social networking sites and crime fighting are becoming a perfect match. 

According to a recent article on <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1891061-1,00.html">Time.com</a>, there are a growing number of police departments across the nation using social networking sites such as Twitter as another tool in their fight against crime. Twitter allows its users to send text-message “tweets” to a mass audience in 140 characters or less and these “tweets” can be read either online or through a mobile device. 

Some police departments also use Twitter to report traffic, crime prevention tips and offer reasons why police patrol certain neighborhoods. Other departments encourage users to tip them about bomb threats and fires, among others. Users who are followers of a particular police department's page receive tweets when a situation arises, though non-users are also able to see the updates.  

The drawback to police departments using social networking sites is that such sites are open to the general public, so anyone, especially criminals, can create a bogus account and send false tweets to divert police attention away from a real crime. This threat, however minimal it has thus proven to be, doesn't seem to concern many police departments who have far praised the use of Twitter and similar sites as an avenue for reaching a mass audience with just one message. Even the FBI is experimenting with its own Twitter page, though it doesn't send tweets to followers nor accept tips about fugitives.

Is social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook a useful and safe way to fight crime?
