          <p>
            As is the case here in the US, the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/does-the-uk-really-need-more-engineers/2011723.article">UK is also suffering from a shortage in science and engineering graduates</a>. This shortage has taken on added importance since its economy has started to grow following the global recession. A report by the Royal Academy of Engineering several years ago noted that the UK would need about 100,000 graduates in STEM related areas by 2020. The government, fully aware of the shortage, has vowed to take steps to remedy the situation. It is also worth noting that a lot of STEM graduates remain unemployed six months after graduation. There are some critics who have argued that there is not really a STEM shortage in the UK. 

It seems STEM jobs are on the rise on both sides of the Atlantic. There seems to also be a shortage of skilled employees to fill these jobs. I am concerned about this troubling trend, especially since STEM continues to be one of the few sectors that continue to grow and produce jobs for recent college graduates. 

What are some ways governments and schools better prepare students to take on these jobs after graduation?
