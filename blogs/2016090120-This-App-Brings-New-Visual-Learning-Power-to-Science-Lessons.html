<p>Almost every student remembers putting together mini styrofoam balls with hanger wires to recreate the solar system, a project that was often the highlight of science class because it gave students a chance to model the topic they were trying to grasp. But what if they could have a similar experience all year? <a href="https://www.lifeliqe.com">Lifeliqe</a>, a new app, could make that possible. 
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Lifeliqe capitalizes on the power of visual learning by giving students and teachers the opportunity to explore thousands of 3D models covering everything from the inside of a cell, to the skeletal system of a shark, to historical sites like Stonehenge. </p>
 
<p>This product serves as an assistant to both students and teachers. Its user-friendly interface allows for even less tech savvy instructors to easily navigate the platform and understand its functionality. The sheer number of models on the app allows for its daily use on a variety of subjects and subtopics. Though the majority of the models focus on science, technology, and mathematics, some cover the arts and culture as well, allowing for interdisciplinary learning opportunities. This product, with its ability to focus, highlight, and extract even the smallest parts of a cell membrane or Matisse painting, makes it easy for teachers to create visual learning experiences, truly bringing the subject matter to life. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> Details and functionality vary greatly between the models, so it takes a bit of time to learn each of their limits. In addition, some functions and subject material require additional in-app purchases to access.</p>
 
<p>It is important for educators to know that this product is better served as a supplement to classroom learning tools and not as the primary form of instruction; although the 3D images are labeled, individual terms are often left undefined. For instance, although users can see the mitochondria, the app doesn’t describe its function in the cell. Often where there are descriptions, the wording can be either too dense or too light for students as the product does not cater to a specific age group.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>With many iPads collecting dust in the back of classrooms, this app allows for easy integration into daily lesson plans. Though this probably won’t replace the epic styrofoam ball solar system experience, its potential to add a similar visual impact to daily lessons will surely take understanding to the next level. </p>
