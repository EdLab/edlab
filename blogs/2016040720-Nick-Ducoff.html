As VP for New Ventures of the <a href="http://bit.ly/1oxcT5l">Northeastern University Global Network</a>, Nick Ducoff leads a cross-functional team to incubate new business ideas, diversify revenue streams, and advance a new model of higher education. Previously at <a href="http://bit.ly/1LkXOsr">Boundless</a>, Ducoff led the content team, HR and legal functions, and affiliate and field marketing teams. Boundless was acquired by Valore in 2015. Ducoff's first venture-backed startup was <a href="http://bit.ly/1PrpUpE">Infochimps</a>, where he led the company as its initial CEO, raising venture capital, and growing the team and business during the company's formative years. After graduating from The University of Texas School of Law with Honors, Ducoff was a corporate and securities attorney at a leading international law firm. Ducoff is a Techstars mentor, venture capital LP, and angel investor in Panorama Education and 11 other venture-backed startups.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>Our <a href="http://bit.ly/1PHxI4L">Level</a> data analytics bootcamp was inspired by two streams of prior experience: building a big data enterprise with Infochimps (which was acquired by CSC) and developing high quality education content with Boundless (which was acquired by Valore). Analytics is quickly becoming a core competency in the new economy and there's enormous employer demand for these skills. Level incorporates Northeastern's experiential DNA which is in my blood after nearly two years here.</p>

<p>My own educational background is a mix of liberal arts, business, law, and a lot of self-teaching. I read approximately a book a week. I believe people can accomplish a lot in short order if they are committed to it. For a two month intensive program like Level, you have to have a certain amount of commitment that is probably higher than a more traditionally paced program.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>While Level's current state is a two month full-time data analytics program, its future state will be stackable programs of varying lengths and depths—online, offline, and hybrid—across disciplines where students can develop advanced skills and competencies, and earn university credentials (e.g., a master's). We're decoupling learning from credentials but then allowing those skills and competencies to be recombined into larger knowledge frameworks <i>and</i> degrees. We want to make higher education more accessible, personalized, and flexible, while still providing credentials that employers recognize and value.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>We're living and working longer yet most people only learn formally after secondary school once, for four years when they are 18. Also, maybe they are provided training and learning and development opportunities on the job, and/or return to graduate school for a year or two in their twenties or early thirties. I don't think that makes sense. I think people should be continuously acquiring new skills and competencies in a format that works for them and fits into their lifestyle. This is probably through a combination of frequent online/mobile microlearning (e.g., Lynda) and formal education in shorter bursts every year or two throughout one's career (e.g., Level).</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>

<p>We're all-in on Level and are excited to expand it online in new geographies, to new disciplines, and in a variety of formats. We're looking forward to deepening our engagement and relationships with the dozens of employers participating in the program such as Starbucks and Humana, including as a learning and development partner.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I am on <a href="http://bit.ly/1QbIKP5">Twitter</a>. I follow people on all seven continents and from as many different perspectives as possible. They include:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/1SLIsFp">Danielle Morrill</a> for startups and Silicon Valley. 
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/1TWVEGz">Adrian Hon</a> for science and humor (UK-based). 
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/1WhLrmF">Yinka Adegoke</a> writes for an African perspective. 
<li>I've got to put a plug in for <a href="http://bit.ly/1KfE2n9">Joseph Aoun</a> for all things Northeastern.
</ul>
