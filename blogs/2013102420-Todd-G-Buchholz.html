<a href="http://www.toddbuchholz.com/">Todd G. Buchholz</a> has worn many hats, from economist and White House director of economic policy to managing director of the ground-breaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Management">Tiger hedge fund</a>.  Beyond his work in economics and finance, Buchholz is also an award-winning learning innovator and co-founder and CEO of educational software company, <a href="http://www.sproglit.com/">Sproglit, LLC.</a>  Sproglit recently released <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/math-arrow-kyle-counts/id638050645"><i>Kyle Counts</i></a>, a math app aimed at primary-grade learners that utilizes Buchholz’s pioneering "<a href="http://www.sproglit.com/math-arrow">Math Arrow,</a>" a "matrix designed to make the relationship among numbers more intuitive and to enhance the learning of mathematical functions."  Buchholz’s work has not gone unrecognized by the education community and he was awarded the Allyn Young Teaching Prize by the Harvard University Department of Economics.  In addition to contributing frequently to the media discourse surrounding the issues of political economy, financial markets, business and culture on major television networks, Buchholz has also published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Todd-G.-Buchholz/e/B000APT2BI">numerous award-winning books</a> that have been translated globally.  Beyond commentating, Buchholz was named "One of the Top 21 Speakers of the 21st Century" by Successful Meetings magazine and is a founding producer of the Broadway show <a href="http://www.jerseyboysinfo.com/">Jersey Boys</a>.  Buchholz holds advanced degrees in economics and law from Harvard University and Cambridge University, where he has served as a Fellow.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>   I was lucky to have a wonderful fifth grade teacher named Ray Sneden (in Toms River, New Jersey) who was as fascinated with sports and sports statistics as I was.  Each Friday in the fall, we exchanged our weekly football picks, including the point spread.  I’m not sure the official state curriculum included a study of betting odds, but they made me appreciate probability theory!  Years later while teaching economics at Harvard and serving as a Fellow at Cambridge University, I noticed that many highly intelligent people simply lacked "number sense."  Graduate students in law and the liberal arts would actually boast about how bad they were at math:  "Oh, don’t ask me to figure out the waiter’s tip!"  Of course, graduate students in math and science would sometimes brag that they couldn’t solve the easiest crossword puzzle.  There’s a joke in Cambridge, Massachusetts about the student who tosses 20 items onto the supermarket’s "10 items or less" express checkout lane.  The cashier asks, "What’s wrong with you?  Are you from Harvard and can’t count-- or MIT and can’t read?"  But lacking basic skills is no joke.  During the Great Recession, nearly one in five homebuyers with poor math skills lost their homes in foreclosure.  With the Math Arrow invention, children (and adults!) can develop a much better grasp of numerical relationships.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’ve been fortunate to serve as a White House economic adviser and to win a teaching prize at Harvard, and so I’ve seen how poor math skills can hurt the entire country!  Last year in the Wall Street Journal I argued that the U.S. Treasury could save future taxpayers billions of dollars by issuing 50 or 100-year bonds and locking in last year’s incredibly low interest rates.   So far they haven’t listened.  Someday my kids will pay the price for this financial illiteracy and innumeracy.
<p>
Apart from my public policy experience, volunteering in the classrooms of my three daughters spurred me to dive deep into elementary school education.  On the walls of the classrooms I saw number lines; on the counters I saw flashcards; and on the computer screens I found math programs that "drill and kill."  Of course, all of these tools can be helpful.  But many children are visual learners.  To those kids a stack of flashcards and a number line look like a never-ending jumble of numerals.  The Math Arrow presents numbers in a visual way so that kids develop intuition about patterns.  Even small children can see how every number from 1-99 has a complement that adds to 100.  At Sproglit, we’re developing app games that do not stress drilling – instead they instill in kids a better grasp of numbers.  We were especially pleased when researchers at BYU reported that playing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/math-arrow-kyle-counts/id638050645"><i>Kyle Counts</i></a> for just one hour a day raised test scores by 7-11% in just a week.  A highlight of my professional career came when Marty Cooper, inventor of the cell phone, declared the Math Arrow "ingenious." 	
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> The Math Arrow has the potential to transform elementary education by allowing kids to visualize numbers from 0-100.  David Noah, managing director of the Success Academy Charter Schools in New York called it "the next generation of the 100’s chart.  There’s nothing else like it."  We watched kindergarten kids in their school on 140th Street in Harlem play <i>Kyle Counts</i> and successfully count by 8’s.  When they completed a round, they hugged each other!  I don’t remember counting by 8’s when I was in kindergarten (though I do remember a kid named Donny hitting me in the head with a truck).  I encourage teachers and parents to download the free teacher’s guide at <a href="http://www.sproglit.com">www.sproglit.com</a>.  I suspect that the Math Arrow may be especially helpful for girls, since neuroscientists tell us that female brains tend to navigate by recognizing landmarks.  The design of the Math Arrow provides signposts as it zig-zags by 5’s.    

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We know that teachers matter a great deal.  The difference between a mediocre teacher and a great teacher can literally change a student’s future standard of living.  Parents will no longer settle for mediocrity.  Hardly anyone chooses a one-night stay at a hotel without checking TripAdvisor.  When I was a kid, when we hopped in the car, we were content to listen to one of a few radio stations.  Now our kids expect on-demand excellence 24/7.  Are they spoiled?  Sure, there’s a negative side to this rampant consumer sovereignty, but that’s nothing compared with the suffering of children stuck with lousy teachers. 
<p> 
After years of cutbacks to music programs, we may see a renewed focus on the value of the arts, including the performing arts.  For years we’ve known of a relationship between musical learning and math.  But I’m sure that I honed my writing skills by learning musical lyrics, too.  Cole Porter and Lorenz Hart helped me appreciate T.S. Eliot.  You could take the score and choreography of, say, <i>West Side Story</i> and teach a master class on literature, the mathematics of music, the physics of dance and acoustics, and also the social dynamics of race.  Right now, with my daughter Victoria I’m writing a musical called <i>Glory Ride</i>, which takes place in fascist Italy.  We’re telling producers it’s like "Les Mis meets Oceans Eleven," filled with soaring music and witty intrigue.  My younger daughters Katherine and Alexia are helping with choreography and costume ideas.            
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am working with my partners to develop more games based on the Math Arrow.  Our first games are focused on addition and subtraction (<i>Kyle Counts</i> and <i>Kira Counts Back</i>).  But the Math Arrow also lends itself to learning multiplication, geometry and distance word problems.  So next year we’ll unveil <i>Kira Travels</i> and <i>Shape Up Kyle</i>.  For most children, word problems are like a dream-sequence in a movie where the director smears Vaseline on the lens and nothing makes sense anymore.  We aim to clean that cloudy lens!
