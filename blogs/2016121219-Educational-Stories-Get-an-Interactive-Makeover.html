<p>SmartyPal does two things: its online platform helps users transform passive content into interactive stories, and its app showcases a selection of these educational stories ready to be tapped and swiped by young children. While educators might want to check out <a href="http://smartypal.com/#technology">SmartyPal’s content creation opportunities</a>, this review will focus on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartypal-educational-stories/id934497478?mt=8">SmartyPal app.</a>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>SmartyPal features a collection of animated, interactive stories created by different sources. Aimed at children from Pre–K to 2nd grade, SmartyPal has three categories of stories: STEM, Critical Thinking, and Social-Emotional. Each story is laid out page-by-page with text, pictures, and accompanying audio. Guided activities with the characters are interspersed among the pages, prompting children to piece together simple puzzles, find the United States on a world map, and match butterfly wings, to name a few. Because SmartyPal’s interactive activities are backed by educational research data, they’re engaging and challenging to young children while teaching them specific skills. Users can also jump from page to page if they want to change categories.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While SmartyPal’s stories are interactive, some of them could be too lengthy for young children, taking more than 30 minutes to fully complete. In addition, because the stories come from different sources, the quality of animation and audio differs significantly. While some stories are almost short movies, others are quite text-heavy, which could make it difficult for young ones to stay engaged. In addition, although there are a few free stories, most cost $2.99.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>SmartyPal provides a data-backed interactive story experience for young children that gets them to practice specific skills through puzzles dispersed among the digital pages. With topics ranging from zoos to NYC, the educational stories in SmartyPal are bound to keep children engaged as they listen and learn. It could be a particularly fun activity for road trips or pre-bed story time.</p>
