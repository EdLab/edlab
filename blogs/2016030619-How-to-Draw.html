<p>An epic journey starts with a simple step. A visual masterpiece has a similar path, beginning with a sketch made by the strokes of a stylus. Colored pencils, pastels, and brushes can later fill in the remaining empty white space with luminous colors, breathing life into a simple canvas. With color, two dimensions seem to stretch into three, and our own world becomes a little more complete when our creations are filled in. The app 
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/how-to-draw-free-drawing-lessons/id450408442?mt=8
">How to Draw</a> helps interested novices develop their artistic skills and feeds the love of illustration. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>How to Draw helps users learn the art of drawing through instructional videos. It can teach you about a broad slate of visual elements—buildings, body parts, stick figures, graffiti letters, insects, and even cartoon characters like Pokemon and Bart Simpson.</p>

<p>More advanced techniques are included too, such as general pencil drawing techniques, like creating spheres, hatching, cross-hatching, and perspective. As such, the app can help you grow as an artist. How to Draw focuses less on age and more on ability. Essentially, it is meritocratic in the way the app has been assembled. Just search for a lesson that fits your ability. Due to the varying complexity of these instructional videos, How to Draw’s age range spans from kids to adults. As long as you are interested in drawing, you should be able to find something engaging in its many videos. </p>
 
<p>The user interface is clean and appealing. Videos appear in the sweet spot, right in the middle of your screen. The navigation is straightforward—there is a carousel at the bottom with titled icons summarizing the lesson’s content. Just double-click and the accompanying video launches. If you have been eager to learn drawing as a skill, there’s no longer an excuse to procrastinate. With How to Draw, it's time to get your draw on! </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>If you choose to learn with How to Draw, just make sure you like watching videos. And I mean  <i>really</i> like watching videos. The app is basically Lynda.com for drawing—a slate of video tutorials regarding different aspects of drawing. As such, if you want to actually draw while learning with this app, you need to have a second device handy. In short, you watch How to Draw on one device, and draw on another, which some users may find inconvenient. </p>

<p>How to Draw has many video tutorials in its library—from my count, almost 40. However, depending on your interests, you may run out more quickly than others. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>How to Draw is a great app that can help you rekindle your love of drawing or inspire new appreciation for an old art form. Just make sure to bring a second device with a large interface if possible so you don’t constrain your creativity! </p>
