            Finding what you need at the library can be overwhelming. Each library is unique with its own cataloging system, search engines, and other tools. Here is a quick and easy guide for how to search for books at the <strong>Gottesman Libraries</strong> using our website.

First, begin at the Gottesman Libraries <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/">homepage</a>. Be sure to choose "<strong>TC Catalog (EDUCAT)</strong>" instead of "<strong>CU Catalog (CLIO)</strong>". The CU catalog will search all of Columbia's libraries except for Teachers College and Columbia University Law School (Pegasus).
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2012/11/libhomepage2.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17575 aligncenter" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/11/libhomepage2.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" /></a></p>
If you are just browsing by subject, click "Keyword" or "Subject". If you know the author, call number, or title of the book that you want, search using those tabs.

Library books have various locations and privileges of use. If the location of a book says <strong>MAIN</strong>, it is located in the stacks, on one of the five floors of the library. It is available to be read in the library or checked out by students and staff members. If the location says <strong>RESERVE</strong>, it is available to be checked out for two hours at a time, and is located behind the front desk on the first floor. Reserve books may be taken out of the building when checked out, and can be renewed for an additional two hours.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/11/mainreserveshot1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17565 aligncenter" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/11/mainreserveshot1.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" /></a></p>
Books whose locations are described as <strong>CURR</strong>, <strong>JUV</strong>, <strong>NEW</strong> <strong>FACULTY</strong>, and <strong>TCANA</strong> are available to be checked out just like main library books, but are located on the shelves in the reading rooms.  There is a directory for where each of these types of books are located at the front desk. <strong>CURR </strong>and <strong>JUV </strong>are children's books and are located in the second floor reading room. <strong>TCANA </strong>and <strong>NEW FACULTY </strong>books are written by TC graduates and are located in the third floor reading room.  <strong>OVERSIZE </strong>books are in the second floor stacks<strong>. REFERENCE </strong>books are for library use only, and are located on the first floor reading room-these are not behind the desk like reserve books, but are in their own stacks by the computers. If a book is in <strong>CLOSED STACKS</strong>, it must be retrieved by a librarian from the archives.  There will be a link next to the book's call number for this to be requested.

To see if a book is available, look at the box under <strong>STATUS</strong>.  If a book is available, the box will be blank.  If a book is checked out, the status will reveal the due date of that book. If the status says <strong>HOLDSHELF</strong>, it means the book was put on hold by a patron. If the status says <strong>BILLED &amp; NOT PAID</strong>, it means the book has been checked out past its due date by a patron, and they have been notified that the book is overdue.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/11/dueshot.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17568 aligncenter" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/11/dueshot.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/11/holdshelfshot2.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17576 aligncenter" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/11/holdshelfshot2.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" /></a></p>
To request a book that is checked-out, you click <strong>RECALL </strong>at the top of the page, and enter the information required.  When the book is returned by the patron, you will receive an email notifying you that it is on the hold-shelf under your name.

I hope that this tutorial has clarified some questions about library searching, and that it will continue to be a guide to those not sure where to start.  Happy searching!
