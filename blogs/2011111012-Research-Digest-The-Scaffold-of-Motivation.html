It would seem that times have never been better for the independent learner.  The variety of educational resources available, their accessibility, their breadth and depth; everything is working your favor.  And yet, I don't see much of that going on.  There are plenty of people lining up to help you learn on your own, but few people who actually end up learning on their own.  I myself take up and abandon such projects with a depressing regularity.  The missing element seems to be the social context, which acts as a scaffold for individual effort.  An article from the TC Record explains.

<b>Description</b>:
The issue as they define it is one of “regulation of motivation,” a category for all the tools people use to manage engagement and effort.  Fairly early we learn that self-regulation is intimately involved with the social context.  Not only do teacher, parent, and community supervision and encouragement help students self-regulate, but internally generated strategies of self-regulation also often require a social context to succeed.  For example, in Bernard Malamud's “A Summer's Reading,” a young, un-motivated high-school dropout living off his sister's paychecks happens one day to mention to the neighborhood grocer that he plans to read 100 books over the summer, and this despite the fact that he didn't particularly like reading books, and wasn't really planning on readying any.  But as word gets out, he finds himself more respected in the neighborhood, and the pressure of social expectations gradually builds upon him.  When fall arrives, we find him in the library, counting off a hundred books and pulling the first off the shelf.

Every example of self-regulation they cite seems to make use of the social context. “In these models,” they conclude, “the novice or learner can actively recruit assistance and shape the support given from those more expert in the community.” Although the effect does not seem to generally be as drastic as in Malamud's story, the principle is the same.  It is very unlikely that the young protagonist, beginning in an unmotivated state, could find some way to motivate himself without the help of a community.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
Given the dependence of self-regulation on social context as outlined by this paper, it seems to me there's an empty niche in the Internet education world for a platform that can make public and social the solitary user's engagement with learning materials.
