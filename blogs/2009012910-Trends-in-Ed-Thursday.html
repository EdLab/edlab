            "Trends in Ed" is the newest CSG product, connecting you to the ever-expanding world of teaching and learning. I'll be bringing you daily updates, so make sure to keep checking in. Onward to today's installment of the latest happenings in ed!

<b>MIT is makin moves!</b>
Gone are the days of massive introductory physics lectures at MIT: enter an era of collaborative, hands-on learning!  The new approach is in reaction to a call made by physicists nationwide for universities to be more effective in how they teach the subject.  Initially protested by students, MIT's plan for smaller classes was made a permanent decision last fall. Already it has seen success: attendance is up and the failure rate dropped more than 50 percent.  The approach is known as TEAL, or Technology Enhanced Active Learning.  So far, only intro physics classes at MIT are using this approach but other schools are following suit with similar plans. These schools include Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, North Carolina State University, University of Maryland, and Harvard. 

<b>Women scientists get a morale boost from the new Obama administration</b>

For people who have wanted to see more women in science, the new Obama administration may be their best bet to achieve this.   The president has shown interest in using science to alleviate some of the country's economic and environmental issues.  It has also been suggested that Obama appoint a woman to the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.  The question of gender inequalities throughout the science profession (particularly physics) has been asked for years, and yet it is still difficult to pinpoint any definitive answers.  Researchers suggest that President Obama sign an executive order that would allow for more family leave and parental benefits for those receiving federal grants, a large amount of whom are research scientists. Many hope that Obama's newly vested interest in the sciences combined with a growing popular opinion that “geek is chic” will help propel women into the science field in greater numbers than ever. 

<b>More on the Rose Art Museum</b>

In a follow-up to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2374">yesterday's</a> story on the Brandeis University Rose Art Museum, NPR brings to life the opinions of a displeased art collector, who disagrees with the university's decision.  The art collector is David Genser, who donated a print by James Rosenquist to the museum. Genser is not alone in his unhappiness.  The president of Brandeis, Jehuda Reinharz, argues that the university's endowment has lost a great deal of its value and has a deficit of $10 million.  While Genser can sympathize with the university's struggle, he urges the it to consider ways in which the collection can be saved. In response, President Reinharz assures that the entire collection is not up for sale.  He hopes that the economy improves so that they will not have to sell anything.  Reinharz is concerned about the losses to the endowment (so far the university has seen a 25% loss).  Reinharz asserts that the university is putting the welfare of students in the forward.  When asked about his thoughts on Genser's dissatisfaction, Reinahrz told of receiving a call from the donator of a seven-figure Warhol painting who told him, “Look, if you have to sell it, sell it. It's more important to keep the first rate faculty in tact. It's more important to give scholarships to students than to keep this work of art, as great as it is.”  The Rose Art Museum collection is appraised at around $350 million.  


<b>Fuhrman and educational accountability</b>

Teachers College Presdient Susan Fuhrman has been named a co-chair for the Roundtable on Edcuation Systems and Accountability (RESA). RESA was created as the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act is being prepared for reauthorization.  The purpose of RESA is to get "federal and state officials, education policymakers and constituency representatives, and education researchers" to talk about issues of educational accountability. Examples of discussions that may take place relate to preparing high school graduates for college or work, studying the effects of standard-based reform on teaching effectiveness, and ways in which to inspire schools to increase quality and achievement. Fuhrman is no stranger to research on accountability as she has devoted much of her professional career to the study of the subject
