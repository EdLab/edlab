            <strong>Title</strong>: Imaginary Windows, Issue #4
<strong>Author</strong>: Erin Fae
<strong>Where to find it</strong>: Barnard Library
<strong>Call number</strong>: ZINES F33i no.4

I’ll hold this, then you’ll hold this.

I encountered the most lovely zine at the Barnard Library zine collection last week: a zine called <em>imaginary windows</em> by  a Brooklyn resident named Erin Fae.  I picked it up because of its  curious cover: a young woman wearing a dress from another century stands  next to some shrubbery in a yard; what is she doing there?  The background behind the  photograph appears to be a photocopied table cloth, the kind of  thing my grandmother might have liked. The image itself has an old feel  to it, and yet, it seems to be a photo of the author (unclear), who wrote the zine in 2008.  What’s going on?

That’s  why I checked out the zine, but the reason I love it is because she  describes her life's activities so thoughtfully and with a different  insight than most. For one thing, she loves antique clothing resembling  the Victorian era--layers and layers of petticoats and bloomers. And  more intriguingly she describes carefully constructing her intended high  femme look while also riding her beloved bike around town--how can she  make sure she doesn’t get her dresses stuck in the spokes while flying  across the Brooklyn bridge? She also discusses the changes to her body  as she becomes stronger while riding her bike, and how annoying she  finds being read as straight because of her stylistic choices.

And  so I was already sold on the zine when I arrived at the best part: her  analysis of her own personal favorite phrase, “I’ll hold this, then  you’ll hold this.”  Fae intentionally writes a paper zine in a digital  era.  She says, “It’s important to me to make art that is tactile, that  people can hold.” (p40) But her phrase also describes her relationship  with her home, and her favorite city, which is Brooklyn.  “Our memory  traces the changing maps of this city. Ten years from now, someone else  will live here, hold this place sacred, build a newer map traced with  tales and woes. They’ll keep the city safe, I’ll keep the city safe.  They are two cities, one city, all the same. I’ll hold this then you’ll  hold this.” (p37)

It  reminds me of a night some friends and I hung out in a bar and all told  our "moving to New York stories."  The following weekend, I had the same  conversation with a different set of friends. Over and over again we  tell these stories: <em>how was it when you moved here? For me it was like  this.</em> And years later when I walk by a part of the city I once  traversed often, but now never do, those original memories rise to the  surface. The map of my memories superimposed on the city’s map keeps  getting denser, but it never occurred to me to describe the city as a  place that changes hands.

It’s  hard to read this zine without feeling conscious of it’s fragile-seeming  existence, these tiny slips of paper photocopied long ago, and now  floating around my backpack. When I return it to the library, who will  hold it next?
