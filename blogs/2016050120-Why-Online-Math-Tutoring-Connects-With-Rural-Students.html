<p>Tutoring is on the rise now more than ever, but for many students, in-person lessons aren’t feasible. This is especially true in rural areas, where students, parents, and schools alike are turning to online tutoring for extra help.</p>

<p>A recent study sought to examine the effectiveness of online math tutoring for middle school students in rural areas. Two schools, one in Virginia and the other in Kansas, hosted private online tutoring sessions for students who had failed their most recent standardized math tests. Students attended sessions twice a week for twenty weeks and averaged about thirty minutes per session.</p>
 
<p>The study focused on one particular tutoring company called Focus Education that prizes the level of interaction it incorporates into teaching sessions. Each lesson was one-on-one, and the online interface allowed for video chat, instant messaging, virtual whiteboard technology, and shared screen capacities, which allowed both parties to see the same practice problems and visuals. Even though tutors taught their students from a distance, Focus Education’s online features still allowed for an intimate and interactive tutoring experience.</p>
 
<p>The results were clear: online math tutoring was a success. Students showed significant improvements on test scores and gave overwhelmingly positive feedback on their tutoring sessions. Interestingly, students were actually pulled out of their math classes one-by-one during the school day for their online sessions. Even though they missed part of their regular classes, the individual lessons still improved their academic performance.</p>

<p>This study is important because it shows that online math tutoring can lead to significant improvements in the subject. Undoubtedly, part of that success relies on the interactivity of Focus Education’s online system. Although students living in rural areas might miss out on in-person tutoring opportunities, this study shows that online lessons can still be effective, rigorous, and enjoyable.</p>
