<p><a href="http://www.originatorkids.com/?p=1008">MathTango</a> is the newest app launched by Originator, Inc., and aims to make learning addition and subtraction truly fun for kids ages six to nine. Combining classroom-tested math puzzles with aspects of world-building games, MathTango has kids complete math missions in order to build and populate their own personal island. The first three missions of the game are free, with an in-app purchase of $6.99 to access all 24 missions. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The concept of using a world-building game to teach students basic math concepts is very clever. Especially for children suffering from <a href="http://www.originatorkids.com/?p=1008"> math anxiety</a>, MathTango provides a non-competitive, untimed, gamified way of developing skills in this area. This relaxed, creative atmosphere also allows for a more individualized experience; after being given an island to care for and populate with cheerful, dancing monster inhabitants, players earn golden doubloons that they may spend on whatever they’d like to enhance the experience of their monsters. Additionally, players are more likely to feel motivated to complete math problems with the sense of ownership that comes from being in charge of their own island. </p>

<p>Players also complete a checklist of missions corresponding to a level that 
features repetitions of the same style of problem-solving puzzle. Each level has its own type of math puzzle, but incorporates iterations of puzzles from previous levels to reinforce lessons learned. The reward for landmark task and level completion is a choreographed dance performed by the player’s resident monsters to show their appreciation. While these dances are extremely silly, they are exceedingly entertaining, especially when considering the young viewership.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>The biggest problem with this game is that a player’s math skills aren’t the only competency being assessed; reading is also a critical component for properly following instructions and completing missions, and doesn’t necessarily match up with the level of math being taught. While the math skills being tested seem appropriate for the intended age range of MathTango, focusing on simple addition and subtraction in single and two-digit numbers, the reading level certainly feels like a stretch for a six- or seven-year-old. All initial instructions are spoken aloud, but they cannot be repeated, therefore requiring the player to read the text below if they are confused. More problematic, the checklist for each level’s missions are exclusively written, so if the player struggles to read what they are supposed to do, the purpose of the game is compromised.</p>

<p>I would also like to see slightly more varied and advanced math skills represented. While the game does a thorough job focusing simply on adding and subtracting one- and two-digit numbers, I think that it could become even more successful if it continued with multiplication and even division for young learners who are advancing more quickly in math.</p>
 
 <p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While this game is based on a great concept, its execution falls a bit short in the matching of math and reading skills. With more narration and an expansion of math content, it has real potential. As it is, the free version can provide several hours of entertaining math learning, so it’s certainly worth trying. </p>
