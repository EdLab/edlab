            <b>Consumer Tech in the Public Space</b>

Did you know that there was a federal post titled Chief Information Officer? I didn't and well, it's there now: the US's first CIO appointed by President Obama.  Last Thursday, <a href=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/white-house-names-first-chief-information-officer/?scp=1&sq=Vivek%20Kundra&st=cse>Vivek Kundra,</a> the former CTO for the District of Columbia was selected to drive innovation by leveraging technology at the federal level.  He is reportedly <a href=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/danielle-sacks/ad-verse-effect/who-does-obamas-new-cio-love-most-google-microsoft-or-apple>“Google-apps-maps-obsessed, cloud-computing, open source finding, crowd sourcing, Apple zealot.”</a> With such a proponent of ‘digitizing the public square' in the office, it's expected that our government is looking to make a dramatic change in the way information is shared between agencies and the public. 

Co-creating, sharing, and meshing things is something that many of us do in our daily lives.  From the small, classroom-level to the larger college or corporation-scale, we've been trying and applying incremental changes on our own.  What makes Kundra's post and the soon-to-be appointed federal Chief Technology Officer interesting is that web 2.0, social media, and whatever else we think are ‘user/consumer/public-created' is going to be promoted and implemented from the top.  Not sure if ‘the top-down approach' is the fitting word here, but wouldn't it be exciting to see the public school system also go through some operational changes…   

<i>I discovered that sitting in a coffee shop that I had more computing power than the average police officer in DC, the average teacher, and the average person issuing tickets. — Vivek Kundra</i>

<b>iPhone-App-a-Day</b>
If you take a full advantage of <a href=http://www.evernote.com>Evernote</a>, it'll be pretty difficult to say, Uhhh…I forget or Uhhh…I'll have to look that up when I get home.  It sounds easy and I will try it out later today.  You can create, clip, and share notes, images, or websites, among other things. Plus, you can sync all your important to miscellaneous stuff so that you can access it on any device you want online or offline.  The coolest feature I think is that you can find text within any images.  Now all my doodles and random notes on napkins can have a longer lifespan.
