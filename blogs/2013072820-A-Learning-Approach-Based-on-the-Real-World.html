What do you imagine when you think of a traditional approach to learning? Are students sitting in class and memorizing information, all to just recite it word for word on a test? In this video, a different approach, known as project-based learning, is discussed that makes learning more interactive, fun, and useful. While William H. Kilpatrick shared the <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=3606"> original project method in 1918</a>, it remains a popular topic in academic literature, as evidenced by Michael Knoll’s <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=16242">recent 2012 paper</a>, published in the Teachers College Record. 

In the same way that adults need to problem solve on a day-to-day basis, this method allows students to participate in projects that help them learn many of the necessary skills they will need later on in college and work.  This video highlights the skills "Claire" learns to use in a real-world job situation that demonstrate the important elements of project-based learning and why more students should participate in such an experience. By learning to work together to complete a project, students learn critical thinking, collaboration, and communication skills—skills that are needed in the real world that many schools do not teach. <p>

Do you think project-based learning is an approach that every school should adopt? Include your thoughts in the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9833">Vialogues</a>. <p>

<b>@01.34 dani100:</b> I like how they compared project-based learning to the problem solving process Claire had to go through in a real-life situation. <p>

<b>@02:22 sjohnson:</b> Lively discussion is always an effective way to motivate learning. <p>

<b>@02:55 dani100:</b> I like how each group was given their own freedom, so that they could choose how they would approach their project and solve the problem. <p>
