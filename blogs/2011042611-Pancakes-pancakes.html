What  does he want for breakfast? A big pancake! But first, Jack's mother  needs flour from the mill, an egg from the black hen, milk from the  spotted cow, butter churned from fresh cream, and firewood for the  stove. Will Jack ever get his pancake?

<a title="About the Author" href="http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/contributor.jsp?id=3451"><strong>About the Author</strong></a>:  Eric Carle started drawing when he was a little boy and has asserted  that he     “will never stop being a scribbler.” Born in Syracuse, New  York, in 1929, he     spent his early childhood in America before moving  to Germany at the age of     six. Carle learned German and studied at  the prestigious Academy of Visual Arts     before fulfilling his dream  of returning to the U.S. in 1952. After working     as a graphic  designer and art director of an advertising agency, Carle collaborated      with Bill Martin, Jr. on <em>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</em>,  launching     his remarkable career as a beloved children's book  illustrator. Since then Carle     has also written and illustrated many  well-known titles such as <em>The Grouchy     Ladybug and The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em>, which has been translated into     more than 30 languages.

To  create his beautiful pictures, Carle uses the technique of collage. He  loves     it when students tell him they can make pictures in the same  way! Carle first     paints over colored tissue paper with acrylic paint  — sometimes using a     wide brush, sometimes a narrow brush, sometimes  his fingertips, and often using     a sponge, burlap, or other bumpy  material like a stamp to create texture. Then     he cuts out shapes in  the colored papers (which he stores in color-coded drawers     after  they dry) to make the different parts of his scenes and characters.

Most  of Eric Carle's characters are animals, and he thinks this might be his      father's influence: when he was growing up, Carle and his dad would  go on walks     in the forest. They would stop and observe all the  little animals and insects     living there, and Carle's father would  tell him about how they live and grow.     Growth and discovery are  major themes in Carle's books. He says that moving     from home to  school was “traumatic” for him, and he hopes that his books, many     of  which are not only beautifully illustrated but have cutouts, flaps,  raised     textures, and lights and sound, are “half toy and half book”  to show young readers     that growth and change can be a lot of fun.

Carle  lives with his wife Bobbie and cat Annie in Massachusetts. He has two      grown-up children, his daughter Cirsten and son Rolf.
