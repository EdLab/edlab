          <p>
            The past two years have presented budget uncertainty to education advocates and school districts around the country. This problem is unlikely to go away as the nation faces fiscal problems as funds for programs are dying up fast. The across-the-board cuts known as <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/fiscal-face-off.html">sequestration</a> that went into effect last March are still in place. A government shut down could be in the offing as conservative Republicans are pushing to defund the president's controversial healthcare plan. 

A shutdown is likely to happen since Congress has yet to pass its spending bill for 2014, which starts on October 1. This means a continuing resolution will be put in place to fund for programs for a couple of months in order to give Congress time to work on the spending bill. But a stalemate is likely to happen since this year conservative Republicans are trying to use the current situation as an opportunity to defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, something the Democratically-controlled U.S. Senate is not likely to support.

Big Losers From Sequestration
<ul>
<li>Title I grants to districts: Loss of $725.8 million, bringing program to $13.7 billion
<li>Special education state grants: Loss of $578.9 million, bringing program to $10.9 billion
<li>Head Start: Loss of roughly $400 million, bringing program to $7.6 billion
<li>Impact Aid: Loss of $57.7 million, bringing program to $1.09 billion
</ul>
