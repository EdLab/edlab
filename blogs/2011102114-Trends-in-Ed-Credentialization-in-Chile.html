            Jack Goldstone, in his “Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World,” argues that intra-elite competition is a fundamental factor in social instability.  Surprisingly enough (considering his history is most concerned with the English Civil War and French Revolution) it turns out that credentialization is a very good measure of how much intra-elite competition there is.  When a lot of people are trying to get a university degree, that's a good sign that most members of the elite feel very insecure about their position, and are desperate to avoid downward mobility.

So when I read that Chilean students had <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/20/141572207/protesting-students-seize-chiles-senate-building">invaded</a> the country's senate this week, and occupied the building for several days, naturally the first thing I did was take a look at university enrollment.  We've talked about Chile's protests <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6335">before</a>, and it does look like there have some issues unique to their higher education system.  An unusually high percentage of educational funding comes from the students themselves, for instance, and the system is somewhat more segregated by social class than average.  But I think this chart I built (don't ask me where I got the numbers) speaks for itself:

As you can see, over the past few decades credentialization in Chile has exploded, to the point where 40% of university age (18-24) citizens are now enrolled at one institution or another.  Thus, although Chile's economy looks pretty strong, it is perhaps not at the moment capable of absorbing the vast numbers of elite aspirants that are moving through the system, which is experienced by Chileans as systemic inequality and governmental dysfunction.
