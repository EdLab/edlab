            What if you had a K-12 school where students decided  the curriculum and their own schedule? A school where comic book making is offered but calculus is not? A school where you are not denied enrollment even if you can't afford the hefty annual tuition? 

For most students, the idea of dictating and directing their own education in the classroom is usually just a fantasy. Then there are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/nyregion/05bigcity.html?_r=1&ref=education">those students at Manhattan Free School in East Harlem</a> who essentially direct their own education. The school, launched in 2008, runs on the belief that students learn best when they direct their own education, as their enthusiasm will push them to learn those subjects they feel very passionate about.  There is a similar school in Brooklyn aptly called the Brooklyn Free School. The order of the day, and the direction of the school for that matter, is debated and voted on by the school's only two faculty members and students. 

Though it differs from the normal school structure, the Manhattan Free School is heavily priced at $15,000 per year for every student. Most of the students struggle to pay the entire fee with 25% paying $1,500 and the rest paying $3,000. As a result of the its limited budget, the school is heavily reliant on volunteers and parents. In a highly competitive area where most parents are paying through the roof at exclusive <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4893">private schools in Manhattan</a>, the Manhattan Free School offers parents and teachers an alternative approach to learning and places the responsibility of learning firmly in the hands of the students.
