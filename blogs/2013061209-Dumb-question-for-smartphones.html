            but how do I use them in the classroom?


As an ESL teacher, I don't have any difficulty discovering new mobile apps for language learning -- some of them awesome, some of them meh, and many of them ideal for classroom use. The problem is integrating them in environments that are not entirely tech friendly. 

There are so many posts about <a href="http://www.edudemic.com/2013/06/why-mobile-learning-is-inevitable/">why mobile learning is inevitable</a>, but far fewer conversations about how to overcome the obstacles along the way: How do you convince administrators of the value of tech integration? How do you offer adequate support for teachers and students? What codes of conduct and usage are effective?

According to a <a href="http://www.tomorrow.org/speakup/pr/SU12_June_PR.html">study</a> released by Project Tomorrow, a California non-profit focused on supporting innovative tech in schools, many schools are still hashing out these problems. Of the high school students surveyed:
<ul>
<li>Half weren't allowed to use their smartphones</li>
<li>Only 18% were allowed to use their personal laptop in school</li>
<li>Only 9% were allowed to use their tablet</li>
</ul>
And <a href="http://edtechdigest.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/trends-student-cellphone-learning/">here</a> is a graph showing how students use their cell phones according to a recent Pew poll of teachers. It's interesting that while 42% of teachers said students used their phones to look up information, online cell platforms only accounted for 2% of cell phone usage in class.

I'll be blogging more about this throughout my internship here at EdLab this summer; I hope to provide practical guidelines and best practices for teachers and administrators. So... if you come across any success stories, send them this way!
