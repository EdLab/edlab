<p>With so much learning happening online, research is constantly being done on what the most effective forms of online learning are. A recent study compared the effectiveness of monologue-style videos with dialogue-style videos to see which had a more positive impact on student learning outcomes.</p>
 
<p>Each video presented a tutor teaching a difficult physics concept, and the students watching were undergraduates. Whereas the monologue videos featured only the tutor discussing the problems, the dialogue videos featured the tutor and a tutee in conversation. In both cases, students watched the videos in pairs and together completed the same problems and worksheets that the tutor discussed. The students took a test before and after the video sessions to assess their improvement.</p>
 
<p>The study found that the students watching the dialogue videos improved their scores significantly more than those watching the monologue videos. In fact, the students watching the dialogues learned as well as the tutees in the videos. The researchers think this is true for two reasons: first, the dialogue videos promoted more constructive interactions between the student pairs than the monologue videos did, and second, having a tutee present in the video prompted more learning.</p>
 
<p>Considering the first reason, the authors noted that students watching the dialogue video interacted more throughout the sessions, solved more problems on their own rather than copying the work of the tutor, and jointly solved problems more than working individually. Considering the second reason, the authors hypothesize that observing the tutee in the dialogue videos promoted more learning than observing the tutor alone. This could be because the tutee asks questions that otherwise might not be addressed by the tutor and because watching the tutee work through a difficult problem fostered the same kind of learning in those observing.</p>

<p>This study has implications for the development and implementation of online video tutorials. It also shows the importance of constructive conversation and interaction in learning. In this case, the study showed that watching a constructive conversation between a tutor and tutee, which then encouraged one with a classmate, led to learning significantly more than watching a monologue video.</p>
