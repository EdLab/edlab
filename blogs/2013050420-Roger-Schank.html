Roger C. Schank is foremost a learning provocateur and educational reformer, but he is also an educator, cognitive psychologist, artificial intelligence theorist, researcher and entrepreneur.  He has founded an impressive array of companies focused on improving learning using technology.  From Cognitive Arts Corp, a company developed in the early 90’s to create high quality multimedia simulations for both online university level courses and corporate training to <a  href="http://www.socraticarts.com/index.cfm">Socratic Arts</a>, whose focus is on providing "<a href="http://www.socraticarts.com/approach.cfm">Story Centered Curricula</a>" to schools and businesses.  Most recently, Dr. Schank continues his passion for using software and online learning to help fix America’s broken education system with the creation of his company, <a href="http://www.engines4ed.org/">Engines for Education.</a>  
<p>
Dr. Schank has also written over 20 books and worked in a variety of advisory roles, including that of Chief Education Officer of <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/">Carnegie Mellon West</a> (Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus) and Chief Learning Officer of Donald Trump’s learning initiative, <a href="https://www.trumpinitiative.com/login/index.cfm">Trump University</a>.  He has also held a variety of academic positions ranging from Distinguished Career Professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, to founding the Institute for the Learning Sciences at Northwestern University, where he is the John P. Evans Professor Emeritus in Computer Science, Education and Psychology.  Dr. Schank, in addition to having held positions at Stanford, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Diderot_University">Paris Diderot University (Paris VII)</a> and the Institute for Semantics and Cognition in Switzerland, was also Professor of Computer Science and Psychology at Yale University, Chairman of the Computer Science department, and Director of the Yale Artificial Intelligence Project.   Schank is a fellow of the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/home.html">AAAI</a>, founded the Cognitive Science Society, and co-founded the Journal of Cognitive Science.  Dr. Schank was awarded a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Texas at Austin.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><p>

<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I hated school -- too competitive and I never found any of it very interesting. I was interested in computers however. When I found myself a professor at Stanford at age 22, teaching kids, who had all done better than me in school, (I never would have gotten into Stanford), I started to think about education more seriously. For a while I just simply refused to lecture.  I began to think about what teaching should be like.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Working in Artificial Intelligence forced me to think about learning. I wanted computers to be smart and they weren’t going to become smart unless they learned from their own experiences. (This was never the mainstream view in AI, which has never been particularly concerned with what people did.) As I became more involved in trying to figure out how learning actually works in people so I could copy the process on a computer, my children went to school. Slowly I began to understand something I had always wondered about -- exactly why school is such an awful experience for children. (Short answer -- because learning in school does not look like learning in the rest of life.) Asking that question informed the rest of my work.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I would like school to simply disappear. While I realize the odds of that happening are low, it is still the right thing. Schools historically were set up to teach religion and in a sense they still do that. The religion these days is the quadratic formula and balancing chemical equations, just a different type of nonsense no one needs to know. Children should be taught to think, not to memorize. Children should get to follow their own interests with experts who can help them. They should not be in classrooms listening to teachers teach academic subjects decided upon by the President of Harvard in 1892.
<p>
So, I am building the alternative. Online learn by doing experiential learning can be done and I am building it wherever and whenever I can. There are always people who would prefer shortcuts to learning. They have been winning for some time now. 
Lectures. Lectures online. Testing. Courses. Credits. Learning about research instead of practice. Competing to get into a hot college. All this needs to end. It needs to be replaced by Education on Demand. You want to learn how to do something and there is someone and some virtual experience that will help you learn how to do it. 

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Online learning will eventually wipe out education as we know it. The colleges are already panicking, signing up for MOOCs and anything else that will allow the current state of affairs to continue. What is the current state of affairs? Professors doing research and hardly teaching. Universities worrying about research grants and not students. University rankings being all about research. Maybe 50 research universities will survive. That is good. They should survive.
<p>
But the other 3,000 colleges in the US need to die to be replaced by online learning guided by the best and brightest. Not the kind of online learning where you press a button for the next page, but the kind where there is a teacher available to you to help you do something you want to do. Similarly, high school needs to die. We need to stop preparing kids for college and start preparing them for life.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have two major projects going on. One is the building of the kind of online learning by doing experiences I am talking about. These are being launched with the cooperation of the few universities who understand that they need to offer something different.
<p>
The second is a project building a video database of stories told by experts that allows anyone to learn from the best people in any field. This database requires certain AI techniques that I have been working on for years that enable a story to find a listener rather what we currently have, which is people searching for things without knowing what they are looking for using keywords. The stories we collect find you.
<p>
I always have a high school alternative project going on. Unfortunately few people really care about providing the alternative to high school. So this project is harder to fund, due to the fact that the testing lobby and the textbook publishers and the common core movement are all fighting any change that would threaten the money they now make on bad education.
