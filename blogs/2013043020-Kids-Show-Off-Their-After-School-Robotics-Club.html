Even though the school day has ended, 4th and 5th graders of Smith Elementary in Spring, Texas are ready to keep learning. They are part of the after school robotics club, a place where they can learn about real-world problem solving, engineering, and teamwork. These students genuinely enjoy their time in the club. One student summed up the club in one word: "fun"! <p>

The robotics club encourages kids to apply their knowledge of STEM subjects and allows them to gain the practical skills necessary to succeed in increasingly collaborative learning environments. <p>

Ever been part of a robotics club yourself, or something similar? Can you vouch for the learning opportunities it affords? Share your experiences in the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8134"> Vialogues</a>. <p>


<b>@00:35 ChrisGotthis:</b> Wow, I didn't take a Robotics class until I was in high school. It amazes me how young these students are and already take such a class. I wish I would’ve started at a young age as well since I have an interest in robotics. Building the robot was easy, but programming them to move the way you want is not. <p>

<b>@02:40 laurascheiber:</b> Inter-disciplinary skills are so important in today’s context and seeing a program that encourages students to engage in math, science, engineering etc. is really inspiring! <p>

<b>@03:14 ChrisGotthis:</b> I like how it helps the kids develop work habits in building robots. It would’ve been a greater challenge if the kids not only built the robot, but program it as well but they are off to the right track as fourth graders. I think it is great that the school gave them an opportunity to have an after school program like this. The teachers put their grant to great use.
