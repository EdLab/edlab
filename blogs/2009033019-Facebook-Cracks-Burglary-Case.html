            Great!.. or Much ado about nothing?

The headline of <a href=" http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/news-article.aspx?storyid=134778" target="_blank">this story</a> got me rushing to see one more affordance of the ubiquitous Facebook, but after reading the story, I felt it was simply hyping Facebook. Upon second thought however, several questions came to mind, but first the story. 

A car is burgled, the owner tells his wife, the wife "facebooks" her friends who in turn "facebook" their friends. One of these friends happens to be a NEIGHBOR who WITNESSED the crime! This neighbor then "facebooks" back saying she saw the culprit and knew where he lived. The police are alerted and the thief is apprehended. Facebook has CRACKED the case!

Sounds fascinating, but I am at a loss as to why a person who has witnessed a crime takes no immediate action but waits until the story is played out in Facebook before responding. Is it that this neighbor did not react because she felt the victim was not a friend, or there is something more compelling about Facebook (and social networks in general) that motivates us to act in ways that we ordinarily should, but are reluctant to do so?  

I felt if the latter were the case, then it is an issue that is worth studying, as it will be of interest to educators, but again I am inclined to dismiss this as merely hyping Facebook.
