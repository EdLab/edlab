<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> My educational trajectory has everything to do with my current work. My undergraduate psychology degree and graduate training as a counselor positioned me to identify factors affecting student success and to generate student-centered solutions in my work to this point. Now I am tying practice to theory in my doctoral program. Dr. Angela Valenzuela’s book <i>Subtractive Schooling</i> and her work on authentic caring and Dr. Rob Crosnoe’s book <i>Fitting In, Standing Out</i> and his work on environmental protective factors have been especially influential as I situate my doctoral studies in school climate. I am so honored to have them both on my dissertation committee as chair and member respectively.
<p> 
Two early research projects influenced the foundation of my work. My undergraduate research project was based on Urie Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory, which says that a person’s development is influenced by relationships and interactions in their varied environments, including their school, extracurricular, home, and neighborhood environments. I observed a fourth-grade autistic girl in five environments and found her behavior to be dramatically different depending on environmental factors. In the two environments that were structured, supportive and positive, her behavior was consistently positive and productive. In the three environments that were unstructured and inconsistent, her behavior was erratic and at times violent. Same girl. Same autism. Different environmental characteristics. Dramatically different behaviors.
<p> 
I conducted quantitative research during my master’s program to determine the factors related to college student satisfaction. Contrary to what I expected, the only significant factor was the student’s individual interaction with a faculty member. If the student simply had at least one personal interaction with a faculty member (e.g., they went to office hours or the faculty member had a personal conversation with them) his/her likelihood of being satisfied with college increased, which Vincent Tinto asserts is related to student retention.
<p>
In my work as an educational administrator, I front-loaded education programs with these two concepts by structuring supportive and positive environments and integrating individualized interaction between educators and students. My students, the majority of whom were low-income and students of color, responded well to this formula and succeeded academically. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> My early professional experience included counseling foster kids and advising college students.  I shifted to education administration and spent the majority of my time directing college access and dropout prevention programs for middle and high school students. The most formative experience, however, is related to two tragic incidents. The first was at Texas A&M University when the bonfire stacks fell and 12 students were killed. The second was at a high school in Austin when a student stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death in the school hallway during school hours. I was part of the emergency response counseling teams in both cases. It was astonishing to witness how communities can become stronger in the face of horrific tragedy. For the most part, students were able to get back to routine much sooner than we expected. I believe it was because their experience was acknowledged and support was offered. We were also able to identify students who needed more support and refer them to the appropriate channels.
<p>
It occurred to me that many kids experience personal tragedies on a daily basis—kids are bullied, parents get divorced, loved ones pass away or become terminally ill, family members are incarcerated, etc. Yet educators are often not aware of these issues. Meanwhile kids who are dealing with these tragic issues can start to disengage academically. So what might appear to be a low aptitude for learning or behavioral issues could actually be symptoms of burdensome external factors. While educators cannot "fix" these personal tragedies, we can certainly acknowledge them and refer to student support services and community resources. And just as with the two tragedies that I experienced, sometimes acknowledgement and support is all that it takes to get kids back on track.
<p> 
I started to front-load my programs with this third concept of checking in with kids and offering support.  That’s when we saw strides among those who I affectionately refer to as the "hump" kids—the vast majority of students who fall under the hump of the normal curve who are often overlooked because they are neither at the extreme high end or extreme low end of the academic or behavior spectrums. When we stopped overlooking them, they started to thrive. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am working to change the learning landscape by providing a practical way to operationalize and scale what I experienced to be true—that a positive learning environment, or "school climate," elicits positive student development thereby raising academic and behavioral outcomes. Decades of research show the positive correlation between a positive school climate and academic and behavioral outcomes. Angela Valenzuela’s work identifies authentic caring as integral to a positive school climate and Rob Crosnoe’s work substantiates that specific environmental factors can indeed serve to protect affected students from a negative educational trajectory. So how do educators improve climate? First, an accurate measurement is needed. Yet climate is very dynamic—what one kid experiences can be very different from what another kid experiences, and what one kid experiences today can be very different from what that same kid will experience tomorrow. Therefore, regular and whole-school measurement is imperative.
<p> 
In addition, when extreme events occur at a school—students drop out, a bullying-related suicide takes place, school violence erupts, etc.—it’s not because something happened yesterday. It’s because something has been happening for a while. These are hard realities that transcend socioeconomics. We have to address them square in the face if we want them to stop. Having a regular gauge of how kids are experiencing school positions schools to proactively address issues before they become tragedies. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Though technology is now a fixture rather than a trend, I still think that technology will have the most impact on learning as we move forward. Technology is the language that kids speak today. Pre-kindergartners seem to intuitively navigate tablets, smartphones and gaming devices. So it’s exciting to see the variety of edtech products that have emerged. Still, I think we have only begun to scratch the surface of maximizing the power of technology to shape our educational environments. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am currently in dissertation phase with my doctoral degree and my next big project is already underway. edMosphere is my startup company and patent pending edtech tool that technologizes what I experienced to be true—that school climate matters, that a positive school climate can be created and managed, and that extreme issues can be mitigated with early intervention. edMosphere uses technology to capture and report school climate in real time. edMosphere can be administered as frequently as every day and therefore can be used as a Response to Intervention (RTI) Tier 1 screening and intervention tool. edMosphere also fits well with Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) efforts.
<p> 
During the spring 2014 semester we piloted edMosphere at two middle schools and two elementary schools in four different school districts in Texas. edMosphere did exactly what it was supposed to do—it brought to light potential issues before they became problems, positioning the school to be proactive rather than reactive to academic and behavioral concerns. We saw bullying reports go down, in-school suspensions go down, and stronger connections formed between kids and teachers.
<p> 
This summer we will correlate edMosphere data (n=540 students) with student outcome data, specifically those that Robert Balfanz refers to as the A, B, C’s (attendance, behavior, course grades). We’re eager to see what statistical correlations emerge. We are also working to integrate teacher support and professional development resources into edMosphere. It’s a lot of work, however, it’s rewarding to see how edMosphere so quickly benefits students at scale.
<p> 
I am so thrilled and blessed to do this work, to learn under professors who are passionate about student success, to have an incredibly smart, committed and fun edMosphere team and to be a part of the supportive startup, technology, and edtech women communities in Austin, Texas.
