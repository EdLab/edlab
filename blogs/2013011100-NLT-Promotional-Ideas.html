          <p>
            As we ready for the official launch of New Learning Times (NLT), I am sure we have all been brainstorming ideas for promoting the EdLab's latest offering. During a recent D&R meeting, Hui Soo informed us to think of promoting NLT in new and diverse ways. Through conversations with several EdLabbers, I've come up with some initial promotional ideas. Please let me know your thoughts on the ideas as well as any other ideas that could be built into these. 
<p>
<ol>
<li>Promoting certain content streams towards a targeted population. For instance, undergraduate business students might be interested in EdLab Review as that particular content stream looks at startups. I am sure most business students have some kind of entrepreneurial aspiration and so promoting there would highlight to them the kinds of startups and products that are springing up in EdTech. We can contact department heads and professors at the top business schools in the country and maybe even give a brief presentation at nearby schools such as Columbia, NYU and CUNY Baruch.</li>
<li>Though they might not be the ideal NLT reader, targeting the 18-25 year old population might be a good idea. Content streams such as Seen in New York would be very interesting to them (take it from me as I belong to this population.) It is very short, informative and it's visual. Though most of the content on NLT might be research based and geared towards those in education, others such as the aforementioned Seen In New York is essentially for everyone and its quick, informal and informative style makes it very attractable. The ideal platform for this is through social media, namely Facebook and Twitter. For instance, I am a member of several Facebook groups where the average member fits into this demographic and I can post relevant content streams there on a daily basis. There are million such groups on Facebook and we can identify them and post there regularly.</li>
<li>Someone once told me when it comes to promotion, at times the more eyes that see the product, the more likely they will check it out. This is especially true in today's social media culture where you can reach so many people with one post. I know practically everyone at the EdLab has a Facebook account and if each can get at least 50 of their followers to like NLT, we could be well over 2,000 likes in a month's time. The ripple effect of that is those new “likes” could potentially refer it to their friends and so on. The same applies to Twitter where we should ask our followers to follow NLT. This is my challenge to the entire EdLab.</li>
<li>Considering NLT to be a rebel in information in the educational area, a video such as the one below would be highly influential. In the video, it would be helpful for the audience to get a better understanding of what NLT really is, and what makes it different from every other educational platform.</li>
<li>Mailing a post an NLT specific postcard or tiny cards (similar to those we did for Vialogues and UFR) to department heads of schools of education across the country.</li>
</ol>
<p>
These are just some initial ideas I have about promoting NLT and will be sharing more in the coming weeks. Since we are thinking of NLT as an almost anti-establishment and rebel like idea, I think this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/7067">Apple commercial</a> should serve as an inspiration to all of us in our promotional efforts.
