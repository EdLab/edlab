            I am attending the session <a href="http://sloanconsortium.org/conferences/2011/et4online/fueling-emerging-technologies-through-open-education">Fueling Emerging Technologies Through Open Education</a>. 

<i> From the Sloan Website</i>:
ABSTRACT
The Hewlett Foundation has been critical to the growth of open education resources. As part of their current commitments, Hewlett has been investing in OER which has resulted in exemplar projects that are being incorporated into federal grants. The projects span both K-12 and higher education. Vic Vuchic will share what they have learned, where the results are most promising to change the education, and how participants can get involved. Gerry Hanley, representing MERLOT and a Hewlett grantee will provide insight as to how MERLOT is supporting open educational services for higher education in the US and internationally.
