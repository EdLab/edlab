            An ongoing debate that seems to be at the center of much attention is whether  community service should be mandatory in America's high schools.  Numerous schools across the country have mandated that in order for their students to graduate, they must complete a predetermined amount of community service. This action though has been met with opposition from various groups who have denounced its mandatory enforcement.
 
Proponents of mandatory community service argue that it helps build leadership skills in students and better prepares them for future jobs in which leadership is valued. It also serves as a symbiotic relationship between the volunteer and the recipient. This can be attributed to the fact that participation in community service simultaneously helps diversify an individual's college application while providing free, beneficial services to the recipient. Research has also shown that on average, students involved in any sort of community service graduate at a higher rate than those who are not. Inner city school districts such as Chicago, Seattle and Washington D.C have noticed this trend and as a result have made it a mandatory graduation requirement. Some <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2009/01/17/2009-01-17_councilman_proposes_community_service_be.html">politicians</a> in New York City are pushing for the city's school system to follow suit though the Board of Ed has refused to do so.
 
Opponents of mandatory community service express the belief that community service isn't a subject that should be forced upon students. True volunteering lies in an individual's will and drive to help others and enforcing it eliminates that drive. By forcing students to do community service, school officials are essentially doing the equivalent of the mandatory system practiced in penitentiaries across the nation. Furthermore, by implementing mandatory community service, students are burdened with yet an extra criteria to meet in order to graduate. Many students seem to agree with this stance as a <a href="http://www.civicyouth.org/quick-facts/volunteeringcommunity-service/">survey</a> conducted in 2002 by the Council for Excellence in Government Youth showed that a majority of high school aged students were against mandatory community service.   
 
Based on previous experiences, I am personally think community service should indeed be mandatory due to the benevolent effects it has on recipients. Whether it is helping clean up a park, tutoring, or just accompanying a senior citizen, the end results are usually positive and encouraging. Most non for-profit organizations count on volunteers to stay afloat and the addition of a surplus of students will further help their cause. It is important to note that there has been a rise in the amount of individuals <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/volun.nr0.htm">volunteering</a> annually, especially college freshmen. Some can attribute this to the fact that our current President spent a bulk of his early political years doing community service and has made it one of his key social programs. This illustrates how the previous generation placed a strong emphasis on community service. The onus is now on this generation and posterity to follow suit and mandatory community service is the best way to ensure that.
