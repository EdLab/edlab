For those who might recognize this study, I blogged briefly about this study and the coverage it received from popular intellectuals like Matt Yglesias and Megan McArdle. This study focuses on the long-term effects of publicly funded interventions that allowed inner-city students in Chicago to attend the Child-Parent Center Education Program. 

<b>Description</b>:
The researchers for this study used relatively basic regression techniques to measure the effects of this intervention on long-term outcomes such as higher educational attainment, income, socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, substance abuse, justice-system involvement. The results were incredibly strong in favor of the Child-Parent Center Education Program, showing positive effects for all but the latter two, which showed negative effects (also good). This comes in the face of some criticism of the lasting effects of early childhood education on IQ. However, as this study shows, even disregarding IQ, high-quality early childhood education has the potential to yield better long-term results, particularly for males and those whose parents were high school dropouts. Some concerns were raised by Megan McArdle about the scalability of the Child-Parent Center Education Program, but even as far as small-scale early childhood education programs go, this can be viewed as a success given the robust results

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>: 
Understanding the ways in which early childhood education can be offered at the level of the Child-Parent Center Education Program is an essential first step to the overall mission of incorporating technology in an efficient and imaginative manner to deliver high-quality early childhood education to more children than what current educational resources can yield.
