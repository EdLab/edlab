          <p>
            A decade ago, the number of children out-of-school (specifically primary) was estimated at 102 million. However, by 2011, that number had decreased to 57 million. This shows that the number of children enrolled in primary schools around the globe has improved. Although more children are attending school, there are some issues that need to be addressed. For instance, this <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/lead-tomorrow-future-leaders-must-learn-read-today">article</a> from the World Bank claims that UNESCO's Education for All Global Monitoring reported that about 25% of the youth in developing countries are not able to read a sentence. Reading is a foundational skill. If a child is not able to read a sentence at his/her youth age, it would be very difficult for that child to further his/her education.

Likewise, a child who cannot read will also struggle to write or develop certain learning skills. For instance, in India, the universal primary enrollment is 97 percent, yet half of second grade students cannot read a sentence. Additionally, about 25% of those second graders cannot even recognize letters. Sadly, there is a great amount of work that needs to be done because these children are tomorrow's future. The next generation will bring about changes in this world. So far, there have been ideas to resolve some of these issues.

The first idea of a solution is hiring adequately trained teachers. Furthermore, an evaluation from India and Kenya shows that students should be grouped by initial learning level and not by age or grade level as every student develops his/her reading skills differently. Technology can help students learn at their own pace, something that has been established in South Asia. If these ideas are put together and utilized in developing countries, I believe that students will develop good learning skills.
