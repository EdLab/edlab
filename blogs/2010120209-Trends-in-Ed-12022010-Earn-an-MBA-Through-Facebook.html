            The London School of Business and Finance is launching what it promotes as the “the world's first internationally recognized M.B.A. to be delivered through a Facebook application.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/education/29iht-educlede29.html?_r=2&ref=education">The school's global MBA program is now an app on Facebook</a> and allows users to access courses in corporate finance, marketing, and others. Since its inception last month, the app already has 30,000 active users and the school expects 500,000 prospective students to enroll in what it is dubbing the free “MBA test drive” within the coming year. The test drive will allow users to watch lectures, engage in online study sessions and even take interactive exams, all for free. The school only charges fees for actual exams.

The London School of Business was founded in 2003 with students taking mainly accounting courses. The school currently has over 15,000 students at locations all over the UK and one in Toronto and offers programs in marketing, finance and business law in addition to accounting. The school also provides professional development courses to global clients such as Deloitte, KPMG, and MTN. The move to Facebook was driven mainly by its students as most used it as their primary source of communication. Prior to the Facebook app, the school's sole online presence was the InterActive learning platform, based on Moodle's open-source software. The courses on Facebook are divided into three 15-minute video lectures and users have to give access to their name, profile picture, Facebook ID and list of friends. Each course is divided into 10 modules and each module has a video lecture, documents, a Facebook discussion and case study materials.
