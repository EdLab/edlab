The <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grca/supportyourpark/air.htm">Grand Canyon National Park’s Artist-in-Residence program</a> at the South Rim is one of the National Park Service system’s <a href="http://www.nps.gov/getinvolved/artist-in-residence.htm">over 40 AIR programs</a> throughout the country. Visual artists, media makers, writers and performing artists of all backgrounds apply to live in a delightful apartment above the Verkamp’s Visitor Center overlooking the canyon for three weeks, while working on their own artwork. The resident artist participates in environmental and cultural advocacy programs at the park, works publicly and interacts with visitors. <p>

This video, filmed in February 2014, features interviews with painters Jay and Kathy Schmidt and writer Naseem Rakha about their experiences at the canyon. True to the goal of the AIR program to support artists who seek to communicate complex contemporary issues through their medium, each artist shares how the canyon—its cold, snowy winter, its ever-changing landscape and its sheer depth and breadth—has impacted their art and worldview. We follow them as they work and learn how staying in a space long enough to feel, breathe, and patiently observe its ebbs and flows is essential to appreciate nature, to reflect on our place in it, and to understand the importance of taking those practices and applying them to any environment. <p>

Share your thoughts or ask the artists questions <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16620">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@1:18 Sappho:</b> To have a meaningful experience, do you think you need to spend time looking, really looking, and capture it through words or paint or just by noticing with lots of time? <p>
<b>@1:18 kws:</b> Both painting and walking are special kinds of learning/knowing. Some of us only learn that way. <p>
<b>@04:48 LauraCostello:</b> Interesting perspective! Art comes from the struggle between the self and an outside force, like a challenging space.
