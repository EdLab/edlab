          <p>
            I've been doing some research on "How to Tweet Smart" for better recommendation. 
Here are some interesting findings from the literature, might be relevant to several of us. 

1. Chen, Jilin, Nairn, Rowan, Nelson, Les, Bernstein, Michael, & Chi, Ed. (2010). <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753503">Short and tweet: experiments on recommending content from information streams</a>. Paper presented at the Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. 

This paper studied URL recommendation on Twitter as a means to better direct user attention in information streams. Look at the 12 algorithms in the figure below. 
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/tweeter-recommendation-algorithms_990b637719254233be45e4485e698ecd.png">

So, the results suggested that both <b>topic relevance</b> and the <b>social voting process</b> were two keys in providing recommendations. (i.e. the first one: just tweet a popular url, but no one is interested and no retweets has the worst effect, only 32%.) The second algorithm: if anyone of us tweet it, regardless of interests and no retweets, it has a little bit more impact. (Sounds more like what we are doing now?!) So, the best one yielded a 72% high interest rate: tweets from us (friends of friends), tweet to someone we know who are interested in the topic, and those tweets have retweet power! 

- Users care about <b>Relevance</b> as well as <b>Serendipity</b>. They are interested in "news" favored to their opinions, also the opposite points of views. To incorporate <i>preferences</i> into recommendation, here are 3 tips: 
<p> 
1) Content received depends on the volumes of the streams. If the users are capable of combing through all their tweets, they are likely to find <b>random</b> popular URLs that are interesting. 
<p>
2) Content received relies on how they seek information. For those who uses Twitter as their information source, a <b>random</b> strategy may just work well.
<p> 
 3) Content is received based on the context. At work, may need information relevant to the job. At home, entertainment related.

2. Brooks, Andrew, & Churchill, Elizabeth. (2010). <a href="http://cs.unc.edu/~julia/accepted-papers/CHI2010-Microblogging-ECAB2.pdf">Tune in, Tweet on, Twit out: Information Snacking on Twitter</a>. Paper presented at the CHI, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

This paper reported three studies to understand content consumption in various ways for supporting everyday information-seeking activities. Mainly, it argued, Twitter is more than a status update, but can be useful for time-sensitive information seeking and decision making. Although the sampling may not be representative enough in the studies, the idea of <i>information snacking</i> certainly deserves more research attention.

There are some more relevant papers. Email me if you like to discuss, I'd love to share my reference library. 

So, to sum up, even we are not building intelligent tweeting machine to spread news. But since we are considering recommending personalized news, these are good tips for us to build a better recommender for New Learning Times (NLT). And we may just use our human intelligence when we tweet.
