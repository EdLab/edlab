<p><b>Title:</b> Does Immediate Feedback While Doing Homework Improve Learning? (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Kehrer, Kim Kelly, & Neil Heffernan</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FLAIRS/FLAIRS13/paper/view/5938">Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
Is immediate feedback better than delayed feedback in online learning systems?  Do students learn more when they receive real time feedback versus feedback the next day?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
In the traditional classroom, students turn in homework and receive feedback the next day or several days after, but the integration of online learning systems into many modern classrooms means that feedback can be much more immediate. The literature shows many examples of significant learning gains associated with web-based systems that provide immediate correctness feedback, but itâ€™s unclear whether the benefits come from feedback timing or other instructional differences. The authors of <a href="http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FLAIRS/FLAIRS13/paper/view/5938">Does Immediate Feedback While Doing Homework Improve Learning?</a>, sought to isolate feedback timing and investigate its role in learning.</p> 

<p>The study tested several classrooms of seventh grade students as part of their regular math homework in a pre-algebra math class. The students studied surface area and volume of three-dimensional figures during the testing period. Students were randomly assigned into immediate and delayed feedback groups. Both groups worked on math assignments in the <a href="https://www.assistments.org/">ASSISTments</a> intelligent tutoring system. Students in the immediate feedback group were graded after each question while completing homework and students in the delayed group received grades in class the day after they turned in homework.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results showed a marginally significant performance benefit in the group that received immediate feedback. Pre-testing revealed that students had more background knowledge on surface area topics than volume topics. To measure the real learning gains, the authors calculated relative gain scores for each topic. Using gain data from pre- and post-tests, the authors found that students learned 12% more in the immediate feedback group.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study seems to indicate that there is some advantage to immediate correctness feedback in the context of a math course; immediate feedback in other subjects may not be as helpful for students. For web-based homework support systems, the option to integrate immediate feedback is important and blended classrooms with more traditional homework exchange protocols should try to integrate immediate feedback systems into learning. Future research could address the influence of immediate feedback in other subjects and grades or experiment with different feedback types.</p>
