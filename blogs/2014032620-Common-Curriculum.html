<p><a href="http://www.commoncurriculum.com/">Common Curriculum</a> is dedicated to making the process of lesson planning more productive. The innovative design allows users to create lesson plans with prefabricated or custom templates while providing the added functionality of daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term views. Perhaps the most valuable asset of this tool is the seamless inclusion of Common Core Standards. Teachers can choose their location, grade level, and subject and automatically insert the proper Common Core Standards right into their daily lesson plan. This is an extremely valuable tool for teachers who want to ensure they are covering all necessary standards in their daily lessons. In addition, this platform allows for easy adjustments, collaborative efforts, integrated communication, and simple file sharing.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Seamless design and comprehensive lesson plan management combined with the inclusion of common core standards makes this useful tool for teachers of all grade levels. The site offers a range of helpful tutorials on how best to utilize its features and provides standard and customizable templates to help new members effectively start using the application. Using the template, teachers can begin a lesson outline with a Common Core standard, add a few bullet points, attach a quiz or picture, and drop it in to the selected day. The option of viewing lesson plans on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis gives educators the ability to visualize their lessons and develop a well-rounded course. The collaborative feature allows teachers to send their lesson plans to other educators, administrators, or confidants and receive feedback right on the site. Teachers can attach pictures and documents to each lesson as well, keeping important items organized and easily accessible. Another feature of this site is the ability to create a "student" website where everything from lesson plans to homework can be posted for students to access. Teachers need only click "make viewable on website" on a specific lesson and the item is automatically posted to an integrated student-dedicated blog.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>The site is currently free and available to anyone with an email address, but for those who want additional features (such as the option to include more collaborators) there is an added fee. The lesson export feature is still in beta mode, which could mean formatting issues on document exports. The site is still in its infancy but the creator encourages users to submit feedback on ways to keep moving the platform forward.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Important features like Common Core inclusions and the ability to plan for the entire year make this platform a unique tool.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Common Curriculum might just be the future of lesson planning.</p>
