            <a href="http://artandcode.ning.com/">Art and Code</a> was a symposium/conference/workshop at Carnegie Mellon that took place last month.

Golan Levin, the conference organizer, wrote this in the Motivation section of the conference website:

<blockquote>Just as true literacy in English means being able to write as well as read, true literacy in software demands not only knowing how to use commercial software tools, but how to create new software for oneself and for others. Today, everyday people are still woefully limited in their ability to create their own software. Many would like to create their own programs and interactive artworks, but fear that programming is “too hard.” The problem, it turns out, may not be programming itself so much as the ways in which it is conventionally taught.</blockquote>

The tools presented on the Art and Code range in difficulty for a child. Open Frameworks is difficult while Scratch was developed to teach kids programming concepts.

I remember learning LOGO in elementary school and then not touching the code again until college, and wonder what my skill level would be if I had even rudimentary programming in high school.

Has anyone in the EdLab done any research around similar topics? I would be interested in talking about it.
