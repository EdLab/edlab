<b>Massively Inaccessible</b> 
<br>
For about a year now MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been all the rage in the education world.  Everyone from Stanford faculty members to the edtech expert, David Wiley, have one.  However, despite becoming a hot trend for learning and debatably, teaching, they are still mainly relegated to computer science and higher-level subjects like logic.  With the exception of very few introductory courses these online experiences are by no means accessible to learners who are not self-motivated and/or require remedial help.  The Gates Foundation hopes to address this issue and find out whether or not MOOCs are a viable pathway to learning for students struggling with introductory-level courses.  Josh Jarrett, the Gates Foundation’s deputy director for postsecondary success describes their hope for the project to <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></i>, "We are cautiously optimistic that MOOC’s might be able to improve outcomes for low-income students who are working toward credentials, but there are a lot of questions that we can’t yet answer." 
<p>
<b>Gateway to the Future?  Or a Gates Failure?</b>
<br>
To explore whether or not the MOOC format could be a scalable, realistic solution to the problem of educating "low-income and underprepared students" the Gates Foundation has launched a proposal contest for universities throughout the country.  The winning 10 proposals will receive grants of over $50,000 to develop MOOCs for "high-enrollment, low-success introductory-level courses."  This initiative could provide a necessary bridge between MOOCs, which are focused on independent learning outside the traditional classroom and the higher education world.  Instead of replacing degrees from institutions of higher education, as "edupunks" in the alternative credentialing world have proposed, MOOCs might be crafted and adapted to support the existing needs of under-performing students already engaged in traditional programs.  The edtech startup, Knewton.com has created a similar relationship to a traditional learning institution with their Arizona Math Readiness course, currently in use at Arizona State University.  Created to provide an adaptive, personalized learning platform to support entry-level math courses that traditionally "weed-out" students who want to enter STEM majors, this course has provided additional online support to improve pass rates.  ASU’s program prevents many students, otherwise turned-away at the "gates" of science-heavy courses, to walk through this difficult entry point by providing remedial, adaptive help online.  Perhaps instead of the hostile take-over through MOOCs that many have hoped for and predicted, the Gates initiative may prove that MOOCs, like their sibling the adaptive learning platform, can be productive partners in the business of providing degrees and support a wide variety of learning beyond complex computer-science courses.  Only time and half a million dollars will tell.
