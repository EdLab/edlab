          <p>
            Researchers from the University of Michigan recently released findings from a decades long <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/parenting-family/teen-ya/2011-04-28-highschooljobs28_st_N.htm">study</a> which links the amount of working hours completed by a high school student to their likelihood of completing college. The study concluded that students who work less than 15 hours a week are far more likely to obtain a bachelor's degree than those who exceed that figure. 

Such results were obtained from data first collected in 1976 as part of the <a href="http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/">Monitoring the Future Project</a> which annually surveys high school seniors across the country. Of the over 65,000 students that were surveyed, 58% of those who reported working less than 15 hours a week had acquired a college degree by the age of 30. On the contrary though, for every additional five hours that a student worked, their likelihood of finishing college diminished by 8%.  Various reasons can be attributed to such a direct correlation.

Students who work more than 15 hours generally boast sub-par grades and thus see work as a gateway from school as well as a chance to earn money early. Another factor that may contribute to such a statistic is the shear workload that a part time job puts on students. Simultaneously holding a job while participating in sports or other extracurricular activities can prove to be too strenuous for some students. Their desire to continue on with their education as a result diminishes which decreases their likelihood of completing college. 
 
With this said, parents are advised to monitor the academic status of their child after they've obtain a part time job to insure that they don't lag behind. If this is adhered to and the amount of working hours are kept at a minimum, parents are expect to see their child benefit from the positive results that a part time job can carry.
