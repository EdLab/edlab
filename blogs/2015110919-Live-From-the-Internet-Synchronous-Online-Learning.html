<p>While many Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) function through pre-recorded video lectures so that anyone in the world can learn at their own pace, MOOCs that use live interactive videos are not as common. In this case study at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa, researchers surveyed students on their perceptions of participation in an online nutrition course that featured synchronous live interactive sessions.</p>
 
<p>The participating students reported that some of the biggest advantages of using synchronous sessions were the ability to collaborate with classmates and to get direct feedback from the professor during the session. However, most students also reported internet connectivity issues, which interrupted the session and caused them to miss certain portions of the discussions. Other students added that only a few of the students in the class actively participated—much less than they would have liked.</p>
 
<p>Another aspect of the live sessions that students found to be challenging was that they were always scheduled at the same time on the same day every week, which excluded students with conflicts (even though they were allowed to enroll initially). </p>
 
<p>The researchers combined some student suggestions for improvement with their own analysis of the results from the study and created solutions to the problems raised in the survey responses. They noted that teachers should help facilitate more balanced participation from all students, much like teachers do in a physical classroom. In order to address the scheduling conflict issue, the researchers suggested varying the times for the synchronous sessions, offering 30-minute "crash meet-up" sessions on an alternate day, or restricting enrollment entirely for those who have conflicts. Finally, the researchers suggested using Facebook for a greater variety of educational resources—such as mandatory activities and facilitating group work. Although this study focused on only one school and one course, it could prompt future analyses of live MOOCs, particularly whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages enough to warrant their continued use. </p>
