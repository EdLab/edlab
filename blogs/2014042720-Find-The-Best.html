<p>Anyone who has ever applied to a school knows that making the best decision possible can be exhausting. Finding accurate information to analyze factors like quality, location, size, selectivity, and value is difficult and usually entrusted to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education">US News and World Report</a>. Sorting choices by SAT scores, graduation rates, out-of-state tuition, and financial aid can cause serious decision fatigue. The aggregate data site <a href="http://www.findthebest.com/">Find The Best</a> encourages users to make well-informed decisions based on sortable lists of institutions ranging from culinary schools to online classes to traditional universities.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The site offers an impressive variety of categories that aren’t available on other sites, such as: degree, cost per credit, campus safety, program length, accreditations, and even <a href="https://www.bbb.org/">Better Business Bureau</a> ratings. For a site with a highly customizable search, the navigation is refreshingly intuitive, but if users feel overwhelmed by options, a helpful guide provides considerations as they browse. Expandable details keep search results simple and uncluttered, a bottom navigation bar tracks items being compared, and a smart rating scores a university after weighing criteria such as admissions selectivity, academic excellence, expert opinions, and career readiness. Results are shareable and trending activities allow users to see that right now a lot of students are comparing William & Mary to The University of Virginia.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>Unfortunately some of the data sets are very small and may cause inaccurate results. For example, faculty at Teachers College Columbia University will be distraught to see the university ranked with the largest gap between male and female faculty salaries (a $118,000 difference); however, only four faculty salaries are included in the data set.  Pages that don’t meet the site’s quality standards or have outdated information are flagged (similar to Wikipedia’s quality assurance model).</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Last winter the company won a competition sponsored by the NYC Department of Education to build the most effective system for comparing public schools (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-public-high-schools-new-york-city-stuyvesant-2013-11">this</a> is their list). If more school districts are willing to open their data, it’s easy to imagine Find The Best becoming the best site for education comparisons. This search system could disrupt traditional higher ed rankings by offering students more detailed, customizable, personalized searches.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>With a little more data, Find The Best could be better than all the rest.</p>
