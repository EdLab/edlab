<p><a href="https://www.buildpiper.com/pages/piper-computer-kit">Piper</a> is a computer kit that gives kids hands-on building and coding experience. With the kit, students aged 7–12 will be able to construct their own Raspberry Pi-powered computer. They can then play through a customized puzzle adventure game built on the Minecraft system. The company hopes that the kit will foster interest in technology for young learners.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Building the Piper computer is challenging, yet rewarding. The kit comes with all the needed parts: screws, wires, hinges, peripherals, and a range of other materials. Students first must carefully follow along on Piper’s oversized blueprints. This process could take up to a few hours to finish, with lots of trial and error along the way.</p>  

<p>The Piper designers specifically made their kits gender neutral: everyone gets the same wood box design. Therefore the company hopes this product can attract girls to engineering and computer science.</p>         

<p>After construction, students power up their device and play through a game where they must save the world as PiperBot. Any child familiar with Minecraft should be able to figure out the gameplay; and if not, the simple puzzles have easy-to-follow instructions.</p> 

<p>The best part of Piper is that the tinkering aspect continues through the gaming. The puzzles on the screen are all integrated into Piper’s physical functions. For instance, during the first few levels, kids build a controller to use for the rest of the game by connecting wires and buttons to a switchboard. As the game progresses, kids continue to build and add new functions. After saving the world, there are supplemental levels available for download. </p>  

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The Piper kit contains a lot of small items, such as screws and buttons, that are essential to building or gaming. These small parts can easily get misplaced. I actually lost a set of screws, so my final constructed box was much less sturdy than the original design. </p>

<p>Additionally, kids must move around physical wires and buttons during the puzzle games. Some of these pieces are quite delicate. For instance, I accidentally bent the prongs of a button during one mission and had to use the screwdriver to straighten it out. While this is arguably part of the learning process, breaking crucial pieces can be quite frustrating.</p> 

<p>Finally, at $299, the price could be an issue for some schools or families. Once the initial excitement of building the computer and playing through the game fades, kids may stop using their kits after just a few months. Thus some parents might not consider Piper worth the initial price tag. </p> 
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Piper certainly achieves its mission of getting kids interested in technology through hands-on learning, even with a few missing pieces along the way. The physical construction and tinkering provides welcome relief to the overconsumption of screens. Plus, the gender neutral design addresses an important issue.</p>     

<p>The kit’s price tag might be tough for some parents or schools. But if you are already buying loads of toys or apps for your children, Piper is worth the investment. The company also offers package deals with a special curriculum for schools that will bring down the per-unit price. If you can make the cost work, Piper’s innovative learning will be beneficial and fun.</p>
