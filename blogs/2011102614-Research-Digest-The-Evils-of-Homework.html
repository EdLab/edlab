<a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=10746">DeBruin-Parecki, Andrea. Book Review: "The End of Homework: How Homework Disrupts Families, Overburdens Children, and Limits Learning". Teachers College Record Volume 104 Number 1, 2002, p. 76-78.</a>

Every schoolchild knows, and to the core, of the evils of homework, but among educators and parents there is a curious and inexplicable blindness on the issue, as if, watching slaves wear away their fingers toiling in the salt mines, they were to say: “This is really building their character!“  In light of recent movements <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/education/24homework.html?src=me&ref=general">at home</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052970204612504576608680528108152.html">abroad</a> against the scourge of homework, I decided to take a look and see if any academics had opened their eyes.  I found this book review in the TC Record which ably identifies the negative effects of homework on students and their families.

<b>Summary</b>:
The book is titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0807042188/teacherscolleger ">“The End of Homework: How Homework Disrupts Families, Overburdens Children, and Limits Learning,” </a> and, judging from the review, the case against homework that it makes is two-pronged.  First, homework is particularly disruptive to, and difficult for, low-income over-worked families, who often don't have the time or the resources to help turn homework into a productive learning opportunity, instead of a source of familial friction and anomie.  Second, the evidence in the research literature is at best inconclusive as to the academic value of homework.  Put these two facts together, and homework begins to look more like a medieval relic than a learning tool appropriate for the 21st century.  Although the authors of the book (Etta Kralovec and John Buell) don't push for its abolishment, they do recommend a drastic reduction in the amount of homework assigned, along with the incorporation of homework into the regular school day.  

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
Some of this, of course, sounds a little bit like the case for “flipping” that Demetri and other at Edlab have been pushing and supporting, and I suspect that new educational technology like Vialogues will be invaluable in the battle against homework already begun.
