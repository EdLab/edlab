            <a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/top-news/technology-keeps-kids-tethered-to-their-parents-longer-than-previous-generations/">This article</a> from the <i>eCampus News</i> proposes that an inevitable result of the information age (or should it be called the communication age?) is that kids are going off to college without really leaving their parents behind anymore.

<i>Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose specialty is technology and relationships, calls this a particular sort of “Huck Finn moment,” in which Huck “takes his parents with him. We all sail down the Mississippi together.”</i>

The writer names Skype, Facebook, smartphones, rising tuition costs, and even 9/11 as reasons as to why post-high school parental involvement has increased to a detrimental effect. 

<i>“It's about having an adolescence that doesn't include the kind of separation that we used to consider part of adolescence,” [Turkle] added. “Something has become the norm that was considered pathological.” </i>

A survey of two schools (Middlebury in VT and U. of Michigan) says that students were in contact with their parents an average of 13 times a week.

Honestly, I wonder if I, too, would've been better off in college without being able to contact my parents via email and cell phones. What about the rest of you? How often did you talk to your parents? Do you think this is a legitimate problem? Does anyone regret being in contact with their parents throughout college? Or possibly vice versa?
