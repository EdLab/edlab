          <p>
            As I sat watching the HBO movie, <a href=“http://www.hbo.com/films/yesterday/”>Yesterday</a>, with my colleagues this past week, a few thoughts sprung to mind about <a href=“http://www.avert.org/aidssouthafrica.htm”>AIDS</a> in Africa, particularly South Africa. Yesterday is a rural South African woman (his father said Yesterday was better than today) who has been diagnosed with AIDS. Resigned to her fate, she embarks on a quest to see her seven-year-old daughter, Beauty, start school before she succumbs to the disease. Deservingly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, Yesterday touches on many themes that have been largely ignored by South African society. Upon traveling from her rural town Rooihoek to <a href=“http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg”>Johannesburg</a>, South Africa's biggest city, to inform her husband John of her diagnosis, he severely beats her while his boss looks away. This is the stigma that often accompanies women with AIDS in Southern Africa, where AIDS is seen by many sectors of society as a woman's disease. In a very patriarchal region, women are often abandoned by their families and husbands and unable to afford medication that could prolong their life. They are left to suffer until death comes knocking on the door. In the movie, the majority of Rooihoek's residents are middle aged women and I can't recall a single instant where a male appears in the town. And as such, how can a faithful woman who is married with a young daughter in a matriarchal surrounding catch AIDS? Though there is little statistical data to support this idea, the answer is quite simple: her husband John. John, by virtue of his occupation as a miner, spends the majority of his time in Johannesburg and therefore contracted AIDS from either an extramarital affair or sexual trysts with other women. John's unforgettable apology to his wife on his death bed serves to emphasize one of the untold truths about AIDS. In rural South Africa, condom usage is non-existent and married women are expected to kowtow to the demands and needs of their husbands. Stories of victims forced to drink from different cups as their own family members abound, with many either knowing or ignoring the fact that casual contact such as drinking cups or hugging doesn't result in one contracting AIDS. <p>

The movie left with me countless questions, among which included what is being done to combat the virus in South Africa? In a population of 48 million, six million are infected with HIV/AIDS, making the <a href=“https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sf.html”>South Africa</a> the country with the highest number of HIV/AIDS cases in the world. It is estimated that 1,000 people die of AIDS everyday in South Africa. The current government of <a href=“http://www.infoplease.com/spot/mbeki1.html”>Thabo Mbeki</a> has been criticized by for doing little to help prevent the spread of the disease or providing the necessary medication to prolong the lives of those already infected. Mbeki, since replacing <a href=“http://www.time.com/time/time100/leaders/profile/mandela.html”>Nelson Mandela</a> as president, has strongly questioned the link between HIV (the virus that leads to AIDS) and AIDS. The link, as he sees it, is rather on the broken infrastructure and poverty that affects not just South Africa, but all of sub-Sahara Africa. Not only has Mbeki failed to back his theory, his administration has thwarted attempts by AIDS activists to gain cheap, generic antiretroviral drugs as well as contemplating whether a program to treat pregnant women with AIDS so they don't pass it on to their newborns is worthwhile. Not only is Mbeki's stand ridiculous, it is deadly. For many South Africans battling AIDS, time is of the very essence in their fight against the worst pandemic since the Black Plague. Politics is very slow and deliberate, AIDS is not. While the Mbeki administration continues to waste precious time debating the link between HIV and AIDS, millions of South Africans are dying. Mbeki's insistence on an ideology that has been rejected by researchers and scientists alike only furthers the pandemic. <p>    

In 2005, South Africa's renowned statesman Nelson Mandela publicly announced that his eldest son <a href=“http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/06/world/main665228.shtml”>Makgatho had died from AIDS complications</a>. “Let us give publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because the only way of making it appear to be a normal illness, just like TB, like cancer, is always to come out and say somebody has died because of HIV,” stated Mandela. It was seen as a major boost to rid South Africa of the stigma attached to AIDS and hopefully lead to a more practical approach to combat the scourge. Mandela, at age 90, is still fighting vigorously for AIDS as he did to rid South Africa of its previous scourge: <a href=“http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~cale/cs201/apartheid.hist.html”>apartheid</a>. His noble effort has been met with some resistance from Mbeki, whose administration has failed South Africa in many wars: a fledgling economy and support for the illegitimate presidency of Robert Mugabe in neighboring Zimbabwe. Often touted as the most prosperous nation in sub-Sahara Africa, South Africa's future depends on how it deals with the AIDS crisis. AIDS accounts for 71% of death among 15-49 year-olds in South Africa. Mbeki's lackluster tenure in office will officially end in 2009 when his term concludes. With a new administration often comes new policies, and for South Africa's sake, let's hope tomorrow is better than yesterday.
