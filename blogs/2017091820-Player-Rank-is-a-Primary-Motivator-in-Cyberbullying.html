<p>As rates of online victimization increase, experts remain divided on a definition for Cyberbullying. Some say traditional bullying criteria (physical, verbal and relational aggression) should be applied to cyberbullying, while others argue for a reassessment of traditional criteria to account for a virtual environment. One thing experts do agree on is that power imbalances, such as computer savvy or player rank (a point system that implies status in the game), take on a different form in electronic media. Now, a new study has revealed rank is an important motivator, after participants cited it as the primary reason for both cyberbullying and cyber-victimization..</p>
 
<p>The study (of self-selected, mostly middle and upper class over-18 year olds) examined the prevalence and types of cyberbullying and cyber-victimization during massively multiplayer online game play. It focused on the individual (sex, gender, and sexual orientation) and observed interactions with teammates and competitors. Researchers tested seven hypotheses using an online survey. All the hypotheses were proven, except one: females and LGBT players did not, as expected, report more overall cyber-victimization than males or heterosexual players. However, they did report experiencing more cyber-victimization via behaviors with sexual meanings and player rank. Forty-five percent of respondents who bullied another player by name-calling, making fun of them, and/or teasing did so due to the other player’s rank. Forty percent of those who excluded another player did so because of the player’s rank, and 29% of participants threatened or forced another player also due to the player’s rank.</p>
 
<p>The results support the idea that a power differential is a common characteristic of bullying, even in an online context, and suggest that bullying is linked with status seeking. The researchers recommend a more dynamic look at player rank and bullying in online gaming, as well as a closer examination of the traditional definition of bullying, specifically, repetition, intent, and power, which they found lacking for a digital context.</p>
