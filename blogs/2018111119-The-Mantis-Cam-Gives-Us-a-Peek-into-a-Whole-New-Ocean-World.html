<p>Humans are limited in our study of undersea animals, not only because of the challenging and often unreachable environments in which they live, but because we lack the ability to see the world as they see it. The capacity to sense polarization, a property of light invisible to humans, is widespread among octopus, squid, crabs, cuttlefish, shrimp, and even some fish. In order to help humans try and see the world through the lens of an animal utilizing polarization, a team led by engineer Viktor Gruev of the University of Illinois has developed the Mantis Cam, named after the mantis shrimp.</p>

<p>Underwater cameras used by divers tend to be bulky, awkward, intrusive, and expensive, so the team that built the Mantis Cam specifically made sure their device was small, affordable, and easy to use. In partnership with marine biologists, the engineers hope their camera can be used to study how different marine creatures use polarization to help scientists understand the phenomenon. Whether the detection of polarization is used for communication, navigation, predator detection, or other purposes, marine biologists might finally be able to find out with this new technology.</p>

<p>What other advantages might these cameras offer to the research community? Why do we continue to pour so much time and so many resources into exploring and understanding the ocean world?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:55 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> It's interesting to think about developing technology we can use to experience the world from the perspective of other animals. I wonder if similar devices could be produced that would enable us to hear sound waves beyond our normal range.</p>

<p><b>@01:25 RuthS: </b>The ocean is still a great mystery to us; creatures that live there are so foreign. There is still so much to discover, and research likes this helps us understand life in the ocean more. Maybe once we understand the ocean more, we will be better able to take care of the earth than we are now.</p>
