<b>Creating Local Leaders to Make a Difference</b><br>
<a href="http://www.globalkids.org/">Global Kids, Inc.</a> is working to produce young leaders throughout the world, who are well-equipped to help solve the myriad of problems facing humanity.  Founded in 1989 by <a href="http://www.encore.org/carole-artigiani">Carole Artigiani</a>, this non-profit educational organization aims to inspire underserved youth to achieve academic excellence and take actions to help solve local and global issues.  The participants, known as "Global Kids Leaders," come from a range of backgrounds, from high schools with low graduation rates in the US, to students with very different backgrounds from different parts of the world.  Global Kids Leaders are inspired to teach other students about current issues and how to make global change one person at a time.
<p>
<b>How To Get Involved</b><br>
In order to foster global learning, Global Kids provides a variety of <a href="http://globalkids.org/#/our-programs">programs</a> for students who want to get involved with international change-making.  In addition to hosting programs within schools in New York City and Washington, D.C., Global Kids offers summer camps, workshops, and conferences related to a number of topics, including digital media, leadership, college and career preparation, foreign relations, human rights, and even the creative arts. Not only do these programs give students resources and the experience necessary to succeed academically, but participants are also able to gain leadership, collaboration, experience, and public speaking skills.  Many of these programs even provide opportunities to travel and explore foreign policy issues. Global Kids has also created an <a href="http://olpglobalkids.org/">online leadership program</a> to reach millions more who are unable to attend in-person workshops.
<p>
In addition to a focus on social justice, the program promotes digital literacy, <a href="http://globalkids.org/#/our-programs/collegecareer-readiness">college/career readiness</a> and civic engagement by utilizing technology to support learning for underprivileged youth.  Global Kids participation does not stop when students graduate, with program alumni filling roles as active civic leaders and accomplished professionals, who come back to contribute to the program. 
<p>
<b>Not Just For Kids</b><br>
Despite the organizationâ€™s name, "Global Kids," the group also provides extensive <a href="http://globalkids.org/#/services-for-educators">professional development and curriculum training and consulting for educators</a>.  These training opportunities can be customized to the needs of educators and organizations and around topics such as youth development, conflict resolution, and digital learning.  With services and programs to help both students and educators, Global Kids is an organization that makes a difference in the global learning and youth development spheres.  With a high school graduation rate of over 90% for program graduates, there is clear proof that Global Kids is providing young people (and adults) with the knowledge they need to flourish in school and potentially become future leaders. Most importantly, it gives students a louder voice in the global community.
