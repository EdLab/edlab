            In the ongoing debate as to whether e-books & libraries will ever really be a good pair, Penguin books has suspended e-book delivery to libraries, citing "security concerns."  Penguin Group along with Macmillan and Simon & Schuster, among others, have a policy of not sharing new releases with libraries.  Existent Penguin e-books in library collections will not be affected by this measure.  

Penguin's thinking behind this mandate is nebulous at best, and can be summarized by vague "security concerns" cited by a spokesperson for the group and explored more fully in <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/penguin-suspends-e-book-availability-to-libraries/?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=tha26">this New York Times blog post</a>.  In the public statement featured on the NYTs the the emphasis is definitely on the continued availability of print versions of these new releases, it does seem that they, and other big publishing houses are suddenly skittish about the financial ramifications of making new releases available in free, licensed form on e-readers.  

Librarians have expressed frustration at these delays, and their sentiments are perhaps best represented by Kate Sheehan, a member of <a href="http://biblio.org/about/">Bibliomation</a>, and her recent Tweet, “You don't have to work with libraries, but if you're not going to, at least give us a reason that isn't insulting to our intelligence.”  Perhaps it is time for publishers to decide, will they offer their full catalogue of titles and new releases to libraries or... not.  This in-between, wishy-washy attitude doesn't seem to serve anyone.  Well, perhaps it does, the publisher's accountants.
