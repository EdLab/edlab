            One of the most challenging aspects of doing business is creating one. It requires great effort and lots of sacrifices. Many entrepreneurs who decide not to start a business idea they had in mind fear the many risks that comes with it. This is the not surprising because according to Gallup research, half of all businesses fail within the first five years. Below are some tips which can help avoid the problems that come with creating a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sc/small-business-tips-2015-3">new business</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Study your competition, but don't overreact to what it is doing.</b>
One thing that is always guaranteed in the business world is competition. The most important thing is to study the market carefully and the major competitors in it. Many entrepreneurs are quick to react to their main competitors every move but it is more advisable to focus on the competitive advantage.
<li><b>Focus on one definable goal every year.</b>
Actionable goals must be set each year. The number of goals set must be reasonable to ensure productivity. Too many goals can lead to less productivity so priorities must be handled first.
<li><b>Find the right technology solutions.</b>
There are always going to be an abundance of resources available but the most                    important thing is to use the ones that makes sense the most for the business being created  and the BUDGET. 
<li><b>Find a good mentor.</b> 
A good mentor will be vital when creating a new business. They can direct the entrepreneur the right way by assisting them in any issues they expect to encounter. A good mentor must be experienced with the right background.
<li><b>Take steps to manage your stress.</b>
Creating a new business surely comes with a lot of stress because of the uncertainty that comes along with it. However, it is important to take careful steps to manage stress in the early stages to prevent being overwhelmed.
</ul>
