<p>As education becomes increasingly more student-centered, student voice plays a growing role in teaching and learning. The concept of nurturing student voice in the classroom is based on the idea that education is best when students have a say in the teaching practices, form, and direction of a course. While there are many ways to strengthen student voice, one significant method is to collect regular feedback.</p>
 
<p>As there are various methods for collecting student feedback, a recent study examined student perceptions regarding three different types: pen and paper, oral survey, and digital response. The study was conducted with 93 university students over an entire 13-week semester at a university in Hong Kong. The three feedback methods were each deployed four times over the course of the term. When students used pen and paper, they were given questionnaires at the beginning of each class that were collected at the end. In oral surveys, the instructor individually questioned students after each class. Finally, in digital response, students opened a digital feedback forum at the beginning of class and could make comments throughout. These were given via one of three digital tools: <a href="https://socrative.com">Socrative</a>, <a href="https://todaysmeet.com">TodaysMeet</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>.</p>
 
<p>At the end of the semester, students responded to a questionnaire about their experiences with each of the different feedback methods. Overwhelmingly, students preferred digital response to either pen and paper or oral survey. In particular, there were five characteristics of digital response that students tended to appreciate most: digital response was fun, anonymous, instantaneous, involved student to student interaction, and provided a record of feedback.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that of these five characteristics, the most important one in securing genuine feedback was the anonymity of digital response. In pen and paper questionnaires, students worried about the teacher recognizing their handwriting; in oral surveys, students had to face their teacher to discuss their opinions. But in digital response, students could comment on the class without worry of recognition, which allowed them to have a more honest voice in the classroom. Based on these results, the researchers think that regular digital feedback could be a valuable tool to make the classroom a more empowering space for students.</p>
