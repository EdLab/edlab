<p>Ten to fifteen years ago interactive whiteboards (IWBs) began popping up in classrooms across the country. Eager to create high-tech schools, many districts announced that <a href="http://www.bxtimes.com/stories/2011/39/bronxtimes-yn_bronx_front_page-37-smartboard.html">IWBs would be installed in every classroom</a>, even as teachers and students struggled to use them, smudging their screens with whiteboard markers. Features like interactive touch-screens and adaptable projections were seen by some as <a href="http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2010/01/27/tln_ferriter_whiteboards.html">expensive distractions from learning</a>. 

<p>Research studies have shown that even among teachers who find IWBs useful, they do not know how to optimize their use. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813011804">One particular study</a> focused on two elementary social studies teachers who used the boards for two hours of professional development activities.</p>

<p>Through an interview with the teachers, conversations with a focus groups of students, and an analysis of student- and teacher-centered activities, the researchers found that it was difficult to incorporate the IWB into student-centered learning. They noted that students in the focus group were most familiar with IWBs in the context of whole-class mathematics instruction, possibly because math teachers received more IWB professional development training and more boards were available to math classes. However, the researchers recommended that the best incorporation of this technology in social studies classrooms was with smaller groups. Teachers expressed concern that this would be difficult to do given that only one student can use the board at a time, and students found that teachers tended to use the board more often than students.</p>

<p>The authors conclude that there is a need for more IWB professional development resources for multiple subject areas, especially because teachers often use the board as a glorified projector. The need for content-specific pedagogical and technological teacher education is as relevant as ever, and until that becomes more available, IWBs could remain nothing more than a really, really expensive projector.</p>
