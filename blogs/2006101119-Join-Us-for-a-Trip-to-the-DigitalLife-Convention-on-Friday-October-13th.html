          <p>
            On Friday, October 13th, Hui Soo, Skye and I intend to attend the <a href="http://www.digitallife.com/flash.html" target="_blank" title="DigitalLife Convention">DigitalLife</a>, consumer electronics and entertainment convention at the Javits Convention Center, located on 34th Street and 11th Avenue.  

We would like to make it a group event, so please let us know if you would like to come along.  Tickets are $12.00.  For further details on the event, check out the attached document.

At the event, we will be conducting video interviews with assorted conference attendees to capture the vibe of the event with an emphasis upon the products or services that have educational value.

We intend to target five groups. We would like input from our EdLab colleages regarding our proposed questions, as outlined below. Some of our questions are serious, while others are intended to mix things up a bit.
