<p>It's sometimes easy to forget that a significant number of American children still don’t have internet access at home. With more educational curriculum online, and with more teachers assigning homework requiring online access to complete, students face a problem called the <i>homework gap</i>. Students with access to the internet at home are more able to complete their assignments, while those without are not.</p>

<p>To put the problem in numbers, approximately <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/20/the-numbers-behind-the-broadband-homework-gap/">5 million households with school-aged children</a> don’t have internet access at home, and this statistic is disproportionately made up of low-income Black and Hispanic families. In fact, around one-third of households with an income of less than $50,000 and school-aged children don’t have internet access at home. Yet, according to this vialogue, 70% of teachers assign homework requiring online access. All this adds up to the fact that many students simply do not have the resources to complete homework assignments at home, and they are more likely to fall behind in school because of it.</p>

<p>There are initiatives to curb this homework gap, including <a href="http://www.1millionproject.org">The 1 Million Project</a>, which aims to close the gap by giving high school students reliable internet access at home. There are also efforts to put wifi on school buses, as has <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3619/wi-fi-on-wheels-puts-students-online">happened in Coachella, California</a>. Do you know of other efforts to close the homework gap? How do you think teachers and schools should approach this problem? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/42071">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@03:35 Ryan Allen:</b> I honestly think this issue is overdramatized in this video. According to <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/">Pew</a> 100% of 18 year olds have cell phones, while 94% of them have smartphones. This kind of access will give students ample resources for high school homework/assignments. Perhaps we need to instill training via phones instead of computers in schools.</p>

<p><b>@01:51 RuthS:</b> As public school budgets continue to be cut, schools have to reuse decades-old textbooks year after year. More kids have textbooks <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/04/09/oklahoma-girl-gets-textbook-once-used_ap.html">dating back to the 80's</a>, so obviously these kids without access to additional resources at home are going to have outdated information. Just today, the NY Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/reader-center/us-public-schools-conditions.html">published an article</a> portraying the low budget state of public schools.</p>
