<p>This paper discusses the details of designing a course for teachers with a specific focus on co-learning as a form of professional development. The goal was to teach teachers how to use information and communications technology (ICT) collaboratively in their pedagogy by going over activities, tools, and resources in a structured format within the course.</p>
 
<p>More than 9,000 teachers from 174 different countries registered for the course, with participation from Africa and Oceania double what it usually is for Coursera courses, suggesting perceived value in this type of professional development beyond the usual user base for Coursera. The author also found that the class completion rate was higher for higher status employees like policymakers and school managers than it was for classroom teachers. And though the author did not draw any immediate conclusions from this, she speculates that completion rates may have been determined by the amount of time each individual had to spend online.</p>
 
<p>By using a post-course survey, course analytics, and the course forum posts, the author was able to conclude that engagement in this professional development course was higher than for an average Coursera course, and that many of the participants enjoyed the interactivity and engagement of the forum posts for talking about issues in ICT teaching. This online course appears to have succeeded in reaching teachers in emerging economies, its support for community learning, and its co-learning professional development model. It demonstrates how online course instructors can effectively engage students with the help of thoughtful design.</p>
