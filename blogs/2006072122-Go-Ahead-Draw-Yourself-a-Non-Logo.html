            Check out these <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/reviews/2006/index.htm">reviews of recent logo changes by major corporations</a>. This is very interesting stuff after a meeting Gonzalo and I attended yesterday on TC's lack of a logo.

Did you know that the "crown" logo was officially not to be used since 1996? It was deemed too "elitist." Yeah, we were supposed to make do with only the words (the appearance of which were stipulated in fine detail in a 10-page document, then promptly filed under "who cares"), but we couldn't help ourselves from cobbling together images from the past! (â€“in an institution as diverse as TC, it's not hard to imagine why)...<!--break-->

Not surprisingly, logos are good to have. So what should we do now? Mandate the use of a single, perfectly defined logo? No! (That doesn't sounds very Web 2.0, does it??) MDG is leaning towards a consumer-driven POV:

"Give me a logo that communicates an idea, and give me a different logo when the idea is different."

Sound familiar? You've seen this to various degrees in the marketplace. Major league baseball brought back historic logos. Google "dresses" their logo up all the time (Absolute Vodka dresses their product!). The principle behind this strategy may go as follows:

1. Your brand is your Name.

2. Unless you sell burgers, there are many qualities of your product that trump the appeal of "brand uniformity through an image."

3. That kind of brand uniformity (e.g., McDonald's, Nike) may even be a bit distasteful these days. (Globalization by way of marketing ingenuity never really struck a chord anyway...)

4. Anyway, if your Name is good enough, it's bigger than a single image.

5. Diversify. Play. Be progressively community-minded. Be digital. Be forward-thinking. Let Your People Create and Self-regulate! (Hey, empower them with <a href="http://pk.tc-library.org">a shared online archive</a>.)

(6. Wait and see how it all turns out. Plan your exit from your design career strategy accordingly.)
