<p>Online education is still in an experimental phase of trial and error. Many educators and researchers are experimenting with online course design to determine which elements most positively affect learning outcomes. New research considers how online course design could take valuable lessons from journalism to transform student experiences with interactive storytelling.</p>
 
<p>Researchers have identified five key elements that all online educational storytelling should have: dynamic presentation, data visualization, multisensory elements, interactivity, and narration. Each of these journalistic components can be incorporated into the course design itself, making the overarching theme of the class one continuous story.</p>
 
<p>To incorporate dynamic presentation into the course design, instructors can make their instructional material engaging with the use of video, movement, or action; this simple action has been shown to enhance student learning. Instructors can create data visualizations by using charts and graphs to portray information, and they can include multisensory elements such as video, audio, and images directly onto the course site. Both of these components cut down on the amount of text present on the page and increase the number of interactive elements.</p>
 
<p>Instructors can also infuse more interactivity into their courses by giving more control to the students. When they browse through course material, they should be able to control the direction of the story with their keyboard. This helps build student engagement, which leads to increased levels of interest in the course material. Finally, it is important for a course that adopts interactive storytelling to have a central narrative. This has been shown to help learners process material with less cognitive load, making it easier to retain the information.</p>
 
<p>When these elements are used successfully in a course design, researchers find that students report enhanced learning, feel more engaged and motivated, and have overall better learning experiences. In addition, several of these elements correlate directly to improved learning outcomes. While interactive storytelling is just one of the many experimental features that could improve online course design, it could be the key element some courses need to boost student engagement, learning outcomes, and satisfaction in their online class.</p>
