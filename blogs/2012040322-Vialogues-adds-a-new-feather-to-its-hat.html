Vialogues has been bestowed with the Best Website for Teaching and Learning 2012. 

Congrats to EdLab and Vialogues Team for getting it, this is just the beginning and sky is the limit.

For people interested in reading the email we received from the AASL, here it goes:
<Email>
On behalf of the American Association of School Librarians (AASL), I would like to congratulate Vialogues on being recognized as a Best Website for Teaching and Learning 2012. The American Association of School Librarians, a division of the American Library Association (ALA), promotes the improvement and extension of library services in elementary and secondary schools as a means of strengthening the total education program. AASL's mission is to advocate excellence, facilitate change and develop leaders in the school library field.
 
The Best Websites for Teaching and Learning Award honors websites, tools, and resources of exceptional value to inquiry-based teaching and learning as embodied in the AASL's Standards for the 21st-Century Learner. The recognized websites foster the qualities of innovation, creativity, active participation, and collaboration. They are free, web-based sites that are user friendly and encourage a community of learners to explore and discover. The sites will be announced during the ALA's 2012 Annual Conference in Anaheim, California, on Saturday, June 23, 2012. In addition, AASL will promote the websites to school library professionals and educators throughout the coming year on their website, www.aasl.org, and on the Best Websites for Teaching and Learning Award website, www.ala.org/aasl/bestlist.
 
Please note â€” information regarding the 2012 Best Websites is embargoed until the announcement is made at 10:00 a.m. Pacific on June 23, 2012.  At that time, AASL will publish a press release and information can be shared with the general public.
 
After June 23, we hope you will proudly display the award logo on your website. You may contact Jennifer Habley, Web Communications Manager, at jhabley@ala.org for more information. Thank you for all the work you do to create innovative resources to support teaching and learning in the 21st century!
