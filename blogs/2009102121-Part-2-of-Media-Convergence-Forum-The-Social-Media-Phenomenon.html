            The Social Media Phenomenon: Branding Success (Panel Discussion with members of Starbucks, Best Buy, Samsung)

Companies (like Starbucks with MyStarbucks) using customer generated ideas to drive how they create and deliver products. Got tens of thousands of ideas through a social networking approach to getting customer ideas, a small number of which were actually implemented in stores. Also used social networks as a way to communicate with customers about corporate priorities. 

Best Buy: using twitter as a forum for customers to come and ask questions for both sales and support. 

Samsung: social media no longer a PC phenomenon, but now a phenomenon that is driven by different types of devices (televisions, mobile phones, etc.). 

Organizational changes theme: need to put new human resources in place to handle social networking work aimed at taking advantage of these new platforms. Need to have personnel who participate actively (for support, participating in user discussions, etc.). 

Give customers a place to complain and give feedback openly — make it as easy as possible, even though this may seem damaging to the brand. Complaints can also signal passion for a brand, so you may not necessarily want to discourage it. 

Team building for media convergence — how do you set your human resource strategy to make the most of new social media. 
-	Best Buy — mix traditional marketers with new social media teams to create exchange of knowledge and better mix of marketing campaigns. 

Mining data on large social networking sites is very tricky and can create a lot of user backlash. How do you manage the balance between not upsetting consumers by invading their privacy or overwhelming them with commercial messages, while still finding a way to monetize large social networks. 
-	Starbucks: avoid making users become receivers of lots of messages in one direction (from company to user). 
-	Best Buy: need the social relationship between company and consumer to be mutually beneficial. 
-	Samsung: no substitute for having human being helping to guide the actual discussions and content provided to consumers. Must be careful with automated recommendation b/c it can become overwhelming and annoying for consumers. 

Tradeoffs between different uses of social media: marketing/sales vs. product design/crowdsourcing vs. support, etc. 
-	Create places for people to engage with one another (not just with the business).  More success with brand building, not with product design as much (at least at Starbucks). 
-	Best Buy: began work with vendors and customers to build products based on customer input (eg. Laptops). 

Negative viral campaigns against a company — need to address it directly and proactively.
