            *Not really "real" as my attached certificate of completion plainly points-out, "Disclaimer: This online offering of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence does not affirm that you were enrolled as a Stanford student in any way; it does not confer a Stanford grade; it does not confer Stanford credit; and it does not confer a Stanford degree or a certificate."  

<b>If not REAL then... what?</b>
Ok, so I completed the "basic" track of a singular online educational experiment in distributed learning taught by <a href="https://www.ai-class.com/home/">two Stanford professors</a>.  What does this mean for me as a student of life and for my future?  In the spirit of inquiry, lets start at the beginning to try to explore all angles of what this, "honorary" credential really means and could be worth on the current credential market...  First, If I were to get "credit" for completing a "real" Stanford class I would be one course closer to a degree from Stanford.  Second, I would also very likely begin to carry many thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt.  This online credential was free.  Finally, I run the risk of realizing after completing this course that the AI track at Stanford isn't the right field for me (this was not the case for me! I am even more curious about the field after this course... ), having again wasted many thousands of dollars and in-class hours. 

<b>An Alternate Path...</b>
Plan B, a learner continues to self credential, promotes their "virtual" credential and shows a portfolio of real-world work either created on their own or in conjunction with a job.  It seems that the current state of affairs is that you either stay within an institution or now, thanks to Stanford and soon <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6969">M.I.T.x</a> you can gain some level of mastery, create your own demonstrable example of this mastery and then leverage it to potential employers or create your own employment.  

<b>What is a Virtual Credential Really Worth?</b>
I am skipping over a big hurdle and question, especially in this economy... will a real* credential from a very REAL institution carry any weight in the current job market?  This remains to be seen, but if I were an employer, and I am not, I would be even more impressed with the prospective employee who through sheer will, tech acumen and perseverance self-credentials.  It is much harder to motivate yourself to do or complete something, in this case an online course, for "no credit," than to complete the same course at an institution that pushes you along in the giant mill of American education.  I should know, I came very close to dropping this virtual course as my "real" life became even more real.  

Stay-tuned for an in-depth <b>i/o Learning exploration</b> of my experience taking the "Basic" track of this course!  Many kudos to anyone who completed the advanced track!
