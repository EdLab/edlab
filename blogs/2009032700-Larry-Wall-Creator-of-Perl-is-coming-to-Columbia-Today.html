          <p>
            I feel people might be interested in attending the session on <b>The Art of Ballistic Programming</b> conducted by Larry Wall, creator of Perl and author of "Programming Perl." The session will be held on 
Friday, March 27th, 12:15pm, Lerner Cinema, Columbia University. 

I have already booked four seats and if people are interested they can use my booking there. In case one wants to RSVP, please <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/larry-wall-talk">click here</a>.

Bio:

Larry Wall, programmer, linguist, author, born March 10, 1949 in Duncan, British Columbia, Canada, and is most widely known for his creation of the Perl computer language in 1987.

Wall is also known as the original author of the rn Usenet software, and the nearly universally used patch. He has won the IOCCC twice, and was the recipient of the first Free Software Foundations award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998.

Beyond his technical skills, Wall is known for his wit and often ironic sense of humor which he displays in the comments to his source code or on Usenet (e.g. "We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can't agree on when it's necessary to compromise").

Larry Wall is a trained linguist, which helped him with his book writing, as well as with the design of Perl. He is the co-author of Programming Perl (often referred to as the Camel Book), which is the definitive resource for Perl programmers. He has also edited the Perl Cookbook and all of the books he has edited or co-written are published by O'Reilly.

Wall continues to oversee further development of Perl and serves as the Benevolent Dictator for Life of the Perl project.
