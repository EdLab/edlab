            In the New York Times this week, David Leonhardt has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/economy/25leonhardt.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2">penned a call</a> for more fairness in college admissions policies.  Taking his cue from Anthony Marx, the former president of Amherst who adjusted the school's admissions policies so as to admit more low-income students, Leonhardt tells us “the model isn't only the fairest one and the right one for the economy. It's also the best one for the colleges themselves. Attracting the best of the best – not just the best of the affluent – and letting them learn from one another is the whole point of a place like Amherst.”
<!--break-->
Leonhardt's argument gains some force from his claim that being fairer in admissions wouldn't hurt America but rather increase economic growth. But this depends on there being a large group of low-income students who are under-educated by the current system. “Incredibly,” Leonhardt writes, “only 44 percent of low-income high school seniors with high standardized test scores enroll in a four-year college, according to a Century Foundation report – compared with about 50 percent of high-income seniors who have average test scores.” Greg Mankiw, the popular economics blogger, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/05/regression-i-would-like-to-see.html">takes issue</a> with this framework, arguing that there isn't any good evidence that these low-income students who are being rejected from elite colleges are actually as well prepared or as capable of the work. 

Working off of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Longer-Separate-Not-Yet-Equal/dp/0691141606/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1306509841&sr=8-1">Thomas Espenshade's analysis</a> (he found that, ceteris paribus, poor whites have a much harder time getting into school than rich whites, whereas the situation is the opposite for black or Hispanic minorities), I read Leonhardt's column as a concealed attempt to shift our society from race-based to class-based preferences, concealed because if he said out loud that the result will be less representation of non-Asian minorities at elite colleges, his proposal would be more controversial to liberals.
