            --After, some informal conversations,  some necessary reflections about my ‘academic' visions,  and inevitable eavesdropping, I would like to share the core ideas of an  introductory text-insert from a dvd compilation titled Dynamic Documents from Art.--

DYNAMIC DOCUMENTS: gadgets, artifacts and other object hypothesis.
It seems more accurate to view thought and experience as occurring behind or beneath spoken words, as being something that saying helps to adumbrate and communicate and that writing (or rewriting) falsifies to the extent that it turns the natural products of mentation–fluid, layered, dense, episodic, too deep and rich for words –into something unnaturally hard-edged, linear, precise, and refined. We “thinkâ€? like logicians primarily on (and because of) paper. If we assume that thought and experience are made wholly of language it is only because, as twentieth-century “hyperliteratesâ€?, we read and write reality more than we live it---Ellen Dissanayake, Homo Aestheticus, 1992.

	As an individual concern with the procedures of art practice and their interaction with “educationâ€? in an academic context, I see a need for fundamental alteration in prevailing patterns of continuity and change.  To generate moments of learning we should consider alternative explorations and explanations beyond the written word.  The proposed dynamic documents attempt to capture, evolve and transform the expected activities of a discipline, department or institution. The transformational character of form, conceptual manipulation, and information management initiate a new approach to the current conditions of academic products. They are artifacts based on uncommon assumptions about the nature of the world and even positions that may “feelâ€? illogical to the normal understanding of how things operate.  As Stone and Zander mention in ART OF POSSIBILITIES, the shift should be attempted,  less by arguing and more through generating active experiences implemented through ongoing practices. The uncommon research products become visual semiconscious interactive understandings from and for a civilization of practice that is composed by a visible side not only in a system of values but in a world of forms, codes of behavior,  rules and exceptions; and a submerged invisible side inhabited by beliefs, desires, fears, repressions, and dreams; the private and the public.

	The gadgets, artifacts, or ‘object-hypotheses'  are examples of a possible diversification of knowledge products that branch from artistic-design practice and the reticence to the extensive verbal linear standards. These textualized standards reaffirm old beliefs in such a way to perpetuate themselves long after their usefulness has passed.  They were built on assumptions that have evolved, and shared knowledge distant from current practices as original conditions have changed.  According to Gregory (the Intelligent Eye), the object-hypotheses are units, of multi-sensory data, representing their own particular view scaled to fit the prevailing situation of current practices. Through the ongoing artistic-design practice the knowledge forms change from standardized verbal sequences, papers, articles and essays, into media models, dynamic documents, knowledge objects, learning gears–diagrams, images, software, research trailers, etc. A prevalent methodology of artification is necessary to create the dynamic document.  Dissanayake summarizes this process as the deliberate performed operations, sometimes with variation, that occur instinctively during a ritualized behavior of doing art.  

	Although their original content may not differ from existing verbal practices,  the dynamic documents  are disconnected from rhetorical strategies and the universe of discourse.  They cross a threshold of form and inhabit a new landscape.  And as alternative representations of an investigation,  they are a natural extension of an adaptive human capacity for creating cognitive models that stand without prosthetic developments of formal literary structures (Josepth Carroll, Evolution and Literary Theory, 1999).  Kiesler (Founder of the Correalism Design Institute, at Columbia University in the mid 50s) has considered the linguistic interpretations of the objects as captions that are artificial, conform judgment and disguise as education.  Under ‘correalism' he framed the objects of his practice as symbol and agents of an artificial duality of ‘vision' and ‘reality' or ‘image (object)' and ‘environment'.   

	The population of dynamic documents must not be understood as a combination of the many and the one or the sum of the parts, but rather a specific organization belonging to those participating, which have no need whatsoever for unity in order to be recognize as a system (Delanda, Intensive Science andd Virtual Philosophy, 2002) of practice.  They intend to provide an exploration and propositions apart from linguistic-hierchical explanations. These documents contribute to a civilization of practice that shifts from Textualism inquiry that claims to be knowledge of a world only through knowledge of a text (Caroll, 1999), toward active understanding through sensory engagement that trace their own path in a natural process of detachment from texts.  The alternative  proposed forms  reassess the measurement system of knowledge units, from external explanatory verbal models to specific ‘material' understandings; from written documents to generative artifacts that emerge as new  practices based on current conditions and possibilities.
