<p>AP physics teacher Johnny Devine uses daily <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum">scrum</a> meetings to keep his students accountable and on-task during group projects. Every morning, students meet and report to their group members what they have accomplished since their last meeting, what they will work on before their next meeting, and current worries they have about the project. Every group uses a poster to visualize their progress. Pending tasks are tracked in one column, and when students begin working on a task, they transfer a sticky note with the task and their name on it into the in-progress column. The last column notes finished work. In this video, Levineâ€™s students use scrum to complete a project about planning a mission to Mars.</p>

<p>Devine considers scrum a process that both provides structure and encourages agency. He is convinced that in order for real student-centered learning to occur, the teacher must occupy a managerial role. How do you conceive of the role of the teacher in a project-based classroom?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:07 Anna Curry: </b>I think this approach teaches students skills that will impact them for the rest of their lives. Working in teams requires management and accountability and this process shows students how to do that. In the computer engineering world, SCRUM is a popular management process. If they go into these fields, these students will be one step ahead.</p>

<p><b>@01:23 Sara Hardman: </b>This type of group learning style could play a big role in how students work in groups in the future. I think more than anything, scrum helps keep team members on the same page and on track, so that no one person gets left behind or has to take on the brunt of the work. And I think this skill set could be useful for any student who does work in groups in their future jobs.</p>
