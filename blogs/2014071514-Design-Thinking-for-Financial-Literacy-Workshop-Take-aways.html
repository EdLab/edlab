            Overall the workshop was an energy filled two hour session. The participants seemed most excited when they were talking to each other. They loved sharing stories and imagining lessons when there are no barriers. “Remember, there are no barriers,” one participant reminded her colleague mid-prototype session. The license to imagine and build out an idea really seemed to fill the participants with a lot of excitement that made the whole process very rewarding for us to organize and run.

Specific Take-aways

1. We learned to be flexible and to accommodate members who were late to the event. 

2. Participants seemed to enjoy our selection of videos, including two videos about design thinking and a variety of short videos (many of which we borrowed from you) about financial literacy. 

3. Brainstorm: We learned that participants actually generated MORE ideas when one person wrote down ideas and the others shouted out ideas one-at-a-time. The first time, when both Carmen and Chingfu were writing ideas, it got very hectic. The second time, when just Carmen wrote down ideas and Chingfu asked everyone to say their ideas slowly and clearly so that Carmen had enough time to write, MORE ideas were generated. This was a great lesson in clear instructions and doing things in an organized fashion. 

4. Based on your feedback earlier last week, we added more specific instructions for the prototyping activities: we gave them one worksheet to write down the basics of their learning module (topics, goals, financial literacy concepts) and a poster to draw advertisement for their learning module. The poster worked great as a visual to convey ideas.

5. For the second group, we set a timer for group prototype presentation in an effort to make them more concisely convey major ideas. We were excited and amazed at how succesful this strategy was. We gave each group 1:30 and this was more than enough time.

6. Both workshops started late, and so we skipped the part where groups could ask each other questions after each prototype. It would have been really great to be able to include this.

7. participants expressed interests in DT and asked for the materials and slides we prepared for the events

8. several members came up to us after the events and expressed interests in Vialogues and we're glad to have the opportunity to promote our products!
