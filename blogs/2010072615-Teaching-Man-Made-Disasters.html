          <p>
            History and the geological makeup of our planet ensures us that humans are unable to stop natural disasters. 

But those disasters that we humans create are the most preventable and as the frequency of such disasters increase, its impact on the environment and others has become greater. Here is an interesting article on the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1686204_1686252_1690600,00.html">Top Ten Man-Made Disasters of 2007</a>. <p>

Of late, I am sure we all have been glued to the events of the Gulf Coast and the oil disaster there. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill">BP Oil Spill</a> has already surpassed the damage caused by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill">Exxon Valdez Oil Spill</a>, and it is noted as the largest offshore oil disaster in U.S. history. The BP Oil Spill flowed at 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of crude oil per day compared to that of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, which spilled such amounts about every four to seven days. This <a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/gulf-oil-spill-impacts-460610">article</a> talks about the possible long term effects of the oil spill. <p>

On a personal note, I hope that this man-made disaster and others like it are introduced and taught more in the classroom. In the course of my now three years in high school, I have yet to encounter any textbook, especially in history or a social science course, that devote a large amount of text space to man made disasters. I think such disasters offer teachable moments as most often have huge political, health, economical, social and environmental implications. For instance, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986, the largest such disaster in recorded history, led to a slowdown in the building of nuclear power plants and the economic and political fallout from it continues to this day. An event such as Chernobyl, which occurred during the dying days of the Cold War and the Soviet Union, could offer teachers a chance to teach the end of the Soviet empire through the lens of the disaster and how the political fallout from it was one of the contributing factors to the eventual collapse of the Soviet empire. If issues like these were to be taught and discussed in the classroom, students will have a better understanding of the history they are been taught and as the adage goes, every historical moment has its roots in something that had previously occurred. <p>
