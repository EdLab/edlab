<p><b>Title:</b> The Role of Entrepreneurship Clubs and Societies in Entrepreneurial Learning (2010)
<p>
<b>Author(s):</b> Luke Pittaway, Elena Rodriquez-Falcon, Olaojo Aiyegbayo, and Amanda King
</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> There is a presumption among entrepreneurial educators that clubs and societies complement formal entrepreneurial education programs because they offer students opportunities to gain skills that are relevant to future venture creation. Some of these skills include converting problems into opportunities, dealing with uncertainty, reflecting on experiences and collaborative-friendly social skills. Little research exists, however, that rigorously examines the learning benefits of entrepreneurial clubs. To bridge this gap, the authors of <a href=" http://intl-isb.sagepub.com/content/29/1/37.full.pdf+html  "> The role of entrepreneurship clubs and societies in entrepreneurial learning </a> set out to understand the extent to which student entrepreneurship clubs and societies impact entrepreneurial learning. Based on answers from 27 interviews and 28 "e-mail postcard" responses, the authors explored why students joined entrepreneurship and investment clubs, and what they learned by participating in them. 

<p><b>Findings:</b> The findings showed that networking for future employment was a primary motivator for joining entrepreneurship clubs. Other reasons included beefing up resumes, obtaining relevant knowledge about starting a business, gaining practical skills, and helping others. The results also suggested that entrepreneurship clubs and societies provide important "learning by doing" opportunities. Facing challenging situations that demanded a reflective process in order to think of a solution was particularly fruitful in terms of entrepreneurial learning. Of particular relevance to entrepreneurship, students also said that clubs and societies fostered social learning in ways that the traditional classroom cannot. Engaging in club tasks such as organizing events with others, public speaking, and networking were some of the activities that students said helped encourage social learning.
<p>

<b>Moving Forward:</b>
In light of these research findings, it seems aspiring entrepreneurs would benefit from participating in entrepreneurship clubs and societies because of their social and action-oriented learning opportunities. The authors recognized the limitations of their small-scale exploratory study and advocate for a larger one that compares different organizational practices across entrepreneurship clubs and societies. 


<p>
An interesting aspect of the studyâ€™s research design was the use of e-postcards. Though they had low postcard response rates, the presumption was that this new technology would provide a quick and easy way to reach out to a wide net of research participants. Future research should explore and experiment with ways of improving upon this method, which could lead to a boost in response rates.
