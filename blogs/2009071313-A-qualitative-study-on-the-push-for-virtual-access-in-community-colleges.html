            “Virtual Access” (Cox, 2006) is a chapter that focuses on online education and how it has been adopted, implemented, and viewed during its seminal stages in the early 2000's. It focuses specifically on community colleges and the reasons behind their adoption of online instruction. It also provides a critical analysis of equity and quality problems that surface with the new online paradigm.

After conducting a detailed qualitative survey of 15 different colleges, Cox's study concludes that competitive advantage and business concerns have driven many administrators to prioritize developing online courses. While this focus has fueled rapid development of such offerings, the author and the faculty of many of these colleges seem to agree that learning goals have often suffered at the expense of the desire to build competitive advantage for institutions. For example, the author points to data showing that colleges have focused primarily on investing in the technology infrastructure and limited organizational capacity to offer online courses. They have not focused on providing new training or reviewing and applying research on what learning paradigms can truly improve the quality of pedagogy. As a result, the Cox's study finds that most online courses are simply a virtual “port” of face-to-face courses with no consideration of what works online. Faculty and other college stakeholders often report some disappointment with how the promises of online education have been realized. 

The chapter also provides many other areas of insights that are worth looking in to. It concludes that while online offerings have often been touted as a tool to increase equity and access, they have done neither. There is an absence of quality online offerings, and even the ones that are out there are often taken in complement to traditional courses. In other words, most enrollees already have access to higher education; online courses are not increasing the availability of such education to new segments of the population.

All is not lost in online education, however. The author does point to many areas of further research and work that are necessary before anything close to a final conclusion can be made about the power of e-learning. In particular, there needs to be more nuanced and focused research on the quality of online offerings and the characteristics of a program that is effective. Furthermore, there needs to be more integration between the technology and organization capacity needs of e-learning and the professional development and pedagogical research that should underpin how online instruction is delivered.
