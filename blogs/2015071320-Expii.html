<p><a href="https://www.expii.com/">Expii</a> is a digital math and science textbook that operates like a wiki, as its content is completely crowdsourced. Anyone can author a section, which may include photos, videos, text explanations, and quiz questions to test the reader. Created by a group of students, scientists and coaches, Expii is designed to be a supplementary tool for education, immersing individuals in the topics they are learning to maximize comprehension. This digital textbook has an interactive navigator that maps topics and links them together based on their interconnectedness within the field. Users can either search for particular topics, or explore this subject map to find lessons. To make adding content simple, Expii has created its own markup language, which can be accessed by viewing the author history, where the new authors can mimic the style.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Each entry can be awarded "fame" by others who verify that the content is accurate and helpful. The names of the authors of each section are all displayed on the side along with the percentage of their contribution to the content, so there is no anonymity and everyone is given proper credit. There is a peer support section called <i>Expii Concourse</i>, similar to a forum, where discussions occur around different topics. There are also discussion threads where users guide one another to format added content and navigate the site. The ability to see if others are currently online so that you can have a realtime conversation with them is a beneficial addition that provides Expiians with immediate support as they learn from and teach others.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It is somewhat difficult for those who are new to Expii to find support guides, since they are accessed through the navigator within the "Universe" bubble, where one might expect to see only textbook content. Users can simply search for topics if they are not willing to hunt for them on the interactive map, but the search tab suggests an overwhelming number of entries as users type their queries, most of which have zero entries when clicked. Expii is new, around one year old, and so there is a long way to go before most topics are filled with information. More outreach efforts for crowdsourcing could help the build out the content more quickly.  As with any wiki, there is always a question of how credible the sources are, although the "fame" ratings do help a bit to determine the reliability of the entries.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you are looking for a standalone virtual textbook, Expii is not the tool. It has been specifically designed by its founders to be a supplemental learning resource. Although the amount of content must vastly increase, the premise of this digital source is promising. Adding information is beneficial since it allows the authors to practice using Expii's proprietary markup language, which could serve as an introduction to basic functional coding, and could also help authors gain a better understanding of a topic through teaching it to others. If the content grows in scope, Expii would be a valuable study tool for teachers to incorporate into their curricula to improve student interactions with particularly difficult content.</p>
