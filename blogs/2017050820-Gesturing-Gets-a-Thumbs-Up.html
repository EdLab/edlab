<p>How might GIFs increase students’ learning? What about mimicking or using a motion? Recently, animations and the use of gesturing as instructional strategies have received attention as ways to improve learning outcomes. This study describes two experiments that investigate the effect of gesturing when learning a new language from animations and static images.</p>
 
<p>Participants across this study’s two experiments learned unfamiliar alphabets from one of two different languages. In the first experiment, 48 participants learned to write nine Mandarin characters. They were assigned at random to one of four groups: animation, no animation (still image), gestures, or no gestures. In the animation condition, participants watched a video of the characters being drawn. In contrast, in the no-animation condition they looked at step-by-step photos of the same process. In the gesturing group, participants were asked to use their index finger to trace characters in the air as they viewed them, whereas, in the non-gesturing condition, participants were asked to sit still. Participants were scored on their abilities to form the correct strokes in the character. The methods used in the second study were the same as the first; the only difference was that participants were younger learners who wrote nine characters from the Persian alphabet.</p>
 
<p>The results of both studies suggest that gesturing was only helpful for static materials but was not beneficial for the animated videos where the movement was clearly shown. Results from the second experiment confirmed that animated visuals were superior to still images and that gesturing had better learning outcomes than non-gesturing. In other words, learning from multimedia may have an added benefit if learners are encouraged to gesture as they learn. These findings suggest that animations and gesturing are most useful when the content being taught is more difficult, which in turn provides insights into when and how to incorporate gesturing and animation for learning.</p>
