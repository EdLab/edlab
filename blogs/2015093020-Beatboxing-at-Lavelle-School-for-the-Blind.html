<p>Students at the Lavelle School for the Blind in the Bronx encounter a host of barriers in the classroom, so coming up with a curriculum that addresses the needs of every student is of the utmost importance for teachers and staff.</p>
 
<p>After seeing the positive way students reacted to his music during a school event, teacher James Kin decided to include beatboxing as an integral part of the school curriculum. Since then, these blind and visually impaired students have been excelling in the B.E.A.T. Rockers Program, where each student learns how to produce the <i>kick drum</i>, the <i>hi-hat</i> and the <i>snare</i> percussion sounds with their mouths as a part of their speech therapy curriculum.</p>
 
<p>The program's creators find beatboxing to be an effective tool for speech therapists to help students achieve their speech goals faster and more effectively, while having fun in the process. By allowing students to express themselves through the production of their own sound, they are providing them with a voice and growing their confidence.</p>
 
<p>How well does this curriculum align with the academic needs of students at Lavelle? Join the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23418/"> Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>
 
<p><b>@01:50 abagigah92:</b> It’s great to see how these students collaborate together and learn speech therapy through music. Although their blind being in this environment will give them the confidence to speak and express themselves. This school is doing an amazing job.</p>
 
<p><b>@02:00 Kafou:</b> Music is powerful tool of communication, it’s a universal language which is spoken by everyone regardless the race, countries or language or what you believe in.</p>
