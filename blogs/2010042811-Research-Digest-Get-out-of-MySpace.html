<b><span style="font-size: small;">Article Review</span></b></h6>
Social  media have become an inseparable part of most people's daily lives.  Scholars in the field of education are increasingly paying attention to how  social media could enhance teaching and learning experience. In this  paper, Jones et al (2010) investigated the opportunities and challenges  social media have presented to higher education. Using both quantitative  (web-based questionnaires, 76 respondents) and qualitative (interviews,  14 interviewees) instruments, they explored students' perspectives on  educational technology in general and on social software for learning  from four UK universities. The major findings from quantitative data  revealed that PowerPoint and Virtual Learning Environment (e.g.  Blackboard) are the most used educational technology, and 70% of the  respondents rarely or never use social software for learning. However,  respondents also indicated the major reasons for educational technology  usage are social (e.g. peer sharing, more communication platform). In  the interviews, students indicated their inclinations to separate social  life from studying, concerns about copyright issues and sense of  information flood. Based on Vygotsky's social learning perspectives,  Jones et al (2010) suggested that higher education institutions should  facilitate community of inquiry that combines some extent of both  learning and social life, <span style="color: black;">and design environment  that allows users to decide how they would like to combine/separate  these two domains. </span>Understand students' experience and  expectations is an important step for this effort. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Findings from  this study provide valuable insight for decision makers and instructors  in higher education institutions. However, several caveats seem to  apply to these findings. First, it is unclear how questionnaire samples  were selected, which makes readers wonder to what extent these findings  could represent students' experience. Secondly, one interviewee's  statement of "Get out of MySpace" well illustrates his/her perception of  separated worlds of social media and learning environment. To  strengthen this theme, however, more analysis of qualitative data is  needed since only one interviewee's perspective was incorporated for  this point. These caveats aside, findings from this paper would  contribute to timely academic conversations in this area. This academia  catch up is extremely important due to rapid changing social media and  learning landscape.

EdLab  D&amp;R team has been working on a new social learning platform (SLP)  that aims to help TC community members to teach and learn from each  others' expertise and build professional networks (proposal <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3285" id="z4:q" title="Ivory Server">here</a>; work in progress <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3881" id="sb_a" title="here">here</a>). The findings from this paper, despite of  caveats, provide some justifications for the development of SLP. As many  students felt overwhelmed by information flood and inclined to separate  their social space from learning space, the design of an institutional  social learning platform could serve as the portal that synchronizes all  learning resources and professional relationships<span style="color: black;">.</span>  Nonetheless, based on design thinking spirit at EdLab and other  guidelines suggested by Jones et al, this optimistic hypothesis deserves  some empirical verification such as a pilot survey about TC students' views on social learning platform or relevant data analysis from current TC virtual learning platform.
