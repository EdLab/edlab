<p>Imagine if PowerPoint, YouTube, and online quizzing combined into one unified product. That’s essentially what <a href="https://www.zaption.com/">Zaption</a> is, as one multimodal form of video presentation and instruction. Teachers can use Zaption to create lessons centered around a video and overlay supplementary features like text, images, hyperlinks, polls, and quizzes throughout its duration.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>When using Zaption, teachers can select specific times to show slides with text, drawings, or images on the sidebar of the video. This can serve as an effective way to annotate video content for students to digest relevant information as they watch and listen. Users can also add features like embedded quizzes in the middle of videos, and the video will pause briefly for students to input their answers. Questions can be created for open responses or numerical ones, providing users with flexibility in the quizzing process.</p>

<p>Zaption also allows you to trim and edit the video itself, making it easy to manipulate videos to fit the scope of the intended lesson. Zaption’s interface is uncomplicated and easy to use, and tutorial videos are available for beginners who are unfamiliar with the program. Its video gallery also hosts numerous videos in nearly every academic subject, from 20th Century America and Art of the Renaissance to Macbeth and Slinky Physics, all of which are crowdsourced and free to use for teachers and students alike.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Zaption offers quizzing functionality for teachers to assess student learning, access to detailed data (such as individual student responses) from these assessments is only available in the Pro version, which costs $10 a month. The Pro membership is also available at a team price ($45 per month for up to five teachers) or a campus-wide price ($200 per month for up to 15 teachers).</p>
 
<p>The system could also be improved with more features on the student end to turn it into a study aid. For example, although it can be convenient that students do not need an account to use Zaption, student accounts could be a good thing if they offered tools like video annotations for note-taking or highlighting important segments of the video. In this way, students could use Zaption as more than just an initial lesson, but also as a study resource for upcoming tests.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Zaption is a great video tool for the classroom because it provides teachers with a way to add extra layers of multimedia to videos so that they can better engage their students. Although there are certainly ways that Zaption could make the experience more student-friendly by building autonomous learning options, the program as a whole will likely be a valuable resource for classes of any age.</p>
