<p><b>Title:</b> The Effect of Positive Feedback in a Constraint-Based Intelligent Tutoring System (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Antonija Mitrovica, Stellan Ohlsson, & Devon K. Barrow</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Adaptive online tutoring systems often rely on student errors to trigger hints and instruction, but observation of human educators reveals that most successful tutors eschew this strategy in favor of positive reinforcement. <i>The Effect of Positive Feedback in a Constraint-Based Intelligent Tutoring System</i> discusses the importance of positive feedback in the practice of tutoring and applies this idea to digital tutoring systems. The authors found that tutors employed positive feedback as an instructional strategy to help reinforce tentative but correct problem solving steps. The study used SQL-Tutor, a college-level database query language tutor, which uses constraints to validate student solutions.</p>
 
<p>The researchers integrated positive feedback into the system which was triggered when students made correct steps towards solving the problem, triumphed over difficulties, and completed tasks. A controlled study was conducted during a month-long introduction to databases course. The control group used the regular, negative feedback SQL-Tutor and the experimental group used the augmented version, which contained positive feedback in addition to the original feedback. The researchers measured time on task and conducted pre- and post-tests for participants.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The experimental group spent half as much time as the control group (92.3 min. vs. 193.8 min.) reaching system mastery with no significant difference in exam scores. These results showed that students who received both positive and negative feedback mastered a controlled amount of new content knowledge in half the time required by students who received negative feedback only. This suggests that intelligent tutoring systems that teach primarily by addressing errors and misconceptions might be more effective if they also included positive student feedback.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The results of this study are surprising and important for edtech development. Adding positive feedback to tutoring systems might be a low-cost way to increase product efficiency. More research is needed to uncover the most beneficial order of positive and negative feedback and when feedback should be deployed in tutoring systems. The gender ratios were also skewed in this particular study, so future research might investigate the role of positive and negative feedback in tutoring systems for other disciplines with more even gender distributions.</p>
