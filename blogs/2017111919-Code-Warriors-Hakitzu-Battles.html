<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/code-warriors-hakitzu-battles-learn-to-code-through/id599976903?mt=8">Code Warriors: Hakitzu Battles </a> is a code learning app disguised as a robot fighting game. The battles are fought via JavaScript programming. I played through the iOS version, but it’s also available on Android and desktop computer.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Code Warriors’ graphics and animations are quite good, especially for a game that is completely free. Giant robots blasting each other with lasers will certainly attract a lot of kids. </p> 

<p>The gameplay has aspects of chess, but it’s more akin to tactical-style role-playing games. Levels present puzzle-like challenges to destroy the enemy team within limited numbers of turns and actions. Finding a solution requires considerable trial and error.</p> 

<p>The beginning portion of Code Warriors doesn’t actually involve much coding. The user simply chooses the commands and then executes the program. It starts more logic-based, with code displayed on the side of the screen. Because coding has such a steep learning curve, the slow build helps to ease students into a complicated subject. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>As mentioned, the actual coding doesn’t start until later in the game. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword. If students only play through the first half, they really won’t learn how to code. Players need to have some commitment to the game’s progression.</p>  

<p>The latter half of Code Warriors is quite difficult, too. Players must type out memorized lines of codes to command their cyborg heroes. Since I played the phone app version, typing everything on the screen was too cumbersome. Students may stop playing right as the most beneficial juncture of the game begins. </p> 

<p>There are also a few minor issues that could easily be tweaked by the designers. First, there is no way to turn off the music/ sound effects. I’d rather listen to podcasts instead of machine guns firing and metal screeching, even if some kids enjoy those effects. Second, the animations get repetitive after the first few levels. Watching a robot run across a junkyard to fire a laser cannon at enemy combatants becomes mundane after the 17th viewing. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Playing through the entire game will certainly teach kids the basics of JavaScript. The beginning stages will allow players to start thinking about logic and order of operations, but this also might be too simplistic. Many students may just quit playing once the difficulty increases.</p> 

<p>Code Warriors is free, so there is little downside to at least trying the game. But, I would suggest checking out the <a href="http://www.codewarriorsgame.com/kai-web-kai/login">desktop computer version</a> of the game. Using a keyboard would make the latter coding stages much more manageable.</p>
