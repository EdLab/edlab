            Hello everyone!  This is my very first blog post at EdLab, so woohoooo! Though today is technically my second day here, I haven't done that much yet, so I'll probably talk more about my day yesterday.

It was definitely a little overwhelming at first... meeting a bunch of new people, learning things basically all at once... but I think by the end of the day I was really starting to get used to the EdLab culture and my own schedule a little bit. What really helped was that everyone here was extreeeeemely welcoming! It made it really easy to feel comfortable working here and everyone encouraged us to ask a lot of questions, (which was nice, because I had a lot)! 

Here, I am a "Product/Community/Manager" intern, which is kind of a long name, but I basically have a variety of tasks to do.  I feel like I mainly have to help out with both the New Learning Times and the TC Record twitter accounts, and also use Vialogues a lot. I think the hardest thing was just finding content to post on Vialogues and search on YouTube for videos that could possibly go up on NLT. But like Jo said, once you kind of find those "key words" to use when searching, you start to get the hang of it. I ended posting about four of them yesterday. Also it was fun to get to watch a lot of the Vialogues videos already posted.  I got to see a lot of new technology being developed nowadays and it's crazy cool; it's no wonder people are incorporating technology into the classroom culture and education in general.

Also, I just wanted to mention that both Kate and Jo have been really helpful my first day at EdLab! Jo basically sits right next to me, so it's nice that I can just turn around and ask her anything.  It was also nice that a lot of people got lunch together and it was super sweet they treated the interns to lunch our first day!

Anyways, it was a really good day, and did not feel long at all. I'm super excited to continue to work hard and be a part of the EdLab team. Looking forward to be given more tasks and I'm ready to learn a lot this summer!

Thanks for reading!
