<p><b>Title:</b> Ad Hoc Autonomous Agent Teams: Collaboration without
Pre-Coordination (2010)<br>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Stone, Gal A. Kaminka, Sarit Kraus, and Jeffrey S. Rosenschein</p>

<p><b>Source:</b><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Papers/bib2html-links/AAAI10-adhoc.pdf"> The Twenty-Fourth Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)</a></p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> 
The prospect of autonomous robots entering the real world and working alongside humans raises both hopes and fears. As of now, autonomous agents are programmed in units to work together, but do not have the capability to adapt to others’ behaviors and capabilities without knowing them beforehand. The paper, <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/Papers/bib2html-links/AAAI10-adhoc.pdf">Ad Hoc Autonomous Agent Teams: Collaboration without Pre-Coordination</a>, examines the ability of autonomous agents to efficiently cooperate with a set of "ad hoc," or previously unknown, teammates to complete tasks. If such agents could be developed, the possibilities would be endless. They could assist humans and other agents for certain tasks, and even help out in high-risk jobs, such as rescuing people during hurricanes and earthquakes.  However, the challenge presented in the paper is to figure out how individual agents can perform well with any set of teammates.</p>

<p>The authors approached this challenge by using two different methods: theoretical and empirical.  In the theoretical approach, they analyzed the challenge of constructing agents with such flexibility through game theory, where the agent would choose the best response based on the other player’s actions.  In the empirical approach, the authors compared human soccer with robot soccer.  While there are human soccer teams that practice repeatedly with one another, there are also people that join "pick up games," where people play with an unfamiliar group.  Even with language barriers, humans still have the ability to adapt to others’ strengths and weaknesses, and continue the game.  On the other hand, robots are usually programmed in teams, as seen in Robotics tournaments; so far, there are no individual robots that can play soccer with an ad hoc team.</p>

<p><b> Findings:</b>
The results from both approaches show that though there are difficulties in programming autonomous agents who are able to cooperate without pre-coordination, it does not seem impossible.  Looking at the theoretical approach using game theory, the authors found that the ad hoc team agent should learn what strategy the other player is using in order to choose the best response. However, it is much more complicated to learn to do this if the other teammate is also adaptive to the agent’s response. With the empirical approach comparing human soccer and robot soccer, the authors realized it is possible for robots to play a "pick up game" like humans without pre-coordination.  This ad hoc team player would have to be able to quickly evaluate what position it is playing based on comparing its own abilities with the strengths of the other players. Basically, in any situation, these autonomous agents should be able to evaluate surroundings quickly and act accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The process of incorporating autonomous agents into the real world may help us learn more about cooperation, teamwork, and ourselves. For now, we need more research on how to make autonomous agents work with other agents, and possibly humans.  Collaboration between robots and humans promises many potential benefits, but we are only beginning to understand the challenges of achieving such genuine collaboration.
