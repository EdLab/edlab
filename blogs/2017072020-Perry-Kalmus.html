Perry Kalmus is the founder of <a href="http://goakala.com/home/">Akala</a>, a customized "virtual college counselor" that helps students throught the college application process. Directly after college, Kalmus helped his mother, Barbara, launch the Princeton Education Network, a college admissions consulting firm the has served over 13,000 people to help them get into the colleges of their dreams. Kalmus holds a bachelor's in economics from Williams College. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at AKALA?</b><br>
<p>I was very fortunate to have grown up with a pretty incredible academic pedigree. The Princeton public schools are some of the best in the country and then I transferred to the prestigious Lawrenceville School for high school. After that, I graduated from Williams College. While in high school, my mother started an educational consulting firm and she did a lot of professional development work in some of the most challenging districts in New Jersey (e.g., Newark, Hoboken, and New Brunswick). From this, I witnessed first-hand the differences between those educational experiences and my own. Now 15 years after graduating from Williams and having been involved in the College Admissions Consulting business the entire time, I have seen the transformational power of a college degree and, equally important, the trajectory-changing power of a private college counselor to help students be accepted into the best-fit schools of their dreams. That is why we created AKALA. Prior to this, our expertise could only be afforded and accessed by the upper class. We wanted to democratize access to high-quality college admissions counseling. We have to close the <i>massive</i> guidance gap that exists in America today and level the playing field for those without the means to access this necessary help.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at AKALA will change the way parents and students approach the college application process?</b><br>
<p>First and foremost, by starting them early, we hope to not only set expectations appropriately, but also to educate families about the amazing options that are available in terms of schools. So many families are obsessed with the brand names, but the reality is that many of the big brands (e.g., the Ivies, Williams, Amherst, Stanford, etc.) are not good fits for many kids. By educating families early, we can get them behind the idea of <i>not</i> looking at the ranking and instead focusing on the fit. Oftentimes, at our parent education nights, I will hold up a $100 bill and say to families, <i>I am willing to bet this $100 bill that unless you have some reason to know, in which case you’re disqualified, that you’ve never heard of a school called Full Sail University</i>. I am yet to give away that $100 bill, but what I explain to people is that if you were accepted into Princeton, Harvard, and Full Sail, but you knew that your passion was animation and you had the dream of working for a Pixar or Disney or video game production house, you would be a fool to go to Princeton or Harvard. Because the reality is that all of the great animation companies recruit at Full Sail. And they don’t recruit at the Ivies. Full Sail is the Princeton or Harvard of animation. I also ask parents where they assume Tim Cook went to school and the answer is almost always Stanford. Surely the CEO of the biggest company on earth went to a prestigious school. Well, as it turns out, he went to Auburn. Most people (especially if they don’t follow college football) have never heard of it, let alone know where it is (it’s in Alabama). But Auburn is one of the top schools in the world for logistics and Tim Cook is a famously brilliant logistician.</p>

<p>In addition, by starting early, we actually de-stress the admissions process. The number one thing we hear from juniors and seniors is <i>Why didn’t anyone tell me this info? I wish I would have known.</i> For AKALA students, they have been guided the whole way through and that alleviates the pressure when they reach 11th and 12th grades.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think we need to personalize learning as much as possible and we need to get more amazing teachers to work in the field of education. If we can help kids become focused on the subjects they love, then focus will never be an issue. One of the great aspects of adolescence is the sense of wonderment in students. They are truly curious about the world and an amazing teacher can completely transform a student’s trajectory.  Sadly, the current system is so focused on standardized tests and memory-deposit learning that it does very little to feed that curiosity in our students. The result is that, on the aggregate, the type of crucial curiosity that can drive a generation of learners is minimized and often times completely eliminated. We need to double down on recruiting impactful teachers into our most challenging schools.</p>

<p><b>AKALA is your second major venture, is there anything else you will be working on down the pipeline?</b><br>
<p>We have a really cool model we created for maximizing efficiency in professional development. The vast majority of professional development is, to be candid, worthless. And teachers agree. Our innovative model maximizes foundation dollars, ensures a vested interest on the part of the school and the teachers, and holds professional development providers accountable for success once-and-for-all. That’s future project number one.</p>

<p>Future project number two is a really innovative approach to networking. We might actually roll it out as a part of AKALA down the road. People are normally terrible networkers. This solution will be a game changer for helping people further their development and careers.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<p>I love people of impact. I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mariashriver">Maria Shriver</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleObama">Michelle Obama</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveCase">Steve Case</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeancase">Jean Case</a>, and a few others.</p>
