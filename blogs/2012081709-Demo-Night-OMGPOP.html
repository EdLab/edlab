          <p>
            Thank you to the EdLab team (Megha, Laura C., Sharath & Avichal) who attended tonight's Meetup and demo night at the OMGPOP offices downtown!  

Getting to the event was half the battle... with Laura and Megha leading the charge!  Avi & I kept getting asked for directions & seperated from the group! We must really look like expert NY'ers... ;)  

First order of business... dinner!  Laura found us a little sandwich joint with a counter called "bite!"  We wolfed-down our sandwiches/panini's and made our way to the OMGPOP offices...

The offices are filled with drawings... perhaps inspired by the group's most popular game "Draw Something."  Like the EdLab their signature color is red... and they have the soft seating to prove it (although not nearly enough for a 100+ meetup!)

The office space was expansive and impressive, however, the space for informal meeting in the back, where they held the Meetup/demos was definitely NOT configured for these kinds of events.  More suitable for a small gathering or meeting.  The WiFi password was impossibly long and because all but about 10 of the 100+ attendees had to stand live-blogging was, unfortunately, out of the question... I did manage to tweet a bit on 3G!

Newscred.com did a great job presenting and made the interesting point that any group that is trying to create all of their own content without licensing at least some was misguided... or unrealistic.  Regardless, he had interesting points regarding licensed content and digital publishing.  I think we should invite them to present a seminar for sure!  Megha asked some great questions... Megha would you mind adding them to the comments?  

Voxy.com presented next and went slide-free, instead, focusing on the original pivot points (from US to South American markets) etc.  Also, discussed the importance of having a language acquisition expert on staff... really believes in online learning as a way to help end poverty and bring education to 3rd world countries.  Also, talked re: the unique challenges of being an older founder.  I am excited to learn more! 

Urtak.com, had me at the orange "maintenance" jumpsuit one of the team members wore... bold!  Also, Marc, one of the founders masterfully fielded questions and presented insight into social polling and literal "social embededness" inherent in their platform.  He also discussed their new WordPress plugin and the fact that there are limited plugin options... Urtak believes that questions are a way to connect people and help scale conversation. 

<b>Thank you again for helping me to represent the EdLab and learn more about the NY startup scene!</b>
