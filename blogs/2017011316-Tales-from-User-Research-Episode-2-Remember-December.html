Bells were ringing, wallets emptying, and families bickering. Ah, the most wonderful time of the year. 

Meanwhile on Vialogues, users were powering through the holiday haze. Even though it was a short month (academically), we had a number of active discussions from schools and colleges across the US and the pond. 

I’ve noted some exceptional cases below along with some personal insights. 

Anything you want to see here in future posts? Have anything to say about Vialogues from your own experience? Let me know in the comments. Feedback’s my bag, baby.

The group's use of the Glow/Grow preface before their comments provides the moderator (also the video's subject) clear and helpful feedback throughout the discussion.

Teaching at it's finest. Here we see a class that is just as engaged in their online discussion as they were in person.

<b>GRAIN-OF-SALT TAKEAWAYS</b>
Based on my observations, here are a few ideas on how Vialogues could possibly better support users in the future:
<ul>
<li>Provide a mechanism that allows participants in a discussion to show approval/disapproval, agreement/disagreement, or some other binary, votable sentiment. It could be useful in feedback cases, to quickly see the perceived weight of certain comments (especially when you get a lot, <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/33678/" target="_blank">like here</a>).  
<li>Allow users to tag others in comments so that OPs get immediate notifications and can keep the conversation going. It would also make references clearer (e.g., <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/33824/#/?time=65" target="_blank"> this thread</a>).
<li>Show full URLs in comments instead of trailing them off with ellipses (e.g., <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/33873/#/?time=540" target="_blank"> this thread</a>).
<li>Is it overwhelming for users to enter and read really long discussions? If so, is there something that can make this a more delightful experience? 
<li>Polls are currently one-sided. In some cases, it would add more to discussions if all participants could see the results, especially when those polls are more surveys and less assessments (e.g., <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/33858/" target="_blank"> this vialogue</a>).
