<b>Title:</b> Guestworkers in the High-Skill U.S. Labor Market: An Analysis of Supply, Employment, and Wage Trends (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Hal Salzman, Daniel Kuehn, and B. Lindsay Lowell<p>
<b>Source:</b> Economic Policy Institute<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> It’s almost a commonplace in U.S. commentary today that the United States is suffering under a shortage of STEM workers.  As the latest immigration reform bill, which may allow for an increase in high-skill immigration, makes its way through Congress, a renewed focus has been placed on the issue.  A study by the liberal think tank Economic Policy Institute, analyzing publicly available data on wages and employment, casts doubt on the received wisdom, and argues that our domestic supply of workers in STEM and IT fields is more than sufficient for our needs.<p>
<b>Findings:</b> As the data the report marshals demonstrate, the U.S. education system and labor market is fairly responsive to changing conditions in STEM and IT fields, so that when wages are going up, indicating increasing demand for workers, more people enter into them, and there are always more qualified graduates entering the labor force each year than ultimately find employment in those fields.  <p>
On the other side of the issue, guest-workers, recruited from work permits, student visas, and a variety of other measures, exhibit very different behavior in the labor force.  Since they tend to come from countries with much lower average wages, what would be considered a decline in wages here has no impact on their willingness to seek employment in these fields.  Their employment, particularly in the information technology sector, has therefore continued to increase, despite stagnant wages in that sector.<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b> These data indicate that it doesn’t make much sense to discuss a shortage of workers in STEM or IT companies, except, perhaps, from the perspective of managers eager to lower their employees’ wages. None of this is to say that the standard economic argument in favor of liberalized immigration laws is not in force, but rather that there is no specific crisis here, requiring a specific solution. Furthermore, an excessive focus on meeting changes in industry opportunities with immigration will lead to a neglect of homegrown educational solutions, as the supply of immigrant labor will eat away at the price signal of increased wages that would have otherwise sent American students to study the relevant material in school.<p>
