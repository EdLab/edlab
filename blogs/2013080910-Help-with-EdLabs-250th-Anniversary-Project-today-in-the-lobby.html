            Yes, you read that right. It's not just the 125 years, but we're also celebrating the 250th anniversary of Teacher's College.

From approximately 11AM until 2PM today, we will be shooting a video for TC's "250th Anniversary" in the lobby of the library on the 1st floor. This post is to request the participation of all willing parties that want to travel to the year 2138 (or go down the elevator and spend 5 minutes having fun).

How does that work, exactly? Well, here's the story. "Back" in 2013, a time capsule was buried at Teacher's College. We are interviewing people at the opening of this time capsule for the "250th" anniversary of the college, and asking people what Teacher's College was like "back in the day." 

Still confused? Basically, all you have to do is describe what life is currently like today, but pretend as if it's 125 years ago.

For example, you could say:
"I can't believe in 2013, Teacher's College still had ______ (elevators, physical books on the shelves, anything you can come up with)

or

"In 2013, people were really interested in ________ (can be education-related, or pop-culture, or technology)

Hopefully you get the idea. Take the time to come up with something you might want to say beforehand, or wing it and be spontaneous.

We'd greatly appreciate your help and participation.
