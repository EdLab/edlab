<p>In 2010, the Library of Congress (LOC) announced that it would partner with Twitter to archive every public tweet since the social media platform’s inception in 2006. Naturally, concerned voices arose in response, questioning the potential breaches of privacy and the level of accessibility of these archives. Since the announcement, the LOC has yet to provide access to this archive, and seems still to be grappling with complex issues that come with archiving such an immense amount of information. Michael Zimmer, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, discusses some of these challenges in his article in First Monday, a peer-reviewed scientific journal</p>
 
<p>Zimmer breaks down the challenges into two sections: those involving practice and those involving policy. Challenges in practice include the logistics behind processing and storing tweets. This is an issue for several reasons, and not just because of the sheer volume of tweets that have cropped up since 2006. Each day, Twitter processes as many as 500 million tweets, and during large-scale events like natural disasters, TV show finales, and the Olympics, that number spikes dramatically. The data is also not limited to the 140 characters of each tweet; each tweet comes with meta data—timestamps, location, retweets, favorites, and a unique ID.</p>
 
<p>Challenges involving policy, such as privacy and accessibility, have also played a role in complicating this archiving process. Although only public tweets are archived and deleted tweets are excluded, some have raised the concern that if private tweets that are retweeted publicly are archived, the privacy agreement between Twitter and users will be broken. The author also argues that data is not strictly private or public—that type of categorization oversimplifies complex issues.</p>
 
<p>One of the biggest dilemmas that the LOC faces is access to information. Although this archive can be a potential goldmine for researchers across the world, providing an unprecedented amount of data on patterns and trends over time, the LOC has insinuated that partnerships with private corporations might be necessary to finally provide researchers with access to the database. These companies, as well as the researchers who gain access to these tweets, would have to sign agreements promising not to commercially reproduce or redistribute information. Finally, Zimmer addresses the problem with Twitter and the LOC’s agreement that allows the Library to exclude from the archive any content that it deems "inappropriate for retention." He emphasizes the ambiguity of how this process will be conducted and who will be given the authority to make these decisions.</p>

<p>With no precedent to guide the process, the LOC’s Twitter archiving ushers in a number of difficult questions that have been common themes with the internet and social media. Privacy, accessibility, and censorship should be critically discussed and policies must be developed before the true potential of this information can be unlocked for research purposes.</p>
