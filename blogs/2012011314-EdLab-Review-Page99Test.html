The page 99 test has apparently long been a staple of reader self-advisory. The thought is that page 99 will provide a core sample of the action so readers can evaluate before investing time or money in a book. <a href="http://page99test.com/index.php">Page99Test</a> seeks to replicate this experience for the web, but has become a platform for small and self publishing. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The offerings are extremely diverse in genre, especially considering there are so few pages at this point. The concept is enticing as well; readers must rate the page to discover the title and author and get instant feedback about how others rate the title. It's easy to get sucked in to the new author drama. It seems like this could be a beneficial platform for self published authors and e-publishing startups. It works well as a discovery tool and readers may be more likely to invest in an unknown once they've been primed with an investment-free sample. The UI is clean and pleasant, with a generic blond wood motif akin to iBooks.

<b>Cons:</b>
The page 99 rule isn't best for all readers. User Aneke's comment on the unpublished projection of <i>Ebon Wings</i> reads, “Why, on page 99, would you be dropping the bit about her mother's simple three—bedroom home? Or dropping her mother's full name randomly?” Despite these objections, users seem to favor the introductory nature of these unpublished projections. A significant percentage of users might be better served by the page 1 test. The quick and text-light concept seems made for mobile, though it does not seem like an app is in the works. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Small and self publishing is easier than ever, there are plenty of websites and grassroots publishers cropping up to usher new authors to electronic sales. Readers, faced with a glut of inexpensive e-content of dubious quality, need a way to quickly evaluate for purchase. Page99Test may emerge as one of a suite of tools to fill this need. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Page99Test is a promising concept which succeeds in its aim.
