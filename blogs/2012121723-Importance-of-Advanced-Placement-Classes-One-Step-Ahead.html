            The school year for high school students is usually busy and stressful. They usually attend school from eight in the morning until late in the afternoon. Many of them are also involved in after school programs such as sports, debate teams, and chess teams, among countless others. In addition, they also go home tired and have to complete homework and other assignments plus studying. Many students add to this workload by taking <a href="http://admitoneblog.org/2009/09/the-real-importance-of-advanced-placement-classes-2/">Advance Placement (AP) classes.</a>

AP is a program by the College Board that helps high school students earn college credits by taking rigorous classes within their high school schedule. Taking an AP course essentially means a student is a step ahead of his high school level classes. It also means more work and more studying but it comes with several benefits. First, AP classes teaches time management and organization because it is usually time consuming as it requires more reading, and assignments. Moreover, AP classes prepare high school students for college as it gives students the experience of enrolling in college level classes. AP classes often give high school students an advantage when it comes to applying for college as many colleges value AP courses more than regular classes. Lastly, AP classes do not only give college credits but also afford students a head start in the college process.
