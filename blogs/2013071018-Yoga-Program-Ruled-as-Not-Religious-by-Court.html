            While it may appear to other people as a relaxing activity that helps clear the mind from unwanted thoughts, <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/schooled_in_sports/2013/07/court_rules_%20yoga_program_not_religious.html">yoga</a> appears to other people  (specifically parents in Encinitas, California) as having religious instruction and should therefore be banned from public schools in keeping with our system of separation of church and state. However, a judge from San Diego has ruled out that yoga is not religious instruction and it doesn't violate any state law. As a matter of fact, yoga has been labeled as a healthy exercise program which teaches good eating habits. Although yoga is mostly about sitting on a mat and performing different moves that are signs of relaxation, it also provides instruction on how to eat good food to stay in shape and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 

The fine root of Hinduism in yoga is the reason why people believe it to be a religious exercise. But the judge from San Diego brought down all the cultural references in yoga such as the language and the sitting position called lotus, which has been renamed as “criss-cross applesauce.”  Yoga was threatened to be terminated in public schools because of the fear that the children might get involved in religious organizations and promote a particular religious orthodoxy. As of now, anything that shows signs of religious instruction has been eliminated from yoga and it is now and will forever be considered as an exercise program for interested individuals and students.
