<p>Prakash Rao sells tea in Odisha, India, but that’s not the only thing he does. In fact, his work extends far beyond his tea selling business—he spends half his income on continuing to fund the school that he founded in a slum fourteen years ago. The students who attend this school would be without access to education if it weren’t for Rao’s generosity and work.</p>

<p>When he first opened his school, Rao also noticed that most of the students were malnourished, which deeply affected their ability to learn in the classroom. Because of this, he says, he started providing milk and biscuits to students, resulting in changes in their demeanor and academic performance almost instantly. </p>

<p>How do non-academic factors like nutrition, which might seem unrelated to schooling at first, affect a student’s ability to learn? In what ways can individuals and grassroot programs provide accessible education to students? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/26864/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:58 dinosossi2:</b> I find Prakash Rao's example of philanthropy truly inspiring. It is easy to find an excuse not to help others. Despite his modest income, he is still able to dedicate a high percentage of what he earns to his school. We should all think of ways to help others despite our limitations.</p>

<p><b>@01:52 Beckieb:</b> I would love to know where he received his scholarship. I think it's important for individuals participating in their local and global community to continue to give back to causes within their means. I admire that this may have been the reason for Prakash's decision to start a school and to reciprocate fortune to others.</p>
