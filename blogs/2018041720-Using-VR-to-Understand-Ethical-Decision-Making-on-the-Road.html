<p>Questions of ethics have always surrounded self-driving cars, but things get even more complicated when considering how AI would replicate the ethical decisions that humans face while driving, ranging from judging when to pass a biker to making a decision about which of two people to collide with. In order to create self-driving cars that can make context-based decisions, researchers simulated road traffic scenarios that could help them better understand how humans make moral judgement calls while driving, and assess the effectiveness of immersive VR in highlighting those judgment calls. </p>
 
<p>The study placed 105 participants between the ages of 18 and 60 in the driver’s seat of a virtual car headed down a suburban road coated in fog. When the fog lifted, two obstacles, one in either lane, would block the car’s path, and the driver would be forced to chose which one to hit. The experiment utilized 17 different obstacles chosen pseudo-randomly–either categorized as inanimate objects, animals, or humans–and visibility and car speed were varied. After giving them a chance to familiarize themselves with VR, the researchers conducted nine trials per participant and condition.</p>
 
<p>Results revealed that the judgment calls participants made during the experiment align with results found in previous studies conducted strictly on paper, demonstrating the suitability of VR to assess ethical behavior in humans. A variety of trends were identified, such as participants more frequently saved a dog over all other animal obstacles, and men were sacrificed 80% of the time when a woman blocked the other lane in lower-speed trials, but not in high-speed trials. Overall, the study confirmed that we are ill-equipped to make moral decisions quickly since there was much less consistency in study results when participants had less time to react.</p>
 
<p>Humans are highly variable, and context is exceedingly important in how we make decisions. Though this study perhaps generates more questions than answers, it demonstrates the importance of a continued effort to better understand human ethics, and establishes VR as an effective tool to do so. Though self-driving cars can eliminate driver misconduct, if we want them to replicate or even improve moral judgement, we first have to grapple with questions of human morality.</p>
