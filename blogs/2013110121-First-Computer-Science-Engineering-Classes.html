          <p>
            I started college earlier this fall hoping to learn and grow as much as I can but I never knew that learning could be so exciting until I took my first computer science class. I was impressed to see myself writing programs that tell the computer exactly what to do. I almost feel like I have some sort of magic power over to make the computer do things. One of the first things I learned was about game design. I used processing to create a soccer game from scratch. I am currently working on a project with some classmates to create game on processing that might be formatted for ioS. I am really enjoying my computer science classes as they cover a wide range of topics. I thought it was all about programing but it's more than that.

It involves a variety of topics such as analysis and design of algorithms, formal design techniques, design of programming languages, software engineering, assembly language and computer organization, distributed computing, artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis. Computer scientists study how to efficiently organize, store and retrieve data, how to write efficient programs, probe the limits of algorithmic techniques in designing programs to behave intelligently, develop new applications that benefit society, design complex software programs and design effective interfaces between programs and humans.

Hope everyone at EdLab is doing well and are still working on exciting and important stuff.
