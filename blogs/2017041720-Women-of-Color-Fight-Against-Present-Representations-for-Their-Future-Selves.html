<p>The word <i>scientist</i> often calls to mind a white-haired man, wearing a white lab coat, standing in front of fancy science equipment. These historic representations of scientists can exclude individuals who donâ€™t fit this mold from entering science fields. Women, especially women of color, are underrepresented in STEM fields. New research examines the ways that historical narratives about women of color in STEM are taken up by high school students.</p>
 
<p>This study examined how four young women of color negotiated STEM identities throughout high school and into college. The study used an embedded multiple-case approach to explore the way STEM identities are adopted by young women in their school settings. Students' varying identities were contrasted as the young women described attempts to navigate the social dynamics of their schools and their interests in STEM. Rather than working against mainstream representations of STEM stereotypes, students faced local narratives that focused on racial underachievement. </p>
 
<p>The research findings suggest that the stereotypes specifically found in schools play the most important role in shaping students self-perceptions. The young women described in this study did not portray themselves as reflecting historical discourses about women in STEM. Rather, they struggled with local racial and class discourses that positioned them differently from the aspirations they had for themselves. This indicates the importance for schools in considering narratives when designing improvement efforts. The researchers also suggest that young women of color may benefit from additional social supports within school systems to help navigate high school successfully.</p>
