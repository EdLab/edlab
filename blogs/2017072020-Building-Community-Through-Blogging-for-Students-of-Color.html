<p>Many studies have found blogging to be an effective pedagogical tool in higher education, but a recent study examined the practice specifically relating to community building for students of color. In particular, the researchers investigated the relationships among learners’ prior blogging experience, sense of community, perceived collaborative learning, and perceived individual learning.</p>
 
<p>Researchers conducted this study at a continuing education institute for adult learners, where both classes participating were entirely students of color. The study lasted one month and involved students using the blogging tool on Blackboard to complete a group project. Because most students had never blogged before, there was a short training session before the project began. Afterward, the researchers administered surveys to the participants.</p>
 
<p>Based on the responses, they found several factors that influenced student self perceptions of their learning. The number one indicator for perceived learning was student perceived sense of community with their fellow classmates. The greater the sense of community in the class, they greater student self perceived learning. Collaborative learning also influenced how much students felt they learned on an individual level. Interestingly, prior blog experience did not significantly affect students’ sense of learning.</p>
 
<p>From these findings, the researchers offer suggestions for instructors who want to blog with their students of color, particularly in continuing education settings.<ul>
<li>Provide blog training before beginning the project since many students might be unfamiliar with this skill</li>
<li>Design activities that develop a greater sense of community in the class</li>
<li>Assign projects that encourage student collaboration</li>
<li>Include real-life experiences in the group work</li></ul>
By following these guidelines, instructors could help ensure that students of color get the most out of their blogging assignments in continuing education.</p>
