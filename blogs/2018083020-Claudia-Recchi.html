<p>Claudia Recchi is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.classpulse.org/">ClassPulse</a>. She and her sister founded ClassPulse with the goal of updating professor and course reviews that college students often ignore at the end of each semester. The ClassPulse app allows students to communicate directly with professors throughout the semester in order to know what is or isn’t working. The siblings were inspired to start the company during their own undergraduate experiences where they saw a need to modernize the outdated end-of-semester course review process.</p> 

<p><b>How did you initially become interested in edtech? What inspired you to start ClassPulse?</b><br> 
<p>My sister and I are both recent college graduates and became interested in edtech while still in school. As students we noticed that a lot of our professors were coming up with their own creative solutions to gather anonymous feedback from their students. One of my professors even used an anonymous Tumblr forum!</p>
 
<p>We realized pretty quickly that there was a real need for a tool that helped instructors gather student feedback that was timely and actionable. That’s how we came up with ClassPulse (previously known as ClassPulse). As a student, I rarely put effort into filling out course evaluations. I didn't see the point in leaving feedback once the course was over. With ClassPulse however, students are given the chance to benefit from their own feedback and are therefore incentivized to leave comments that are thoughtful and actionable. We built ClassPulse because it is something we wish our professors would have used when we were students.</p>
 
<p><b>How have students and lecturers responded to ClassPulse so far?</b><br> <p>We launched our ClassPulse mobile app this January and, in less than four months, it spread to professors at over 200 universities in the U.S. Our growth came from word of mouth and was accelerated by two articles that came out on <i><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Everyone-Hates-Course/241929">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/20/new-app-seeks-shake-student-ratings-instruction-facilitating-open-ended-feedback">Inside HigherEd</a></i></p> 

<p>We see a lot of faculty using our tool to ask their students to write "minute papers" or to ask students what the "muddiest point" of a specific lecture was. Some professors use ClassPulse as a "safe" forum in which their students can proactively share thoughts about a lecture and discuss topics with their classmates without having to worry about asking "stupid questions."</p> 

<p><b>How do you think ClassPulse can change higher education?</b><br>
<p>I think right now there’s more pressure than ever before on universities to "prove their value." When you think about it, the core service that universities provide to students takes place in the classroom. Students aren’t taking out loans so that their school can produce research; students are investing in learning <i>skills</i> that will make them more marketable in the workforce. Similarly, employers are starting to look for tangible skill sets rather than diplomas from big name universities. We will help schools bring the focus back to teaching by helping instructors identify and address issues early on.</p>
<p><b>What are you currently working on or what is your next big project?</b><br> <p>We are exploring the option of using ClassPulse in first year seminars and for advising programs. We are working with administrators at a couple of schools to help them build targeted surveys that students fill out throughout these programs. We think by doing this we could add tremendous value to schools looking to improve the effectiveness of their first year seminars and increase student retention.</p>
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter or other social media?</b><br> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidjhelfand?lang=en">David Helfand</a> is to me one of the most inspiring and interesting people in education. He has no problem speaking up about what is wrong with education and how it must change to keep up with today’s world. He has his own unique approach to teaching which is embodied in his school, <a href="https://questu.ca/david-helfands-new-quest/">Quest University</a>. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQe73IXZtU">TED talks</a> are great food for thought.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/shellterrell?lang=en">Shelly Sanchez Terrell</a> is one of the three founders of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Edchat?src=hash">#EdChat</a>. They connect instructors all over the world and share insightful ideas on how to engage students and improve teaching. I love how they were able to create a network of ideas and make it possible to share and spread insightful content within the teaching community.</p>
