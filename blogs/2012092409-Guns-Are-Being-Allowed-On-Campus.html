            The issue of gun rights keeps reeling its head in every corner of our country as lawmakers and states continue to struggle with the issue in light of recent random and violent shootings. As perhaps one of the safest places anywhere, colleges would be the last place you associate with gun rights. This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/education/guns-on-campus-at-university-of-colorado-causes-unease.html?ref=education&_rmoc.semityn.www">NY Times article</a> highlights concerns at University of Colorado, where students are legally permitted to carry concealed weapons on campus. As it stands, most states leave that discretion to individual universities but five states (Oregon, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Utah and Colorado) allow students to legally carry weapons on campus as a measure of protection.

 

As expected, most faculty and school administrators feel uneasy about the law since they feel it creates a tense atmosphere. Proponents argue that allowing students to legally arm themselves gives them a chance for self defense should a random shooting occur. They further argue there is no guarantees a delusional student won't random shoot on campus even if there was no law allowing students to legally carry firearm. I am sure this is the beginning of what I expect to be a long and heated debate about gun rights in schools.

 

How should staff and faculty go about asking for a change in this law? Would you apply to a college or university where students are allowed to carry weapons?
