<p> Whether it’s Mindcraft or Farmville, gamers and non-gamers both find themselves caught up in <i>sandbox</i> or <i>open world</i> games. This is why Wrainbo, an edtech company, created <a href=" http://www.wrainbo.com/overview">Magitech</a>, a mobile game that uses data, marketing, operations, and finance rules to play. On the open world gaming platform, you build your business and sell to customers with a desire to gain the most gold by beating your competitors’ rates. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p> Following rules of supply and demand, in concert with other economic principles, you go through the gaming world building your business. For an economic novice like myself, I found the information surprisingly easy to digest. The first level takes you step by step through each component of the game, so you are aware of key functions and different applications. For the moment, the game is in its beta phase, and you can only have a single player against robots. However, developers say they have every intention of expanding interaction by making a multiplayer platform once the initial beta testing is complete. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p> Though this game is promising, with plans to break down complicated data analytics and finance to more entertaining terms, there seems to be a lot to learn in a short time. So unless you are already a business student who has a decent grasp of the content, it might be a bit difficult for you to keep up with all the principles within the game that must be applied in order for you to play. In addition, like many of these sandbox games, the graphics take me back to a super Nintendo era, which can either be nostalgic or boring depending on your preference.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p> With current long term beta testing occurring at Duke University, a consulting firm, and with a corporate education provider, there are sure to be some stunning new updates when the full version of Magitech is released in November. For now, I can see this game being a useful tool for high school and university students who are having a difficult time grasping the complicated and sometimes abstract concepts of the business world. </p>
