<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

Family Involvement in Early Childhood Education: Research into Practice is a must-have resource for early childhood professionals who understand the importance of building positive parent/teacher partnerships.

This unique resource offers practical ideas and activities for developing partnerships with families. Designed for parents and teachers of infants, toddlers, and school age children, the text includes ideas and specific activities that can be implemented for instant use by classroom teachers. Special features of the text include sample ideas and activities for involving fathers; sample forms, newsletters, and progress report forms; and activities for at-home involvement. The review questions, highlighted key terminology, and chapter exercises encourage meaningful reflection and reinforce key concepts.
