          <p>
            I've been getting a lot of questions about the EdLab Edit Jam.  I hope this post provides some clarity because I know the previous post in the EdLab events section might sound a little mysterious to some.

The Edit Jam will be EdLab's attempt at a collaborative art-making session.  Each member of the Media Design Group will work with either digital (Illustrator, video, dj'ing) or analog tools (charcoal drawing, sculpting, sewing).  Besides the usual faces you see everyday at the MDC, Ai Kijima, an incredible textile artist, will also participate in our creative jam.  Check out her work <a href="http://www.aikijima.com/">here</a>. 

All of us will be "connected" in as many ways possible: from text chatting, audio and video conferencing, to creative mind-melding as well.  I will be DJ'ing throughout the night, so I hope my music will positively propel our creations. In addition, the audience will be able to interact with us though Mac workstations connected to our machines. Needless to say, there will be plenty of media stimulation and interaction!

I originally conceived of this idea when I heard about the Cut & Paste Digital Design Tounrnament in New York.  I thought, "Designers, dj's, clubs, and computers all at one place at the same time?  Brilliant!"  So the old club/record promoter within spurred me to produce an event similar to this one - at TC.

I was fortunate enough to scout out this year's Cut & Paste two weeks ago.  It was pretty cool, but I think our event differs in two key aspects: Edit Jam will be driven by collaboration and interaction. At Cut & Paste I felt as if I were at a sporting event, where a wall existed between the audience and the participants.

At the Edlab Edit Jam we hope to provide an exciting event while simultaneously exploring the intersection of art, technology, media in a completely collaboartive and interactive environment.  I hope you can come and take part in our EdLab Edit Jam!
