            June 30th, 2011 might as well be the judgement day... if you're Amazon or Barnes & Nobles, of course.

Back in February, Apple enacted a couple of new rules in their "law" concerning in-app purchases and such. Long story short, if you could buy content outside of the app, developers HAVE to include the function to be able to buy content inside of the app. Why is this so important to Apple? So that they can eat 30% of the revenue, that's why. The deadline for apps to implement this change was set at June 30th, 2011.

Recently, however, Apple did maybe reconsider their positions a little bit, because they announced that this (in my honest opinion) draconic rule did NOT apply to subscription-based material. This was great news to NYTimes or Newsweek, but still, it gave no break to Amazon or B&N.

Well, so what can they do?

Read on...<!--break-->

I found an <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-what-amazon-should-do-with-its-kindle-ipad-app/">article</a> at PaidContent.org that outlines their possible course of action pretty nicely.

1) <b>They can comply.</b> This could be a very difficult decision to make for Amazon... 30% cut on each sale can amount to a lot of money.

2) <b>They can take out the buy feature all together.</b> This way, they would not be in violation of the "laws" of Apple App Store. However, users would have to buy all their content on their PCs or Macs (or Android, for that matter). This could be a deal-breaker for a lot of people, since quite a portion of the market are now moving towards ditching the PC altogether.

3) And finally, what I personally hope they do, <b>They can ditch Apple App Store altogether. </b> With this dramatic move, Apple will be forced to reconsider their "law," since thousands of Kindle users who have an iPhone, iPod, or an iPad will not be happy that their content is no longer accessible on their devices. Of course, the problem with this method can be that 1) users can get mad at Amazon or B&N instead, or 2) Apple doesn't care and then it's a lose-lose situation.

What do you think the course of the action should be?
