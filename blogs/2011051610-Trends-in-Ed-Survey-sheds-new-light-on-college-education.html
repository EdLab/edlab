          <p>
            With college graduations in full swing, the ongoing debate about what a college education ought to be, who pays for it and whether students' are getting what they pay for are some of the concerns a new <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703509104576325611317227614.html">Pew Research survey of adults and college presidents</a> sought to answer. The survey, <i>Is College Worth It? College Presidents, Public Assess Value, Quality and Mission of Higher Education</i>, posed college related questions to 2,142 to American adults and the other to 1,055 college presidents (small, large, public, private, and for-profit). 

Some of the results of the survey:

-	Nearly 2/3 of college presidents agree that the largest share of college costs should come from students and families while only 48% of the general public share that sentiment

-	58% of college presidents note that high schools these days are doing a worse job of preparing students for college than a decade ago

-	Of the surveyed adults who had at least one child under age 18, 94% said they expect that child to attend college, and 53% said they are saving to pay for it.

-	57% of 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed who had no bachelor's degree and weren't enrolled in college said they would rather work and make money than go to school

The full survey can be found <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/HigherEdReport.pdf">here</a>.
