<a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> is many things, from groundbreaking researcher, Artificial Intelligence and MOOC pioneer, to Senior Computer Scientist at <a href="http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>.  Currently, Norvig is the Director of Research at <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Inc.</a>, where he has served, since 2001 in various key leadership capacities including Director of Search Quality.  Beyond key work at Google, Norvig is a leader in the <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0602/p13s02-stct.html">machine learning and machine translation space</a> and  directed Google’s <a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/">Course Builder</a> team.  CourseBuilder is an open source project that helped guide the development of both the <a href="https://www.edx.org/alert/edx-announces-partnership-google/1115">Open edX partnership</a> and subsequent Mooc.org platform.  Beyond innovating within the walls of the world’s leading search engine, Norvig co-taught the groundbreaking <a href="http://www.ai-class.com/">Articifial Intelligence-focused MOOC </a> that attracted more than 160,000 learners from around the world (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16stanford.html">this NYT article</a>) and continues to inform the discourse around online learning.  In addition to teaching the masses online, Norvig has contributed extensive scholarship in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Software Engineering, including the definitive text, <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/"><i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</i></a>.  Beyond virtual teaching and scholarship, Norvig is the author of the popular, long-running digital essay, <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html"><i>Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years<i></a> and has taught at both the University of Southern California and the University of California at Berkeley, from which he received a Ph.D. in 1986.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> I've worked in a variety of settings -- big companies, small companies, universities, the government (NASA), I practiced teaching at university, but only really had to explain and convince other people of something important when I entered industry.  I think that observing a variety of types of learning outside of the classroom is important for a teacher.  In addition, for much of my career I've studied the ways that the analysis of large amounts of data can help make continual improvements in a variety of settings.  There is a promise that we will soon be able to do that in education, but the promise is yet to be fulfilled -- we're just getting started.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Testing ideas against hard reality.  Whether it is in the lab when an experiment goes wrong or in industry when a product is received poorly, reality has a way of knocking down the product of faulty thinking.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I hope that high quality educational materials will be more accessible to more people all over the globe.  But more important than the educational content is the educational community.  I hope that we can all share enough enthusiasm and motivation to keep the rest of the community thriving.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> I hope that learning will be more personalized, yet more social, more active, and more life-long.
<p>

<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Several projects: creating better error messages for beginning programmers; creating a marketplace for online learning activities, doing a better job of getting computers to converse in natural language.
