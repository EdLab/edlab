<p>Gone are the days when you can hide your feelings behind a poker face. Researchers at MIT have <a href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160921093924.htm>developed a technology</a> that can read your emotions via WiFi signals. The device transmits a wireless signal that bounces off a person’s body and returns. With these signals, the device collects information on heartbeats and breathing rhythms, and then analyzes them. The device has an 87% accuracy rate reporting anger, sadness, joy, and pleasure.<p>

<p>Researchers think this technology could have several applications. For one, it could allow advertisers to relay ads customized to a specific person’s current emotional state. For another, it could connect with a <i>smart house</i> or <i>smart room</i> in the future to create changes in lighting or music. In addition, this technology could have many different learning applications and be particularly useful for children who have trouble understanding their own emotions and those of others.</p>

<p>What other learning applications could this technology have? What are the dangers that might come with a device that can read your hidden emotions? Join the discussion

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:26 Victoria57251:</b> This would be great for classrooms. I can imagine many times where all my students were in bad moods and I could not figure out they were upset until it was too late and everyone ended up having a bad day. This would be great to help educators know the classroom mood ]so they can adjust their lesson and tone for the students.</p>

<p><b>@01:44 Nantwi:</b> If this app is accurate as advertised, the implications for learning could be massive. For instance, it might help educators highlight students who are struggling to learn the material or have anxieties in the classroom. It can also help administrators and other school personnel identify students who might have violent or crazy thoughts.</p>
