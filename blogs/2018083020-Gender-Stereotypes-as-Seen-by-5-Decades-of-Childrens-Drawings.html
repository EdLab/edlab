<p>Although there have long been gender stereotypes in science, linking men more than women to the field, a recent study shows that those conceptions have been changing for the better within the past five decades. Since the 1960s, researchers have been studying children’s gender stereotypes of scientists with one straightforward study: Draw-a-Scientist. They give children in grades K–12 the simple instruction of drawing a scientist, then document whether they drew a male or female.</p>
 
<p>Using data from 78 studies conducted from the 1960s to present day, the researchers found stark differences as the decades progressed. In the 1960s–1970s, less than 1% of all children drew female scientists. But, by the 1990s–2010s, 28% drew females. Although the percentage is still low, the increase is promising.</p>
 
<p>The studies also showed that younger children drew more female scientists, and older children opted for more male scientists. At the age of 6, girls drew female scientists 70% of the time, but by age 16, they were drawing female scientists only 25% of the time. The same decline is true for boys: at age 6, boys drew female scientists 17% of the time, but by age 16, they drew female scientists a startling 2% of the time. It’s important to note here that while boys drew significantly fewer female scientists than girls did overall, the researchers explain that children are more likely to draw people of their own gender, which could account for some of this disparity.</p>

<p>Overall, the research shows that children are more likely to draw female scientists now because they are exposed to more representations of female scientists than ever before. And it’s true; although still the minority, women graduate with significantly more science degrees now than in past decades. For example, in 1966, women earned 19% of chemistry degrees, but by 2015, they earned 48% of them. Because of this, women are more frequently represented as scientists in the media as well as in elementary school education. Children implicitly pick up on these gendered representations wherever they’re portrayed, so the more balanced these representations are, the fewer gender stereotypes they will hold. Greater female representation and fewer gendered stereotypes will in turn mean that more girls will aspire to enter science fields.</p>
