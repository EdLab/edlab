            As announced by this video, presidential candidate and Congressman Ron Paul is working on getting an audit for the Fed Bill passed by the House of Representatives this month. This bill will make the Federal Reserve System reveal any covert printing of money as mentioned in the video. This would stop the devaluation of our currency going on in many bailouts.

Do you believe the Federal Reserve should be audited and monitored? Some argue that this would give Congress too much power over the Federal Reserve, which is intended to be a separate institution. As a separate institution, economists should theoretically be able to make the Federal Reserve act with no political influences.

However, there are signs that the Federal Reserve is corrupt in another way. Libertarians claim that the Federal Reserve props up Wall Street Bankers. If audit the Feds were passed, this would be cleared up. If the Federal Reserve is truly supporting certain bankers, it would have to answer to the American people for it. Ron Paul calls the deliberate inflation of our currency stealing from the people, as savings are shrunk to a fraction of their original value and living expenses rise. If the people knew just how much money was being printed, the Fed would have to be much more responsible about the amount of money it prints. 

What is your opinion on auditing the Federal Reserve?
