            Story has it that the pigeons roaming our streets today were originally brought to North America for domestic purposes. They were pets. Later they were released into a greater ecosystem, both urban and wild, but the ecosystem was not prepared to respond to this influx of foreign creatures. Instead, the number of pigeons kept increasing because no other animal up the food chain had the need or knowledge to hunt these pigeons. 

Now this is just a story I heard. I cannot verify it — not even on Wikipedia — because I am not brave enough to be confronted with so many pictures of birds. I do not like birds very much. So let's focus on ecosystems...

What about the <b>education ecosystem</b>? Is the current system of teachers with their large classes and limited time able to handle the ongoing and ever-increasing number of EdTech startups? This question was raised by <a href="sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> and proposed as a <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/15291">potential panel discussion</a> for an upcoming conference.

If teachers (and their students) are the ultimate consumers of EdTech products, then they must actively approve the good ones and/or reject the not-so-good ones; their feedback fosters the production of quality products with meaningful outcomes. Otherwise, we run the risk of EdTech startups becoming like those pigeons: abundant, but ignored, and sometimes unwanted all together.

Now to tie this into EdLab. How can EdLab be a valuable addition to the education ecosystem? Demo Night is one way, but what other offerings can we innovate and release, perhaps as part of LaunchPad, to ensure we are good "rangers" of the education ecosystem?
