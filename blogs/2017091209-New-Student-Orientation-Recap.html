            <p><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20170912095710-img_0473_jpg_197a80cc8b7199b2ffcfcabe5d622e53.jpeg" style />Last Tuesday, Joann and I set up shop outside the Everett Cafe to welcome students to TC and, more specifically, the Gottesman Libraries. A nice change of pace from our day-to-day routine, orchestrating this event was an opportunity to both showcase EdLab's work and engage with students on a more hands-on level. </p><p><br /></p><p>Here are a few of my takeaways from planning the event.  </p><p><br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Giveaways and Swag</span></p><p>Simpler is better. Apparently it doesn't take much to lure in students beyond candy and glittery shoeboxes (given that students are walking in your direction anyway). Even in the absence of the donut bar I had originally wished for, we received a healthy amount of foot traffic throughout the course of the day.  </p><p><br /></p><p>That being said, I would have liked to have been more intentional in brainstorming EdLab-specific giveaways. <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">I think items with daily utility could have been a </span>potential<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> vehicle for promoting the EdLab ethos even beyond this one event (VisualizED-inspired laptop stickers remain on my wishlist). </span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">The More EdLabbers, the Better </span></p><p>My favorite moments were when we had several other EdLabbers join us and have one-on-one conversations with students. EdLab undertakes<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> such a wide range of projects that having multiple teams represented at outreach events like these helps to paint a much more accurate picture of our work. I think that it's more informative for students (or anyone wanting to learn about EdLab) to listen to different EdLabbers' personal experiences as opposed to hearing just one generic pitch. </span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Don't Scare the Costumer </span></p><p>As several people pointed out during our D&amp;R, going up to a gaggle of folks in coordinated outfits can be a bit intimidating. Joann and I opted to not sit behind a large table (though we did go for the matching polos), and instead we segmented our activities across several high tables so that students could explore freely. </p><p><br /></p><p>Creating multiple pathways for engagement was a good idea, but in retrospect we could have figured out a better way to actually convey to students that they had options. <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">It felt strange to bombard </span>each and every one of them with,<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> &quot;And you can do a demo here, and you can </span>take a photo here, and lemme get your email before you run away from me...&quot; and so we ended up privileging some stations over others rather than making full use of the space we set up. </p><p><br /></p><p><b>Thank You! </b></p><p>Finally, thank you to everyone who helped set up, worked tables, and took cheesy photos! All your help is much appreciated! </p><div><br /></div><div><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20170912095405-img_0470_jpg_567fe03ead2bda7539306397e0906b50.jpeg" style /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
