Technical Services (Materials at TC) is responsible for much of the backstage work in libraries. Cataloging, resource maintenance, acquisitions, and delivery are essential and traditional library functions that suffer from a publicity problem, even amongst other modes of librarianship. Shrinking budgets and the proliferation of collaborative and commercial alternatives to on-site cataloging and collection development have eliminated many a technical services department. This article aims to present strategies of outreach and production for maintaining relevance in technical services. 
 
<b>Description:</b>
Southern Connecticut State University has rather large technical services team comprised of several catalogers and three managers of different aspects of acquisitions. The staff counts collaboration and community very highly in their outreach efforts. They created a publicized mission statement to this effect and attempt to be involved in projects in different departments of the library and the university. Several of their staff members serve as departmental liaisons and subject librarians and are able to directly observe student research and provide unique bibliographic training. 

In keeping with their mission of community outreach, technical services librarians hosted an international film series, worked with the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame, provided assistance in dissertation metadata and production, and created preservation displays of archival materials. These services and efforts aim to create visibility and connection with students and faculty as well as establish a precedent in the greater library community of engagement and action. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Our Materials unit is moving towards greater outreach and production for precisely the same reasons. Instead of differentiating the unit, as Southern Connecticut State University has done, we are moving towards greater adherence and cooperation with the mission of our library as a producer and innovator in educational technology while maintaining prompt delivery of essential library services. We'll have a chance to discuss practical strategies for transparency and creative production in the Materials unit at the Development and Research meeting on September 6th, your ideas are appreciated!
