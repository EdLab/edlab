            Students are usually taught the basic rights of individuals in America as prescribed by the constitution. It is reasonable to think that schools in other countries also teach students their basic rights as individuals. This <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29950843" target = "blank">article</a> highlights a very strange right that a group of students are advocating: "The Right to Cheat" on exams. After a series of interviews in some universities in Uttar Pradesh, India by a BBC correspondent, students feel they have a natural right to cheat on examinations. The students indicated that the education system is very corrupt and allows students easy access to questions from exams they have yet to take. Apparently, only the students from wealthy families can afford to buy "cheat sheets" and exam grades. Other students also explained that there are so many popular students have links with local politicians. As such, these students are able to influence their peers politically. Students that have political ties are allowed to cheat on exams because politicians pay the proctors to leave those particular students to cheat.
<p>
This reminds me of the education system in Ghana (where I grew up). It is similar to the situation in India. My classmates from rich families never worried about attending class or even studying. Ironically, these same students were the ones that passed the entrance exams and went on to prestigious universities in the country. The situation is quite alarming but unfortunately there is no place to report such acts. This makes it very difficult to address such issues. This problem highlights many of the issues that affect education in the developing world.
