As I hungrily await the season 4 premiere of<a href="http://www.hbo.com/#/true-blood"> True Blood</a>, (June 26<sup>th</sup>!), I've been thinking about our recent societal obsession with blood suckers.  I confess that I read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_%28series%29">Twilight Series</a> (all four, don’t judge).  I even gave <a href="http://www.cwtv.com/shows/the-vampire-diaries">The Vampire Diaries</a> a try, though it didn’t appeal to me so much, perhaps because the CW  doesn't have the luxury of being able to be quite as uninhibited or extreme as  Cable TV.

But <em>True Blood</em> sold me from the first episode, hook, line, and sinker, in part because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Ball_%28screenwriter%29">Alan Ball</a> seems to be able to do no wrong.  With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_%28TV_series%29">Six Feet Under</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Beauty_%281999_film%29">American Beauty</a>,  he always has something fascinating to say about humans and  how we relate to one another, which makes me even more intrigued with  why he turned his attention to vampires.

What is Alan Ball trying to  say about humans through focusing on the undead?

And since I am a sucker (no pun intended) for all things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud">Freud</a>,  I also began to wonder, what would Sigmund say about our sudden  fascination/fixation with vampires?  What makes <em>True Blood</em> so  irresistible to watch?  When you narrow it down, <em>True Blood</em> is a  beautiful representation of Freud’s notion that sex and aggression are  two powerful forces in human development.  Sure, we all care  (marginally) about Sookie and Bill’s love saga, but the more titillating  aspects of the show seem to be all the carnal desire and blood spilled  (desire and blood often going hand in hand) that Alan Ball fills our  screens with countless times throughout each episode.

Could it be that  some of our fixation on "vampires" may be because they provide us with a  beautiful way of being able to fulfill some of our own raw needs within ourselves?   Through focusing on  "vampires" we then have the luxury of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection">projecting</a> these carnal aspects of ourselves onto those “sub-human blood suckers"  instead.  Alan Ball (and the other writers of <em>True Blood</em>) make this point time  and time again within the series, often directly comparing vampires  with humans and pointing out the similarities.  But I wonder sometimes  if the viewers of the show themselves may end up doing the same thing  that many of the small town Louisiana folk in <em>True Blood</em> do to the  vampires, by drawing a big distinction between "us" and "them."

After all, as viewers, we can watch <em>True Blood</em> ravenously, and afterward,  if we have any moments of discomfort or unease about just how <em>much</em> we enjoyed all that blood, we then have the option of  chalking it up to being a show about "vampires or werewolves or other  demons" instead of facing those perhaps- not- so- pretty aspects of ourselves.  But the reality  (and I believe Freud and Alan Ball would have my back on this one) is  that <em>True Blood</em> and all the other vampire crazed entertainment filling our  pages or TV screens today, is far more a commentary about the living  than it is about the undead.

But it sure is fun to watch those blood-suckers.
