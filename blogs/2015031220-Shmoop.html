<p><a href="http://www.shmoop.com/">Shmoop</a> is a digital publishing company providing educational materials in a consistent, funny, and relevant voice. Test prep, Flashcards, Study Guides, College Entrance Exams, Shmoop Courses, Shmoop in Spanish, and Teacher Resources are a few of the products Shmoop offers. Students can access all materials through a web browser with a login and password.  By creating a profile, students can curate their Shmoop experience for their needs, but itâ€™s not necessary for exploration. </p>

<p>Learning guides for both students and educators align with the Common Core standards and are available at no cost. Test Prep Guides for SAT, PSAT, ACT, Common Core, AP Exams and Entrance Exams are available for purchase ($20-30). Purchasing a Test Prep Guide includes a 12-month subscription and guides can be purchased for personal use or for use in the classroom. Students can look into life after high school via the Careers page and College 101 section. Shmoop Courses include curriculum for students, guidelines for teachers, and a virtual classroom.  Shmoop Courses can be purchased for schools and districts, for home schools and individual classrooms, or for independent student study. Common Core aligned resources for teachers are available for purchase in topics like literature, history, and economics. Shmoop can be used by teachers and educators as a way to curate their in-class work as or supplemental content, like homework or extra credit.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The most positive and welcoming aspect of Shmoop is the voice.  Shmoop is relevant, funny, and anything but dry.  Reading and learning become enjoyable tasks because Shmoop merges pop culture with core education to help struggling students understand and engage with the material. Shmoop curates the vast amount of educational resources and applies them to individual needs across an unbelievable variety of topics and types of resources.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While the sheer amount of information available on Shmoop is a positive aspect, it may also overwhelm users, both students and teachers.  Navigating through the resources is a large and possibly daunting task, and it's sometimes unclear if students will persevere long enough to find and use the content successfully. The Shmoop website is populated with advertisements in order to keep most resources free and accessible.  Plainly, the ads are distracting and disruptive.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Shmoop is a resource that can be applied to different situations. Students can use Shmoop for additional resources outside of the classroom as a way to learn material in a different way, to prep for tests, or to go above and beyond their class assignments. Educators can use Shmoop Courses as the actual course presented to the students, as a resource for additional classroom activities, as a personal resource for Common Core, or as extra credit and homework. Shmoop is versatile and affordable for both the student and the educator.
