<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

"Peace activist and cofounder of the Enough Project, John Prendergast is known as a champion of human rights in Africa.

But  the not-so-public face of J.P. is the life he’s led as a Big Brother to  Michael Mattocks. As a curious, driven, and emotionally wounded  twenty-year-old, J.P. made the life-changing decision to form a “Big  Brother/Little Brother” relationship with then seven-year-old Michael,  who was living out of plastic bags and drifting from one homeless  shelter to the next with his mother and siblings. Lacking a connection  with his own brother and distancing himself from a disastrous  relationship with his father, J.P. formed a unique bond with Michael the  moment they met. Michael and J.P. became like family, with Michael and  some of his siblings even living with J.P. one summer. In the years that  followed, J.P. took Michael and his brothers on outings, whether it was  fishing, playing basketball, patronizing cheap restaurants, or going on  road trips. This friendship would continue for over twenty-five years  as the two coped with varying degrees of violence, instability, and  trauma in their own lives. "
