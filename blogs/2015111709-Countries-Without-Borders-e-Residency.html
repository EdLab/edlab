            Hi all!

This is a quick write up regarding a recent talk on the idea of e-residency. Any comments, suggestions or thoughts are welcome!

<b>Countries Without Borders: e-Residency and Digital Citizenship  </b>
<i>Reshaping the contours of the nation state in the digital age  </i>

Why do we often feel a sense of kinship with people from the same nation? Terms like citizenship, nationalism, and patriotism are so abstract, opaque, and vague that it is difficult to understand why they bind us, and sometimes have a tendency to divide. They are highly polarizing terms with widely varying effects depending on the context. For example, when meeting a fellow citizen in a far off land, sharing stories of long-lost national pastimes, rousing patriotic songs of communion, and common cultural artifacts can develop a sense of bonding between people who would otherwise be strangers. However, when left unchecked, unexamined, and undistilled, unbridled nationalism can lead to feelings of exclusion, otherness, and distrust that can exact very real costs. Benedict Anderson’s iconic book, <i>Imagined Communities</i>, discusses the idea of the nation state as being a socially constructed community between people who live under shared sovereign rule. In this book, Anderson examines the nature of the nation state, its formation, as well as its impact. 

In advanced democracies, the form and function of the nation state are normally complex ideas that have become even more complicated in the digital age. Due to the omnipresent nature of the internet—a sweeping technological phenomenon that allows communication across broad distances almost instantaneously, in essence conflating both time and space—perhaps the traditional definition of a country can be repurposed and broadened. For example, if the essence of a <i>country</i> requires people who consent to rule as well as a mechanism for this consent to be measured, such as through voting, perhaps you can dispense with the traditional requirement of a shared geographic space and fashion a new kind of country in a more malleable, digital, online form that fosters greater inclusivity, overcoming the problems that vast geographic distances incur. In this instance, the internet becomes a surrogate for the sovereign soil upon which a country is situated, its sense of affiliation between citizens created through the multiple modes of digital communications that the web affords uniting disparate people. Due to the communicative affordances of the internet, the vectors that configure the traditional <i>town square</i> can be pushed and pulled, its contours reconstituted in seemingly infinite permutations; a multiplicity of voices, ideas, and opinions shared instantaneously and from all direction. The debate occurring in Plato’s academy now seems almost quaint.

In his recent talk, Taavi Kotka, Estonian Chief Information Officer, spoke about the e-residency initiative in his homeland. In this novel program, foreign nationals can receive <i>digital IDs</i> that act as a secure Estonian e-identity. By having this e-residency, successful applicants will have convenient, safe, and secure access to various global digital services provided by the Estonian government. Due to Estonia’s small population, dispersed over a relatively large geographic era, the country was forced to become pioneers in the provision of government services to its people, specifically in the aftermath of the dissolution of the former Soviet regime that burdened the country economically. From this simple beginning, Kotka hopes that extending e-residency to non-Estonians can help his country connect to a wider world.

Why is the idea of e-residency useful in the modern era, especially beyond the relatively narrow geographic area of Estonia? More specifically, why would e-residency resonate with the wider world? For one reason, we are experiencing profound shifts in the economy. By 2020, 40% of the U.S. workforce will be freelancers (Giang, 2013), the traditional bricks-and-mortar workspace becoming less common. And on a similar note, there will be 1 billion <i>digital nomads</i> by 2035 (levels.io, 2015). Nomads in the digital age are people who are independent of any specific location and incorporate technology to conduct their job through the internet, smartphones, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), etc. As a result, these nomads possess some form of digital identity but it is not fully vetted by a trusted third-party such as a national government like Estonia. Like its northern peers, Estonia assigns unique digital identifiers to its citizens at birth to help foster a sense of transparency and facilitate purely digital transactions, whether they be legal, financial, or governmental in nature. According to Kotka, in a cashless future, having access to secure online digital identities and corresponding services (e.g., legal help, accountancy, etc.), will allow small businesses and individual proprietors to flourish. This would be especially attractive to growing vendors looking for a European base to their operations.

Due to phenomena like e-residency, our conceptions of the nation state need to be revisited. The world may finally become a digital global village.

P.S. For a discussion of the challenges of fostering digital citizenship in schools, please see <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/2873">Vialogues</a>. In the video, LeeAnn Lindsey, a technology infusion and professional development coordinator, gives suggestions to promote ways for students to participate in government, politics, and civil society.
