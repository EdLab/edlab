<p>Collaborative online writing necessitates new types of information literacy skills. Students write blogs on WordPress, post content to social media sites like Facebook, read breaking news on Twitter, and discover information on Wikipedia. These practices have led to a paradigmatic break with conventional literacy practices from even a few years ago. A recent qualitative study examines the information assessment methods of high school students while they build a collaborative online information source. </p>
 
<p>The study investigated high school students at two educational institutions—one was a top-ranked suburban public school, another was a private suburban high school with a 100% graduation rate. It focused on two major research questions. First, how do high school students assess and understand information sources when they are within an open collaboration framework? And second, how does producing information sources affect this understanding? </p>
 
<p>Two major assessment strategies were discovered: first-order strategies, which involve the adoption of known accepted standards to assess information sources, and second-order strategies, which include student-created standards based on their understanding of how information is produced and the tasks with which they engage.</p>
 
<p>The authors identify implications for research on collaboration, educational practice, and learning. By developing a better understanding of information production and regulation within collaborative spaces, students and teachers can develop sophisticated ways to use online information. Also, the collaborative nature of this online work among friends creates an authentic need for accuracy among peers, which further requires creative ways to achieve these ends. A lack of similar studies suggests that little systematic guidance is available for students regarding online collaboration. Successful communication online does not necessarily happen without direct assistance. Informed teacher practice can help students develop more sophisticated forms of literacy that will allow students to read the online word and the virtual world. </p>
