Graham Forman is the founder and managing director of <a href="http://www.edovatecapital.com/">Edovate Capital</a>, a venture capital firm that invests in early stage and growth stage companies that are innovating education. Forman is also the co-founder of the <a href="http://www.edgarage.org/">edGarage</a>, which is a co-working space and services platform for education entrepreneurs. Prior to founding Edovate Capital, he was Vice President of Business Development for Netchemia, LLC a venture-backed, cloud-based software company serving the K12 marketplace, where he led new business development and strategic partnerships. He has an MBA from Anderson School of Management at UCLA and a BA from the University of Chicago. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Edovate Capital?</b><br>
<p>I've spent 20+ years of my career focused on the themes of education, entrepreneurship, and investing. I started my career working in the U.S. Senate as a staff aide for former U.S. Senator Paul Simon who was a leader on education and labor issues. I worked for him until he retired and then I moved to California and worked on a couple of campaigns. One of the campaigns I worked on was for a college president who ran and won a seat in the state assembly. With his rich education background, he quickly became chair of the Education Committee, and I worked for him for a number of years on education policy and other issues. So, the first five years or so of my career was focused on education policy. </p>

<p>During that time, I developed a strong appreciation for the impact that policy has on educators and school leaders. The next 15 years I spent as an education startup operator. I had three startup experiences in which I led sales, marketing, business development, and customer success. I had my successes and failures as a tech entrepreneur, but enough success to begin angel investing more than 10 years ago. Toward the end of the third operating company, I got interested in scaling my impact and decided that investing in and advising lots of education entrepreneurs was a good way to do that. So, I started Edovate Capital about four years ago. When we sold the last company to private equity three years ago, I decided to focus full-time on my investing work at Edovate. It's been a ton of fun so far.</p> 

<p><b>How does Edovate Capital decide which education companies merit an investment?</b><br>
<p>I speak with about 500 education technology entrepreneurs each year and make two to four decisions to invest. There's a lot that goes into deciding, but I would say the key things are the quality of the founding team, a real market that's been underserved and has lacked innovation, a reliable funding stream from schools and districts to invest in solutions, and a scalable business model. I don't make quick decisions, but instead typically get to know the entrepreneurs over six months or more before investing so that we get to know one another and develop a comfort level in working together. I work hard for the entrepreneurs I back and want to be sure that I can add value to their work beyond the investment that I make.<p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>There are a couple of trends that are here, growing, and I believe will stay and have a lasting impact on learning. First, personalized learning is instruction that offers pedagogy, curriculum, and learning environments to meet the individual student's needs. The experience is tailored to learning preferences and the specific interests to benefit learners. I believe this trend is already having an impact and will continue to impact learning because tailored learning leads to better outcomes than a one-size fits all approach. 

<p>Second, and relatedly to personalized learning, competency-based learning (CBL) is starting to have a larger impact on students. This type of learning includes systems of instruction, assessment, and grading that require learners to demonstrate that they have the knowledge and skills they are expected to learn as they progress in their education. I believe CBL is a powerful, growing trend that's here to stay because learners are required to learn more deeply with CBL, but can move at their own pace and in areas that interest them. Technology is an important tool that helps enable both of these trends, but is not a required part of a well-tailored personalized or competency-based learning experience. </p> 

<p><b>Apart from Edovate Capital, what else are you working on?</b><br>
In addition to my investing work, I support very early-stage education innovators through a project I co-founded called edGarage, a co-working space and services platform for education innovators in Colorado. We provide physical space where innovators can work, programming geared towards supporting them, and a mentor network that supports them as well. 

<p>Our goal is to catalyze more startup activity in education in Colorado and support promising entrepreneurs in their success. I also serve on the Board of the Colorado Education Initiative, which is a statewide non-profit dedicated to accelerating educational innovation across schools and districts in our state. I believe that if we're going to innovate at scale, it will have to be through traditional schools and districts that serve more than 90% of K12 students in Colorado and in the U.S. </p>
