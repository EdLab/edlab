<p>Not all educational video games are created equal. In particular, some are akin to digital environments of free play with no specific learning goals laid out. Others alert players to learning goals from the beginning. In a recent study, researchers examined the differences in students’ experiences when they played a game with no clear objectives and when they played one with concrete goals.</p>
 
<p>To do this, the researchers recruited nearly 90 students to participate in a customized Minecraft game to learn basic elements of electrical engineering. The students were split into three groups: the first group was given a clear learning goal at the beginning of the game, the second was given a clear performance goal, and the third was given no goal. The researchers examined how these differences affected the students’ cognitive load (the mental effort they put forward in the game) and emotional states while playing by administering surveys throughout the gameplay as well as after.</p>
 
<p>The students in each group had significantly different experiences. For one, the students with a specific learning goal worked to achieve it throughout the entirety of the gaming experience and did not feel lost or confused about their objective. In fact, their cognitive load was the lowest of any group. The students with a specific performance goal also worked to achieve it, but it was more frequently discarded throughout the learning tasks in the game. The students in the goal-free group, however, reported feeling lost and confused about what to do in the game, and therefore carried a great cognitive load. In addition, the students in the first two groups reported having significantly higher levels of fun than the students in the goal-free group.</p>
 
<p>These results may be important for educational video game designers and teachers implementing games in the classroom. The researchers suggest avoiding a goal-free environment in games as it jeopardizes student enjoyment and likely their learning experiences. Specific learning goals both increase student amusement during the game and decrease their cognitive load. Although the researchers did not closely examine the amount of content students learned in the game, the different goal conditions are likely to lead to differences in learning outcomes.</p>
