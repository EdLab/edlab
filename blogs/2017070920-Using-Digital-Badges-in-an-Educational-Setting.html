<p>As educational apps and online platforms continue to grow, designers are experimenting with different digital reward systems to figure out what makes lessons most sticky. One such system that is rapidly gaining popularity is that of digital badges. These symbols of achievement are akin to the badges scouts receive for mastering specific skills, except instead of sewing them to a vest, awardees can showcase them on an e-portfolio or social media platform.</p>
 
<p>Digital badges have been popular on educational apps, such as <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, where learners can recognize their past accomplishments despite not receiving an actual certificate. In this context, these badges motivate users to continue learning and allow them to identify their progress. They are also frequently used in other learning and professional environments to recognize often overlooked micro-skills, such as problem solving and decision making abilities.</p>
 
<p>In light of these factors, researchers have begun studying how digital badges can be used in online educational classes to engage students. A team of researchers recently developed a 4-part strategy that educators should consider before implementing digital badges to their learning contexts. They propose that educators should:

<ul><li>Design the badges in light of scaffolded learning, where they can be awarded in stages to exhibit improvement in skills;</li>
<li>Align the digital badges to educational standards so that they hold weight in an academic environment;</li>
<li>Plan how students will collect, display, and keep track of their badges;</li>
<li>Develop specific instructions on what the digital badges are, how they work, and what students can do with them once they receive them.</li></ul></p>
 
<p>While the authors of this study have yet to examine student outcomes and reactions in educational contexts that use this reward system, they predict that digital badges will motivate students to master skills and remain engaged throughout a class. Digital badges may also reinforce past lessons by providing a constant reminder of achievements. Studies on the exact educational effects of digital badges will have to be completed before we can rightly suggest adding them to online classes. But after this initial analysis, it seems likely that digital badges are here to stay.</p>
