<p><b>Bridging the Gap Between Real-World Video and High-Quality Analysis</b></p>

<p>Problems that require technological solutions providing both speed and precision are some of the most difficult to tackle, particularly because such technology can be difficult to find. However, these are exactly the types of problems Edgybees aims to solve. The company has created a technology that overlays AR with video streaming to improve a variety of situations, often that require both high-quality visuals and quick, intuitive functionality. The Edgybees platform is being used to improve agricultural and land management, construction, broadcast media, and gaming, but perhaps what it has become most known for is its use by first responders.</p>

<p><b>Tracking Disasters as They Unfold</b></p>

<p>Over the past year, Edgybees has been using its high speed AR technology in a drone-flying app, First Response, to maximize the effectiveness of aerial operations in emergency situations. This app orients first responders to natural disasters, crime scenes, or domestic fires by using an algorithm to overlay virtual signs, objects, and geo-located elements on top of live streaming video captured by a camera mounted on a drone or helicopter.</p>

<p>For example, during the Northern California wildfires of October 2017, First Response was able to mark on live streaming video where fire lines were, as well as the location of different teams of firefighters, in order to guide those approaching the situation.</p> 

<p><b>Keeping Tabs on Those Involved</b></p>

<p>Edgybees is not just concerned with creating technology to track environmental changes, but also with teaching team leaders and command centers how to keep first responders safe. In the first usage of First Response in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, Edgybees’ technology surveyed the area and assessed safety while tracking first responders as they did their job. The ability to keep personnel in sight can lead to the development of safer, more efficient emergency operations.</p></p>

<p>The Edgybees platform can also provide insight to farmers, architects, and construction companies who want to keep tabs on everything from underground infrastructure to irrigation systems. With this wide range of applications, this technology has the power to be truly influential.</p>
