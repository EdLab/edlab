          <p>
            <p>Last Friday and Saturday, SeungYeon and I attended the Fifth Conference on the Statistical Methods in Psychometrics. The conference is an annual event sponsored by the department of statistics at Columbia University. What I like most about this conference is that the invited speakers and participants are mostly researchers who work on the technical issues in psychometrics. So the topics are very concentrated with heavy methodological emphasis. The conference does not have parallel sessions, and each speaker is given 35 minutes with a good 5-10 minutes of Q&amp;A. </p><p><br /></p><p>This year, some of the invited speakers are Irini Moustaki - Professor at London School of Economics and the editor of Psychometrika, Edward Ip - professor at Wake Forest University's school of medicine, Han van der Maas - professor at University of Amsterdam, Dan Bolt - professor at University of Wisconsin and president-elect of the Psychometric Society, Jeff Douglas - professor at UIUC, Matthias von Davier - a well-known psychometrics researcher at National Board of Medical Examiners, Jimmy de la Torre - professor at the University of Hong Kong, and some other people in the field. It is pretty much an all-star line-up.</p><p><br /></p><p>A big common theme of the talks is centered around the novel methods for modeling the rich response data from various new types of assessments. For Example, Jean-Paul Fox from University of Twente his incremental test for assessing students' performance in serious gaming. In serious gaming, at each stage, a student is assessed whether he reached mastery of the current stage, and should be promoted to the next level. Dr. Fox developed an incremental log-likelihood ratio test that updates confidence of mastery after the student complete an action. In another example, Shiyu Wang from the University of Georgia developed a hidden Markov Model for modeling response and response time jointly. Specifically, her model considers the learning process. As time progress, students learn or master more attributes. In some sense, it is very related to what SeungYeon did in her dissertation. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
