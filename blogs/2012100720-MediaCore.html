<a href="http://mediacore.com/
">MediaCore</a> is a platform for creating branded, professional-looking video sites. Though the site caters to businesses and institutions as well as schools, MediaCore has included a suite of features that could potentially stand alone as a learning management system. The site is free for individual teachers and professors with payment plans aimed at schools and businesses.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
MediaCore has a strong focus on education with a <a href="http://mediacore.com/blog/category/higher-education
">devoted blog</a> that offers ways to use the tool in classrooms. The school-focused management features include strong privacy controls and a way to limit sharing and embedding of videos. The simplicity of the dashboard is deceptive as the controls are extremely powerful, especially for a free site. Users can add a domain, have lots of control over site appearance, and are even able to monetize video courses through advertising and enrollment fees. Despite its complexity, the dashboard and main pages are organized sensibly and videos <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/10/mediacore-raises-seed-funding-launches-platform-to-let-smbs-create-their-own-youtube/
">arrange automatically</a> by relevance and popularity.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
Though it contributes to the site’s ease of use, some of the elements seem almost too familiar; the iconography on the dashboard buttons seems similar to the style of the iPad and the external user-created sites are very Youtubesque. The site is extremely general compared to other educational video sharing sites like <a href="http://www.torsh.co/">TORSH</a>, and though their blog <a href="http://mediacore.com/blog/taking-video-capture-to-the-next-level">suggests audio</a> and video assists for recording lectures, the tool seems uncommitted to any particular filming arrangement. The distinctive features that they do offer for teachers occasionally backfire.  For instance it seems impossible to embed or link directly to their promotional video.</p> 

<p><b> Possibilities:</b><br>
The site has a robust educational dimension, but seems like a tool suited to businesses over schools. There are many sites and platforms for teachers to host video, but precious few secure spaces to host digital media for non-schools. MediaCore is much slicker than a Wiki and much easier to maintain than an Intranet. It also seems like a straightforward way for an individual to build out a for-profit online course. It’s certainly au courant to be a business solution with an edtech agenda, and tools that bridge this gap might be the missing link in the digitization of education.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
MediaCore is easy to use, but unusually powerful.</p>
