<p><b>Title:</b> Six Provocations for Big Data (2011) </p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> danah boyd & Kate Crawford </p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1926431"> A Decade in Internet Time: Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
What are the popular assumptions and biases in big data research? </p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The analytic phenomenon of big data has become common in every corner of our digital lives. The value of big data is in the patterns that can be discovered when making connections in huge datasets and the use of web-based technologies in school and life has made these large datasets readily available. Given its increasingly dominant role in our daily lives, the authors contend that users of big data should investigate its assumptions and biases to help us better understand its implications for research.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors, who are researchers at Microsoft, outline six provocations to challenge common perceptions about research with big data:
<ol><li>There may be limitations that come with this new approach of knowing. Rather than accepting results unquestioningly from automated research, users may need to recognize the inherent flaws of technologies for collecting big data and modify and augment analysis practices.</li>
<li>Big data research is never as objective as it seems. Regardless of the size of the data set, researcher interpretation is essential for research analysis and therefore subject to limitation and bias.</li>
<li>Bigger data is not always better. Solid research work comes through a systematic approach to data collection and analysis, which is not necessarily related to the size of the data.</li>
<li>Context matters; not all data are equivalent.</li>
<li>Donâ€™t be evil. Just because the data is public or accessible does not make it ethical to collect and analyze. Researchers should consider their accountability to both their field of research and their research subjects.</li> 
<li>Big data may widen the digital divide. Researchers and data collectors should deeply consider questions of access, constraint, and context in producing and working with big data. </li></ol></p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Undoubtedly, big data is shaping the future of our digital life. These six provocations push researchers, data scientists, and policy makers to reexamine big data research more carefully and thoroughly. One quick application to the field of education is in investigating the demographics and goals of MOOC learners before passing judgment about the retention and completion rates in MOOC courses.  In addition, policy makers should pay careful attention to student data ownership, access, and use. Keeping these issues in mind, educational researchers will get more in-depth, meaningful, and ethical knowledge from mining big educational data in the future. </p>
