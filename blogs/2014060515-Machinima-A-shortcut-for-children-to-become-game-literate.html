          <p>
            The word machinima <strong>machinima </strong>caught my attention when I was reviewing a study for New Learning Times.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paul_Gee" target = "blank">James Gee</a>, a professor who wrote prolifically in gaming and literacy at Arizona State University, also brought up this term in one of his recent talks. It is integrated from <strong>machi</strong>ne, a<strong>ni</strong>mation, and cine<strong>ma </strong> (see a full explanation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima" target="blank">here</a>) and is often in the form of live action or scripted in-game videos.  They are fun videos mainly created by veteran game players as instructional videos to guide novel players.
<p>
To get a flavor of machinima,  I curiously searched "Club Penguin" on YouTube. <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com" target="blank">Club Penguin (CP)</a> is a popular multi-player virtual game designed for primary-level children. I got 632,000 results from the search. Though it is hard to identify how many of them belong to machinima, my goal for the search was not to count the statistics but to view some machinima examples created by children. So I randomly clicked into several to view the content - they are not only "tip" videos that demonstrate how to navigate CP, but "cheat" videos that provide shortcuts to getting all the "goodies" such as how to quickly earn money in the game, how to find the keys to all the secret rooms, and how to unlock some game items.
<p>
These machinimas made me wonder about children's gaming experiences - they navigate, read in-game information, communicate with in-game avatars, and meanwhile watch machinimas to achieve their game goals? For the machinima video makers, they are probably motivated to create those instructional videos to satisfy their audiences and re-affirm their identities as game masters? I was just amazed by children's capabilities of producing such rich-text videos to address their new style of teaching and learning in video games.
