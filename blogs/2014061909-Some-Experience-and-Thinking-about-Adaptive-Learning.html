            Tradeoff? That's the problem. As a user, I believe the learning experience can be improved with more deliberately designed and integrated learning resources that have “good” portions of both the “interactive” and “non-interactive” contents. Thus users can have better opportunities of gaining both practical experience and divergent thinking based of the knowledge they are learning.
<p>
With the advance of education technologies, nearly all online learning resources have more or less adaptive learning features. Some obvious examples are Coursera's interactive quiz and Udacity's interactive programming classrooms. Some of them are highly interactive (like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target = "blank">Codecademy</a>), and some are just embedded with small partial of interaction.
<p>
From a programming language learner's perspective, I really feel there might be a noticeably different learning experience between those “highly interactive” learning resources and “relatively non-interactive” learning resources. Take Codecademy and Coursera as two opposite examples – when using Codecademy, we follow the instructions on the prompts and build apps or web features step by step. For Coursera, on the other hand, the content are more likely to be videos with few pauses. According to my own experience, Codecademy brings me more practical skills while Coursera gives me more space to have divergent thinking. It is not surprising to have this kind of experience, basically because following the instructions and complete what I am told to do can obviously narrow our thoughts, while Coursera's contents provide us with basic knowledge and open opportunities for more thinking.
