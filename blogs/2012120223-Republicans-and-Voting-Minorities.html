          <p>
            My ongoing series on EdLab alumni and their endeavors after they've left the Lab focuses on Skanda Amarnath. Ever the economics guru during his time here, Skanda was known for his <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6281">Schoolyard Brawl</a> series with Fred, among others. Skanda recently wrote an <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/14/how-do-you-make-inroads-with-asian-americans.html">article</a> for the Daily Beast regarding the voting patterns of Asian Americans in light of the just concluded presidential elections. Skanda's post was in response to a post election podcast he had heard from columnists David Frum and Bob Shrum, specifically how Asian South and East Asians in Canada had strongly voted for the Conservatives there in their most recent election.  

Skanda notes how Republicans have lost significant ground among Asian Americans in the past 20 years, bucking the trend by their peers in Canada. He lists various reasons for the evaporating support for Republicans by Asian Americans, including insults, and lack of general understanding by the former of the latter's views on social issues and economic programs. Though they have taken a heavy beating among most minority groups, Skanda does offer some hope for the Republican Party; please see his article. As a member of a voting minority (young and Hispanic), I agree with most of Skanda's argument. It seems the Republican Party has either lost touch with big voting blocs or have no idea how to appeal to them. It is going to be interesting to see the direction of Republican Party after another Electoral College blowout.
