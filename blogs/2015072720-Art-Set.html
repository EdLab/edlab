<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/art-set/id469918702?mt=8">Art Set</a> is an app that is designed to feel like a real art set in your pocket. Choose your canvas and then create your masterpiece with any of the available materials in the artist's drawer. All you need is your finger and your portable Apple device to start creating. You can change the effect of your strokes by using more or less pressure and different speeds. Smudging is even possible to give work an authentic appearance that is normally not achievable with digital art application. In Art Set, you can bring your works to life using the same techniques you would use with physical art materials. Once you have created a few visual art pieces, you can view them all in the gallery, share them with your friends, and show your artwork off to the world.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The most impressive feature of this app is the realistic appearance of the media and materials. Oil pastels and colored pencils appear on the canvas just as they would if you had them in front of you in physical form. The array of tools is impressive and each is available in many colors. There are even various weaves and colors of canvas to use as the backdrop for your art. Uploading a picture from your device to start with is another option. The undo button is one of the best parts of the app, since it allows you to do what you wish you could do in real life â€“ remove that brush stroke that just ruined your vision! </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Since you are using your fingertip, it can be difficult to be precise. A variety of brush tip options in the oil paint function would help to remedy this issue. Also, there is no way to mix colors to form a new shade. The colors simply blend together when smudged, so users are unable to create nuanced shades using the available colors. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Art Set is a beautiful and vibrant app that allows users to create realistic works of art. A great find for serious, amateur, and casual artists, this app is a great option for anyone looking for a way to create beautiful visual art. It is easy to use and is appropriate for people of any age. It would be great for users trying to expand their creativity and connect to art if they do not have regular access to physical art materials. It is also perfect for art on the go.</p>
