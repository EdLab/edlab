<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

In their second collaboration, Wilcox and Angelis tell the stories of high school educators who embody best practices in their day-to-day activities--practices that consistently lead to higher student academic achievement across the core subjects for all students. This book shares results of a multi-case study of how some high schools consistently deliver better student performance, including improved four-year graduation rates. These schools have learned how to successfully adapt to the climate of increased (and increasing) accountability. Best Practices from High-Performing High Schools is for anyone who strives to ensure that all teens graduate from high school and are ready to succeed in college, in their careers, and in life.
