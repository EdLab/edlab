<p>Students have different motivations for taking online and blended learning (OBL) courses, and it’s important for teachers and institutions to understand those before developing new classes. OBL refers to learning that takes place partially online and partially in-person. Many higher education institutions are adopting this pedagogical model in order to meet the needs of their students, especially older students with families or jobs who would not enroll in a course if it met entirely in-person.</p>
 
<p>In order to analyze different students’ motivations for enrolling in OBL courses, a group of researchers conducted a two-part study that consisted of questionnaires and interviews. They collected a total of 166 responses from students of differing ages and backgrounds, yet all enrolled in an OBL teacher education program.</p>
 
<p>The results show three main motivations students had in taking OBL courses: intrinsic value, attainment value, and utility value. Those motivated by the intrinsic value of OBL were more likely to enjoy self-study, working with technology, and engaging with their classmates online and in-person. Students motivated by attainment value mostly wanted to succeed in the course for personal fulfillment and to avoid the guilt and shame of failing. These students most enjoyed OBL activities such as independent learning and social motivation. Finally, students motivated by utility value wanted their participation in an OBL course to help them attain very real and practical goals regarding their future, valuing the flexibility of OBL and its inclusion of face-to-face sessions.</p>
 
<p>While some students demonstrated more than one of these motivations, all students identified with at least one. Teachers and institutions should be aware of these differing motivations in order to develop the best classes for the particular students taking them.</p>
 
<p>Specifically, the researchers suggest that teachers ensure their OBL courses have a good balance of in-person and online moments, and that students receive enough support online even when they are learning from a distance. They also recommend that teachers alleviate some of the unnecessary tension in group work online by organizing groups based on students’ values. These efforts could help students no matter their motivation for taking the OBL course, but the researchers still recommend curating other particular experiences based on the groups’ motivational factors.</p>
