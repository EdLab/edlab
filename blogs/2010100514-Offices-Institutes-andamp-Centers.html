            College News and Departmental Notes: The Trustees Establish an Institute of Educational Research

by Departmental notes — 1921

At the meeting of the Trustees of Teachers College, held on Thursday, February 10, an Institute of Educational Research was established to promote the scientific study of education in cooperation with the several departments of the College and with other institutions interested in investigation and research. The establishment of this Institute will undoubtedly prove to be one of the most significant forward steps in the history of the College, since it makes definite provision for research in education along lines of that already found in medicine and engineering, with a separate organization and full-time staff devoting itself exclusively to this work....

The Office of Research in Home Economics Education: Teachers College, Columbia University (1924)

by Annie Robertson Dyer — 1926

THE office of research in Home Economics education was instituted at Teachers College in September, 1924. Its tentative program was built on the basis of what seemed to be an insistent: demand from the school field. During 1920-21 a committee of the staff of Teachers College, Pratt Institute, the Commonwealth School, and the New York public schools, with Professor Cooley of Teachers College as chairman, met "to recognize and if possible crystallize some of the problems in household arts educational research." Dr. Bonser presented to this group a "proposed survey of standards of family life in United States." This was studied and worked over, and the next year there were outlined plans for "an analysis of the fundamental needs of American home life, a study of homemaking activities and relationships in terms of learning difficulties." During the year 1923-24 a group of the faculty of Teachers College met regularly to study further research in household arts education. Needs, problems, and methods of study were formulated by Professors Bonser, Rugg, Winchell, Cooley, and Snedden, and criticisms were given by other members. Miss Florence Winchell was the working member of the committee. She assembled studies already made which gave information on homes and needs of children, and facts regarding consumers. At the end of that year a research associate in household arts education was appointed. During 1924-25 a group of thirty members of the practical household arts and education faculties of Teachers College met monthly with Dean Russell to discuss and arrange a program of home economics educational research. Since a sound basis was desired, the research associate made three preliminary studies: (1) a field problem study; (2) a study of research methods and their possible use in home economics education; (3) a study of bureaus conducting social and educational research—their programs and office organization....
