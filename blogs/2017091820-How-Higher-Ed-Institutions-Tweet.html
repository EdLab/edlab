<p>A group of researchers recently combed through nearly six million tweets from all of the higher education institutions in the U.S. that have Twitter accounts (not including community colleges) to assess how they used the social media platform. Around 84% of colleges and universities have Twitter accounts, and the data collected represents 62% of all tweets created by the entire population of U.S. colleges and universities.</p>
 
<p>This massive amount of data indicates four prominent trends in higher education Twitter usage:</p>
 
<ul><li>1. Twitter is often lauded as being a fantastic social media tool for engaging in conversation and dialogue. Despite this, the platform is not often used that way by higher ed institutions. Most of their tweets (nearly 80%) were made as one-way streets to spread information, rather than to converse or respond to followers.</p>
 
<li>2. Where some tweets have links to other websites, most of these tweets link back to other institutional social media platforms. In other words, if a college’s tweet includes a link, it will mostly likely be one directing the reader to an Instagram or Facebook post rather than to an outside news source. This points to what the researchers call a limited ecosystem of web participation.</p>
 
<li>3. Most tweets sent by higher ed institutions are neutral in sentiment, although they create many positive-sounding tweets as well. As most tweets are informative, it makes sense that most are also neutral. Positive tweets tend to commend student achievements or discuss exciting campus activities. Institutions very rarely, however, write a negative-sounding tweet. These are generally reserved to share bad news with the student body rather than to complain about day-to-day events.</p>
 
<li>4. When tweets contain images, they almost always reflect a positive aspect of the institution. The most common types of shared pictures reflect student activities, campus attractiveness, and ceremonies or other events.</p></ul>
 
<p>The researchers think that these results point to a specific concern: most institutional uses of Twitter are not living up to their educational potential. While Twitter can be a fantastic conversational tool, most institutions use it as a platform for monologues rather than dialogues. Ultimately, the researchers think that institutions should reconsider how they use their official Twitter accounts, and explore ways to more positively affect change on campus or in their larger communities.</p>
