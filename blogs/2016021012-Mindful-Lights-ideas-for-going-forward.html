            Mindful Lights was a labor of love that evolved over several months and finally was installed in early December 2015. Although I only participated in the final production phase of the project I was able to appreciate how many iterations had been considered and how much technology was involved for it to produce the calming, serine effect.

Now that the design team knows how to make something like Mindful Lights we thought we'd take a moment to come up with follow-up ideas that use the same technology that could be used in the Learning Theater. SK, Veronica, Jackie and I came up with some options:

Zoe's Idea:

LED lights are used as "Breadcrumbs" to guide audience members through a maze of darkened spaces (for projected content). The LEDS turn on when the rangefinders (large blue dots) sense them and that triggers the Fadecandy to light the way to the next phase of the gallery/space.  Each section of the exhibit has a color associated with it which allocates special significance to the section as they pass through. The colors fade into one another and have directionality which helps the audience know which way to go next. 

At the end (Long final hallway) the LEDS "review" the content by ranging through all the colors while the screens on the wall sum up the experience. 

No tubes were harmed in this exhibit.
