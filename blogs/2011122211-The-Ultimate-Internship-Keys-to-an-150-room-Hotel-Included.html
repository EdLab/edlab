Imagine you are nearing your last semester of high school, and instead of going to work at a company as an intern for the summer ... your teacher arranges for you to help RUN the company.  An Italian prof has done just that.  For over ten years the  <a href="http://www.mipschool.eu/2011/summer/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=82&Itemid=102&lang=en">“Mission in Polsa” (Mission is Possible) program</a>, the only of its kind in Europe, has been run by a teacher at Don Milani high school in Rovereto, Italy.  Allowing young people to have complete control of a 150 room hotel for a number of weeks every summer.  Professor Maurio Enea explains the inspiration behind the program, “We wanted to provide the students with an opportunity to do for real the things that they study ... Too often during their internships, our students are offered only minor duties. Our goal is to give them the opportunity to choose, to make decisions, maybe to make mistakes -- but always using their own brains."  Brains, eh... what a concept & sadly underused in many internship experiences.    

<b>The EdLab Takeaway... </b>
I know that historically, here at the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/">EdLab</a>, we have always tried to provide meaningful experiences and work for our <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/416">apprentices</a>, but I know that this is not usually the case.  Many interns throughout the country and world are expected to quietly (& quickly!) get coffee and function as unpaid assistants to many top-level executives and their teams.  It is refreshing to learn that there is another model alive and well functioning for over a decade in a small town in Italy, providing 18 & 19 year-olds with a life-changing experience. What a seemingly simple concept, that these students would be able to "use their brains" as opposed to simply procuring caffeine.  I wonder if guests are equally happy with the experience?  How can other real-world opportunities like <a href="http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/master-class/index.html">HBO's MasterClass</a> be integrated into the American Secondary School experience?  What are are other examples?  How do we create a more meaningful internship experience?  Perhaps this will help to alleviate some student loan debt, as young people are then able to make better decisions about their direction for college, or in many cases <a href="http://www.uncollege.org/">un-college</a>.
