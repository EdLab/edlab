<i>CodeNow is a nonprofit serving youth in New York City and Washington D.C. In the Fall of 2013 we are expanding to San Francisco.  We provide free out-of-school training in computer programming to high schoolers. Our students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch at school. More than 40% are young women. We encourage collaboration among our students as they develop their programming skills. This is fundamental to their success.</i> (From the CodeNow.org site) 

<p><b>Reading, Writing and Coding</b><br>
<a href="http://codenow.org/"> CodeNow </a> believes that coding is the new "literacy," yet many underserved schools cannot afford to include training in this specialized skill set.  Additionally, many employers now view advanced computer programming skills as a necessity and these highly specialized jobs are only predicted to grow in the coming years (CodeNow projects that by 2018 the US will have added another 1.2 million new tech jobs).  Despite this growth many young graduates are often not exposed to training early enough to pursue these fields (see <a href="http://theinstitute.ieee.org/opinions/question/a-programmer-shortage">this short piece</a> on the issue), thereby further widening the "skills gap."   CodeNow hopes to help young people discover and pursue careers in computer science by offering free after-school training programs.  Also, the group, which has locations in New York, Washington D.C. and soon San Francisco, partners with community groups and organizations not only to offer training but also to provide laptops, mentorship and internship opportunities.  Since 2011 CodeNow has offered these services as extra curricular, off-campus workshops, and provided over 10,600 hours of free instruction.   
<p>
Despite the fact that all participants qualify for the free lunch program, many will go on to become computer programmers (one-third of DC seniors who graduate from the program have gone on to CS programs) and ALL are able to "build a Twitter app or an encryption engine in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby</a>."  CodeNow embraces the tenets of <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning">project-based learning</a>, employs talented tutor/mentors, and focuses on inclusion.  For example, this past summer participants in <a href="http://codenow.org/2013/08/20/codenow-nyc-provides-5000-hours-of-training-through-summer-fellowship/">CodeNowâ€™s Summer Fellowship</a> learned advanced computer programming and were given the opportunity to intern at leading companies.  Not only did these young learners gain valuable work experience at companies ranging from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> to Microsoft, but they were paid a stipend, that allowed them to experience first-hand many of the perks of computer science-focused careers. 
<p>
<b>Further Filling the Access Gap</b><br>
CodeNow is designed to address the "access gap" in computer science.  With access to engaging, high quality computer science training at the secondary level, young people will be inspired to pursue these subjects in early college, thereby leading to well-prepared job seekers who are ready to fill the increasing demand for 21st century skills.  CodeNow places a special focus on young women and minorities, groups who currently makeup only about 22% and 5% (respectively) of the technology workforce (source: <a href="http://codenow.org/#">CodeNow site</a>).  This focus on inclusion allows CodeNow to help bridge the computer science skills-gap and the gender and race gaps.  Very NOW indeed.
