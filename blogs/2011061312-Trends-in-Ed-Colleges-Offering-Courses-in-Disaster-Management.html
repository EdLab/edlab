          <p>
            With natural and man-made disasters dominating the news in recent years, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/education/10disaster.html">colleges and universities across the country are offering disaster management courses to undergraduate students</a>. The need for such courses can be directly traced back to 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina as those were the first prominent disasters today's college students witnessed in their lives.

Though the classes offered at various campuses differ in terms of content, its overlying theme is how to prepare or deal with crisis. NYU is offering a course in disaster mental health while SUNY New Paltz has a whole department, Institute of Disaster Mental Health dedicated to the many aspects of disasters such as geography, media, global terrorism and death in American society in addition to learning about the latest approaches to aiding disaster victims, including physical and emotional needs. 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) first encouraged colleges to create supplements to its training course at the University of Maryland in 1995. Now, there are over 232 such programs nationwide, most of them after 9/11. There is an additional 112 homeland security courses, most of which focus solely on terrorism. Graduates from such programs usually gain employment with local, state and federal emergency-management agencies as well as schools and hospitals that want emergency management plans in place of one.

I wonder if those working on the National Center for Disaster Preparedness project can look into the online resources available for some of the courses at the institutions mentioned in the Times article and how that informs what they eventually create.
