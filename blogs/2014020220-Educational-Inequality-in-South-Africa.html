          <p>
            Though apartheid as a practice ended in South Africa two decades ago, you'll be surprised to know that this system still continues in South African classrooms and job market. According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/opinion/molefe-south-africas-failing-grade.html?_r=0">op-ed</a>, there are two types of educational systems in South Africa: a functional school system for the wealthy, and a dysfunctional public school system for poor black students. Although most of the governmental schools were reserved for white children during apartheid, these same schools have been developed and gaining entry to them is now expensive and very competitive. 

As a result, black students are enrolled in poor schools with a lack of resources. In essence, these students are not receiving the proper education to prepare them for 21st century professional life. Consequently, they are having a hard time finding employment. Employers complain that most of the students that apply for jobs have bad rÃ©sumÃ©s and cover letters, and lack work ethic. But the truth of the matter is these students are not the ones to be blame, but an inferior public education system that failed to adequately prepare them. The most important concern now is how and what can be done to make sure that all people of South Africa, whether black or white, can receive an equal and quality education.
