<p>Those who have been calling for bans on homework may want to reconsider—particularly when it comes to coding classes. Researchers from Taiwan have shown that annotations and homework for Scratch programming coursework are correlated to increases in student learning performance. The authors of the study developed an annotation-based Scratch programming system (ASP) prior to the study and used it in a sixth grade class on coding.</p>
 
<p>The students in the class had no previous experience with Scratch, and were asked to take Scratch achievement tests before and after the course. The authors then collected data on six variables: the number of annotations and homework activities completed and reviewed by the students, as well as ones completed by their peers that they, in turn, reviewed.</p>
 
<p>The researchers then turned to determine the relationships between the six different variables and academic performance in the class. Particularly of note was the finding that only the number of homework solutions seemed to significantly predict achievement. The researchers posited that reviewing peers’ annotations may not be particularly helpful for studying or learning because annotations tend to be very personal and only closely connected to the creator him or herself. However, the students completed a satisfaction survey, which revealed that they had positive impressions overall of how the annotation system benefited their learning. </p>

<p>With the recent clamor to add more computer programming classes to elementary and secondary education, teachers and administrators alike may want to consider how to develop those courses. With so many ways to teach and learn coding, studies like this can help determine what types of instructional strategies best promote learning and achievement in programming classes.</p>
