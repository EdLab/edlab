<p>Emoticons are the original emojis, and are still regularly used for texting and other instant messaging. Little research has been done on how these visual communicative representations impact advice-taking. To test these effects, researchers conducted two experiments on a group of college students that focused on how likely participants were to follow advice when it was given with emoticons.</p>

<p>The first experiment used a sample of 42 students from eastern China and asked participants to answer questions about four different scenarios, such as the optimal time for their university to begin afternoon classes, and to rate their level of personal involvement with the given topic. After making an initial choice, students received a text message either with or without emoticons advising them to make the opposite selection. The experimenters then recorded any of the resulting choice changes. Below is an example of a text with emoticons:</p>

<aside class="quotebox">
    <blockquote>
        <i><p>I think B is better. If the classes begin at half past one, they can have a rest at noon (*^u^*). It is tired and hurried for them to have lessons just after lunch (T＿T).</i></p>
    </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>The results showed that overall, advice sent with emoticons was more influential, however, the effect was highly dependent on participants’ level of involvement with the given scenarios. For students with low involvement, the emoticons were highly predictive of their taking advice, while those with high involvement were not influenced by emoticons at all. The researchers posited that students with high involvement made decisions primarily based on outside context. </p> 

<p>The second experiment replicated the first, but also measured participants’ <i>need for cognition</i> (NFC), a psychological term meaning the extent to which individuals are drawn to and enjoy effortful cognitive activities. In this experiment, all of the results from the first test were replicated, while the added NFC measure provided further information. Students that scored low on the NFC were more affected by the use of emoticons when compared to their counterparts who were higher on the scale. For these high NFC respondents, they were keen on taking advice, but there was no difference in their response to texts with or without emoticons.</p>  

<p>The results of the experiments were not surprising to the researchers, but because this is a new area of inquiry, they admitted that future studies are needed in more diverse settings. Given the growing prevalence of <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4592/its-time-to-admit-that-theres-no-such-thing-as-a">multitasking</a> between devices and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4075/the-changing-landscape-of-online-education">online education</a>, researchers will need a better understanding of how different types of people react to these popular forms of communication.</p>
