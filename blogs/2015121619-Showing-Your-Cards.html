<p>There has always been a market for card games for children in the toy industry, with many of them focused on fantasy worlds and fictional characters. Second Avenue Learning wanted to take advantage of that by introducing an educational element into the mix. TARGETS features characters based on the periodic table of elements and allows for game play both through the physical cards as well as an augmented reality setting.</p>

<p>The card game offers students the opportunity to learn about atomic and molecular structures, and the augmented reality provides them the chance to solve science problems in a 3D world. For example, students may be prompted to create water molecules in both forms of game play. Users can play individually or with others, and the device tracks activity and progress over time.</p>

<p>Would you be interested in learning science through card play? Is an augmented reality world more engaging than traditional forms of science instruction? Chime in <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25293/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:24 Nantwi:</b> I am big fan of card games, especially those that forces players to critically think and strategize. It is extremely helpful for young children during the early years as it teaches them skills that can use during their educational journey. </p>

<p><b>@01:11 Brian.Sweeting:</b> I think one of the advantages of using card games is that it encourages self-directed learning. I wonder what the ratio of teacher-to-student time is during these games. </p>

<p><b>@01:15 PG.Williamson:</b> Hands-on/experiential learning helps me internalize concepts even as a graduate student, which points to the large impact that must have on the malleable minds of young students. </p>
