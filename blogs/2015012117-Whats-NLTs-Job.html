            My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard, and I'm like.... this is not why I bought this milkshake. Please get off my property. 

So why did I buy the milkshake? Famed Harvard Business School professor (and author of Steve Jobs' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma" target="_blank">favorite business book</a>) Clayton Christensen can help answer that one. He developed the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) theory to reframe a question product owners have been wondering since the dawn of the free market: instead of asking a customer why they bought a product, ask them what job the product was hired to do. Switching to this line of questioning returned surprising insights for Christensen and his team as they wondered why, in the very early morning, were people buying so many milkshakes from a fast food restaurant?

Watch this short (<5 min) clip of Christensen telling the story in his own words to find out the answer: 

<iframe src="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play_embedded/19541" width="540" height="700" frameBorder="0" scrolling="No"></iframe>

<b>How to get from product purchase to insight</b>

A JTBD interview differs from a usability test in that it doesn't focus on feature sets. Usability tests have their place and function (<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/11536" target="_blank">heavens knows I love them</a>) but with JTBD, you're discovering what drives people to choose (or not choose) your product over others. <i>It helps you understand the motivations of your users.</i> It's quite an empathic form of research. 

JTBD interviews are a lot like investigations. Questions start broad and become probing.  
Imagine that the interviewer is a filmmaker, and she's trying to script an exact representation of the time you made the purchase in question. To do that, she might ask what day of the month it was, what the weather was like, what you had for lunch that day. It's maybe the only time an interviewer can get away with asking, “What were you wearing?” without sounding creepy. Assumptions have no place here.

Interviews are nonlinear but the eventual mission is to be able to fill in the gaps on a timeline that starts at a customer's first thought [of the product] and ends with their retrospective evaluation of satisfaction.

The interview brings customers back to the moment they purchased the product and back further still to the moment that inspired them to search for the product. The goal here is not to bombard the interviewee with seemingly ridiculous questions, but to get them accustomed to remembering.  Anyone who has listened to the first episode of Serial knows how hard it can be to remember details correctly, even if an event happened recently. 

<b>What market research doesn't tell you</b>

Personas are great when you are first pitching a product and you want your investors (or dev team) to buy into your vision. It gets people on the same page with who you are trying to reach. But you don't create solutions for a persona, you create them for a problem. Similarly, segmenting customers based on demographics and psychographics can't help you explain <i>why</i> someone made a purchase. In other words, if I know that someone is 30, male, and married with kids, it doesn't tell me why they purchased a Costco membership. Flipping that around, people don't buy Costco memberships because they are 30.

Focus groups are another technique born of traditional research. Henry Ford famously said, “Ask people what they want, they'll say a faster horse.” People know what they like, but they can only suggest improvements to what they know. Case in point: the iPhone 5c--  the cheaper, more colorful, and <a href="http://airherald.com/whats-next-for-the-iphone-5c-possibly-apples-worst-selling-iphone-ever/9405/" target="_blank">worst selling iPhone of all time.</a>

Asking customers about the jobs they are hiring for allows you to uncover whitespaces-- areas that are currently filled by less-than-optimal solutions. This gives competitors the opportunity to swoop in with better solutions. Interestingly, JTBD interviews often challenge expectations of competitors. In the milkshake example, the researchers found that the restaurant being observed wasn't competing with other fast food joints on milkshakes alone; bagels, bananas, and donuts were in the arena as well. 

<b>JTBD and NLT sitting in a tree</b>

It's an interesting enough question I'd like to pose to current and former NLT readers. Why'd they come to us in the first place and why'd they fire us? NLT is a good place to start because its user base perplexes me. 

<b>TL;DR</b>
Jobs-to-be-done is a theory we can use to understand the motivations behind our users' decisions to adopt (and disown) our products. I plan to implement this framework to learn how we might better develop or position our products for biggest impact. 

<b>TL;DR the TL;DR</b>
I heard about this thing, so I'm going to do the thing. Results forthcoming!
