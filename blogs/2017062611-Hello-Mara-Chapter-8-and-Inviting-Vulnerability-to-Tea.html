            <p>        <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> </span><img src="http://www.artelino.eu/images/stories/articles/buddha-life-mara-demon/buudha-life-mara-demon3.jpg" style="font-size: 0.875rem; width: 637px; float: none; height: 374.5px;" /></p><p><br /></p><p>There is a great story about the Demon God Mara and the Buddha. The night before his enlightenment, Buddha defeated a great evil demon: Mara. However Mara did not stay defeated and would rear up at intervals to interrupt the work of Buddha. Rather than ignore Mara or drive him away, Buddha would say &quot;I see you Mara&quot; and invite the terrifying specter to tea.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="http://This story is often used by Psychologistshttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-true-refuge/201508/inviting-mara-tea">This story is often used by Psychologists</a> to help people understand depression, anxiety and fear. These uncomfortable feelings are so often pushed aside, buried or masked by people in order to avoid feeling weak and afraid. Anthony Tjan feels similarly about vulnerability in the pursuit of goodness in business.</p><p><br /></p><p>To Tjan, vulnerability (also known as 'risk' in business terms) indicates the unsexy and humbling barriers that are seldom explored by people interested in big rewards and profits. He uses the example of &quot;MiniLux&quot; - a chain of health, safety and worker satisfaction-oriented nail salons that he and his partners developed. The vulnerability was to take an overlooked (thus unsexy) and often abusive industry and upgrade elements (by eschewing some of the products like acrylics) to create a better service for workers and customers. Customers might prefer the cheaper, more toxic options that harmed the workers, investors may not be impressed by the industry. These were the specters that came to Tjan - and he felt them - but also saw the potential for his known purpose: to ensure that human capital remains the guiding principle behind everything they do.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote>Accepting the premise that we all have flaws of competency and character should give leaders the courage to share these flaws, confront them, and find strength in them. This is the basis of both trust and authenticity.</blockquote><p>Tjan spends a little time talking about &quot;Passive&quot; vs &quot;Active&quot; Vulnerability which I personally find problematic as it puts pressure on an already volatile personal feeling to &quot;not be weak&quot;- which is the point of vulnerability. I don't think a distinction can be made in the variety of vulnerabilities, especially one that he believes should be recognized and acted upon in the moment of experience. However I definitely agree that v<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">ulnerability, in addition to the traditional elements of entrepreneurship like conviction and confidence are a balance that must be acknowledged, if not invited in to join the party.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Here are some resources mentioned in Chapter 8</b></p><p>Brene Brown's TED talk on the<a href="http://Power of Vulnerability https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability"> Power of Vulnerability </a>and her book &quot;<a href="http://Daring Greatlyhttps://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419">Daring Greatly</a>&quot;</p><p>Sarah Lewis's TED talk <a href="http://Embrace the Near Winhttps://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_lewis_embrace_the_near_win">Embrace the near Win</a> and her book &quot;<a href="http://The Risehttp://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Rise/Sarah-Lewis/9781451629248">The Rise</a>&quot;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><div><br /></div>
