          <p>
            I recently discovered that my passion for volunteerism now has a new polished purpose - team building. The company that I intern at for over a year now put together a great excursion and a visit to an organization called 'rocking the boat' (http://www.rockingtheboat.org/) where we worked as a team to assist high school students to build boats. The organization uses boat building to engage students from underprivileged backgrounds in an effort to empower them to become responsible adults. The idea is simple , like most non-profits and volunteerism goes a long way in their mission of achieving positive results. Team building as a concept is inherently important to every organization and may entail different things depending on the organizational culture. <strong></strong>

<strong>Team Building</strong> refers to a wide range of activities, presented to  businesses, schools, sports teams, religious or nonprofit organizations  designed for improving team <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance">performance</a>. Team building is pursued via a variety of practices, and can range from simple <a title="Human bonding" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_bonding">bonding</a> exercises to complex simulations and multi-day team building retreats  designed to develop a team (including group assessment and <a title="Group-dynamic games" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group-dynamic_games">group-dynamic games</a>), usually falling somewhere in between (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_building).

Here are some of the reasons why team building is important :
<ol>
	<li>Team building allows employees to get to know each other to build rapport and thus, facilitates amicability in the workplace.</li>
	<li>Working in teams allows organization members to experiment with new roles and learn from other members thus, creating synergy with strengths and weaknesses.</li>
	<li>Team building activities foster innovation and creativity and create new energy to take back to the office.</li>
</ol>
Further, looking into academic data that supports the idea of combining volunteerism and team building the following article was found in our database 'Intra-Organizational Volunteerism: Good Soldiers, Good Deeds and Good Politics' (http://www.jstor.org/stable/25123759). This article labels combining the two things as 'employer sanctioned volunteerism' which creates motivation for employees and adds to their feelings of personal benefits attached to the organization.

In another arcticle 'Toward a conceptual framework of employee volunteerism: an aid for the human resource manager' (http://search.proquest.com/docview/212092494) different types of volunteer activities are outlined followed by the advantages it has on the organization. For example the article revealed the following comments:  a number of respondents indicated that their volunteer activities gave  them new ideas they could use in the work place. Specifically,  respondents noted that "exposure to a variety of people and situations  helps me be more creative at work". The skills that volunteers felt they received from their volunteer  activities were, primarily, people skills. It was noted that "the more  you work with people, the more it's going to improve your customer  contact" and "when you are exposed to a variety of situations (as in  volunteer activities) you are better able to relate to people who are  different from you". Some interviewees explained that "I've become more  comfortable contacting people that I don't know very well" and,  volunteering "shows you ways of communicating more effectively with a  diverse group of people, this is particularly important when working  with cross-functional teams". Other skills gained through volunteer  activities included "management and organizational skills", training  skills, and the ability to "balance my time and prioritize my  responsibilities" (Wright &amp; Jacoby, 2000).

Team building is a recognized approach in the direction of Organization Development and the following article discusses the Department of State's first attempt at it 'Team Building—One Approach to Organizational Development' (http://jab.sagepub.com/content/6/3/291). Last but not least... having a pay day to do what you love and get  better at you're being paid for is not a bad deal - so start talking  about it and it may just happen !
