<p><a href="http://spritebox.com/">SpriteBox</a> teaches coding to kids of all ages. By solving puzzles in a Mario-esque world, players learn sequencing, parameters, loops, procedures, and basic Swift and Java syntax. There are two iterations of the game: a free trial version, SpriteBox: Code Hour, and a full-blown coding course, SpriteBox Coding, which costs $4.99.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>SpriteBox’s greatest success is that it never makes the player feel like they’re engaging in an educational activity. Because the gamification of coding tasks is so effective, you are able to learn without realizing you’re learning. Every task is framed as a puzzle, so while you’re recognizing patterns and experimenting with different functions, you’re not only building steps and bridges to continue through the maze, you’re also learning Swift or Java.</p>

<p>The game is definitely reminiscent of Super Mario, which is also great fun for anyone who grew up with the classic video game. By using a model that is familiar, players intuitively know to run and jump to collect points and free trapped creatures. However, unlike Mario, your character can’t die. The ability to repeat new skills without a time limit or fear of repercussions makes SpriteBox a good environment for experimenting and learning.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that the demo app is substantial; there are four different courses to try out, and each has a good amount of puzzles to complete. This is a great way to determine whether or not to invest in the full program.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>A hint function in SpriteBox would be helpful. While you can repeat instructions as much as you want, there are no tips to guide you along if you’re unsure how to solve a puzzle. I like that experimentation is encouraged, but not knowing how to find a path forward can cause frustration.</p>

<p>Though the platform teaches both Java and Swift, it is very unclear how to switch between the two, especially for beginners. There is an icon at the very beginning of the game that turns Java off and Swift on, but unless you know exactly what to look for, it’s unlikely you’ll find it. It would be great if the meaning of the icons were clearer, and if they were easier to find.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Overall, I found SpriteBox to be fun, clever, and sufficiently educational. Though a clearer understanding of its application to the real world of coding would be nice, the game itself is very successful in achieving its set learning objectives.</p>
