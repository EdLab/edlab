            <a href ="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509001092"> Wing-mui So, Winnie, Wai-cheong Pow, Jacky, Hung, Vincent Hing-keung (2009), The interactive use of a video database in teacher education: Creating a knowledge base for teaching through a learning community. <i>Computers & Education</i>, 53 (2009) 775—786 </a>
   
<b>Description:</b> This paper is describes an interesting study on how student teachers in Hong Kong learned how to improve their teaching practices through the use of an online interactive video database platform. Student teachers would record themselves teaching a class, and then post the recorded video on the website that would allow other student teachers to comment during the video with observations on teaching practices, and thus form a collaborative learning community. This study explores the use of online discussions on these recordings. The objective is to find out whether the feedback on the recorded video, would help these student teachers improve on their teaching techniques.

Hope their basic website features sounds familiar to my fellow Edlabbers, as the website used in the study is very similar to our own website <a href ="https://vialogues.com/"> Vialogues</a>:

<b>Method:</b> After the video database website was developed, the student teachers involved, participated in a workshop where they learned how to utilize the site and were given guides on how to record their classrooms. Student teachers would record and then upload a 35-40 minute video of themselves teaching a classroom, after their fellow student teachers viewed the video they would use the “Mark-in/Mark-out” function to comment on a specific section of the video. These comments would be posted on a virtual bulletin board that is shared within the community of members, where they can view the segment and provide constructive comments, as well as respond to each others comment. These functions are comparable to our own Vialogues, which uses time-stamped comments, that is similar to the “Mark-in/Mark-out” feature. Vialogues also has the option to reply directly to comments made during the video.

Student teachers were invited to use the website during their first teaching practicum in their third year, and afterwards they were involved in a focus group discussing their views of several issues, including the gains in constructing understanding about teaching, technical hitches with suggestions for video shooting and uploading and the difficulties and suggestions regarding the sharing among community members.
   
They were then invited to use the site again in their second teaching practicum during their fourth year. After the second teaching practicum student teachers wrote down their reflections on the experience and also expressed how they would make meaningful use out of these videos and what they could do to attract more student teachers to the online community.

<b>Results:</b> The authors of this paper found that the discussions on each video posted were very interactive. There were replies to some of the comments made, that were mostly focused on what exactly was happening in the classroom, informing other members what has been done to modify the teaching practice, and expressing appreciation for helpful comments. With the feedback that was given in each video, each student teacher was able to adopt good teaching practices and improve their teaching techniques in order to better serve their students.

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b> This paper shows us how student teachers can improve their teaching practices by getting feedback from their fellow student teachers on a platform that is very similar to our own Vialogues. I believe that we reach out to professors and students in the Education field and show them how to use Vialogues to improve on their teaching techniques. Students teachers here in Teachers College (or any college for that matter) can record themselves teaching a classroom full of students and have other student teachers from Teachers College or from any other college comment on the videos once they are uploaded to Vialogues. This can be a good way to promote Vialogues and add good content to the site, while also  improving the teaching practices of future teachers.
