<p>Staring at a blank canvas can be overwhelming at any age. Researchers explored using a remix-oriented approach to maintaining student engagement in a participatory learning project. To jump start students’ creativity, researchers experimented with remixing existing digital stories to allow students a place to start their creations.</p>
 
<p>Remix is a creative process where individuals take various cultural artifacts and then combine or manipulate them in new ways. While remix originates from editing music, it has expanded to include many different forms of media. In an effort to understand the impact of a remix approach to creative learning, this study examined the effects of this approach on the motivations, creative self-efficacy, and flow perceptions of 45 third grade students in northern Taiwan. Flow is defined as a state of deep engagement with a learning activity.</p>
 
<p>Students participated in a two-year digital storytelling program aimed at developing their English abilities. They read an example story and then used an online platform to create a multimedia story. In the experimental group, students didn’t start from scratch, but instead created their stories by remixing the example story. A teaching assistant supported all students to use English words in their stories. Once students had completed their stories, they uploaded them to an online database to share with others in their class.</p>
 
<p>Data from the last nine weeks of the two-year storytelling program showed that students in the experimental remixing condition had better learning experiences. Students in the remixing condition became increasingly engaged in creating their stories and demonstrated more intrinsic motivation as measured by a questionnaire after completing the activity. Finally, students who experienced the experimental conditions applied various approaches to remixing the model story and asked for more assistance from the English teaching assistant. The remix-oriented approach helped these students maintain engagement and allowed them to tap into their creative self-efficacy. This research could be used to inform future instructional designs to consider providing students with sample projects or artifacts to modify and could change teachers’ understandings of how original work is produced.</p>
