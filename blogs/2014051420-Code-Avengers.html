<p><a href="http://www.codeavengers.com/"> Code Avengers</a> is an innovative web-based coding program designed to give learners a comprehensive knowledge of coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interactive tutorials feature multiple course levels, from beginner to advanced, as well as code challenges, points, and badges that turn the learning process into an addictive experience. Students can choose to build their own website, program apps, or make games with minimal reading and helpful hints along the way. The program also offers an educator component that enables teachers to use Code Avengers in the classroom. Teachers can register individual students or entire classes and monitor each learner’s progress on a comprehensive event console.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Code Avengers offers two distinct programs for instruction: web development and computer programming. In the web development section, learners are introduced to basic HTML5 and CSS3 in Level 1, and by Level 3 they are creating interactive websites and web apps. There are over 100 projects and tasks in each level and the whole course takes about 6-10 hours to complete. In computer programming, newcomers learn variables, if statements, and loops, eventually progressing to functions and graphics, and finally ending with animation, objects, and classes. This course has over 200 tasks and projects and takes approximately 8-15 hours to complete. Each course offers a trial period (25 free tasks for website design, 50 for app building) and the site features an intuitive dictionary of coding terms for easy reference.</p>

<p>Additionally, this web platform features an educators-only component for those looking to use the program in the classroom. Teachers can manage student accounts and overall progress on a simple, smart interface. The educator component offers two subscription options, based on individual or classroom use and is relatively inexpensive.
</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Coding can be an intimidating skill to learn, even when it’s introduced in its most basic form. Learners who are unfamiliar with coding might become discouraged by the somewhat complex interface of Code Avengers. Although there are helpful hints along the way, the task instructions aren’t always easy to follow and the "check code" process seems slightly cumbersome. There is definitely a learning curve with the program itself, which could also dissuade timid users from moving deeper into the courses.</p>

<p>For independent learners, the number hours required to complete each course may seem lengthy, and without a structured classroom setting, perseverance could be a problem.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Code Avengers is an exceptionally relevant and valuable learning program. The platform encourages learners of all ages to develop a mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a fun and worthwhile way.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Code Avengers – "the way to a $100,000 salary."</p>
