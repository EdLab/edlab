The infographic above was featured as a sidebar in a recent <a href="http://educationnext.org/the-public-weighs-in-on-school-reform/">Educationnext.org article</a> on the public's opinion of school reform and shows that support for online education is up compared to 2009, but slightly down, perhaps correlated to political turmoil, since 2010.  In addition to online education, the article listed results from recent polls that that examined merit-based pay, support for unions, the importance of credentials for teachers and issues surrounding charter schools.  

<b>Speaking of online learning...</b>
Go Idaho!  Idaho State School Superintendent, Tom Luna's, <a href="http://www.sde.idaho.gov/site/studentscomefirst/">Students Come First reform legislation</a>, along with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/education/06online.html?pagewanted=all">other initiatives throughout the country</a> are an exciting step in the right direction.  Student's Come First requires that beginning in 2016, all high school students must complete at least two online classes to graduate.  In the higher-ed sector, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6362">Stanford's record-breaking online AI course</a>, may also help to push the reality of  online education into the forefront of policy-maker's minds. 

To quote from Luna's <a href="http://www.sde.idaho.gov/site/studentscomefirst/docs/3%20Pillars%20Handout.pdf">Three Pillars of a Customer Driven Education</a>, a component of the reform effort mentioned above & reminiscent of the EdLab's fourth foundational focus, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/?q=node/492">Re-imagining Schooling</a>: 

<i>The 21st Century Classroom is not limited by walls, bell schedules, school calendars or geography. Every Idaho student will have access to a highly effective teacher, the necessary technology, and high academic standards that are comparable with any other country worldwide.</i>

<b>In Conclusion...</b>
We are slowly but surely moving in the right direction to support 21st century learning online and outside of the traditional school structure, both architecturally and metaphorically.  Despite debates touched-on in the  Educationnext.org article listed above regarding unions, credentials & merit-based pay, if we can utilize online courses to help teachers to do more with less, then we could potentially eliminate many of the stresses, both financial & temporal facing educators and administrators.   Will the education sector finally catch-up with other industries and fields who have for the most part, figured-out that "online" options are an added bonus and not simply an outsourced outlier?
