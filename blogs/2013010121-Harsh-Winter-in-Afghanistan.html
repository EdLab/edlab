          <p>
            The United Nations has reported <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/world/asia/cold-afghan-camps-receive-some-aid-but-shortages-loom.html?_r=0">an emergency in Afghanistan</a> as the winter weather has proven to be difficult for many of its citizens. The United Nations Commission for Refugees is in charge of distribution of clothes and supplies to help families in need at refugee camps. They've been deaths associated with the harsh winter conditions, including a three year old. Last year over 100,000 children died in the winter due to lack of supplies and poor housing conditions. Although supplies are being distributed, leaders in Kabul are complaining that it is not enough to provide for the countless of families in need. 

The commission has provided families with warm blankets, cooking utensils, soaps and charcoal once a month until February. There are 50 camps in Kabul with an estimated 35,000 people living in them. Moreover, with the men not being able to work as laborers due to the conditions, there are other challenges such as hunger. Although the Afghans are very grateful with the support from outsiders, they feel it is not enough to push through the harsh winter conditions killing hundreds each day. Many are blaming their government for their troubles because they've had to flee out of their homes due to the constant threat of violence associated with the Taliban.
