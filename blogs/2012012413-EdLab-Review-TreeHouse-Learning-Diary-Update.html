Back in November, I wrote an <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6853">article</a> about TreeHouse and how I was planning on using it to learn the foundations of HTML5 and CSS3. They just released their <a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=6cd557f316f6c6b5deccf9bc0&id=b4a453aeb9&e=1353359cd7">$9 student plan</a> today, where students can sign up for the Gold Plan for a highly subsidized price. Also, they just recently developed <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7094">Code Racer</a> (which Kate recently profiled last week), a game that teaches people how to code by pitting them up against other people  also learning how to code. 

<b>Pros:</b>
With the Gold Plan, the extra things you receive are video tutorials on cutting-edge web topics like jQuery, UX, Rails, PHP, iPhone Apps, CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, NoSQL, etc. which seem to be valuable and helpful. For someone who has little experience but big interest, it acts as a good starting platform. Another unique aspect of TreeHouse is in their special sauce: “We've done partnerships with Facebook, WordPress and LivingSocial,” Mr. Carson said. “They're going to start recruiting people who've unlocked our badges for internships and jobs.” (<a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/coding-start-ups-compete-for-booming-market/">NYTimes</a>)

<b>Cons:</b>
For the product, there aren't many negatives to say. Of course, there are glitches here and there on the website, but overall, the learning experience is smooth and learner-oriented. Their one flaw is the expensive $49 monthly price tag for the full-service Gold Plan, although their new $9 student plan should definitely help with their reputation. However, with philanthropic <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> as their main competitor, who doesn't even have a revenue model, TreeHouse will really have to outshine others with the quality of their product. 

<b>EdLab Takeaway:</b>
As a quick learning diary update, I completed the initial HTML badge and am now working on the CSS badge. Most of the content was review for me, so I was able to carefully evaluate the quality of the information and video instruction pedagogy. As an educator, I was impressed that they explicitly used a clear framework of scaffolding and was surprised to find that checks for understanding were possible even with pre-recorded online instruction. I want to investigate further to see if there is a way to quantitatively measure the quality of online/mobile instruction out there right now, possibly a universal rubric of some sorts? Food for thought.
