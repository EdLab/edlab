<p>With more courses using online learning management systems, whether through fully online or blended learning models, there is a growing need to optimize course design for these types of models. Although learning management systems provide the opportunity to extract a great deal of data, the way researchers derive meaning from the data is nebulous. A researcher from Greece investigated students enrolled in a university course on introductory Java programming that utilized lectures and laboratory sessions offered through Moodle, a popular learning management system.</p>
 
<p>The Moodle platform provides students with the opportunity to post in discussion threads, view and download resources, take quizzes, and engage in other functions meant to mirror an in-person classroom. Other researchers have noted, however, that there are certain challenges on systems like Moodle that do not typically become issues in face-to-face learning environments. For example, learning management systems often rely on asynchronous communication and typically lack means of conveying emotional cues, which can cause delays in feedback and has been shown to lead to procrastination as well as lower motivation levels.</p>
 
<p>This study sought to identify variables that were correlated with student success to resolve these issues. The researcher started with 29 online activities, 14 of which were found to have a strong impact on final student grade. Of those 14, four were found to predict the majority of the variance found in student grades: reading and posting messages, content creation contribution, quiz efforts, and number of files viewed. The author posits that the high correlation for reading and posting messages suggests the importance of peer and instructor interactions online, while the correlation for optional quiz usage shows the effects of self-directed learning.</p>
 
<p>It was also noted that although the four variables were strongly linked with students’ grades, variables such as total time online and number of online sessions were not significantly correlated with grades. The researcher noted that this was indicative of the complexity of understanding student engagement in online learning environments. He further recommended that future research should not be conducted using self-reported questionnaires, which can introduce biases. Instead, studies should analyze the content of written messages sent through the learning management system and note students’ learning dispositions to identify those who are at risk for failing in online learning.</p>
