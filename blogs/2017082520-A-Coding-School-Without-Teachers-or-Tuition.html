<p>The Holberton School in San Francisco doesn’t have teachers and it doesn’t charge tuition. Named after <a href="http://ethw.org/Betty_Holberton">Betty Holberton</a>, one of the first ever computer programmers, Holberton School offers an alternative higher education model that trains students to become software engineers in two years entirely through project-based and peer learning. Students begin their time at Holberton on campus for nine months, building skills together in a collective environment. After this, they transition into an internship for six months and later spend their remaining time continuing to build skills and connections with industry leaders.</p>

<p>Students at Holberton learn <i>how to learn</i> just as much as they learn programming skills. While programming and coding languages make up the foundation of the school’s curriculum, students are also encouraged to learn soft skills, such as running an industry meet-up or interviewing industry leaders. </p>

<p>Holberton ensures its students have all the skills they need to become employable because its very existence depends on graduates landing jobs. While students don’t pay tuition to attend Holberton, they agree to give the school 17% of their annual income for the first three years of employment after graduating, provided that they make more than $40,000. Because Holberton is so new, it’s uncertain whether this school model is sustainable. But as of now, graduates have been making a splash in Silicon Valley, some working at big name companies such as Apple and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>How do you think this educational model will adequately prepare students to get jobs in the tech field after graduating? Do you think this system is economically sustainable? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/39253/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:00 RuthS:</b> This tuition model certainly works against mainstream neoliberal models of education that proliferate the country today. The school survives because the students succeed. They have an actual, tangible reason to want their students to land good jobs.</p>

<p><b>@02:06 ThomasAnderson:</b> This sort of reminds me of <a href="http://www.uopeople.edu/">University of the People</a>.</p>
