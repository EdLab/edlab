            I will be attending a UNESCO discussion, <i>Moving from Access to Learning in the Post 2015 Dialogue: Why Indicators Matter & How We Can Use Them Well</i>, at the United Nations (UN) tomorrow afternoon. The Post 2015 reference in the title is a reference to the UN Millennium Development Goals, a series of targets agreed upon by most UN member states in 2000 and sought to achieve a set of eight primary goals by 2015. One of the eight goals is achieving universal primary education. With less than two years left to go before the deadline for the goals, the hope of achieving universal primary education is fading fast. Earlier today, UNESCO released a <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002211/221129E.pdf">paper</a> that noted more than 57 million children around the globe do not have access to or are denied a right to primary education. The paper focuses mainly on who are not “getting their foot in the door” and why there is a decrease in funding for global primary education, especially in those parts of the world where there is a greater need, namely sub-Sahara African and South & West Asia.

The paper fails to note the reasons why so many children are still not enrolled in or are dropping out of primary schools. First, most poor families in developing countries weigh every decision in economic terms (might be true for those in more developed nations as well), including a child's education, since children there tend to work from an early age to support their families. To the family, the basic question simply becomes, does the cost of enrolling a child in school outweigh the benefits of not doing so? The answer is usually a resounding no. Even if parents want to enroll their child, there are several factors that might prevent poor families from doing so. Unlike most Western nations, there is some sort of school fees associated with primary education. Though some developing countries now have free primary education, many still have tuition and the quality of the schools deter many families, already skeptical, from enrolling their child. Couple that with school supplies, transportation and other costs associated with school, and there is little chance families can afford to send their child to school. Even if they have the means and desire, there might be a dearth of quality primary schools in their locale. 

It would be interesting to hear the discussion on this very issue tomorrow.  How can we assess learning, especially in K-12, when there is still a lack of access?
