            The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/education/08educ.html?pagewanted=all">big education news</a> this month is the NCLB waiver plan that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan recently announced.  A key provision of the No Child Left Behind act was that 100 percent of students become proficient in math and reading by 2014.  Although everybody knew that this wouldn't happen, reworking the law was obviously a lower priority than certain other issues Congress has faced in the past few years, and they never got around to it.  So a couple of weeks ago, Arne Duncan announced that he would unilaterally waive the proficiency requirement for deserving states.  
<!--break-->
The criteria for receiving a waiver are similar to those used in the Obama Administration's "Race to the Top" initiative, and involve states demonstrating that they “were adopting higher standards under which high school students were 'college- and career-ready' at graduation, were working to improve teacher effectiveness and evaluation systems based on student test scores and other measures, were overhauling the lowest-performing schools, and were adopting locally designed school accountability systems to replace No Child's pass-fail system.”

On C-SPAN this week, Duncan clarified that states will not need to join the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a> in order to qualify.  <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2011/08/duncan_states_dont_need_to_joi.html">The consensus</a> seems to be that this is a political move, to allay conservative fears about a national curriculum.  As of yet its unclear how stringent Duncan's standards will be, and some decry the whole exercise as defeating the entire purpose of NCLB.

I personally am struck by the similarity between this and the debt-ceiling crisis.  In both cases we set for ourselves an impossible standard, figuring we'd work it out “at some point.”  Unfortunately, because educational standards have a lower priority than the fiscal solvency of the nation, there doesn't seem to be enough incentive for our polarized congress to actually work it out.  But I suppose they'll get around to it eventually.
