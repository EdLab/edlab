            This one is for the ladies.

Last week I mentioned the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2383">“morale boost”</a> that female scientists, both professional and aspiring, needed in order to strengthen their numbers in the field.  <a href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v19n2/pdf/mccarthy.pdf">The Journal of Technology Education</a> also covered this topic in its latest edition. The researchers found that level of support, personal situations, and sense of self were the largest contributing factors to whether or not women entered into the science field. They suggested strategies women scientists can use to move beyond the “cultural barriers.” 
      -	Educate families on the different learning needs and learning styles of females and provide resources that represent the different genders.
      -	Help elementary school teachers become more accustomed to teaching science, math, and technology in the classroom and help their students become more comfortable with the subjects
      -	Expose children to tech ed and engineering principles early on so they can see real applications for math and science.  
      -	Encourage more males to enter into early childhood ed so that they may act as role models and help to balance the field.  

The number of women earning bachelor's degrees in psychology and biology has increased over the past 40 years but the number of women earning post-bachelor's science degrees is decreasing. Women are interested in science, there is no question there.  The answer that researchers are desperately trying to retrieve, however, is why there is such a great deficit in the number of females in the fields of math and physics. Is it a history of believing women are inadequate and inferior? Child care issues? Lack of role models?  As researchers continue to search for the answers, the author of the article, <a href="http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2009/02/03/News/Women.In.Science-3609233.shtml">"Women in Science"</a> offers women  one piece of advice: Just stick with it.
