<p><i>"SoundCloud’s community of sound creators spans a huge range of artists, producers, and organizations. From independent artists to Grammy-winning bands … from <a href="https://soundcloud.com/whitehouse">the White House</a> to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theeconomist">The Economist</a>, comedians like John Oliver and Andy Zaltzman of <a href="http://thebuglepodcast.com/">The Bugle</a>, politicians like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and storytellers such as <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a>. Plus, everyday creators of music and audio, sharing everything from passing thoughts to life-changing moments. With its continued ambition to unmute the web, SoundCloud allows everyone to discover original music & audio, connect with each other, and share the sounds they hear."</i> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/press/releases/2012/12/04/next-soundcloud-for-everyone">SoundCloud, Now for Everyone</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Sound System</b></p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a>, founded in Sweden and based in Germany, is a different kind of audio streaming platform: it’s less about streaming music and more about creating all kinds of audio. While most streaming services only allow users to listen to music or podcasts, SoundCloud focuses on musicians, storytellers, and even teachers who want to share their own content with others. Users of the site can upload recorded content from their browsers, while the mobile app enables recording on the go. Each sound (e.g., podcast, lecture, song, or even a recording of the world around you) has the option for commenting, which makes SoundCloud a way to start a conversation, or give and receive feedback in a learning environment. </p>

<p><b>Let’s Talk About It</b></p>

<p>One of the exceptional features of SoundCloud—and the one that makes it most suited for learning—is the community forum structure. The messaging and commenting features might have been designed with artists and their fans in mind, but it also opens the door for creating more collaborative work in general. Teachers and students alike can easily highlight a particular part of an audio track by clicking directly onto the image of the sound wave to comment or ask questions. This feature lends itself most obviously to music or speech classes, where a teacher could respond to very specific parts of an audio track, but the educational applications are much broader. SoundCloud’s capacity for targeted feedback is well-suited for any kind of asynchronous, interactive learning experience, but it’s the ability to record and share on the go that offers the most exciting possibilities. By allowing anyone to document and build unique learning experiences, it turns the whole world of sound into a classroom. </p>
