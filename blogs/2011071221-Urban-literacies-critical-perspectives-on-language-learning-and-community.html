<strong>Title: </strong>Urban literacies : critical perspectives on language, learning, and community

<strong>Author: </strong>Valerie Kinloch (Ed

<strong>Publisher: </strong>Teachers College Press<strong>
</strong>

<strong>Call number:</strong> <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/a+Kinloch/akinloch/1%2C3%2C7%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=akinloch+valerie+1974&amp;4%2C%2C4">LC5131 .U696 2011</a>

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

''This volume presents us with guidance rooted in rigorous research,  guidance for teachers and teacher education to be empowered to learn  from and build upon the linguistic and creative energy bounding on  street corners, in community bookstores, out of digital devices, and  through Internet airwaves...We are inspired by the scholars in this  historic volume who are paving new groundwork for empowering literacies  in schools and communities.''

In this collection of research on issues in urban education, new and  emerging scholars of color in the field have authored theoretically rich  and practically sound chapters that extend current conversations on the  literate lives, academic achievements, and social networking systems of  students of color in urban environments during and after school time.  The primary focus of this book is to closely and carefully  investigate--through rigorous research, various theoretical  orientations, and diverse methodologies--meanings of and current  concerns with urban education in the lives of children, youth, and  adults of color across three intersecting spectrums.

<strong>About the author:</strong>

Dr. Valerie Kinloch is Associate Professor in Literacy Studies  (Adolescent Literacy &amp; English Education) in the College of  Education and Human Ecology at The Ohio State University. She holds  affiliate appointments in the Department of English and the Department  of Women's Studies at OSU. She earned her B.A. in Honors English at  Johnson C. Smith University, her M.A. in English and African American  Literature at Wayne State University, and her Ph.D. in English with  emphasis in Composition and Rhetoric at Wayne State University. Prior to  joining the faculty at OSU, Dr. Kinloch was on faculty at Teachers  College, Columbia University in New York City. There, she worked with  masters and doctoral level students at Teachers College and with  students and teachers in local high schools. She was a visiting senior  English instructor at a high school in Harlem. Prior to this, she worked  as a Writing Resident in an urban middle school through the  Writers-In-The-Schools program in Houston, Texas.

Her research interests include the social and literary lives,  literacy learning, and collaborative engagements of youth and adults in  and out-of-school spaces, particularly in urban contexts. She is the  author of several journal articles, including "Revisiting the Promise of  Students' Right to Their Own Language: Pedagogical Strategies" (in <em>College Composition and Communication Journal</em>), "'The white-ificaton of the hood': Power, politics, and youth performing narratives of community" (in <em>Language Arts Journal</em>), "'To not be a traitor of Black English': Youth perceptions of language rights in an urban context," in <em>Teachers College Record</em>),  and, among other articles, "Suspicious spatial distinctions: Literacy  research with students across school and community contexts" (in <em>Written Communication</em>). Her co-authored book, <em>Still Seeking an Attitude: Critical Reflections on the Work of June Jordan</em>, was released in 2004, and her single- authored biography on poet-educator June Jordan titled, <em>June Jordan: Her Life and Letters</em>,  was published in 2006. Dr. Kinloch was awarded a Spencer Foundation  Small Research Grant as well as a Grant-in-Aid from the National Council  of Teachers of English (NCTE) to support her work on the writing,  literacy, and activist practices of African American and Latino/a high  school and first generation college students in urban settings. In  particular, this work examines how community gentrification and a  politics of place can heavily impact the lives, literacy practices, and  survival strategies of urban youth of color.
