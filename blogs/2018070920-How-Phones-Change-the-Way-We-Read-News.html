<p>People read the news much more frequently on their phones than on their desktops. In fact, as of 2015, <a href="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/06/30143308/state-of-the-news-media-report-2016-final.pdf">99 out of 110 major news sites</a> had more readers via mobile devices than computers. Even though the content across news sites is the same regardless of device, some researchers are concerned that phones and tablets are changing the way we consume news information, and not in a good way. </p>
 
<p>A recent study looked at how people read news differently on mobile devices than on computers. In particular, the researchers focused on how long people spent reading each article and how much attention they paid to any embedded links. The study included two parts. The first involved tracking participants’ eye movements as they read articles on different devices. This kind of tracking monitors how much attention readers pay to each article and to what particular sections. The second part involved analyzing data collected on website traffic across different devices.</p>
 
<p>In both parts of the study, researchers found the same results: people spend way less time reading articles when using their phones than they do when using their computers. They are also less likely to notice embedded links in articles when reading on their phones. This means that even though people read articles more often on their phones, they spend less time reading them and pay less attention to what they read.<p>
 
<p>There are several possible reasons for this. For one, the phone’s smaller screen size could make it more difficult or less enjoyable for people to read articles. For another, people usually use their phones when they’re on the go, and it’s probably harder to pay attention to a news story in that context.<p>
 
<p>Regardless of the reason, these researchers were alarmed by their findings because, as more people read news exclusively on their phones, they will likely become less able to pay attention to what they read, and news can only serve its purpose in a democracy when people actually process it. Perhaps future studies can try to find specific design features that foster greater news-reading attention spans on phones in order to reverse this alarming trend.</p>
