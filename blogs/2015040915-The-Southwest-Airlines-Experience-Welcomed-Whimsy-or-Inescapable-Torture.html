            For over 40 years, Southwest Airlines has been showing its customers a whole lotta LUV. The name, an homage to their homebase and HQ at Dallas Love Field Airport, has been the inspiration for countless marketing promotions, from their <a href="http://blog.royercorp.com/the-airline-industry-and-the-swizzle-stick-cocktails-at-30000-feet" target="_blank">signature swizzle sticks</a> to <a href="http://www.swafreedomshop.com/charm-bracelet.html" target="_blank">surprisingly cute jewelry.</a> LUV has helped create a unique culture. Granted, every single company in the history of companies has said they put customers first, but Southwest seems to go out of its way to be different.

<font size="1"><i>Viewfinders for everyone!</i></font>
<br>


And that's where Lifehouse comes in. 

Southwest's quirky "Live at 35" concert series &mdash; an impromptu musical session from lesser-known and headline acts alike &mdash; has surprised many an unsuspecting passenger. Sportswriter Jonah Keri <a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1787178/innocent-southwest-air-passengers-subjected-to-flash-lifehouse-concert/news/">recently entertained a delighted Twitter audience</a> by chronicling his increasing desperation at "America's version of Nickelback."

Passengers don't know they're on a Live at 35 flight until it's happening. Pop-up ambushes seem to be a tactic Southwest employs often to keep things spicy. Take the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/11/03/wedding-at-32000-feet-first-for-southwest-airlines/18401481/">surprise wedding</a> it hosted last year. Or the <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/03/southwest-wedding-shower/">surprise wedding shower</a> it threw just a few days ago.</a> 

The last example is particularly emblematic of Southwest's ethos. Demonstrating how influential excellent customer service can be on one's experience and perception of a brand, the co-recipient of the shower noted, "They kind of have a special place in my heart." Bam! 

Another example of a Southwest employee going out of her way to make customers' flights more enjoyable is flight attendant Marty Cobb. Known for her dry humor and perfect delivery, she's quickly becoming the quintessential reason to fly Southwest. I mean, when have you <i>ever</i> seen this many people pay attention to the in-flight safety demonstration?

There's a lot we can learn from all that luvin' Southwest shows its customers. Just the sheer quantity of campaigns and stunts Southwest executes each year goes to show the amount of attention it's putting on crafting an experience. 

All this talk of LUV has got me feelin' sentimental. <b>If we were to throw an EdLab user appreciation campaign, what could we do? </b>
