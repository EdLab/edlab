<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15332748.2011.648558">Medley, K. (2012). Keep it down over there! milblogs: Evidence that historic things happen. <i>Journal of Archival Organization, 9</i>(3-4), 141-173.</a> 

Soldier accounts in the form of letters, diaries, and mementos have long been targeted for archival preservation. These collections are well-used and offer a unique perspective to our understanding of historical conflict. Soldier record methods in the Iraq/Afghanistan war have developed somewhat faster than preservation and archivists must move quickly to make record of these primarily born-digital accounts. 

These resources present several unique challenges to archivists. The real-time methods of military blogs and other digital records make anonymity and ambiguity more important than it is in slow-travel and no-travel communication. The close watch and multiple warnings issued by the US Army to Specialist Colby Buzzell over his blog, <a href="http://cbftw.blogspot.com/"><i>My War</i></a> are cited as examples of the unique restrictions on military blogs over both sensitive information and representations of the military. Limited soldier access to the Internet means that some date information or detail can be lost when entries are finally posted. Linking and networking are unique benefits to digital materials, but these quickly degrade and are difficult to preserve even several months from creation. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
In thinking about web preservation, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Sites devoted to this purpose, like the <a href="http://archive.org/index.php">Internet Archive</a>, seem to have no method in place for vetting information and are instead attempting to amass a record of the internet in its entirety. As we think about the development of Pocket Knowledge, this strategy may be best for the uncertain future of digital items. 

It's clear that preservation and research of these materials will be different, as we continue to become comfortable with and develop strategies for massive information. Work with web crawlers like the Library of Congress' <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/lcwa/html/lcwa-home.html">MINERVA</a> have been successful and may represent an aspect of digital preservation, but saving everything won't be enough. Archives should continue to create partnerships with companies (like the LOC with <a href="http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-081.html">Twitter</a>) and solicit private donations of high interest born-digital material.
