            *Private*

Good morning from glorious Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I'm attending the <a href="http://www.copydesk.org/aces2015/"target="blank">American Copy Editors Society conference</a>. This will be a great opportunity to gather and share best practices for editing and digital publishing for NLT, TCR, and NSSE. Here are my takeaways from today's sessions (feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUmtY5QgOVLINZkxGP_MvOk76lrGaprR-8XkoH-tONo/edit?usp=sharing"target="blank">browse my notes</a>). 

<b>Editing in a Digital Environment: Best Practices for Workflow and Quality Control</b>
<p>Rachel Stuckey (<a href="https://twitter.com/NomadicEditor"target=”blank”>@NomadicEditory</a>) and Adrienne Montgomerie (<a href="https://twitter.com/sciEditor"target=”blank”>@sciEditor</a>) discussed how the adoption of digital editing tools has caused the production process to evolve from a linear model to one that is modular, circular, and has more simultaneous moving parts.</p>

<a href="http://imgur.com/HmQgHXz"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HmQgHXz.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<p>A more adaptable process better facilitates collaboration and makes it easier to repurpose content, but it's not without its challenges. To address these, Rachel and Adrienne recommended several helpful best practices, including: communicating what can and can't vary in your process; ensuring your editors are using markup tools properly; and setting limits on when it's time to stop tinkering with a piece. </p>

<p>In terms of improving our own workflow, I wonder if it might be worth using Google Docs to draft NLT pieces. This might make it easier to: access the most up-to-date templates formatted with accurate, color-coded HTML; deliver feedback and review edits in the comments section; avoid the terrible auto-formatting features of MS Word; and sync with our production docs that are already on Google Spreadsheets.</p>

<p><b>Using Checklists to Foolproof Your Editing</b></p>
<p>This <i>very thorough</i> session with Samantha Enslen (<a href="https://twitter.com/dragonsammie"target="blank">@dragonsammie</a>) brought me great comfort as someone who constantly creates, uses, and frequently abandons checklists. There are just <i>so</i> many things to do (in work, in life) that it's so easy to feel overwhelmed and frustrated–especially in publishing where there are too many tasks to expect a normal human to remember. </p>

<p>While organizing your work into a list, it's important to: limit it to the most important items; use simple, precise language; test in real-life settings, and automate if possible. </p>

<p>I'm probably going to steal and adapt a very helpful production/editing checklist from this presentation for TCR/NSSE editing. </p>

<p><b>Social Media Fact-checking</b></p>

<p>We don't do a lot of promoting reader content on social media, but if that were ever to change, this session by Lauren Klinger (<a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenKlinger"target=”blank">@LaurenKlinger</a>) of Poynter provided an excellent primer on how to think about the source and content we engage with. 

<p>Always be skeptical and ask questions about social media content that could perpetuate negative rumors or erode trust within your community. For example, this is a beautiful photo of an eclipse from the ISS that went viral in 2012.</p>

<a href="http://imgur.com/W3KRJyL"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/W3KRJyL.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<p>The problem is <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/05/22/a-fake-and-a-real-view-of-the-solar-eclipse-from-space/#.VRTltIF4rB4"target=”blank”>it's fake</a>. Unless you asked questions before re-posting (Where did this come from? Is it too good to be true? Does it look altered? Who else has this story? What is the value to my audience?) you wouldn't think to do any checking into its origins.</p>

<p>There are so many verification methods–from basic searches to finding the Exif specifications–that there's no good excuse for repurposing bad content.</p>

<p><b>Stress Reduction for Editors</b></p>

<p>Even though much of what we do is factual (researching, cataloging, coding, editing, collecting data), we shouldn't feel ashamed when we have emotional reactions to our work–it's stressful and we're only human. It is our responsibility to deal with that stress the best we can and take care of ourselves. Anya Weber (<a href="https://twitter.com/anyaweber"target=”blank”>@anyaweber</a>) shared some tips and reminders for editors but applicable to anyone:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Anticipate events/times when you're likely to be stressed and stay well-rested, hydrated, and fed before them. Eat a banana.</li>
<li>Manage realistic expectations with your coworkers, supervisors, and customers about when you'll be available.</li>
<li>Think carefully about your capacity to take on more work; prioritize, don't be afraid to say <i>no</i>.</li>
<li>Schedule enough time off and commit to not doing work during that time. If you won't be checking email, make sure you inform everyone and have a reliable backup.</li>
<li>Take a few minutes to practice meditation, breathing, or mindfulness.</li>
<li>Move around, go for a walk (especially after lunch), stand up, stretch, or join running club.</li>
<li>Run the inside of your wrists under cold water; apparently this has a calming effect during desperately stressful situations.</li>
<li>Accept your stress, because sometimes that's all you can do; try to channel the energy into something positive.</li>
</ol>
