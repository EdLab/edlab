<p>Students in the Communication, Media, and Learning Technologies Design program at Teachers College experienced a new kind of library tutorial, diving deep into the details of research methods and materials available at the Gottesman Libraries. The research workshop took place in the <a href="https://lt.tc.columbia.edu">Smith Learning Theater</a> for 90 students as part of an introductory course on communication, computing, and technology taught by Professor Yoo Kyun Chang. Professor Chang worked with members of the library service team, including Allen Foresta and Kim Kefgen, to design, organize, and implement the hands-on event.</p>

<p>Senior Librarian Allen Foresta meets with classes throughout the year to teach them the basics of library research methods, but this was the first time such an event took place in the Learning Theater rather than in a classroom. Because of this, the experience was completely different from a typical lecture-like session. Instead, it incorporated movement, problem solving, real-time research, and presentations. Teams of students each focused on a different topic or problem, then used the library’s resources to devise a research-heavy solution within the time limit. Foresta, along with other library colleagues, provided helpful guidance when questions arose and judged the students’ research findings at the end of the evening.</p>

<p>Foresta said that having this research workshop take place in the Learning Theater made the experience both memorable and fun. The flexible space and careful event organization made the instruction immersive and constructivist, and Foresta thinks students will carry these research methods with them throughout their academic careers.</p>
