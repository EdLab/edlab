            Consider this: the reason you're sitting and reading these words right now is because an advanced human affectionally known as a computer geek — but a biologically advanced one, mind you, sporting contacts, not glasses — has pressed a button on a machine and told you to. Allow yourself to entertain the idea that someone out there actually created this world — complete with wars, sicknesses, love, chocolate chip ice cream — from a simulation on his supercomputer. What you ate today, the movie you saw last night, your last paycheck — all just computer circuitry and electrical impulses designed and controlled by an omniscient master sitting on a computer.

Now think of the unforgettable movie the Matrix (if you aren't playing it back in your head already). Think back to Morpheus's words to Neo… Or simply read them here: “what is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.” 

Continue to follow that train of thoughts to the last dream you can fully remember. How vivid it was, how real! You might remember what you touched, what you felt, what you thought, what you did, what you tasted or smelled… All of these emotions and actions didn't need your body to be executed. You were simply lying there. Or maybe the impulses that created those emotions and events in your dream were so strong that they induced motor outputs — that is to say, so strong that you fell out of bed. Would it then be so farfetched a thought that we might all just be information in a machine? That we have no bodies but are simply floating brains stimulated by electrical signals so strong that we feel like we actually <i>feel</i>? Run? Take the train to work? Live? A strange idea, yes, but what evidence is there to discard it as invalid?

This idea that reality's supposed reality may be unreal has been entertained in many a mind for many a year. This specific simulation route however was introduced by <a href= http://www.nickbostrom.com/cv.html> Nick Bostrom</a>, a philosopher at Oxford University and director of the Future of Humanity Institute. “Dr. Bostrom assumes that technological advances could produce a computer with more processing power than all the brains in the world,” states a <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/science/14tier.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5090&en=22bfff4070a81187&ex=1344744000>  New York Times article</a> on Dr. Bostrom's theory, “and that advanced humans, or ‘posthumans,' could run ‘ancestor simulations' of their evolutionary history by creating virtual worlds inhabited by virtual people with fully developed virtual nervous systems.” The article goes on to say that, thinking along the lines of life being a Sims game, we shouldn't think that nothing is real, and that whatever we do has no meaning. David J. Chalmers, a philosopher at the Australian National University, expounds on this.

In a paper titled <a href=http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html> The Matrix of Metaphysics</a>, Chalmers explains, among many other things, that what we do matters because it is real to us. He introduces his argument with the idea that we may all be brains in jars receiving inputs from a supercomputer and creating outputs that are then fed back to the machine and thus to our virtual selves. As such, we ‘live.' He calls this virtual world a ‘<i>matrix</i>,' similar to the one in The Matrix, except that we cannot physically exit this <i>matrix</i> since we have no bodies, only brains. He uses his Matrix Hypothesis, and Morpheus's words stated earlier, to further argue that if we identify reality as the electrical signals that feed our senses, then our life must be real from our perspective. What we feel and do and taste and smell affect us regardless of who created those feelings in us.

Frankly I find this to be a meager and failing attempt to give our life meaning. Fate, Religion, Science, they've all been or continue to be candidates in this campaign to explain why we are here, and where we will end up. Some choose to believe that we just are, nothing more and nothing less. Others, like me, believe that there is something or someone out there that transcends coincidences, chance, or capricious fate. And still others put their belief in man and choose to believe that computer geeks rule the world. Unfortunately, man's only judge is man. If we are baffled by the relatively simple question of ‘what women want,' the meaning of life and humanity <i>might</i> just escape our cognitive grasp.
