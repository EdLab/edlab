            George, Zoraida and I went to Grace Dodge Hall to watch the HBO movie Walkout as presented by the Office of Diversity and Community Affairs. This was my first time doing a live blog so I didn't know what was installed or how many people were going to be there.

<b>1:00</b>: George: About eight people were in attendance (including us), which I found very surprising. Figured it would be more people, especially since there is a discussion phase after the movie. Anyways the organizers are here. Refreshments include tortilla chips, pretzels and popcorn.

<b>1:10</b>- Malves: Isabel Martinez, one of the organizers and  a “Chicana” herself, briefly introduced herself and informed the audience she would be leading the post movie discussion. All set to go as the movie is popped into the DVD and the curtains are closed.

<b>1:11</b>-Start of the movie. Walkout is the true story Chicano students in East Los Angeles, who in 1968 staged several dramatic walkouts in their high schools to protest academic prejudice and poor school conditions. Aided by a popular and progressive young teacher, Sal Castro, Paula Crisostomo and a group of young Chicano activists battle parents, teachers, bureaucrats, the police and public opinion to make their point. 

<b>1:13</b>: Zoraida: Opening scene of the movie-Sal informed an entirely Mexican class that their history in nonexistent in American history books. Why did the director chose to start the movie like this? 

George: The fight scene between the two students in the yard reminded me of similar scenes in the 1995 high school movie Dangerous Minds. 

<b>1:20</b>: George: a truly powerful scene as two students are called to the front of the class for speaking Spanish. As a punishment, the teacher spanked them with a paddle. This scene reminded me of my educational experience back in Ghana. At the private school I attended, there were signs all around the school saying “English Only,” meaning students were prohibited from speaking their native language. The punishment was usually a spanking by a teacher or administrator with a cane. 

Zoraida: The sign in the school said “If you can't say it in English, then it not worth saying.” 

<b>1:26</b>: Malves: The students attend a camp  where Sal informs them one out of four Chicanos don't graduate high school and only 2% attend college. Sal tells the students that unless they go to college, someone else is going to write their history. Sal is really concerned about the history of Chicanos as this is the second time he has mentioned it thus far in the movie. 

<b>1:35</b>: Malves: Sal took the students to a nearby college and as Paula was on her way to the restroom, she found a library where she is astonished to see books in different languages: French, Hebrew and Spanish. She says, “It's not right the way people treat our kind of people.” At Sal's urging, she wrote an article about the conditions in her heavily populated Latino school using the constitutional argument of “we are created equal.” 

<b>1:42</b>- Zoraida: the Mexican students, led by Paula, met at a restaurant to discuss possible plans for bringing attention to their cause. Some of the students suggested each student write an article, another suggested using violence (with the Black Panthers as his inspiration) to stage an armed rebellion while others suggested nonviolent methods. An unknown photogtapher is taking pictures of Paula as she entered the restaurant. 

George: this scene reminded me of another HBO movie, Boycott-the story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama that has been heralded as the start of the civil rights movement. In that movie, Dr. King, Ralph Abernathy, Bayard Rustin and others met in similar circumstances to discuss plans on how to continue the boycott. Like the students in Walkout, the leaders of the bus Boycott eventually chose passive resistance despite the ever present threat of police force. 

<b>1:46</b>: Zoraida: during lunch time, Paula stood up and asked the students if they were tired of the injustices. Most of the students angrily screamed yes and rushed to fill out a survey put together by Paula.

Malves: I hope the students' enthusiasm in filling out the survey translate to them participating in the walkout.

<b>1:55</b>: George: the students finally receives the attention of the school board. Edward James Olmos (who directed the movie) plays one of the board directors. The students are informed by the board that they need more time to discuss their wishes, much to the ire of the students as they have patiently waited long hours for their grievances to be heard. In the wake of their anger, the students cited the methods used by the leaders of the aforementioned Montgomery Bus Boycott as a similar platform they could follow. They decided on a walkout in which they would attend school and then walk out of class at a certain time, thus causing the school to lose money: “No students, no pockets.”  A resounding consensus was followed by chants of “walkout walkout walkout.”  

<b>2:09</b>: Zoraida: The students wanted to have the walkout right away but Mr. Castro told them they need more time to better prepare for the walkout such as informing reporters. 


<b>2:16</b>: <b>WAAAAALLLLLKKKKKOOOOOUUUUTTTTT!!!!!</b>

<b>2:19</b>:Malves: outside of their respective schools, the students chanted “Chicano Power.” A truly powerful scene that embodies the spirit and effort the students have placed into the walkout. They have risked family bonds, jobs and even the threat of expulsion from high school on the brink of graduation to fight for a cause they clearly believe in. 

<b>2:22</b>:Zoraida: the students met at the restaurant to plan the next phase of the walkout: some schools will stay while others walkout. The cops listened in on the conversation (we later find out that one of the student planners is an undercover cop who relayed information back to the police department) and planned to stop the schools planning to walkout. As the students walked out of their classes, the cops stood guard over chained doors. The students broke the chains on the doors and escapeed into the streets. Violent scenes as cops stormed the targeted schools and used force to coerce students back into class. Students are beaten with clubs, kicked and punched while journalists take pictures and videos. Later that night, the students and Sal gathered to discuss the future of the walkout. Much to their amazement, the footage of cops hitting the students didn't make the evening news. 

<b>2:35</b>:George: The students reconvened at the restaurant to plan another walkout. They decided in order to avoid another police intervention, they would invite the entire community to walkout in solidarity. So they walkout for a third straight day and as they neared the streets, the community marched towards them. Paula's mother, who didn't approve of her daughter's initially, led the marching community members. 

<b>2:50</b>: Malves: Following the arrests of Sal and other student leaders on prom night, the remaining students decided on one last action: they applied for admission to UCLA. The film ended with the students and the community marching towards the police station where Sal and the students leaders are been held. Following a brief exchange between Paula and the undercover cop who pretended to be a student leader, Sal emerges out of the background from a group of uniformed cops as chants of “Chicano Power” erupted. 

<b>3:00</b>: Malves: Post movie discussion-One of the audience members talked about the lack of people in attendance and George informed the audience that we were there to live blog the event and hopefully that may stimulate others to join in their next viewing. Shockingly, two of the eight people in attendance are students from NYU. 

Zoraida: another audience member stated that many people, including teachers, didn't show up because the movie doesn't apply to them. She felt it did apply to them because most teachers have students who are facing problems similar to those faced by the students in the film. 

<b>3:10</b>: Malves: AJ, another audience member, stated that the worldwide web prohibits people from engaging in demonstrations and picketing because people lack a passion for such things these days. Since everything can be done online, people are less inclined to meet and discuss plans for action like the students in the film.

<b>3:15</b>: George: end of what was a brief group discussion. It appeared the lack of people at the viewing led to what I think could have been a great discussion. The movie touched on so many issues still afflicting our school: ethnicity, class, and infrastructure, among others. Overall, awesome movie. 

Malves: Very inspirational movie and showed the power that young people have and the difference they can make with that power.

Zoraida: Movie showed that young people's voices can be heard despite their relative inexperience and obstacles they might face along the way.
