          <p>
            Over the past 3 months, several of us at Development & Research have been working on Critter, a tool to support conversations around web videos. We have <a href=" http://jay.tc.columbia.edu/critter/view/htdocs/main.php">completed a prototype that we would love to get your feedback on</a>. There is a "login" link on the top right which you can click and create a new account. Also, there is a "Help" tab which you can use to find out more about Critter and how to use it. We've also <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2767">posted info about Critter on the blog previously </a> if you would like some background.


Even with this release, we're already thinking about additional features we would like to add and some of the pedagogical applications we see for Critter. However, we want your feedback and advice as we decide on the next steps. Just start using Critter - upload some video you want to discuss and start a conversation with colleagues or friends. After you've had a chance to try out Critter for a while, please let us know what you think about the tool. Any constructive criticism is welcome, but if you are stumped about what to say, here are some things we are wondering about:

1) How is the user experience with Critter? Are the help documents 'helpful'? Is it easy to figure out what to do with Critter and are there any issues with the tool that make it difficult to use?

2) What features or changes do you think are needed to take Critter to the "next level"?

3) How do you envision using a tool like Critter? Do you think you would actually use it? If not, what is preventing you? Are there any uses you see for learning and teaching?

Also, if you encounter any bugs or problems using this prototype version, please let us know as well. To fix problems, it is really helpful if you describe how you recreated the problem (including what user you were logged in as, where you were in the site, and which videos/groups/discussions you were dealing with). You can also just post those below for now and we will add them to our ticketing system manually.


Finally, Zhou, Arianna, Frederick and I are planning a seminar later this summer to get feedback in a more structured manner. Over the next few weeks, we'll be asking Edlabers to test drive Critter in a more controlled manner and trying to collect some data that we can use to improve the tool. We'll be posting more about this effort in the coming days. However, we would really appreciate your initial and undirected reactions to the tool even before this process gets started. You can post comments to the blog below or email us personally with advice.
