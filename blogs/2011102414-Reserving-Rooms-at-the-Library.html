            <em> In an effort  to bring more information to the  community about library services we  are going to answer frequently asked  questions right here on Pressible!  Of course you are still welcome at  all times to stop by the desk and  ask your questions.</em>

A question that we receive often is how to reserve group rooms at the library. You can reserve rooms from the <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/">library homepage</a>. Once you are on the homepage you can find the link to reserve rooms under "Library Resources" on the left hand side. Under "Library Resources" click on "Reserve Group Rooms &amp; Classrooms." After you click on "Reserve Group Rooms &amp; Classrooms" you will be prompted to log in using your UNI and password. Only people with UNI's are able to reserve rooms. Once you sign in, provide the date, time, and duration of your meeting, as well as the number of people in your group and any equipment needs you have. Be aware that the booking system defaults the date to tomorrow, but you can change that by clicking the arrow next to the date.

If there are any available rooms, the system will automatically assign a free room to you that meets all of your needs. You will then receive a confirmation email in your Columbia email.

Students are able to book rooms two weeks in advance and students can use these rooms for up to 3 hours. Faculty can book rooms up to four weeks in advance for a maximum of 8 hours. If you would like to book a room farther in advance (or have another special need) you can fill out the special event application.

I hope this is helpful! If you have any other questions about reserving rooms check out the <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/frame.php?dest=%2Fkb">Gottesman Libraries Knowledge Base </a>or stop by the desk!
