<a href="http://www.flowerschoolny.com">FlowerSchool New York </a> founder Eileen Johnson always loved to entertain. After retiring from her work as director of outreach for Children’s Scholarship Fund, she was looking for a new skill to learn and share. There was an oversaturation of cooking institutions so she took a flight to Paris and learned the art of floral design instead.</p>

<p>What started in 2003 as a series of master classes featuring the best floral artist in the business, evolved into a year-round curriculum of foundation courses, one-off workshops, a perfume school, and a six week professional program. And while <a href="http://www.flowerschoolny.com/schedule/class-schedule-and-registration.html
">master classes </a> at the school continue to explore artistic movements, seasons, and color schemes, the DOE accredited <a href="http://www.flowerschoolny.com/schedule/professional-program/">professional program </a> prepares students for jobs in floristry and even opening their own shop or studio one day.</p>

<p>In fact, FlowerSchool New York claims responsibility for over 100 floral businesses around the globe by giving students tools and techniques they need to flourish. Students hail from every corner of the world and begin their educational journey by mastering flower conditioning, using the tools, and design principles before moving onto more complex arrangements and simulated environments including the event and flower shop series. The event series takes place over three days and challenges students to design, purchase floral product for, and execute a full event with a budget. The four-part flower shop series introduces students to what it would be like to work at and eventually own a flower shop; working with clients and constraints to fill orders quickly and creatively. </p>

<p>The program concludes by placing students in vetted flower shops and studios around NYC for two-week internships where they apply what they’ve learned and gain real world experience.</p>
