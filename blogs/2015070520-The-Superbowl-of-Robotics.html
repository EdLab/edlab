Students from schools throughout the nation compete in regional contests to get the chance to participate in the annual robotics championship in St. Louis, Missouri. Teams are allotted a short time span and are given limited materials to create an impressive and practical robot. Teams work tirelessly to bring their visions to life (cue debate about robots being life), but only one team can reign supreme. Or can they? <p>

Dean Kamen, the founder of FIRST (For Inspiration of Recognition of Science and Technology), the program responsible for this competition of competitions in the field of robotics, claims that each team is a winner, regardless of whether or not they bring home the trophy. As corny as such a statement may appear at first glance, Kamen is really on to something. These students are all actively engaged with technology in a way that sitting in a classroom could never accomplish. This competition has made science and technology fun by treating it like a competitive sport. </p>

<p>The venue where the competition takes place looks more like a sports arena than a science championship venue. Energies run high, and not just through the electrically-powered robots. Teams are cheered on by each other and by the enthusiastic crowd of spectators. The tone of the event ignites the creativity and ingenuity of the robotics teams, and powers them through the competition. The students collaborate, focus, and achieve, and they are all admired for their dedication and hard work. This championship opens many doors for teams within the engineering world, and places them on the road toward careers in science and technology. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:22 AbdulMalik:</b> This is a great way of dealing with the decline of students' interest in math and science. By just building a robot a student might end up majoring in engineering which is fascinating. </p>

<p><b>@01:12 mpowers:</b> Interesting analogy, "science fair as sporting event" ... when the field of professional sport is one that offers more limited job prospects and higher/early levels of commitment & dedication. (There's plenty more demand for professional biologists than professional football players, of course, but both are less "in-demand" than business, financial, and management roles.) </p>

<p><b>@03:27 idrissa10:</b> The students leave the competition with valuable traits. Learning to work together in a team builds tolerance, patients, and professionalism! </p>
