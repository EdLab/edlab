<b>Title:</b> Does Instructional Approach Matter? How Elaboration Plays a Crucial Role in Multimedia Learning (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Tessa H. S. Eysink & Ton de Jong
</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.611776">Does Instructional Approach Matter? How Elaboration Plays a Crucial Role in Multimedia Learning</a> is the follow up to <a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ883292&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ883292">a study</a> the authors conducted in 2009 measuring the effectiveness of four different instructional approaches. Both studies compared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia">hypermedia learning</a>, observational learning, self-explanation learning, and inquiry learning. The earlier study revealed that self-explanation-based and inquiry learning environments had significantly higher learning outcomes than more passive learning methods like hypermedia and observational learning. They speculated that the students learned better because they had to generate parts of the subject matter themselves. 
</p>

<p> 
In this follow up study, the authors compared the same four learning styles and focused their research on the learning processes rather than the effectiveness of the approaches. Their aim was to investigate which components of the learning strategies were behind the changes in effectiveness. The study was performed on 40 Dutch high school students in a math course, and unlike the earlier study, the students had some knowledge of the material before the study began. To study the process, the students were asked to "think aloud" while learning. These learning transcripts were coded for statements expressing a distinct learner activity and the statements were categorized as superficial, elaborative, or regulative processes. Superficial processes included reading, watching, filtering, and checking solution steps. Elaborative processes were described as developing & testing hypotheses, relating, integrating, and creating explanations. Regulative processes included orienting, planning, monitoring, and reflecting.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results confirmed that self-explanation-based learning and inquiry learning led to greater engagement in learning processes. The authors also found that these styles of learning resulted in more elaborative activities. These activities, which include developing hypotheses and creating self explanations for new concepts, were identified as the core of effective learning.
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> An interesting feature of this study was that all methods of learning were tested in a computer-based learning environment. Even users tested with hypermedia learning, with the internet at their fingertips for browsing, were ineffective learners if they were not inspired to engage in elaborative processes. This may be an important note for modern educators: educational technology is not enough. Learning technologies should be evaluated for specific elaborative learning behaviors. Through these two studies, the presence of these activities has been shown as a good indicator of learning effectiveness.
