          <p>
            Recently the topic of home-schooling has been on my mind, and so I decided to blog about it. In a few decades, home-schoolers may become quite a sizeable chunk of our population. 

There are countless reasons for home-schooling, and some are directly related to religion, while others are more subjective. I have found that many given motivations for keeping a child's learning at home are for very personal and emotional reasons. 

This <a href="http://progress-index.com/news/number-of-home-school-students-increasing-1.1491656">article</a>, published a few weeks ago, reports that the number of home-schoolers have increased by more than fifty percent over the past decade in Virginia!

I respectfully disagree with how Christina Caffi and Susannah Foster (from the article) present their social advantages of homeschooling.

"...the greatest teacher can't possibly care for the development of a child as much as a parent does," Foster says. I say that the greatest teachers love their students, and--as memories of my most special teachers come to mind--that it is ungracious to say otherwise. Later in the article, with Foster's words still in mind, I was surprised to read Caffi say she had concerns "for the <i>erosion</i> of the moral values that [she] had tried to instill in [her daughter]." I am glad that Caffi had at least given public schooling a try, but from what she says, you would think that her daughter's public school is a cesspit of evil!

On the other hand, the article mentions Amy Wilson and Parrish Mort, who encourage their children to choose whether they want to be home-schooled or not on a yearly basis. This was also hard to pass over without inspection. I imagine that many of the students that genuinely <i>need</i> to learn to socialize may tend to favor learning at home. In my personal experience, it has often been what has made me uncomfortable that has ultimately helped me the most; (in other words, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger).

I'm not averse to homeschooling. I just wanted to disagree with a few of the points that were brought up by the people in the article. Homeschooling pros and cons are, again, subjective and depend on excellent family circumstances. The benefits to home-schooling are a little bit easier to back with facts and I agree with quite a number of them; in fact, I can even see myself promoting home-schooling. But if I were to promote it, it wouldn't be because public schools "erode moral values!"

My very first day at EdLab has ended, and now with it, my very first blog post... I am so happy to be an intern, everyone. This summer is going to be a pleasure.
