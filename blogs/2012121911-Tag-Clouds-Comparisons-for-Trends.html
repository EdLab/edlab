          <p>
            I was curious how and what we have been publishing in New Learning Times (NLT) in past few months, in terms of <i>topic trends</i>. So my first thought was to put all the content into a tag cloud. The words that pop most frequently probably would be the main topics. That's about right. I also wanted to figure out the trends between the first two months and last two months. I generated two tag clouds. It was <b>impossible to do comparisons</b> as there seems to be a lot similarities in the choices of words, though there were some subtle differences. In the figure below, I used research digest content as example.

So, I was thinking, how do I see the changes so I can better adjust the kind of articles I should frequently read and report more on. I want to  a) see the changes b) do the comparisons c) navigate the key topics for each comparing time frame. See the figure below. The colors may not be as pretty as the one above, but it actually tells more stories. I know we talked about <b>education in general</b> in the beginning and we talk more about <b>learning</b> now. Also, we've reported a lot of similar topics from the past two months until now, which shows consistency and that's good.

Now it's very easy to do and only take three steps: 

1) Get content from database  or copy it from NLT site

2) Strip the HTML tags 

3) Plug the text to R scripts mainly, to count each corpus term frequencies and find out the overlap terms. and scale them into x-axis. (Scripts are sharable upon request. Still need to tweak spacing and a lot of small things, stop words, etc.)
