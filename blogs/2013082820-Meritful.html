<p><a href="http://www.meritful.com/">Meritful</a> connects companies to top college graduates. Students can set up their own profiles with their basic information and add projects, activities or any other learning achievements to show proof of their skills. Completed profiles are likelier to attract attention from companies and result in job opportunities. Users can also tap into their peer community to receive feedback on their projects. The platform features student challenges to let users show off their skills with an online certificate of completion. Professional ambassadors from different companies have their own profiles on the platform to connect with students and build relationships online with the goal of recruiting better entry level candidates.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This type of social platform gives higher education students the chance to show off their achievements for professionals in the field and potential employers. The platform places an emphasis on showcasing student uploads for employers. As they face a challenging job market, it is increasingly important for students to learn to present and promote their accomplishments. Because the platformâ€™s central focus is connecting students and professionals, it may offer a better way to facilitate these connections than more generic professional social networks.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The platform could use even more specific paths to engage students and professionals. One possibility would be to encourage professionals to post job listings and engage in discussions with students around these listings. This could give students and professionals something to discuss and would be a chance for students to gain experience posting job-specific showcases.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Meritful gives college students and real world professionals a space to connect directly with one another. The fact that all users are working towards the same goal sets it apart from other professional platforms like Linkedin. In more generic social networks it is easy for students to get lost in the shuffle, especially if they are unable to find the right professional connection. Meritful creates a space so potential employers can find recently graduated students more efficiently. The platform has a lot of potential and including more services might increase the number of students hired through the system. </p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Meritful gives students access to professionals and the possibility of landing a job.</p>
