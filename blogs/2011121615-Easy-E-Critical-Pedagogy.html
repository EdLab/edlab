            Easy-E (Easy-Education) is a content stream idea I floated a few weeks ago, although with a new name courtesy of Kate.  The idea is to make esoteric concepts from the educational world digestible for a general audience.  Here is my first attempt.  Feedback is appreciated!

What is critical pedagogy? The “critical,” like in the critical theory I briefly studied in college, tells us that it's about post-Marxist left-wing politics, and the “pedagogy” tells us that it's about education.  “Critical Pedagogy,” writes Peter McLaren, “asks how and why knowledge gets constructed the way it does, and how and why some constructions of reality are legitimated and celebrated by the dominant culture while others are clearly not… In other words, what are the social functions of knowledge… Whose interests does this knowledge serves?”

In other words, critical pedagogy begins in that relativism so often decried by conservative critics.  The theory views knowledge production and instruction not as methods for helping people understand how the world really is, but rather as sites of cultural conflict, just one more area where political and social power contests play out.  Furthermore, critical pedagogy accepts as given that, by and large, the dominant high-status groups (here in America, that would be rich white men, I suppose) have been winning these contests in the arena of education, as in other arenas.  Therefore, pedagogy as it's traditionally practiced is by and large a collection of methods used by the aforementioned high-status groups to cement and reproduce their dominance.  Our educational system devalues the behaviors typical of low-status groups, so that members of those groups are alienated from the system as well as being forced to remain in their low-status positions.

One of the tactics used by the elite (which falls under the category “hegemony”) involves concealing the political nature of their educational system, so that the very idea that knowledge and knowledge instruction are politically neutral becomes a tool of domination, a way to suppress dissent. Critical Pedagogy, as a politically committed theory of knowledge, seeks to reverse this trend, first by unmasking the political domination inscribed in the educational system, and then by creating a new system that will empower the low-status groups (women, minorities, the lower class) suffering under the current regime.

More concretely my impression is that the major educational reforms favored by Critical Pedagogy are those that make students more politically aware, and more supportive of leftist politics.  This could mean, for instance, teaching a class about racism, or encouraging students to become politically active in their local communities.
