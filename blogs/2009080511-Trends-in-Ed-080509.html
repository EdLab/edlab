            <b>How Do <i>You</i> Reflect on Your Undergraduate Experience?</b>

Looking back, what part of your undergraduate college education do you value most now?
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40008957@N04/3792359438/" title="30poll-t_CA1.650 by koschcal, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2520/3792359438_89b8c87f5e.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="30poll-t_CA1.650" /></a>

A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/magazine/30poll-t.html?pagewanted=1">poll (2007)</a> conducted by the NYTimes and MTV U assessed graduates' impressions of several facets of the undergraduate experience (study write-up is attached).  Drawing opinions on issues from how they felt when choosing a college all the way to how they think a degree will break them into a career, this study appeals to my own reflections, as a recent graduate, on the past 4 years.  

What qualities were very or somewhat important when you were deciding which undergraduate college to attend?

If you could relive your college years, what would you do differently?

In truth, I have always been fascinated by the American college/university system and its contrast to those of any other country's system.  Though not every high school graduate attends an institute of higher education, nor does everyone consider themselves to have had a "college experience", what I find intriguing is the American college lifestyle (think: breaks during the day, late late nights, making your own schedule) that is so distinct from that during any other point in one's life.  Undergrad in America is a prominent subculture.  Maybe this is just nostalgia talking....
