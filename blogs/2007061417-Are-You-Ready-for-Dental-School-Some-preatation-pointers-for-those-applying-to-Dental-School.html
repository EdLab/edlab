            	The journey to becoming a dentist might not be everyone's goal in life, or even their ideal career, but it sure is a competitive field these days in the world of health professions. Preparing for dental school can seem confusing and frustrating, but with early preparation and organization, the task of applying to dental school and the journey to becoming a dentist can be less painful. With some research and these helpful tips, the preparations leading up to dental school should be a breeze. Let's face it - medical school and dental school is tough enough as it is, why put yourself through the torture?
<P>

The First step is to research the 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dental_schools_in_the_United_States>dental schools</a> that you want to apply to. Make sure your schools are separated in order from dream school to fall backs, with reachable goals inbetween. You should also <a href=http://www.aibs.org/careers/>consider your options</a> just in case dental school is out of your reach or you are not accepted into a program. 
<P>

Make sure to weigh out your options and research what your next step will be if you do not get in. Even though dental school will be the ultimate and idealistic goal, remember you're better safe then sorry. 
<P>

The Second Step is to start creating a portfolio. This portfolio should include a biography of yourself, an updated copy of your undergraduate transcript, your reasons for pursuing dental school, a recommendation form ( if your school requires one ), a "thank you" letter, and an outline of what a professor should include in your recommendation. These portfolios are used as guidelines for professors who will write about your overall performance. Your biography should include the basics as well as life experiences you would like others to know, what have you been through? What have you accomplished? Your transcript will give the professor or the person writing your recommendation a good sense of what kind of student you are/were. You should include your reasons for wanting to enter dental school so that they can incorporate the type of personality and characteristics you possess to make you a great applicant. Some schools require a recommendation form for professors to fill out, if this is the case make sure that you have this included in your folder. And last but not least, you should thank the person writing you the recommendation for taking their time in order to help you, and also give suggestions in the form of questions to make a guide for them in what subjects to address when writing this recommendation. 
<P>

Remember that all these recommendations are great but most of them must come from professors of major math and science courses. Also add in extracurricular activities and recommendations from internships/supervisors, etc. to portray to the committee that you are a well rounded person. 
These recommendations will be handed to a board within your undergraduate school, which will write your overall assessment and evaluation/recommendation that will be sent to the dental schools you apply to. They will take into consideration what each professor and mentor writes about your personality, studies, and sense of overall character. These folders will not only keep you organized but remind you of how many recommendations you have completed throughout your four years in college.
<P>

While you are working on recommendations, make sure that you become familiar with the atmosphere of dental professions. Make sure that you intern/work/volunteer at a dental office or clinic. Observe, learn, and absorb as much as you can. It would be a good idea to build close relations within these atmospheres, both with professors and mentors.
<P>

Make sure to complete all prerequisite courses, and I strongly advise taking them in order. Not only is it more organized and professional, it ensures learning will be easier to follow and complete. Although it is not required, any additional classes such as Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Anatomy, etc. are strongly encouraged so that you may get a better grasp of scientific material. This may help you study for the DAT's; which is an exam that is taken before applying for dental schools. Just as the SAT's are standardized tests, the DAT's should be a test of the things you have already learned in your prerequisite courses. In order to prepare for this exam, know your study habits and apply it accordingly. Whether you study better alone, with a group of people, or want to enroll in a test prep program, guarantee your success on the DAT's because it is one of the standards for your admittance into your dream school.
<P>

After having prepared yourself, take the DAT's at least one year before you plan to enroll as a dental student; apply to take the <a href=http://www.ada.org> DAT's online</a>. If you are unhappy with your score retake the exam. A 90 day period is suggested, that way you have enough time to study so that your scores can substantially improve. Remember that the admissions committee will consider the best set of scores, and will not combine the scores of any two tests.
<P>

Your journey is almost at its end. When applying for dental school, some schools might require an essay which you must include in your application. Start writing a rough draft of your essay and make sure that you proof read it (many times) and make any corrections before sending it out. Remember to speak about what differentiates you from other applicants, any talents or hobbies, and the experiences you have had in that field. When you have completed your essay and it is the image you would like to portray to dental schools, make sure that you mail it in with your application and portfolio. When applying, make sure you apply to at least four to ten dental schools from your list, and check due dates so you don't miss your deadlines!
<P>

HOLD ON! You are not finished yet. The Dental Schools that are interested in your acceptance will contact you in efforts to get to know you better. Dress and act in a professional manner, and remember to be yourself. You shouldn't ever go into an interview unprepared; make sure you know something about the school that is interviewing you. After all, the more interest you show in their school, the easier and more comfortable the interview will be. 
<P>

Now that you have amazed your interviewer, you should await for your answers to your applied schools. At this point your preparations and journey have come to an end and all you can do is hope, wait and wish for the best.
<P>
Good Luck!
