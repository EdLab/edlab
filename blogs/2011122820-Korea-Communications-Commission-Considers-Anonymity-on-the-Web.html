          <p>
            We at EdLab have considered transparency versus anonymity on the web quite a few times. (I thought somebody else had written the previous post, but it turns out that it was actually <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6278">me</a>! Haha) I imagine (with only anecdotal evidence) that most of the younger staff like myself support anonymity over transparency; I can't imagine services like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> ever picking up if every user had to identify themselves using their legal name and, to top it off, a PIN such as Social Security Number.

Until now, that has been exactly the case in Korea. Every since I can remember, Korean web sites required your legal and full name along with a 13 digit PIN (just like the SSN) in order for you to sign up. Understandably, this caused quite a few problems, including foreigners having difficulties signing up for any Korean web services, privacy issues, and identity thefts. Even Amnesty International at one point expressed concerns over the ability to remain anonymous on the web in South Korea.

However, the Korean Communications Commission is now considering phasing out of the requirement of providing your legal name and PIN in any internet encounters. This is, from most points of view, a positive change.

However, I am worried about an initial outpouring of slanders and false rumors on the web once this change is put into effect. Korea has a dark history of celebrities committing suicide due to harsh and cruel slander on the web; the law that requires you to identify yourself, in part, was put into effect due to these unfortunate events. It is my hopes that the "keyboard warriors," as negative commenters are called in Korea, have learned from their wrongdoings in the past and that we as a culture are now mature enough to desist from such deplorable actions of spreading false rumors about others.
