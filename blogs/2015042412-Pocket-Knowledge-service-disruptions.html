          <p>
            Hello,
<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Pocket Knowledge</a> had seen some significant service disruptions this past week and we had tried hard to keep it to a minimal. The service is back up now and we are keeping our eyes out for any signs of problems creeping back.

We are sorry about the inconvenience and most of all of not doing a better job communicating when the service was down. We hold ourselves as an engineering team to pretty high standards and we dropped the ball on this occasion.

Lessons learnt:
1. Communicate - This is super important and we didn't do a good job of it. When we know a service is faltering, even before we begin to investigate it we should put up something that tells the world we are on top of it. This lets people know that we stand by our product and offer excellent support.
2. Team work - As an engineering team we are only as good as the people who are using our software. Software at the end is about people and giving them tools to be awesome. PK might be a poor example of this (given that it looks a little dated) :), but it's used and provides value. This people-centric view towards software dog foods back in to our engineering process itself. The engineering team came together and everybody pitched in to help in which ever way they could. <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/7016" target="_blank">Ling Xiao</a> - helped with creating an Ubuntu AMI, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/560" target="_blank">Zhou</a> - helped with PHP/Apache configs, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/588" target="_blank">Pranav</a> - got on the phone with AWS and got our instances back etc.
3. Healthy skepticism - All of this started with one email from Amazon AWS (our cloud provider) which in effect told us, that one of our instances participated in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" target="_blank">Distributed Denial of Service attack</a>. We took what they said at face value and in hindsight should have been a little more skeptical. This unfortunately is unavoidable and is part of what it means to work with a Cloud provider, in this new age of writing software that runs everywhere all the time. We go through this learning process of figuring out what to be on top of and what to relax a little on and wait for more data before acting.

We take our engineering craft seriously and will be doing a better job going forward. Please reach out to us with your feedback.
