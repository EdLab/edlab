            At the recommendation of President-elect Barack Obama during the customary White House tour by the sitting President to the President-elect, President Bush recently invited Obama along with former presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter for lunch at the White House. The meeting marked the first time since 1981 that all living presidents had gathered for something other than funerals and commemorations. The meeting also afforded Obama the chance to receive <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/07/presidents.meeting/">“advice, good counsel and fellowship”</a> from the former presidents. With his historic inauguration less than two weeks away, the timing couldn't be more perfect for Obama to lunch with his predecessors as each dealt with many of the issues Obama's administration will face. I'm sure the escalating crisis in Gaza came up during the lunch. Clinton and Carter's administrations played a prominent role in the passage of two of the most influential treaties concerning Israel and its neighbors. During his administration, Carter was instrumental in the signing of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_david_accords">Camp David Accords in 1979</a>. The accords marked the first time a predominantly Arab country, Egypt, reached a peace agreement with Israel. One of the highlights of President Clinton's administration was the <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords">Oslo Accords of 1993</a>. The accords, agreed upon by Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, granted temporary self-rule for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Clinton's administration was heavily criticized in later years for lack of action towards genocide in Rwanda and Srebrenica, so Clinton could advice Obama on how to avoid the same mistakes when dealing with the genocide in Darfur. <p>

George H.W. Bush presided over the short and successful war in the Persian Gulf during the last years of his brief administration. Maybe he is the man Obama should ask about how to properly deal with the war in Iraq and the ever escalating war in Afghanistan. For all his campaign bashing of President Bush, Obama did commend the soon to be former president on his efforts to combat diseases in the Third World. His administration spent over $15 billion for relief for victims of AIDS and other diseases. The health of the economy is a problem every president must examine and each must have counseled Obama on how to examine a very ailing economy. One can only imagine what was else was on the menu during their lunch.
