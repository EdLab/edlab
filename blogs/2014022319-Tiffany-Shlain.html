<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I consider my education to be from so many more places than just school. My parents played a really important role in preparing me for my current work. They were both very curious and always asked a lot of questions. They loved words and reading and instilled that same curiosity and the same joy of learning in me. 
<p>
I have a BA from UC Berkeley, where I studied interdisciplinary studies. I have always looked for the connections between things. I loved UCBerkeley. There was such a diversity of ideas there. From the diversity of the student body to the brilliant professors.  CAL was this dedicated period of being a student, but really I see myself as a lifelong learner.  I’ve loved taking intense programs as an adult. I did a program about organizational change at Harvard Business School and I am a Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute where we were guided through the great thinkers and reread (closely) important texts. To read the same texts as a seasoned adult, with all the new layers of meaning and understanding, has been very profound for me.  And each time I make a new film, I am delving deeper into new subjects. So whether it was my recent film on brain development from birth to 5 years old or our new film on the social science and neuroscience of character development, I am a student with each film. I have made almost 20 films since college.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?

<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I did a lot of internships when I was in college but also when I was in high school. I interned at film studios and technology companies, in fact one of my earliest internships was with one of the first laptop companies. I think these internships led me to merge technology and filmmaking and do what I do today.
<p>
In my 20s I founded The Webby Awards and I ran it for nearly a decade of my life. That experience taught me a lot about collaboration, about establishing standards for excellence, and about the business world. A lot of artists depend solely on their creativity but, to be successful, filmmakers have to treat making films like running a business.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> The films my team and I make are meant to trigger important conversations for the 21st century. It’s exciting to create films that are being used by professors and teachers at schools and organizations around the world. Film is a really important tool to engage people on complicated topics.
<p>
And I think that education and learning have to continue to evolve. Right now my team and I are about to start working on a film called The 21st Century Brain, which is all about the most important qualities people need to flourish in the 21st Century. While of course math and science and reading are always important, I think it’s just as important to teach collaboration, adaptability, perseverance, iterating, improvising and learning quickly from failure.  My films are really about bringing these conversations into schools and homes to be part of the education landscape and to speak to the ecosystem of education.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?
<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Collaborative learning and the ability for students to access top teachers and professors from around the world through the web are two major trends that I think will impact learning in the years ahead. I also think increased use of video to elaborate on ideas will have a great impact on learning. Nothing will replace the learning that’s possible through personal student-teacher interaction but all of these collaborative tools can help enhance this relationship and provide new ways of learning.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The AOL Original series we premiered in October, <a href="http://on.aol.com/show/the-future-starts-here-517951318/episode/517965297"><i>The Future Starts Here,</i></a> is one of the network’s most popular recent releases. We are nearly at 12 million views just a couple of months since we launched and the number continues to grow everyday.  The series features eight short episodes that explore the impact of technology on our lives - the good, the bad and the potential.
<p>
Our next big film is The Science of Character, which explores new research on character development and our ability to shape who we are. It’s the fourth film from our <a href="http://www.letitripple.org/">Let it Ripple: Mobile Films for Global Change</a> series and we’re planning to premiere it during a live and several virtual events as part of Character Day on March 20. We’re inviting all leaders, educators, students, parents, students of life, to be part of the premiere.
<p>
The vision is to have schools, companies, organizations, and homes all screen the free film and then join online Q and As throughout the day through a Google Classroom where experts from both the field of character development and other fields will talk about character. All free and all online.
<p>
If you are interested in hosting a screening on March 20th, we will provide a free customized version of the film with your school or organization’s logo. More information is available <a href="http://letitripple.org/character/">here</a>.
