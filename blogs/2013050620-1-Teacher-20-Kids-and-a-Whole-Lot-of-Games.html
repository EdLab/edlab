Third grade teacher and investor Ananth Pai recognized that the 1 to 20 ratio of teacher to students wasn't working for his classroom. He wasn’t able to give individual students the attention they needed. In his words, "you cannot solve the problem with human capacity alone." So, he sought to find an effective solution and found his answer in educational technologies. <p>

Mr. Pai created a game-based curriculum using an assortment of games found online and for the Nintendo DS. It wasn’t long before his students could be found sprawled across the floor, ticking away at their mobile games or intensely battling students from other countries in a duel of fractions.  In order to balance out the 1:20 situation, Mr. Pai enlisted the help of dozens of digital tutors.  <p>

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the video, though, is how his young students reacted to the question, "Do students have a right to technology in their classrooms?" To see their response, and to get a look at the specific games they played, watch the video above. Don’t forget to <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8684">add your thoughts</a> to the ongoing discussion on Vialogues! <p> 

<b>00:44 annief27:</b> I wonder if all his pupils are more focused on the game rather than using the correct methods to derive at the answer <p>


<b>01:40 JordaJean: </b> I wonder how long students play each game? Do they do a circuit of games, or is it more interest-based?


<p>

<b>05:30 JordaJean:</b> It's really amazing to see students' families getting behind the teacher.
