          <p>
            For many schools, athletics play a significant role in helping shape their brand. The athletic success of certain schools makes them more popular than their academic success. Student athletes sometimes spend more time with their teams than in the classroom. This means student athletes have to work tirelessly after practice and games to finish assignments. This is all in light of this important <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/05/i-trusted-em-when-ncaa-schools-abandon-their-injured-athletes/275407/">article</a> that sheds highlights how schools are technically not required to provide health care for student athletes. The NCAA Division I manual barely has a full page that explains this policy to ensure that athletes obtain health care.

This means student athletes are left unattended when they encounter injuries at games or practices. This report comes as shocking news to most families because recruiters told them that their children would receive a quality education while receiving benefits for playing college sports as well. Should the NCAA be blamed for not paying close attention to healthcare issues pertaining to student athletes or should parents be blamed for not finding out about healthcare from school officials who recruit their children?
