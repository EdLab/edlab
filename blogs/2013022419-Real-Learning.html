<b>Title:</b> A Comparison of Lectured-Based and Challenge-Based Learning in a Workplace Setting: Course Designs, Patterns of Interactivity, and Learning Outcomes (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Timothy K. O’Mahony, Nancy J. Vye, John D. Bransford, Elizabeth A. Sanders, Reed Stevens, Richard D. Stephens, Michael C. Richey, Kuen Y. Lin, & Moe K. Soleiman 
<p>

<b>Study Design:</b> 
Engineers at Boeing training in composite materials were split into three groups.  Two groups were given a traditional lecture-based course, while the third was given a novel course that utilized a "challenge-based learning" (CBL) design, which involved having small-discussion groups solve a series of discrete subject-relevant challenges.  The collaborative process and post-course learning outcomes of the three groups were then analyzed and compared.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
The study found that engineers in the CBL group scored significantly higher in one content area on the post-course examinations compared to the other two groups.  Although this isn’t the across-the-board improvement one would hope for, an analysis of the interactions within the three groups indicates that CBL may also provide less tangible benefits.  As one would expect, in the traditional lecture courses the vast majority of the course-time was taken up with "Teacher Instructional Monolog."  In the CBL course, by contrast, students had the opportunity and incentive to engage in what the study labeled "engaged, attentive questioning."  This, along with more extensive interaction among students, indicates an opportunity for trainees to gain relevant knowledge that may not have been included in the original aim of the course.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward: </b>
A preliminary study of this kind offers little in the way of definitive answers, but its emphasis on collaboration and workplace learning offers a few ideas for the future of  education. Most notably, it primes us to think more seriously about the kinds of learning that may not be reflected in performance on a short test.  The study points out that the relationship-building taking place in the CBL group will most likely come in handy as the team goes on to confront real-world problems in the workplace.  Real life tasks and problems rarely draw solely upon the narrow slices of learning that students must demonstrate in the traditional classroom; it may be to their benefit (and to the benefit of our educational system) to focus more attention on the practical goals and social component of learning.
