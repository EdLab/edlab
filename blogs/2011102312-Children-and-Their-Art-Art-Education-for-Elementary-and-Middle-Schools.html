This Ninth Edition is targeted at middle level and elementary schools.  The authors are experienced as art teachers in the public schools and  have a broad knowledge about school art programs. The Ninth Edition  provides updated developments in theory, research and practices, with a  strong emphasis on how digital technology provides new ways of teaching  art.  The most comprehensive textbook available for teaching art education  methods, CHILDREN AND THEIR ART covers all aspects of teaching art in  the elementary and middle school classroom: the basic principles and  goals of art education, the characteristics and needs of children as  learners, the core principles of art as a subject--aesthetics,  principles of design, art history, new developments in art media and  technology. It also covers all aspects of instruction: curriculum  planning, sample lessons, suggested readings, and internet resources.  Among numerous updates throughout the text, the Ninth Edition features a  brand-new chapter on new media in art education with 22 new images. It  features the use of digital technology in elementary and middle school  classrooms and examples of digital art created by students. </dd> </dl></div>
