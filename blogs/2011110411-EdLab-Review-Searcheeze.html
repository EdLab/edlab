<b>Description:</b> <a href ="http://www.searcheeze.com/en/home"> Searcheeze</a> is a social bookmarking web tool that allow users to curate selected text, pictures, and videos from any website, and share them with their friends through Facebook or email. When users share your curated materials with friends, they can also add selected text, pictures, and videos that they find on the web, after registering with Searcheeze. Not only does this make it a good collaborative bookmarking tool, it also has a publishing feature that lets you post your curated materials on social networking sites like Facebook. The video below explains exactly how Searcheeze works:

Searcheeze is a brand new website that just came out of its private beta version, meaning that potential users no longer have to be on a waiting list to register for the site. Another nice feature is that users can register using their Facebook account, which is a growing trend for these types of websites. Before Searcheeze came about, the creators of the bookmarking webtool had a another website called Ibrii, which had similar features. After two years of feedback from Ibrii users, the website eventually evolved into Searcheeze.

<b>Pros:</b> The way you would add snippets of text, pictures and videos to Searcheeze is very simple and straight forward. You could be doing researching on a certain topic, when suddenly you come across something of interest on a website, and decide that you want to save a section of the text and all you need to do is click on the Searcheeze bookmark saved into your browser, highlight the text and drag it into the opened Searcheeze area. I like how you can collect information from different websites, and have the ability to view them all in one area. Of course the social and publishing feature is always a pro in my book.

<b>Cons:</b> When you open the Searcheeze bookmark, it tends to take up some space on the website your viewing, and thus might make it a bit harder to highlight the text you want to save. You can minimize the sidebar and drag your text there but it would be nice to view the entire website and the Seacheeze sidebar at the same time.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This web tool is a product of two years worth of feedback from users, which is why I believe that when promoting our websites, we should also encourage people to give us as much feedback as possible so our sites can also evolve.  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> Searcheeze can be useful when doing the weekly blogging like Research Digest or Trends in Ed, because when doing research for these blogs, I have a million windows opened to get bits of information on each site and with Searcheeze, I can now have all my research in one place. The screenshot below is an small example of what you can do with this application, I <a href ="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Frankensteined"> frankensteined</a> my <a href ="http://archivalrevival.pressible.org/demetri/pictures-of-the-teachers-college-yearbook-from-1926"> Archival Revival blog post</a> with a snippet from Wikipedia with information on the Roaring Twenties. One nice feature is that when you save multiple pictures, it puts them into a small gallery you can flip through.
