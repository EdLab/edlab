<p><b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b></p>

<p><b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?</p>

<p><b>Answer:</b> I’m a first generation college graduate. So I understand at my core what a difference education makes in the opportunities one has.  I grew up in a small town and eventually made it to Rice University and then to Harvard Law and a top-tier law firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore.  At each level, a whole new world of opportunity opened up.  When I decided to become an entrepreneur, it was largely a desire to enable more students from various socioeconomic backgrounds to succeed by democratizing access to learning and educational resources.  Today, as the President of Macmillan New Ventures (MNV), I am charged with discovering, developing, and marketing innovative educational technologies and new products that enable students to learn more, faster and cheaper.  I am focused on doing more for education, pushing the boundaries of where, when and how people learn.  So for my current work, my own educational trajectory truly provided me with the zeal to make a difference in the next generation’s education. </p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?</p>

<p><b>Answer:</b> Two experiences:  1) founding an early Internet company and 2) engaging in significant cost-cutting and pivoting to help that company survive the dotcom crash.  I founded Questia in 1998 as an early eBook company—the concept has come full circle recently but our idea was to provide consumers unlimited access to a large number of books online in a cloud-based environment for a monthly subscription fee.  The experience of being an entrepreneur informs how I work with our early-stage companies and their founders every day.  I think if I didn’t understand a company founder at this level due to having been an entrepreneur myself, it would be hard for MNV to do what we do.  Conversely, I spent a lot of time following 2001 in the nitty-gritty of right-sizing Questia and getting it to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization">EBITDA</a> positive state.  That informs the way I interact with Macmillan’s corporate leadership every day.  While we are very aggressive about investing in growth, we need to do it in a way that is cost-effective and ultimately pays off in a reasonable timeframe.  At the core, I sit in between our entrepreneurs and our senior corporate leadership.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</p> 

<p><b>Answer:</b> I hope that we are making learning more engaging, more personalized and more persistent.  By putting the learner at the core of product development and figuring out how to keep them engaged, how to accelerate the rate at which they learn, and to increase how long they retain this knowledge I hope that we reduce the time it takes for learners to achieve their learning objectives and thereby reduce the overall cost of education.  Macmillan New Ventures is part of <a href="http://se.macmillan.com/">Macmillan Science and Education</a> which has a history of over 170 years of helping curious minds achieve great things through various education solutions; however, MNV is focused on applying the latest technologies including algorithms, predictive analytics, game-based incentives, simulations, and personalization to advance the learning landscape.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</p>

<p><b>Answer:</b> Data analytics, improved communication and engagement efficacy, and personalized learning experiences are bound to shape the education ecosystem for years to come.  The ability for administrators and educators to pinpoint student learning capabilities, provide the right learning asset at the right time and engage the learner based on their unique needs will become table stakes moving forward.  Educators and partners that can achieve this will set the yardstick by which all are measured.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</p>

<p><b>Answer:</b> Macmillan New Ventures is focused on several important projects.   One such project is REEF: Education, set to launch December 2014, which is a mobile-first communication and engagement suite for higher education. It will help facilitate more efficient communication, collaboration and engagement between students, instructors, and administrators by supporting and strengthening their existing workflows via mobile devices.  We hope REEF: Education will leverage learning analytics, improve academic outcomes and ultimately help achieve institutional missions.  Education CIOs have expressed an overwhelming need for improved engagement and communication tools and we already have more than 25 institutions using REEF: Education prior to its official launch. </p>

<p>Another project is around STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Learning. Macmillan New Ventures has a number of solutions in the STEM space and we increasingly want these individual solutions to work together seamlessly and provide the instructors and institutions with comprehensive analytics and actionable recommendations for improving each individual students’ outcome.  At the same time, we want our individual solutions to work well with the myriad of other products coming into the marketplace.  We expressly do not think that any one party can or should have the complete solution for a course or campus and want to make sure the instructor and administrator have the ability to pick and choose which solutions in the marketplace will help them achieve their objective.  Traditionally, I think major players have tried to force their customers into a comprehensive suite.  It’s a lot harder to offer a seamless interaction in the event a customer wants to use multiple products on one hand, but also make it easy for them to pick and choose different products from various vendors if they feel that is optimal for them on the other hand.</p>
