<p><b>Title:</b> Using Technology for Enhancing Reflective Writing, Metacognition and Learning (2010)</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> Carolyn Mair</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://ejournals.ebsco.com/direct.asp?ArticleID=44549A8588E942F23F9A">Journal of Further and Higher Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can online resources help students engage in the process of reflection to develop reflection writing skills, metacognitive awareness, and ultimately enhance learning?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>  The authors developed an online tool called Meta-Reflection to "facilitate and structure the recording, storage and retrieval of reflection." 10 psychology undergraduate students (9 female, 1 male) participated in the 6-week study.  The students filled out a pre-study questionnaire and attended a focus group aimed at developing a common understanding of reflection. During the study, the students uploaded their responses to structured reflective questions on a daily basis. After the study was done, the students participated in post-study interviews. The student reflections were not assessed.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The researchers found "using a structured approach to online reflective practice is empowering and ultimately enhances undergraduate learning through the development of metacognition." The students found the reflection had a positive effect, "including improving memory, helping with problem areas, seeing progress, encouraging critical thinking, focusing on weak areas, assisting organization and time-management skills, and bringing stress relief." Overall, the researchers found that the study was successful in achieving the aim of having students learn the process of reflection in a structured context using an online tool. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Despite the obvious sample limitations, the researchers were able to conclude that intentionally teaching reflective practice removed ambiguity about the process of reflection and allowed students to develop metacognitive awareness for reflection and action. Despite this claim, it was not clear how students were taught to review their reflections in order to inform actions. This seems to be a critical part of reflective and metacognitive practice, that is, reviewing and identifying areas of growth and weakness to inform future action. Moreover, while the researchers explicitly stated that the reflections were not assessed to avoid discouraging open and honest reflection, there was no mention of student self-assessment. Such self-assessment could be a critical part of developing a metacognitive and reflective practice to inform action.</p>
