          <p>
            Who has the power to open and fund public charter schools in Georgia (and to a large extent the rest of the nation)? This is the question currently facing Georgia's Supreme Court. Their decision in a <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-charter-school-ruling-879811.html">two-year legal battle between local school districts and an independent commission</a> established by the state will have ramifications for the future and direction of charter schools across the country. 

The fire for the feud was ignited when the Georgia Charter Schools Commission, founded and approved by the state, started opening charter schools, much to the chagrin of local school boards, most of whom have denied schools created by the commission. Georgia's state constitution allows school board franchises to establish and maintain schools, and thus the legal question in the case becomes whether the Georgia law creating the commission was constitutional. 

Lost in all the legal wrangling and public row are the current students of those schools created by the commission, as they will be the ones most affected by the decision of the court. Should the court agree with the school boards' argument, close to 15,000 students will be displaced since all the charter schools created under the commission will have to be closed. Most of Georgia's current 121 charter schools were opened by local school boards and serve about 4% of all Georgia's public schools students.  The Court, in addition to the decision, could provide guidelines and recommendations for the students who will be affected should they side with the school boards.
