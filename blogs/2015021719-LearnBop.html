<p><a href="https://www.learnbop.com/">LearnBop</a> is designed to teach algebra to 5th through 9th Graders. With its fun, easy to use interface, it is approachable for students and teachers alike. </i>Bops</i>, in LearnBop, are interactive math problems. The bops respond to student responses in each step of the problem solving process by reformulating based on student input. LearnBop’s learning director, Cindy Bryant, is a presidential awardee and a former member of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Board of Directors. All of LearnBop’s content is aligned with the Common Core</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>For teachers, the curriculum is easily customizable for whole classes and students. Because of the dynamic bops that customize to student responses, LearnBop feels like one-on-one learning. If a student has trouble answering a question and asks for help, LearnBop responds by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable questions. As the student requests help, the teacher is notified of missing pieces in the student’s math understanding. LearnBop then suggests lessons for teachers that will strengthen the student's understanding of the concept. The feedback loop among LearnBop, students, and teachers allows teachers to know when students have achieved mastery of a subject (in their algorithm that means correctly answering a question 90% of the time). The teacher dashboard allows teachers to easily manage student data and make informed decisions about their upcoming math lessons. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>LearnBop is not free, though the pricing scale is comparable to similar apps. Currently, it costs $15/student for an individual class purchase, and $10/student for a school-wide purchase. LearnBop is uniquely designed to offer Common Core aligned math programs, so it may not be so useful in schools with different math curricula. LearnBop was also designed for engaged students and teachers to use together, so the benefits of the app might not be clear for students working independently without a dedicated teacher.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaways:</b></p>
<p>The site boasts jumps in student achievement over eight months, citing a middle school class in Brooklyn, NY that went from failing to passing Common Core standards tests. Teachers who may want to know exactly what kinds of additional strategies they can employ in the classroom to ensure this kind of rapid success might find LearnBop's recently released webinar and slides on developing mathematical literacy helpful. These resources are designed to support teachers and administrators interested rolling out the LearnBop red carpet of math learning.</p>
