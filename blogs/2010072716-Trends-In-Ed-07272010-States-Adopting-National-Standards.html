          <p>
            In many of the world's developed nations, there are some sort of national educational sets, with the United States being the lone exception.  In the US, states are responsible for creating their own educational standards. That trend looks set to end as there are a growing number of states signing on to the Common Core standards. 

The <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2010/0726/Uniform-education-standards-Momentum-grows-as-more-states-sign-on">Common Core standards were released last spring and so far</a>, 28 states and the District of Columbia have signed with many more expected to do so in the coming days. One of the primary arguments for the adoption of a national standards is “that the US will have a clear set of guidelines for what all students should know and when they should know it; that the standards are logical, rigorous, and build on prior learning; and that they are tied to the knowledge high school graduates need to be ready for college or a career.”

Proponents of the Common Core argue students who move to different states will experience little interruption in their studies and states could further collaborate on textbooks and standardized exams. Opponents argue the standards will lose its desired effect if states don't commit to investing in reform while others claim the new standards are weaker than what some states already have in place. It is also worth noting that any state hoping to gain a piece of some of the Race to the Top money must adopt the Common Core standards by August 2nd.
