<p>Years ago, having a pen pal was actually quite common, whether it be someone from across the country or across the world. But as snail mail took a backseat to email and cell phone communications, the prevalence of pen pal relationships has faded significantly. <a href="https://penpalschools.com/">Penpal Schools</a> is trying to change that, but with an added educational bonus. As an organization that works to connect students from across the globe with one another, Penpal Schools seeks to put a spotlight on diversity, and subsequently reach across cultural barriers so that students can learn from one another in a communicative way.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Penpal Schools is a free program, which makes it more accessible to teachers and students. It also makes an effort to connect students from different cultural backgrounds, so that pairs can learn about each other’s home country and share experiences unique to their culture. Teachers can also review their students’ letters and grade them accordingly.</p>

<p>One of the greatest strengths of the program, however, is that it is not just a service that pairs students and leaves it at that. Penpal Schools provides Common Core-aligned courses that are set in a specific period of time and targeted for certain age groups in order to add structure to the students’ interactions. Some of these courses include "World News," "World Explorer," "Language Exchange," and "Decision 2016." World News, for example, is offered at three different levels of difficulty for either three or six weeks, and prompts students to read news articles about current events happening in their pen pal’s country. Topics include the environment, poverty, technology, war, and government. The articles provided are formatted in an easy-to-read, digestible structure that provides text features like bolded focus words and vocabulary definitions.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Penpal Schools is overall very well-structured, with a unique and organic way for students to learn about not only other students’ cultures, but also their realities as influenced by their cultural contexts. Of course, the challenge with all educational technology tools is that integrating them into the classroom is complicated by the fact that not all schools will have access to the appropriate devices and technology so that all students can fully take part in the process. This can be an issue in high-needs districts in the United States, as well as in other countries where access to technology is limited. Penpal Schools does, however, provide the opportunity for users to donate money to sponsor students to participate in the program.</p>

<p>Although Penpal Schools provides courses that are aligned with the Common Core, this is a U.S.-centric focus that may not be well-suited for schools in other countries. Although students from other countries can still use the resource, this does not speak to how relevant the courses themselves are to curricula outside the U.S.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Penpal Schools can be a great curriculum-relevant way to teach students about global current events as well as foreign culture, and languages. It is increasingly important to make sure that students are mindful of the fact that they exist in a global society, and what better way to teach them that than through other students their age who live across the world? Penpal Schools does a fantastic job providing the appropriate structure for students to learn about and engage with cultures from around the world.</p>
