          <p>
            The teaching of the writing institute is intense as it conflicts with my final week of another on-going research methodology course. I really got a CRAZY week... But fortunately it is a high-quality week-long class that is far beyond my expectation. I never thought that writing can be taught in such a well-structured way and also made fun. I feel excited about the processes of teaching: (1) the 10-minute mini lesson for building up connections to fit into students' works, <span style="font-weight: bold;">demonstrating</span> strategies for writing, <span style="font-weight: bold;">engaging </span>students by asking students to <span style="font-weight: bold;">practice</span> the strategy just taught, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">linking</span> the on-going lesson to content/strategies taught previously; and (2) the ways of conferring with students individually and in a small group.

In a writing workshop, the mini lesson, which takes the first 10 minutes, is very important to support students' <span style="font-weight: bold;">independent writing</span>. It will provide students with strategies for writing and they will be the ones who take the choices of strategies with them throughout their entire writing life. The strategies may not help students to shape their main work that they need to complete on that day but will familiarize students with different meanings via different strategies. The processes of practices will enable students to build up a rich writing repertoire for their increasing growth. Since there are only ten minutes for the mini lesson, the instruction needs to be very succinct, and the demonstration of writing needs to be very detailed.

Conferring with students is another important component in teaching of writing. Conferring gives good moments for differentiated teaching. A conference consists of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> research</span> (finding out what students are working on, where they are, and what problems they might encounter), <span style="font-weight: bold;">compliment </span>(encouraging students' going-on work and support the strategies students already used in their works),<span style="font-weight: bold;"> teach</span> (what further help they might need and what strategies they can apply to make their writing better), and <span style="font-weight: bold;">link</span> (link the aforementioned teaching to the mini lesson or the previous strategies/content).

The processes of both the mini lesson and the conferring match the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Constructivism</span> learning theory. Students are continuously learning from new strategies and their own practices while being linked to knowledge already or previously acquired. These approaches assist students to write, rather than restrict the content students want to write about. Teachers are more like facilitators rather than instructors. I wonder whether this structured method (of teaching of English writing) can be applied to students learning English as a second language? Can the concept be also applied to other languages, for example, for teachers teaching the writing of Chinese literacy in China?
