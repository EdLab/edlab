<p>In large university lectures, it can be difficult for students to engage with their professors, especially those students who are more introverted. Some instructors have begun to use clicker devices or apps to encourage interactions. A research team from Taiwanese and Chinese universities attempted to measure the success that this technology has on classroom engagement, with a focus on the differences between introverted and extroverted students. </p> 

<p>The sample for this study consisted of 109 university students in two different elective geographic information system courses. Professors employed a computer-based interface that students could use to request a pause in the lecture if the material was confusing. Once enough students requested a pause, the lecturer would halt the course and provide additional explanation or practice. Students also took a self-assessment questionnaire after each session. The experiment lasted over a two week period.  </p>

<p>The results showed that around 60% of the students were willing to signal a pause to the instructor for various reasons. Of those students, around 70% said that they requested stoppage because they were confused or didn’t understand the subject. The factor that predicted the highest rate of pausing was students with self-reported low levels of trust in the instructor, with almost 89% of these students requesting a halt to the lecture when they were confused.  </p>

<p>The clicker technological intervention did not seem to fix the introvert and extrovert engagement divide. Extroverted students reported a higher self-assessed willingness to use this technology. Conversely, almost a third of the respondents were considered to be introverted and these students mostly chose not to request breaks in the lectures, even during periods when they were confused.  </p>

<p>The researchers admit that this study has a few limitations, such as a small sample size, short timeframe, and only one course subject. However, they believe that this project can inform future research on the growing use of clickers in university classrooms. While introverts still used the clickers less often than their extroverted peers, these kinds of experiments might help to overcome discrepancies in learning outcomes among those with differing learning styles. </p>
