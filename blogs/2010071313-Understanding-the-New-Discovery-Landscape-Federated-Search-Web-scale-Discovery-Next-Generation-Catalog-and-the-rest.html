            <b>Background:</b>
Hui Soo, Shaoqing, Jo Agnitti and I have been working on building and testing out an open source Integrated Library Management system called Koha.

<b>Where we are:</b>
We have currently tested out a successful deployment of Koha and are in the process of importing data from our current Integrated Library System. You can evaluate the <a href="www.koha.org/">Koha system</a> by logging into our <b><a href="http://sandbox6-edlab.tc.columbia.edu">test setup</a></b> (only accessible inside TC network and requires one to be hardwired in or on VPN). For the username and password please get in touch with Joann or Shaoqing.

<b>Research:</b>
We have been consistently monitoring the library search space with respect to the developments done in the library cataloging and how to make the patron experience much more enriching.

In regard to this there was a recent webinar done by Serial Solutions on the topic of <b><i>Understanding the New Discovery Landscape: Federated Search, Web-scale Discovery, Next-Generation Catalog and the rest</b></i>.
I am mentioning the key points for everybody to get a good sense of where the new developments are heading and would like to sought out any feedback of what ways we should proceed our current endeavors to include that in the Koha ILS which we are currently playing around this. Please shoot an email to either of us or include a blog post.

So not boring you enough here are the key details which I found out:

Today a Modernized Interface for a library catalog seems to have all of these functionalities which are in tandem with the features offered by Google, Amazon, etc: 
<ol>
<li>Single Search box
<li>Query Tools (Did you mean, type-ahead)
<li>Relevance Ranked results
<li>Enhanced visual displays
<li>Recommendation services
</ol>

A good example of a library having a good User interface design is Mississippi Library.  http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/

To get a background of the library cataloging and how it evolved please refer to the wiki page of <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPAC">OPAC</a></b>.

New Library Discovery layer and how it interfaces with other systems to make the search more comprehensible and scalable to not only our library but also other libraries

The latest new developments happening inside the colleges and the libraries:
<ul>
<li> Teaching platform replaced by Moodle
<li> Replacement of ILMS- emphasis on front end - Aquabrowser(tag clouds)
<li> New building - integrating experiential lerning plus other services
<li> Accountability - ROI, statistics
<li> Research - repositories
<li> RFID
<li> Improving access 
<li> E-only catalogue 
</ul>

There is also a new offering offered by serial solutions which is meant to assist libraries in getting the content in a more authoritative fashion to users who are right now relying on search engines for ease of use. 

<b>Background about Summon: 
Summon</b> a new library discovery search with much more information provided by it as to the likes of, however not keeping the library at the backstage but at the front. 

<b>Salient Features of Summon:</b> 
<ul>
<li>It mines all the full text and has abstract over the mouse over.
<li>It has partners like LexisNexis, Proquest, etc. 
<li>Find by subject terms, content types, narrow by dates, etc. 
<li> It also has a mobile platform presence (iPhone)
</ul>

An instance where you can evaluate Summon deployed by University of Huddersfield <b> <a href="http://library.hud.ac.uk/summon/">here</b></a>. Summon seems to be an intuitive enough to even search by citation type for journals. 

More information available on Summon is available <b><a href="http://serialsolutions.com/summon-research/">here</a></b>.

You can view the Seminar Webcast for the event <b><a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/tools/webcast/883879-388/understanding__the_new_discovery.html.csp"> here</a></b> and also see the presentation slides which are attached with this blog entry.

We would be more interested in hearing from you all (including Gary) as to what features you think would be useful for the next generation ILS for TC.
