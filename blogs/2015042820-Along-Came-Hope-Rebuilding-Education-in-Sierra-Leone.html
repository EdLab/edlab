Sierra Leone, a small country in West Africa, has had little to cheer about in recent times. The outbreak of the Ebola virus last year brought more anguish to a generation that has seen its share of misery. From 1991–2002, a violent civil war left scores dead and obliterated many of its institutions. The civil war was particularly known for its use of child soldiers. Young adolescent boys were turned into killing machines overnight. Many of these child soldiers have yet to fully reintegrate into society. The work of rebuilding Sierra Leone has fallen largely to non-governmental organizations (NGOs). </p>

<p>Operation Blessing, focused primarily in the capital city of Freetown, is one such NGO hard at work to ensure Sierra Leone’s current youth have access to education. Operation Blessing has been working in conjunction with ambitious and dedicated local religious leaders to provide free education to boys and girls in Freetown. In a community where 90% of the population is illiterate, the work of Operation Blessing is essential to ensuring Sierra Leone’s youth can fulfill their aspirations while providing a spark to light the country out of its long darkness.</p>

<p>How vital is the work of organizations such as Operation Blessing in a postwar community? What role can other stakeholders play to continue the rebuilding in Sierra Leone? ? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/21825/">Join the discussion on Vialogues. </a>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>00:41 bizapp:</b> How are the classrooms structured? Are all the children placed in one classroom or separated based on their ability level? </p>

<p><b>00:54 lassinebamba:</b> The most important step is making sure students have a safe and clean environment to learn. Though nonprofits play an immense role in postwar societies, governments must play an even bigger role to ensure schools, teachers and students have the basic tools (classrooms, books, etc.,). </p>

<p><b>02:48 kwaku5:</b> Educating young people is the most important recovery project for any war torn nation.
