<p>Despite the fact that deception is a tactic humans have been employing probably since the dawn of time, we are surprisingly bad at detecting it; <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201305/why-are-we-so-bad-detecting-lies">research has found</a> that we only catch lies with about 50% accuracy. This has real repercussions for law enforcement officers, judges, and others who rely upon their ability to parse fact from fiction on a daily basis and with serious consequences. But is this a skill that can be taught? </p>

<p>A research team at UC Santa Barbara decided to try teaching deception detection techniques in a way they hoped would be both engaging and effective: by using a video game. Seven hundred U.S. college students participated in the study with half of the participants playing an instructional video game developed by the UC Santa Barbara team, and the other half viewing a PowerPoint training presentation. In both scenarios, students received training about cognitive biases and deception detection, but only the game was interactive, with students engaging in particular scenarios and receiving feedback on their responses.</p>
 
<p>The first attempt revealed flaws with the game design, and these were adjusted for the second simulation. Despite this, pre- and post-tests and questionnaires from both simulations demonstrated that the game was more effective than the traditional lecture at motivating learners, supporting autonomy, creating perceived value, and increasing engagement with the training. The video game was also more successful in teaching factual knowledge and at improving students’ abilities to accurately identify truth telling, though detecting lies proved a harder skill for students to master. This last observation might mean that truth and deception detection are separate skills that require different types of training. </p>

<p>While there needs to be further adjustments to the game and more research into the different types of training necessary to detect truth and deception, this study demonstrates that video games are a viable way to teach new skill sets. Perhaps this technology can help both current and future law enforcers learn how to be better human lie detectors and more just and reliable professionals.</p>
