          <p>
            This week the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/education/23single.html">reported</a> on the growing kerfuffle over single-sex education inaugurated by the “2006 regulations weakening the Title IX prohibition against sex discrimination in education.”  A group of psychologists and neuroscientists have published <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6050/1706">an article in Science magazine</a> titled “The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling” attacking the growing trend (more than 500 public schools in America offer single-sex courses). The authors of the article contend that there is little support for the practice in the research literature, and the negative effects, including reinforcing sex-stereotypes, can be quite serious.  
<!--break-->
There's not a doubt in my mind that I would have learned better and faster in a single-sex environment (more so, I would guess, in college than high school), but I haven't done any reading in the literature, and can't speak to the general impact.  That said, this conflict looks to me more about cultural politics than science.  The ongoing argument as reported by the Times is about whether or not schools should provide the option, not the requirement.  Legally, single-sex classes may be permitted only “as long as they are voluntary, students have a substantially equal coeducational option and the school reasonably believes separation will produce better academic outcomes.”  Why is this not a strong enough regulation?  Presumably because a certain camp is so fearful of sex-stereotypes that they will go to any lengths to prevent their emergence.  My guess, as an ignoramus indulging in unfounded speculation, is that single-sex education actually reduces the salience of sex-stereotypes in student learning, by reducing opportunities for making the comparisons upon which they rest.

The lead author of the article, Diane Halpern of Claremont-McKenna, explains and defends her article in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6050/1706/suppl/DC1.">a podcast interview</a> hosted on the Science website.
