<p><b>Title:</b> Optimising the Use of Note-Taking as an External Cognitive Aid for Increasing Learning (2009)</p>

<b>Authors:</b> Tamas Makany, Jonathan Kemp, & Itiel E. Dror</p>

<p><b>Source:</b><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00906.x/full"> British Journal of Educational Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Does one method of note-taking—linear vs. non-linear—enhance student learning more than another?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> 
Although note-taking has been going on for centuries in both professional and academic settings, the more effective note-taking methods do not seem to be immediately intuitive. During a typical lecture, students are generally only able to capture around 20-40% of the material when using the traditional note-taking method. This is significant considering that the level of details in notes can account for up to 50% of the variance in students’ final test scores. This study examines the efficiency and effectiveness of two note-taking techniques—traditional linear and non-linear <a href="http://www.smartwisdom.com">SmartWisdom</a>—on academic performance. The non-linear SmartWisdom approach to note-taking organizes information graphically on a single page in a semi-hierarchical format within concentric circles. Concepts are recorded in connected strings of one or two word bits, branching out from the innermost circle as details are added.</p> 

<p>Two groups of adult information management students (N=26) participated in the study. Each group of students was shown 5-minute video clips of a science lecture and a conference panel discussion on financial trends. All students took hand-written notes as they watched the videos; one group used the traditional linear approach while the other used the non-linear SmartWisdom approach. After each video, students were tested on comprehension, accuracy of understanding, ability to generate complex mental imagery of details regarding presented information, personal sense of note-taking performance, and memory of the presentation 4 hours after the video.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The non-linear note-taking group performed significantly better than the linear group in both terms of the quantity and the quality of the material learned. Overall, non-linear note taking strategies increased academic performance through deeper understanding and highly integrated knowledge management. Students using the non-linear technique relayed information in a semantically more connected and meaningful way than the students from the linear group. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Note-taking is a complex information management process. Instructing students on ways to conceptualize information in a less linear fashion would help them to process information in more meaningful and interconnected ways. This approach to managing information could not only increase efficiency and understanding in the classroom but also in the workplace. Given that research shows students who <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/903">multitask on laptops</a> when taking electronic notes during lectures display lower levels of comprehension than those who don’t, a "low tech" pen and paper approach to note-taking may provide additional benefits to the students’ comprehension by eliminating distractions associated with the laptop.</p>
