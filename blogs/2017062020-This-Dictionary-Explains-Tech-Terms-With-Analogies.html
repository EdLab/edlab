<p>If you’ve ever had trouble with tech jargon, <a href="https://sidewaysdictionary.com/#/">Sideways Dictionary</a> might be able to help. This new project, produced as a collaboration between the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com"> Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.google.com">Jigsaw</a>, defines all the quintessential techie terms in an untraditional way. Instead of your run-of-the mill definitions, Sideways Dictionary uses analogies in order to create an image that might better boost your understanding.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The analogies on Sideways Dictionary are crowdsourced, meaning that anyone can contribute to the database. Collected analogies are first vetted by the website creators, then published on the site where they are upvoted or downvoted. The analogies with the most upvotes make it to the top of the list. There are currently 73 tech words on the list, each of which has at least three analogies listed.</p>
 
<p>Sideways Dictionary provides a lot of fun analogies that are actually helpful in grasping these slippery tech terms. For instance, a Hackathon is described as both like a <i>regatta for geeks</i> and <i>Marvel’s Avengers Assemble</i>, with more information explaining each term. Other words that are listed are ones such as <i>machine learning</i>, <i>honeypot</i>, and <i>big data</i>.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Sideways Dictionary is likely much more helpful for people who already have a basic understanding of tech jargon rather than those who are completely unfamiliar with it. After reading through some terms that were previously unfamiliar to me (e.g., <i>sandboxing</i> and <i>WPA</i>), I felt like I was able to grasp their basic functions, but did not feel prepared to use them in a conversation. In addition, because the site only has 73 terms at the moment, it is not yet a comprehensive guide to all things techie.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Sideways Dictionary takes an innovative and interesting approach to defining tech jargon. Because it works in analogies instead of concrete definitions, this project will work better as a supplement to understanding tech terms rather than as a primary source. In other words, it’s like an illustration in a picture book: not necessary to understand the story, but helpful for getting a better picture of what’s happening. </p>
