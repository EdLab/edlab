          <p>
            <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercise/0">Codeacademy</a> is a free interactive online website where anybody can learn how to write code. This newly launched website is free for anybody to register and use and users can even register using their Facebook account! Codeacademy's philosophy on teaching is to have the person learn by doing. So the learner will be inputting code in the space provided, and they will be able to see their output.  For now, Codeacademy teaches the basics of writing code in Javascript, but eventually they plan to move to other languages.

<b>Pros</b>: Codeacademy is simple and fun to use and even younger learners can have an easy time learning code. The website has a social aspect to it as well. The learner can learn with friends and keep track of how their friends are doing. The learner also has a profile on the website which displays the percentage of completing a course. For now they just have a beginner's course. You can earn achievements as you go through each level of the learning process. 

<b>Cons</b>: For now this website just teaches Javascript, and I am hoping they will expand to other languages like HTML. Codeacademy also has very simple commands to learn, so this will not cater to more advance code writers. I am hoping that these two problems will be addressed further down the line and I am looking forward to seeing what they will do with this website. 

<b>EdLab Relavance</b>: Codeacademy is similar to the app that Sudden Industries had in their <a href ="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/851">seminar</a>, in which both the website and app have a social feature to it, which in turn, might draw in more users. Another interesting fact is that the creators of the website are also Columbia students.

<b>Our Takeaway</b>: I think this is a good way of introducing programming to younger students (K-9). Since we have more and more jobs that involve computers and programming, this is a good way to get a new generation prepared for these new tasks.
