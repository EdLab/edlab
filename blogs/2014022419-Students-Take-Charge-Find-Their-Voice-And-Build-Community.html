Detroit Summer is a student-run school program in Detroit founded by Grace Lee Baggs in 1992. Student run? Yes, student-run. Students encourage their peers to take on leadership roles, get involved with community organizing, and find their voice. The program uses hip hop, arts, media, and action to make a change. The effect of their hard work is neighborhood beautification, an increased sense of community, and student agency: with a sense of purpose, students tap into their ability to make a difference.<p>

Julia Putnam, the first Detroit Summer volunteer, shares, "I used to be scared of the neighborhood." Now she is out there changing it, inhabiting it, making it beautiful. She speaks of painting an elderly womanâ€™s house and the upbeat, artistically shot video shows clips of students gardening. Baggs says she was inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. to found the program as a way for youth to empower <i>themselves</i>. By being in charge of a program aimed at community organizing and artistic expression, the youth find their voice and make a difference in ways visible to the community. The video, filled with clips of students sharing their experiences interlaced with examples of their work, points to the promise of this model. <p>
