          <p>
            <a href="www.bie.org">The Buck Institute for Education</a> (BIE) is a not-for-profit funded by the Leonard and Beryl Buck Trust that focuses on promoting project-based learning (PBL) in the classroom. PBL is fairly self-explanatory; centering learning around projects that teach a standards-based curriculum in an integrated, often interdisciplinary, and frequently hands-on setting. PBL should not be wholly considered an exercise in "building things", since projects might be slightly more abstract and in the digital realm, rather than the physical realm. 

The site itself is focused on providing tools, videos, and, most importantly, details on how to execute specific projects. I will admit that I was at first incredibly impressed by the number of projects they had for each subject, only to find later that there was significant overlap and some projects were not as relevant to a specific discipline as others. Nevertheless, each of the projects had the necessary level of detail for a teacher to easily execute.

There is also plenty of research on the benefits of PBL on student achievement. After looking at some of the papers, my one concern is that there is no way to control for the quality of projects outside a limited study. Oftentimes teachers and administrators try to pass off burdensome work as PBL. However, PBL, when executed properly, can certainly have a positive impact from the studies available on the website.

The low-down: this is a great resource for teachers but remember that the amount of learning that takes place is directly correlated to the quality and relevance of the project.
