            Hi everyone. 

Do you know any designers who want to prove themselves in the field of data visualization? Our 2011 "Visualizing Data" competition (replacing <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/1887">EDAR</a> this year) is open:

The Gottesman Libraries is looking for designers that are able to understand the implications of educational data, andÂ will award up to 20 designers an honorarium of $500 for work that visualizes data and potentially connects it to existing or potential educational policy, the effects of such policy upon students, and society at large. We are interested in entries that articulate the breadth of possible approaches to data visualization — from static representations to <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> visualizations, and everything in between.

<strong>The Data</strong>

Our competition is centered around national education statistic curated byÂ the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), a center within the Institute of Education Science of the U.S. Department of Education. We believe this data set offers designers some autonomy in choosing exactly which data to work with, from within a large pool of education statistics.

You may choose to work with any data on the NCES site, but we suggest starting with the rich “Elementary/Secondary” section <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/index.asp?faq=FFOption3#faqFFOption3">here.</a>

Following the link above, you can choose factors (such as ‘Expenditures' or ‘Transportation') within the Elementary/Secondary subheading to view (and download) data you are interested in working with. To get started, we suggest browsing the various sub-topics. Each section includes a narrative, along with premade tables with data available in standard spreadsheet formats.

Your visualization may draw upon any NCESÂ data set you like, just be sure to document exactly what you're using.

<strong>Details</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The competition begins March 7th, 2011. There will be an application window that runs 8 weeks to a firm deadline at 5pm on <strong>April 29th, 2011</strong>. Winners will be announced May 10th, 2011.</li>
	<li>Up to 20 designers will be awarded a <strong>$500 honorarium</strong>.Â Recipients of the honorarium are required to share source files and grant Teachers College license to use the works fully or in part, and create derivative works.</li>
	<li>We will proudly promote the entrants' work in various media (both print and online).Â  Any time an honoree's work is used, it will be fully credited. Among other publications, works will be displayed in and around Teachers College, specifically in a gallery space with projectors and other digital displays.</li>
	<li>Submissions will be judged by a small cohort of <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/">EdLab</a> designers and educational researchers at <a href="http://www.tc.edu/">Teachers College</a>, and 1-2 additional guest judges announced mid-April.</li>
	<li>Open to students and professionals.</li>
</ul>
For more information, see the full Call for Submissions on the <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/hughes/visualizing-data-competition-2011">Learning at the Library site</a>.
