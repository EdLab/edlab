<b>Title:</b>
Active Learning Not Associated with Student Learning in a Random Sample of College Biology Courses
<p>
<b>Authors:</b>
T. M. Andrews, M. J. Leonard, C. A. Colgrove, & S. T. Kalinowski
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Existing research has supported the practice of active learning, particularly in college science lectures.  Incorporating student activities, such as group discussions or experimental exercises, is believed to enhance student learning and retention of material.
<p>
The authors of this article set out to examine the usefulness of the practice in a college biology course. They sampled a variety of introductory biology courses from large and top-ranked colleges and universities.  They examined student learning pre- and post-course, and surveyed instructors on the amount and type of active learning exercises they incorporate in their classrooms, along with other potentially relevant factors.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Their first and most dispiriting discovery is that very little learning seemed to be going on, and learning gains by students in these introductory courses were modest, with many students unable to apply any material from the class to a fairly basic novel question.  Although active learning was a fairly popular tool, used by the vast majority of instructors to at least some extent, there didn’t seem to be any significant association between the use of active learning tools by instructors and real learning gains in the student population. However, the authors did find that instructors who worked actively to correct student misconceptions, either through active learning or within their lectures, did see significant gains in student learning.  
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study shows that active learning activities alone are not enough to enhance student learning.  Previous research into active learning, as the study authors discuss, restricted itself to investigating classrooms in which the instructors implementing active learning had previous science education research experience, such as published papers or visits to conferences.  The instructors that comprised this study’s sample, by contrast, were a more mixed group, and included many who had no such previous experience.  The study authors note that this may explain both the large effects found by previous researchers, as well as the lack of effects in their current study.
<p>
Further research will be necessary to determine whether domain-specific teacher experience is in fact necessary for the success of active learning.  Even a modest effect, however, serves to emphasize how important training and implementation can be for programs of even proven effectiveness.  Without a sustainable infrastructure to ensure that learning methods are employed in the right manner, including with an experienced eye on student problems as they crop up, we’ll remain stuck in neutral, with students who learn little to nothing from semester-long courses.
