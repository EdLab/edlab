As <a href="http://usestealth.com/">Stealth</a> quotes in their <a href=”http://usestealth.com/howitworks.php”>”About"</a> section, "Anonymous search is at the core of people looking up information" (<a href=”http://thedroidguy.com/2012/01/googles-eric-schmidt-responds-to-government-concerns-over-privacy-policy/”>said by Eric Schmidt of Google</a>), and Stealth has created just that. It provides users with a truly anonymous search experience including the following: no tracking of any kind, no saved searches, no recorded IP addresses and no stored cookies. 

Stealth does not share any of your search data with third parties and has claimed on their site that, while they don't currently accept advertising, they may in the future and, if they do, they will go so far as to promise to sacrifice 80% of potential ad revenue to maintain the current level of privacy. In Stealth's own words, "On most free search engines, you're paying with your privacy. On Stealth, you don't pay at all."

This "freedom" is especially compelling as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/google-privacy-policy-who-will-be-affected-and-how-you-can-choose-what-information-gets-shared/2012/01/26/gIQA69fNVQ_story.html">Google recently announced plans to change their privacy policy</a> and may soon share more and more of your data from their suite of apps. As our search data becomes increasingly valuable to marketers it might truly benefit users to go "stealth."

<b>Pros:</b> 
Stealth is free of ads and offers a tidy list of search filters including web, image, news, and video-based results. When I searched for "EdLab", our site came up first– the true test of an effective search engine! ;)

<b>Cons:</b>
The interface design is really low contrast and this makes it hard to find the aforementioned filters. Speaking of filters, there aren't as many as Google offers and, while Stealth is more streamlined, the "search by color" filter on image searches from the "Plex" really is hard to beat. Also, the image search for EdLab seemed very skimpy in Stealth's results area.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
What would an EdLab-developed search engine look like? What would be the standout features and who would be our target user? Would we offer a "stealth" feature? <a href="http://www.sweetsearch.com/">Dulcinea Media's "Sweet Search"</a> is a great example of a proprietary search engine built specifically for the ed sector. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
I think, given the current battles over our personal information, it is worth exploring alternatives.
