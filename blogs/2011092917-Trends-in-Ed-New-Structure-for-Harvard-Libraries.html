          <p>
            Harvard's libraries have a new organizational structure meant to foster collaboration between buildings and units. Under the new vision, Harvard's 90-some libraries will be separated into 5 affinity groups based on service and focus. The groups are fairly amorphous to allow for differences in mission, explanations from <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/09/new-harvard-library-structure">Harvard Magazine</a>: 

"libraries focused on application of theory in practice, including those of the schools of law, business, education, and government; a group focused on physical and life sciences with shared research responsibilities, including the medical school library and the science libraries; a group formed around content areas, such as the humanities and the social sciences, including major collections such as those of Widener and Lamont;
libraries of arts and culture such as fine arts,  architecture, music, theater, and film; and finally, a group of special collections libraries such as Houghton and the University Archives."

Libraries will be able to choose their own group and will have 45 days to change allegiance. The executive director Helen Shenton states that the groups were developed along existing lines of collaboration and she hopes that they will strengthen these bonds. 

The strategies that large library systems use for policy creation and governance are very interesting. It seems that even in our one-building library cross-departmental communication is sometimes difficult, not to mention collaboration with the library system across the street. I can only imagine what it would be like to manage such a behemoth (lots of meetings, I suspect.) We'll see how this new strategy of Harvard's goes down, I hope it will be an era of renewed focus on their five-point goals.
