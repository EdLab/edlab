<i>If America is to maintain our high standard of living, we must continue to innovate. We are competing with nations many times our size. We don't have a single brain to waste. Math and science are the engines of innovation. With these engines we can lead the world. We must demystify math and science so that all students feel the joy that follows understanding</i> (<a href="http://www.nationalmathandscience.org/resources/quotes">Dr. Michael Brown, Nobel Prize winner for medicine</a>).

<b>Evolution of After-School Programs</b><br>
Nicholas Eftimiades founded the space-themed after-school program, <a href="http://www.foge.org/">Federation of Galaxy Explorers (FOGE)</a> in 2001 with the goal of encouraging interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) subjects among children.  Through after-school, summer camp and evening programs focused on Grades 3-12 the national not-for-profit, "prepares children for employment in the 21st century by building on exciting hands-on applications of math and science."  These hands-on experiences include a wide range of activities from "sci-fi art exhibits" to suborbital space balloon launches and aircraft design, among many others.  This focus on "space" is a logical choice as Eftimiades worked for over 28 years in the Department of Defense, including seven years in the National Security Space Office.  With an emphasis on in-person project-based "missions" and alignment with The National Science Education Standards, the program is a fresh approach when compared to other youth, space-themed initiatives like <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forkids/kidsclub/flash/index.html">NASA’s Kids Club,</a> which focus almost completely on simulations and online games.  With incentives ranging from physical badges, medals and certificates to measurable "explorer" progress, FOGE participants are inspired to engage with the program.  Additionally, explorers nationwide are encouraged to collaborate with other teams through the program’s secure online collaboration platform.

<b>Stemming the Tide of STEM Failure?</b><br>
<a href="http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/advocate.cfm?story_id=4001725">Afterschool Alliance</a> Executive Director Jodi Grant has described the benefit of STEM-focused after-school programs as affording students, "the chance to build robots, explore the stars, learn how plants process sunlight and what makes airplanes and rockets fly. They have time to try, fail and try again. Much of that isn't possible during the regular school day."  The Afterschool Alliance has also recently concluded that, "existing data already show that the afterschool setting is playing a key role in supporting STEM learning. Future STEM education policy, the report says, should include afterschool as a key component of STEM education reform efforts."  With many US students failing STEM subjects and education stakeholders from the federal Department of Education to parents scrambling to find alternative learning opportunities to support student success in these subjects, a program like FOGE is a potentially valuable option.  With a focus on conceptually advanced, "project-based" learning the FOGE program aims to generate interest in STEM for students who would normally only encounter "standards-driven" basics in these regular classes.  Perhaps the over 30,000 children who have already been involved with the program will be inspired to pursue STEM-related studies and help address the fact that only <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2012/07/09/america-desperately-needs-more-stem-students-heres-how-to-get-them/">15% of the world’s scientists currently live in the US </a>. Beyond cultivating interest in STEM-related fields, the program strives to teach the history of space exploration and instill the value of funding space initiatives.  One of the first men on the moon, Buzz Aldrin, is even on the board.  Perhaps, like the great space race of the 1960’s young "explorers" will be similarly inspired to join a "citizen activist force in society; helping to shape the national space policy."
