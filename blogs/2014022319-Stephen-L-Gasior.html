<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stephen-gasior/58/9b3/226">Dr. Stephen Gasior</a> is helping to take science education beyond the traditional bounds of the classroom and into the virtual realm.  In an innovative move, Dr. Gasior helped create VIBE (<a href="http://wiki.bio-se.info">Virtual Islands for Better Education</a>) and began experimenting with teaching college-level biology courses in <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenSim</a>.  Beyond helping to push forward our concept of telecommuting and non-traditional learning opportunities in virtual worlds, Dr. Gasior is a biology instructor at Ball State University and formerly taught at the University of New Orleans.  He has extensive expertise not only teaching scientists-in-training, but also non-science majors in courses ranging from Cellular and Molecular Biology to Genetics across a spectrum of levels.  Dr. Gasior has also contributed extensively to the field as a Postdoctoral Fellow at both Tulane Cancer Center in New Orleans and the University of Chicago, as well as through numerous peer-reviewed publications. He will be presenting as a Research and Education Track Leader for the <a href="http://conference.opensimulator.org/2013/">OpenSimulator Community Conference 2014</a>. Dr. Gasior holds a Doctorate in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Chicago and a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry from Tulane University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My background before teaching was doing molecular biology research. That training and work was always about pushing the experimental techniques and thinking deeply to come up with new areas of knowledge. It involved trial and error but always a willingness to keep moving forward and trying new approaches. I've found as an educator that I am still attempting to push student learning forward with a varied teaching style and seeing where technology can enhance either the learning or the opportunity for students to be engaged in class. I find that I am pushing virtual worlds to be a strong environment for student learning because, in my mind, it meets those needs of engaging students as a group and individually. I've been experimenting with OpenSim as a way to get teachers able to deliver customized learning lessons that schools can host themselves which is kind of an experiment in pushing forward the way schools think about themselves as education providers. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Without a doubt, my having taught college non-majors biology classes three times in <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> was just an eye opener for creating a great classroom environment that allowed students to be telecommuters. There were several projects or explorations we did as a class that were just a joy to see some students really take to and learn the material. I haven't had an opportunity to teach in Second Life since then, but I've been working with Virtual Islands for Better Education on OpenSim and been enjoying more virtual networking with educational Second Life groups. Getting out more and seeing the other great educational experiences or places has been a real treat. I hope in time for my teaching experiences to synergize with the work of others to really make some new and wonderful learning activities. 

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I really hope that me and my collaborators' work can change a few things about education. One, many schools and universities in essence contract out their educational content to companies that host the material or even homework. The open nature of OpenSim really creates this opportunity to be the host of the classroom and the educational material. And in some cases, keeping it within your own network means it is something that bypasses a lot of the worry about connectivity and cost of the wider internet. Two, as we have done, I hope to see more educators develop their own learning activities in the OpenSim environment. Instead of purchasing or relying on programmers to develop for you, educators can relatively easily make engaging or at least beautiful and immersive activities that are highly customized to one's own teaching perspective. Three, in the long run, the ability to archive and distribute those activities in OpenSim means a lot more material can be available for others to use. Maybe some people will distribute it freely, or similar to us, have it persistently available for others to use. These factors can bring more educators back to really creating specifically custom content for their classes without having to be a computer whiz. 
<p>
The other major aspect of using virtual worlds is to foster the sense of community among students. With virtual worlds, you can not only have your learning activities but also engage students far away with social and artistic activities. I have long wondered whether students that primarily take online classes feel as associated with the "brand" of a school if they don't partake of sporting or other social activities or don't interact with fellow students. With virtual worlds, one can deliver both the class and the community. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The broad trends I am currently most interested in are the increase in bandwidth and computing power especially in rural areas as well as the increase in studies on how effective different distance and electronic "classrooms" are.  We are accumulating enough students in online classes that we are getting a better sense of what is or is not effective for students to learn. I think how e-classrooms operate and how they create effective learning environments will be different in 5 years, and some of that will come from more accumulated best practices from the field. Ball State has a really interesting way of helping teachers develop their digital arsenal by having peer faculty coaches. I can see that as a big trend where in-house educators do the training and seeding of new digital tools for more faculty. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The current big project is Virtual Islands for Better Education. We are a collaborative of virtual worlds educators using OpenSim and hosting it ourselves. It's been used for global health graduate students, college genetics, college general biology, and 4th grade biology. We have co-developed with Wizardry and Steamworks tools for importing bulk digital content in ways that I don't see with other learning platforms. Our local archaeologist is now using digital terrain mapping for making virtual landscape recreations. But, the main thrust of that collaboration is not just the content, but learning how to make educators their own independent content hosters as well. My other big project is working with the Ball State <a href="http://idialab.org/">IDIA Lab</a> to build, develop content, and launch REDGrid as the OpenSim campus grid. The closed prototype currently has a great set of campus buildings, nursing activities, and some content on bioethics from Laryssa Nadolny at Iowa State University. IDIA lab is an award winning digital content developer and they are exciting to work with. Finally, I have a smaller project for biology classes looking at evolution, also with Wizardry and Steamworks, that we are going to find out how effective it is with students. We are in the study design stage. So that's built and now it comes time to really characterize whether it's a great tool for students beyond my thinking it is.
