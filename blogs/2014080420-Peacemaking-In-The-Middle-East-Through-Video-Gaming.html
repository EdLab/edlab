<p><b>Title:</b> PeaceMaker: Changing Students' Attitudes Toward Palestinians and Israelis Through Video Game Play (2012)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleem Alhabash & Kevin Wise</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=aa92c4e9-76da-4df6-b507-e05c1ecbc4af%40sessionmgr4001&vid=1&hid=4204&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=cax&AN=74233935"> International Journal of Communication </a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do participants’ attitudes toward Palestinians and Israelis change after playing PeaceMaker as a function of their nationality assignment (Palestinian president vs. Israeli prime minister)?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Role-play has been found to be an effective approach to self-induced attitude change, especially in cases in which one assumes the role that is contradictory to one’s preferences. In role-play, people actively improvise arguments and construct understandings about the relevant topics and situations. In this study, the researchers used PeaceMaker, a role-playing video game about peacemaking in the Middle East, and investigated its effectiveness on college students' explicit and implicit attitude change toward Palestinians and Israelis. 68 students participated in a controlled experiment and were assigned to different nationalities to play this game. Pre and post-tests on students' explicit (self-reported) and implicit attitudes toward Palestinians and Israelis were administered.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Participants' explicit attitudes toward Israelis and Palestinians changed significantly after the research activity. The pre-test results indicated that generally participants had more favorable views of Israelis than Palestinians. After playing this game for 20 minutes, participants who played as the Palestinian president changed their views on Palestinians positively, and their evaluations of Israelis changed negatively. However, their implicit attitudes toward both national groups did not change because of this gaming experience. This finding suggests that persuasive game role-play can lead to bias reduction. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> This paper illustrates the effectiveness of persuasive games for helping players gain new understanding about other social or national groups. This study only measured short-term effects of a persuasive game on attitude change, and it would be helpful to have more studies evaluating long-term behavior and attitude changes. </p>
