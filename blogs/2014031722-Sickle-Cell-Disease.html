          <p>
            As part of my theme on health and education, I will focus today's post on <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/heart/sickle_cell_anemia.html#">sickle cell disease</a>. It is an inherited disorder in which the red blood cells are abnormally shaped. Those afflicted with sickle cell can experience a host of issues such as chronic anemia and damaged body organs. Since there are different kinds of sickle cell diseases, the effect it has on individuals varies.  Those fortunate can live a very healthy and normal life while others are frequently hospitalized. 

The kind of sickle cell disease an individual has depends on inherited genes from a parent. Since there is no cure for sickle cell disease, bone marrow transplant is the only known form of remedy. However, such transplants tend to be a complex and risky.

I am really hoping they find a cure to sickle disease as one of my closest friends suffers from it. He is a very talented athlete and a great individual but the disease greatly limits his ability to do a lot of things. On the field, he's constantly out of breath (fatigue is one of the symptoms of sickle cell disease). There seems a certain element of unfairness about sickle cell since it is inherited and an individual's lifestyle doesn't play any role.
