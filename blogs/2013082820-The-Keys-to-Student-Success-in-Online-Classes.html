<p><b>Title:</b> Unpacking online learning experiences: Online learning self-efficacy and learning satisfaction (2013)<br>
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Demei Shen, Moon-Heum Cho, Chia-Lin Tasi, Rose Marra

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What is the role of self-efficacy in an online learning environment?<p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
As the number of online course providers continues to grow, an important question remains unanswered: how can administrators effectively retain students and ensure that they complete courses? While many students excitedly sign up for online classes, they often fail to complete course requirements or finish classes. Self-efficacy, or the belief in one’s own ability to complete tasks and reach goals, may be an explanation for these patterns and deserves to be more thoroughly examined for a better understanding of the challenges to online learning. A group of researchers from the US, Colombia, and China recently attempted to determine the qualities of self-efficacy as they relate to online learning and student satisfaction.
<p>

In this study, experts in online teaching interviewed 406 undergraduate and graduate students from two universities in the Midwestern US on 120 survey items to assess the six dimensions of self-efficacy pertaining to completing courses, self-regulating, and interacting and socializing with peers and instructors. Students were asked to rank their confidence in completing different tasks associated with online learning as well as their satisfaction with accomplishing those tasks. Of the demographic data collected, gender of participating students was evaluated as a possible factor affecting self-efficacy.
<p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results of this study reveal that self-efficacy in online learning is multi-dimensional, with a complex relationship of intertwining factors affecting a students’ attitude toward their own abilities in online classes. Overall, gender was found to be a significant predictor of self-efficacy with regards to completing online courses, handling tools in a CMS, and interacting with instructors – female students scored higher in all of these areas. This may imply that generally female students take a more active approach to their learning and seek more assistance. 
<p>
The study also found that academic status was not a significant predictor of self-efficacy for completing an online course, nor interacting socially with peers and instructors, although graduate students did score higher than undergraduates when asked about their confidence in using CMS tools. The number of online courses previously taken by students was a better predictor of peer and instructor interactions, indicating that students who have more experience with online platforms are more likely to collaborate with others academically. Also, students who were able to interact with their classmates predicted a higher learning satisfaction. While these relationships are noteworthy, there was no explanation for variance in self-efficacy when multiple factors were considered at once, including the combination of gender, number of online classes, and academic status. 

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Recognizing factors that affect student learning in online classes is the first step towards developing practices to encourage students. The authors of this paper suggest that by creating an active social presence, instructors may decrease student anxiety about completing assignments and engaging with others. Professors can increase student participation by regularly monitoring progress and offering immediate feedback, support, and encouragement. Establishing online orientations, discussion boards, and guidelines for interaction may enhance not only students’ perceptions of their abilities, but ultimately their success.
