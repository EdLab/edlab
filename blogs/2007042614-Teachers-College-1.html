          <p>
            I'm sure few missed it, but Teachers College was recently ranked the <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/news/article.htm?id=6096#1">#1</a> school of education by U.S. News & World Report.  As I read some of the coverage, I couldn't help but think back to some of the issues that Gary raised <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/1079">back in February</a>, particularly the notion that TC now faces competitors not located among the universities and colleges considered by the magazine.  We know from Arthur Levine's <a href="http://www.edschools.org/">work</a> that education schools are facing an influx of non-traditional competition (for-profit providers, non-profit organizations, community colleges, etc.) in the teacher preparation market - clearly the economic foundation of education schools and certainly a considerable source of revenue here at the college.  I wonder: Is TC taking such emergent competition seriously?  Or, sitting atop a circumscribed ranking platform, does it feel immune to the hype?

Many universities and colleges are taking competition seriously.  They are responding to rising costs, higher expectations, and fiercer competition for top students by engaging in marketing and CRM (customer relationship management).  They are also investing in technology to help drive and improve instruction, organize content, and streamline administrative services.  They are leveraging institutional data in ways that allow them to recruit, retain, and secure loyalty from students and alumni.  They see such activity as an important part of higher education in the 21st century.  These universities are developing data-based institutional strategies.  Is TC?

As a student, it's hard to tell.  President Fuhrman has <a href="http://www.tc.edu/news/article.htm?id=5915">spoken publicly</a> about the need to "streamline governance" and TC is importing external reviewers to assess the administrative efficiency of the college (as a whole) and its departments.  These are important measures to be taken.  They work to ensure that the college is cost-competitive.  But more than operations needs to be addressed - and it needs to be addressed internally (or at least continually) rather than through a one-off consulting study.  Is this being done?  Are there plans in the making?  One who consults the website for TC's <a href="http://www.tc.edu/administration/inst-studies/">Office of Institutional Studies</a> would have entirely no idea, for the site has not been updated in more than six years.  

I mean no offense, but I value Teachers College and think some serious organizational questions need to be dealt with if Teachers College wants to retain its reputation in the education sector.  For example, Teachers College needs to find ways to communicate better with its students, almost three-quarters of which are part-time and on campus infrequently.  To communicate better with potential, current, and former students, student profile data needs to be leveraged systematically, through a unified system or portal, enabling the college to send personalized messages to students, putting an end to the 10,000th mass email that no one reads or cares to pay attention to.  It also needs to start seeing <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/oess/index.asp?Id=OESS+Departments&Info=OESS+Departments">marketing</a> as more than "strategies used to recruit a large pool of prospective students until they enroll at TC".  When it comes to higher education, marketing and personalized outreach must occur across a student's lifecycle, from recruitment, to admission and retention, and then finally through continuing education and alumni relations.  These institutional strategies (and many others) must be taken in order to ensure that Teachers College engages the best students, exceeds their expectations - and does so efficiently.   
    
The school that is ranked the number one school of education in the next 5, 10, or 20 years will recognize that changes in the education sector change the marketplace in which education schools operate.  Will TC be that school?
