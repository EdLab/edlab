Calling all EdLabbers:
Please send me a list of all of your CAS application usernames (e.g. Vialogues, New Learning Times, Survey SideKick, Data Dashboard, Research Broker, Pundit, EdNode). 

I'm looking for primary usernames and alternates, including IDs you may have generated for test purposes.

Please email lists to mh3426@tc.columbia.edu with subject "CAS usernames".

As for the rest of the post, some didactics then some questions.  Thanks!

"Big Data" is a staple in the headlines, usually capping a column on what to do with the innumerable bytes we've been generating since the dawn of the digital age.

I know what you're thinking: are we experiencing Socratic inquiry at the societal level? Maybe.

The conversation below the fold often runs to machine learning algorithms; we want to teach the computers to teach us about ourselves, and about each other. This is lofty stuff, maybe even when we're just trying to make money, boost traffic, or identify marginal needs in the data population. As more institutions digitize their data stores, the data set we're teaching those computers to crawl is an ever-closer approximation to the compendium of human knowledge and experience.

Maybe.

Like anyone online since the mid-90s, I know a bot. A bot is usually a macro or machine algorithm for exploiting an information ecosystem, to control digital resources or manipulate traffic. Most of the time, this is done while masquerading as a legitimate human user. Though occasionally benevolent in the IRC channels of yore, most bots worth talking these days about are a little more insidious (or at least annoying). 

Bots might be found in a black-hat tactician's SEO toolbox, pumping traffic to a junk website to generate ad revenue (and boosting a site's rating -- a neat by-product). Another bot might be used in a DDoS attack, requesting so much of a data server that the server gives up. In both of these cases, users at large lose time trying to access the content they're looking for. Usually, we find a way to work around. In the world of web search, some ubiquitous providers have stepped up efforts not to be evil by tooling their algorithms to guide users to good content and avoid garbage. But what of the damage already done? 

The quest for massive self-awareness hits a roadblock. Bot footprints are everywhere, a legacy inherited by frustrated data scientists and pokey web-development folks alike.

In ascending order of vagueness:
What are some data science strategies for working around the massive amounts of bot data? Especially, what methods take assessment of data quality out of the hands of human analysts?

How much loss of real (human) data should be tolerated when removing artificially generated (bot) data? Does the question change when one considers the proportion of world finance transactions now performed algorithmically?

Does fostering self-awareness in our machines affect awareness of ourselves?

Feel free to wax poetic in the comments.
