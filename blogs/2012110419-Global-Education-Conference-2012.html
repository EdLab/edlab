<i>We hope that educators will come away inspired from their experiences within the conference and that they will have developed enough confidence to try and connect their classrooms to others around the world.</i>

<b>Open Invitation to Collaborate</b><br>
Many recent educational and technology-focused groups have attempted free, virtual conferences, including event co-founder, Steve Hargadon’s <a href="http://www.classroom20.com/page/2012-learning-2-0-virtual-conference">of Learning 2.0 conference</a>.  However,<a href="http://www.globaleducationconference.com/"> Global Education Conference 2012 (GEC)</a>, which will be held this November 12-16th, is one of the first virtual conferences to completely remove traditional barriers-to-participation.  From cost (the event is free), to attendee credentials (the event is open to unregistered participants) and presentations (open to any proposal), GEC promises to be a truly "open" model of virtual conferencing.  <a href="http://lucygrayconsulting.com/about.php">Lucy Gray</a> (see exclusive interview with Ms. Gray below) describes this goal to New Learning Times, "As long as you can connect to the internet and propose a session that’s related to our mission, you are welcome to present!"  Held for the second year, continuously over the course of 5 days via <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx">Blackboard’s Collaborate platform</a>, the virtual conference aims to create an un-gated, global community and conversation around education.  However, with this intention comes an unusual set of challenges, namely, that people expect a more typical conference experience.  Gray explains, "Our biggest challenges are related to how people traditionally perceive conferences. It’s hard for some to understand that we are not a physical event and that we are not charging for admission."  Beyond exceeding participant expectations, the conference will be held for the first time, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.iearn.org/">iEARN’s ’s virtual (and in-person) worldwide conference and Youth Summit,</a> and in conjunction with <a href="http://iew.state.gov/">International Education Week</a>. 
<p>
 
<b>Uniquely Empowering</b><br>
This year’s GEC will include conference "strands" focused on "teachers, students, curriculum, policies, professional development and leadership."  Additional topics include "game design" sponsored by <a href="http://www.brainpop.com/">BrainPOP</a> and "technology-driven innovation" co-sponsored by <a href="http://getideas.org/">Cisco’s GetIdeas.org</a> and <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/">EdSurge</a>.  Beyond, unique tech-focused themes and low barriers to participation, the conference founders hope to empower and inspire participants to increase their engagement with technology.  Tutorials on how to present virtually using conference technologies are available, paired with a suite of support resources, including online mentorship and volunteer moderators for each presentation.  These resources are especially important because for many presenters this is the first time they will interact online at this level of complexity.  Gray explains to New Learning Times, "Many participants are hesitant about presenting if they’ve not done a lot of webinars previously, but once they’ve been through our training sessions and the presenting experience, they are really glad they tried this and seem to be more confident."  Additionally, participants are encouraged to promote their own presentations on social networks, explore new resources and make new connections.  This "network effect" will be facilitated by the conference’s unique utilization of both Blackboard Collaborate, which allows for live-streamed presentations that can be watched at any time and the <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning platform</a> for social networking.  Beyond creating a supportive online space for first-timers to present virtually and an online environment for the sharing of presenter and participant resources, the conference founders hope that participants will come-away from the experience more receptive to integrating technology in their classrooms and to connecting their students to the rest of the world.  Gray and Hargadon are helping to facilitate this move towards a truly "connected" global classroom, one un-conference at a time.

<b>NLT Exclusive Interview with
Lucy Gray, Co-founder of Global Education Conference </b>
<p>
<b>How is this conference unique in the virtual conferencing space?</b><br>

Our conference is unique in that we are organizing a free event that takes place for five days around the clock in order to accommodate all time zones. We also make the barriers to participation as low as possible. As long as you can connect to the internet and propose a session that’s related to our mission, you are welcome to present!
<p>
The philosophy about participation driving our conference is also different. We want to empower educators and organizations to get the word out about their good work. We provide the time, place and mechanism for this, but presenters need to take charge of the proposal process, booking their own sessions through Google Calendar and a tool called <a href="http://youcanbook.me">You Can Book Me</a>, and by publicizing their sessions via social media. Many participants are hesitant about presenting if they’ve not done a lot of webinars previously, but once they’ve been through our training sessions and the presenting experience, they are really glad they tried this and seem to be more confident. It’s very exciting to see how people react to the experience.
<p>
<b>What do you and the conference founders hope that educators will gain from the conference that they can translate into how they teach?</b><br>

Steve Hargadon and I are the founders of the conference. We hope that educators will come away inspired from their experiences within the conference and that they will have developed enough confidence to try and connect their classrooms to others around the world. It is our intention that they will find more experienced educators to follow, existing group projects to join, and will ponder how they are supporting students in the development of global competency.
<p>
<b>What might a student/learner gain from "attendance?"  Parent?</b><br>

If you are a student, and I’m assuming you mean a student in grades K-20, you’ll learn from other students who are presenting about their work, particularly through the iEARN side of the conference entitled the iEARN Annual Conference and Youth Summit.  There are two parts to the conference; the regular Global Education Conference and the iEARN Annual Conference and Youth Summit, which is normally a face-to-face event. iEARN ran into some logistical issues this year with their conference, and decided to see how a virtual conference might enhance their work.
<p>
Within the student strand of the regular Global Education Conference, students will learn about how other kids around the world are taking action to change the course of this planet. Student voice is really important in global education because they are our future, and we want to make sure that they are part of the current revolution that’s taking place in education.
<p>
<b>What are the unique challenges of hosting a conference that is open to such a wide range of participants?</b><br>

Our biggest challenges are related to how people traditionally perceive conferences. It’s hard for some to understand that we are not a physical event and that we are not charging for admission. You don’t even really have to register to attend, and that throws people for a loop. We also have issues with language barriers, and with people being overwhelmed with information on our web site. We’re trying to keep things simple, but it’s challenging for people to read through our materials and grasp how this conference works and looks.
<p>
Once people actually participate, though, they get the hang of how things look and work and they can’t get enough. We do our best to support new attendees by having our international advisory board leadership team answer questions in our discussion forums and by providing a virtual help lounge staffed by volunteers during the event itself. Each conference session also has a trained moderator to help presenters and attendees alike.
<p>
<b>What technologies are you using that will help to overcome this issue/benefit of scale and accessibility?</b><br>  

We use Blackboard Collaborate as our video conferencing platform and our community network uses the Ning platform.  Generally speaking, Blackboard Collaborate works well in low bandwidth situations and we advise people not to use webcam capabilities, which can require more bandwidth on the part of the participant. Of course, there are still some areas of the world where connectivity is an issue, and we haven’t figured out a great way to overcome that barrier. All sessions are recorded and can be accessed later if participants are unable to attend live sessions. We also encourage our presenters to post additional resources on our conference web site.
<p>
Ning has been a very useful tool for encouraging community engagement, sharing resources and providing a space to host our basic conference information. It’s also very customizable so that we can control its design.
<p>
<b>How will you partner with and incorporate iEARN into the conference?</b><br>

iEARN has been instrumental in bringing more people to our community, particularly from areas of the world where it’s been more difficult to connect with educators and organizations. They have been heavily involved with the sponsorship, planning and execution of our conference for the past two years, and this year, they’ve added to the mix by hosting their annual conference and youth summit at the same time. I don’t think they’ll ever abandon their face-to-face events, but this is a nice supplement to what they already do well. I hope to see them continue to be involved in the annual GEC AND host their face-to-face events.
