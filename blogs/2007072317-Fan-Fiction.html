          <p>
            In recent years, a new phenomenon has surged through the internet. Countless fans who have become unhappy with the storylines in their favorite TV shows, cartoons or books, have decided to take matters into their own hands. Fan fiction (better known as fanfic or ff on the web) is the work of a fan written within the context of the universe of a particular book, TV show or cartoon. It can easily be described as amateur work in which the characters and situations come entirely from the original work of some other (often well-known) writer. Although its popularity has soared thanks to websites like <a href=http://www.fanfiction.net/> Fanfiction.net </a>, fan fiction, as fiction written by fans of an original work (ahem obviously), has been around for much longer than the internet. 
<p>
As early as the 17th Century, fan fiction was apparent in unauthorized sequels publications to Miguel de Cervantes' <i> Don Quixote</i>. Parodies of Lewis Carroll's <i> Alice in Wonderland </i> in the 19th Century also showed glimmers of what would become fan fiction. However, it wasn't until <a href=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/index.html> Star Trek </a> in the 1960s that fan fiction in relation to a fan base became widely popular. The 1970s also saw the creation of fanzines for Trekkies as well as <a href=http://www.starwars.com/> Star Wars </a> fans. Since the advent of the World Wide Web, fan fiction has become extensively widespread throughout the world.  Due to the increasing number of internet users, archive websites were created to hold wide-ranging stories and topics. In 1998, <a href=http://www.fanfiction.net/> Fanfiction.net </a> was founded as an automated fan fiction archive website that held a variety of stories categorized into Anime/Manga, Books, Cartoons, TV Shows, Movies, Comics, Miscellaneous, and Games. 
<p>
Spreading into a variety of genres (such as Romance, Mystery, Song, Crossover), fan fiction has given a new life to original works. For example, the <a href=http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/> Harry Potter </a> fan fiction found on the internet today has expanded the series to often unimaginable proportions with fans of the series elaborating on sub-plots often completely changing the direction in which its author, <a href=http://www.jkrowling.com/> J.K. Rowling </a>, has driven the plot. In addition, the creation of “ships” (that is to say, relationships, but that is entirely too long to type out) with Rowling's characters has produced an entirely new storyline in the Potter world, this including “Slash fics” which incorporate romance between members of the same sex. Some deranged <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/258> fans </a> really believe the plot would work out with their imagined (relation-) ships. (Ahem, Draco/Hermione much?) 
<p>
Despite the many warped (yet creative!) ideas lurking around the fan fiction realm, it seems to be a very positive source for imagination that, although originally inspired by the author, becomes genuinely inherent in the fan fic writer. An entirely more positive pastime than playing videos games (although there are <a href=http://www.larasanctuary.com/fanfiction/index.html> Tomb Raider fics </a> for all you gamers out there).
