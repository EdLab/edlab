<p>Traffic fatalities are consistently a leading cause of death across age groups. With high rates of smartphone ownership and teens obsessed with using them even while driving, an already dangerous road situation can quickly go out of control. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dmv-genius-free-drivers-practice/id513850893?mt=8">DMV Genius</a> is a free app that helps learners prepare for the written portion of their driving test and makes future road trips a safer and happier experience. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>DMV Genius offers its testing services across all 50 states. The home page is like your car dashboard; it gives you easy access to all of the app’s testing options. At the top of the screen, choose your preferred type of exam depending on your confidence level: Easy, Hard, Hardest, or Exam Mode. The first three types are preparatory in nature and include hints, while the fourth kicks the pace into high gear, mimicking rough and bumpy exam conditions ahead. </p>

<p>Testing assessment is straightforward. Instant feedback lets you know if you chose correctly or not, as well as why or why not. At the bottom of the interface, you can ask for hints when you reach a traffic jam of tough questions, helping you ease into the fast lane of driving success. </p>

<p>The color scheme is pleasant, readable white text against either a golden border or blue background. Interactivity is responsive and icons sized appropriately. The user interface is straightforward. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>DMV Genius may be <i>too</i> no-frills compared to apps with über-interactivity and glossy finishes. Unfortunately, there is no background music or swoosh sounds when transitioning between screens. There are also no response sounds (e.g., bell rings for a correct choice, or horn honks for incorrect). Basically, you pick a question, read multiple-choice responses, choose an answer, and move on slowly, one question after another, like bumper-to-bumper traffic. Each test has at least 40 questions (and as many as 300); you become fatigued and want to pull over for a proverbial rest stop. </p>
 
<p>One issue with DMV Genius is that some of its functions are a little misleading. Specifically, the Hint function isn’t always useful. Unfortunately, they are sometimes not simple suggestions, but instead directions to the correct answer. For example, in a speed limit question with four possible responses, the hint is "The lowest speed of all!" As you might imagine, it’s not hard figuring out the correct response. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>DMV Genius could be a useful supplement when studying for your written driving exam. Although the questions seem appropriate, the app is not certified by a formal agency. DMV Genius could make paper-and-pencil studying less boring, although it is not a dynamic experience. Much like driving alone with unremarkable scenery, using DMV Genius can become a little boring. </p>
