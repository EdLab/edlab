<p><i>"MindSumo connects companies with a community of 300,000 college students to work on challenges that impact the world."</i> (<a href="https://www.mindsumo.com/business/about">About MindSumo</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Mutually Benefiting Students and Companies</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mindsumo.com/challenges">MindSumo</a> acts as a bridge between companies and millennials. Founded in 2011 and based in San Francisco, MindSumo pays students to come up with solutions to real problems businesses face. Companies bring their challenges to MindSumo, which then invites all members of its community to offer innovative solutions. The top-ranked contributions get monetary prizes, ranging from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p><b>Difficult Challenges, Innovative Solutions</b></p>
 
<p>So far, over 400 companies have used the MindSumo platform, including nearly 80 Fortune 500 companies, among them Microsoft and Target. Altogether, these businesses have presented over 1,000 challenges to students. Some examples include asking students to propose a new twist on a carbonated beverage for millennials, and to propose a smart hygienic product (smart toilet paper, anyone?) that will make consumers’ lives easier.</p>
 
<p>Challenges remain open for 30 days and usually garner about 100 responses. While MindSumo screens the submissions, companies get to choose their favorites, which then receive money for their efforts. While companies receive creative, high-quality solutions from fresh minds, college students receive extra money to help pay their way through school. MindSumo doesn’t expect students to present million dollar ideas, but they hope students develop solutions they are proud to present to an executive or add to their portfolios. And with nearly 300,000 students registered on MindSumo, the group continues to grow, all while college students develop their problem-solving skills and companies solve their trickiest problems.</p>
