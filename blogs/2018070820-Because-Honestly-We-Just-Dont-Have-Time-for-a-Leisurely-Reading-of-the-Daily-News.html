<p>Built by <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>, <a href="https://sip.fyi/">Sip Stories</a> is a free app that delivers the day’s most important tech news and stories to your phone daily. Sip curates headlines and one-liners of recent news articles, and allows the user to tap through highlights or read the full story from a major news source.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Though long-form news stories are important, it is nice to have a resource that provides succinct recaps you can consume in less than a minute. Sip does a great job of combining Tweets, quotes, images, reviews, and summaries from a variety of sources so that you feel like you’re getting a holistic, complete picture of an issue very quickly. This act of synthesis saves so much time for anyone in the tech industry who wants to know the latest without getting bogged down in details.</p> 

<p>Sip’s design is clever, and not at all obnoxious, which seems rare for most news apps these days. Notifications are infrequent, and always silent. When you first download the app, you are told, "Now, close this app. Go about your day. We’ll let you know when something incredible happens." There is no stressful sense of urgency to constantly check for updates, and when you do, you are greeted with single sentences to tap through that lay out the stories of the day.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While I like the ability to quickly tap through information, tweets, and images, I wish this app were slightly more intuitive. For example, I found myself accidentally tapping too fast and wishing I could go back to briefly review the previous slide, but because my instinct was to swipe, I didn’t realize until a few days into using the app that tapping on the left versus the right side of the screen affects what content you view. Also, the ability to skip over a story would be nice if you’re simply not interested and would like to go on to the next headline without tapping through the details.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Ultimately, I think Sip Stories has a lot to offer. Its audience is specific, but important, and likely in need of a service that Sip can provide. With its streamlined design and focused goal, it is a resource users will come to have a steady, but healthy, reliance on.</p>
