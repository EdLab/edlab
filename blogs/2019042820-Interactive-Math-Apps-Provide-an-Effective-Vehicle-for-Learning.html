<p>Developing basic math skills is essential for long-term educational success. Yet many students seem to struggle to build a foundational knowledge of basic math facts and concepts. Interactive math apps promise new opportunities for students to get individualized and targeted practice to learn those basic skills. What impact could this technology have in a classroom setting? <p>
 
<p>In a randomized controlled trial of 389 children aged 4-5 years, researchers at the University of Nottingham investigated this question. Over a 12-week period, children learned in one of three conditions: spending time with the app during free play, spending time with the app instead of other group math activities, and only engaging in standard math practice . As the primary intervention, this study used two tablet apps developed by<a href="https://onebillion.org/"> onebillion</a>, an educational nonprofit organization that aims to teach core concepts such as numbers, shapes, and measurements. </p>
 
<p>Before and after the intervention, participants took a standardized paper-based math assessment. Results showed that in both situations in which students used the interactive app, they had better math achievement than those who did not. It didn’t make a significant difference if time with the app replaced other activities or was provided as a supplement. </p>

<p>The results indicate that interactive math apps could represent efficient tools to support early math instruction. However, it’s important to emphasize that any app utilized should be well-designed and based on supported pedagogical theory. Otherwise, it’s unlikely that these results will be recreated.   </p>
