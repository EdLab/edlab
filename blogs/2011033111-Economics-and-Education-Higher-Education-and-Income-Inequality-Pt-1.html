            Google "Higher Education & Income Inequality" and you can read about how higher education explains most of the rise in income inequality. I do not doubt this fact, but I have a problem with the policy prescription that comes with such research, namely that if more students go to college, income inequality will decline. 

This strikes me as largely untrue. In fact, I would argue undergraduate education in many cases <b>increases income inequality</b>. Yeah, I said it. (Although no one has done the necessary research on this...yet)

Much of the rise in income inequality via higher education has come as a result of the rise in the professional class. The educational investment needed to become a doctor or a lawyer is indeed higher than most professions, as are the wages that come as a result of such investment. The same is starting to happen for other professions, particularly in finance with the rise in prominence of a masters of business administration. Yet notice that in the U.S., as opposed to most other countries, an undergraduate education is necessary for an M.D., J.D., or an M.B.A.

Unfortunately, there are only a finite number of MDs, largely the result of the American Medical Association lobbying to limit the number of medical seats available each year. Likewise, there are only a finite number of lawyers needed, as given by the high unemployment rate for recently graduated law school students. Given the trend in finance toward choosing from elite schools almost exclusively, only those limited few at elite schools can lay claim to high-paying careers in high finance. More people going to college in order to work in each of these respective fields does not magically yield more jobs in these fields.
