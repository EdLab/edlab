<p><i>"We hope and intend that the work of our Digital Ready schools will be used to create a model for student-centered school change that can be adapted for different types of schools throughout New York City and beyond."</i> (from <a href="http://digitalready.net/">Digital Ready</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="http://digitalready.net/">Digital Ready</a> is a program that works to customize professional development plans for schools and educators to help increase student-centered learning, academic success, and college and career readiness. Digital Ready in particular specializes in supporting schools to become more innovative in their approaches, for example, through design thinking, a method that uses rapid prototyping to facilitate creative change and innovation.</p>

<p>The Digital Ready team also develops school-specific plans that help the schools manage the change. They aim to streamline change pathways around four levers: curriculum, teaching, assessment, and expanded learning opportunities. These levers help add clarity to the process and allow schools to understand how they can support learning in and outside the classroom. Schools typically assign small teams to work with Digital Ready, and these small teams interact and collaborate with other small teams from local schools. </p>

<p><b>Pedagogical Visions</b><br>
At Digital Ready technology is viewed as uniquely suited to address student learning needs. Schools are the sites where teachers can leverage data to personalize learning, make use of Open Educational Resources to provide more relevant materials to students and design technology supported project-based learning opportunities that align with the Common Core to support student achievement.  One of the aims of the program is that students take ownership over their learning and feel engaged in classroom experiences. "I’ve come to believe that delight can basically serve as a Geiger counter for good practice around student ownership of learning," <a href="http://digitalready.net/the-big-idea-student-centered-learning-in-new-york-city-high-schools/">shares</a> Joy Nolan, Instructional Designer/ Curriculum Specialist for Digital Ready. To support this aim, Digital Ready supports the use of formative assessment techniques, such as digital portfolios, so that students feel engaged in their own assessment.</p>

<p><b>Future Prospects</b><br>
Developed in partnership with NYC Department of Education’s Office of Post Secondary Readiness and the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, Digital Ready seeks to transform the way teaching and learning happens using technology to place the student at the center. Currently, Digital Ready offers three quarterly meetings, a weeklong professional development workshop, and a Digital Ready Summer Institute. In the 2015-2016 academic year, Digital Ready will be working with 30 New York City based schools. The goal is to work with more schools and promote the professional development model to schools across the country. </p>
