<a href="http://crl.acrl.org/content/72/4/316.full.pdf+html">Herrera, G. (2011). Google Scholar Users and User Behaviors: An Exploratory Study. <i>College & Research Libraries</i>, 72(4), 316-330.</a>

This study examines five years of usage statistics from the <a href="http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/general_library/">University of Mississippi</a> system focusing on Google Scholar and other databases. Though Google Scholar does not provide usage statistics to schools, the University of Mississippi library was able to examine student access through the library website and access to its databases in the same fashion as its subscriptions.

<b>Description:</b>
The author supplemented the data gathered with literature on the usability of Google Scholar in comparison to subscription database providers EBSCO and Web of Knowledge. In usability studies cited by the author, traditional databases were less familiar and more difficult to use than Google Scholar, especially for undergraduates. The author identified some commonly cited objections to the use of GS in libraries, like foreign language support and citation manager compatibility, but these were largely resolved by GS during the course of the study. It's clear from the literature examined that Google Scholar has become an important gateway to databases and first resource for many students and researchers. 

The data gathered by the University of Mississippi was meant to identify disciplines and groups of students that used Google Scholar most frequently and determine if they were relying on GS alone for research. The data examined click-throughs of GS hosted library subscription materials as well as student access to GS through the library homepage. The author found that 76% of users were using GS in addition to library subscription databases, but a much smaller contingent of GS users were augmenting with non-immediate resources like interlibrary loan and the p-book catalog. The data shows a library population reaching out to GS, but willing to seek library subscription databases and materials as long as they are instantly available. 

The author also found greater use of both GS and traditional e-databases among science and social science students. She theorizes that students in the humanities are still finding relevant physical resources in the library, but that eventually all disciplines will look first and foremost for instantly available electronic resources. A small contingent of users, mostly graduate students in the sciences and social sciences, seemed attached to particular items and articles over instant accessibility and were willing to choose ILL. Among those users who sought ILL for specific items, many returned to do so again. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The moral of this story is meeting users where they are. Google Scholar has been growing into an effective search strategy and one that often leads users towards a cornucopia of information comprised of library licensed and freely available content. GS has already made some technologies, like citation databases, obsolete and it will be an important user channel to monitor for the future development of our electronic resources. It will also become important to teach to GS in future bibliographic instruction. 

The other tale told by this study is of increasing hunger for immediately available content. Most users were unwilling to pursue strategies like ILL or the traditional catalog over instantly accessible content and those who did seemed to be prolific users of library resources with specific goals and well-entrenched search strategies.
