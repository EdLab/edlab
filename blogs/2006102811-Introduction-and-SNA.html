            Hi, its nice to be a new member of the EdLab community.  In addition to my dissertation and NED, I have been thinking about the state of Social Network Analysis tools. SNA is only going to grow in popularity as an analytic technique.  But I can remember as a newbie being struck by the fragmented state of tools, and the lack of a comprehensive, easy to use, application for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing social network data. 

<!--break-->

As I think about my own research, there are eight functional capabilities that I've had to cobble together from different apps:
 
1. Collect — Capabilities for collecting social network data such as generating paper-based and Web-based survey instruments (hosted as a Web service), as well as perhaps downloading existing social network data from popular consumer sites and enterprise collaboration systems such as email.  
 
2. Input — Capabilities for entering social network data either through importation, fresh entry via a basic spreadsheet, or a graphical point and click wizard (e.g. Walsh's Classroom Sociometrics).
 
3. Manage — Capabilities for managing datasets (e.g. merge, split), as well as more specialized techniques such as transposing data, and making valued relationships dichotomous or directional relationships symmetrical.
 
4. Analyze — Capabilities to run a core set of the most common analyses typically run on network data (e.g. density, centrality, blockmodels, n-Cliques) using algorithms that are currently available only through fragmented software packages (e.g. UCINET, Pajek, KliqueFinder).  Where appropriate, multiple measures for a common concept should be offered. And all analyses should share a common look and feel, work off of a common active data set, and generate standardized outputs to report results.
 
5. Test — Capabilities for conducting statistical significance tests of social networks.  Also support the use of social network data as explanatory variables in more traditional regression-based analyses such as in SPSS and SAS.  As such, include integration bridges with the major statistical software packages and support of their file formats. 
 
6. Visualize —Capabilities for visualizing social network data drawing on the active data set and related outputs used in other part of the applications (e.g. Netdraw). 
 
7. Collaborate — Capabilities for group workflow and the ability for teams of users to work with a common data set.  Research projects often involve multiple individuals working with a data set, and multiple datasets that relate to one another but have been fragmented based on the needs of different individuals.  As a Web 2.0 application, a comprehensive tool could enable this type of collaboration.  
 
8. Program — Capabilities for accessing and manipulating its standard algorithms, developing new capabilities as extensions, and bypassing wizards and ease-of-use GUI limitations for power users.  

I know UCINET does a lot of this.  And some of the “rawnessâ€? of GUI's is due to the need for the researcher to make thoughtful choices about their models.  But it seems to me that something like what I've described above can and should evolve if SNA is to be a more accessible theory-based method for researchers interested in their substantive research interests, not SNA per se.  Ease of use and comprehensiveness.  

I remember using Bank Street Writer as a kid.  Would be neat if one day TC SNA became the SNA app for mere mortal academics and practioners.

Just a thought.  Look forward to meeting everyone soon.
