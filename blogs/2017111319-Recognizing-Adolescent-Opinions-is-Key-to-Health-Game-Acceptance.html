<p>Adults discuss tobacco-related issues in accusatory and exaggerated ways, according to adolescents in a study exploring the role of digital games in tobacco-related health literacy. "The most important thing," a ninth grader told researchers, when asked how to include tobacco-related information in a mobile game, "is that cigarettes and snus [an upper lip tobacco product] use are not the main things of the game, because then it doesn’t interest anyone." Neither should health games contain "things related to smokers that adolescents admire, such as money, good looks, fancy cars, or beautiful people around them,’’ said a seventh grader.</p>
 
<p>The two-phase study used an open-ended questionnaire (phase one) to ask 83 seventh to ninth graders, (13 to 16 years) about their experiences of tobacco-related health education, and 39 focus groups (phase two) with fourth to sixth graders (10–13 years) to acquire opinions on the health game, Fume, which was in development. Both groups pointed out that acceptability of theory-based health games can be achieved by investing in high-quality design features, such as advanced graphics and versatile content, with funny or stimulating elements and sufficiently challenging gameplay.</p>
 
<p>The results supported the theory that early adolescence provides an important period for tobacco-preventive interventions, since tobacco use is still rare among 11-year olds. Even with decreasing rates of cigarette smoking, 15 year-old girls (11%) and boys (12%) smoke at least once a week, and use of electronic cigarettes is associated with increased intention to smoke among adolescents who have never smoked. The authors say more research is needed to develop new intervention methods that are optimally effective for both genders.</p>
