            <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/07/14/south.sudan.un/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">South Sudan is the youngest country</a> in the world; a country that celebrated its independence only last week. It faces a lot of difficulties building a whole new country from the very beginning in an area still lacking fundamental facilities. Only a minimum number of South Sudanese citizens can read (lack of education) and the country still fears the conflicts that may arise as it grows from its northern neighbors. The new nation was born from one of the longest civil wars ever (leading to approximately two million deaths). South Sudan became its own country after the civil war ended in a ceasefire in 2005 when the Sudan People's Liberation Movement entered into a peace talk with the Sudan Government, agreed on the peace pact, campaigned for a referendum and following an overwhelming majority obtained Khartoum's (capital of Sudan) imprimatur to form the separate state.

Salva Kiir, the first president of South Sudan, has urged his country to join hands in a struggle to move forward through sacrifices, and he is also hoping that his government remain committed in the fight against corruption. After South Sudan became independent, their national soccer team played their first ever international game against Tusker F.C from Kenya. In almost every African country, soccer is symbolized as a source of happiness, and it always bring people together in a good manner so that they can celebrate their achievements and South Sudan is no exception despite its role as a new nation.
