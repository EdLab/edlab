<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scholastic-ereading-app-the/id491014756?mt=8">Storia</a> is an ebook reading application for kids launched by <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/home">Scholastic</a>. Currently, the application can be accessed through Windows PC and iPad, and will be available for Android tablets in the future. With a collection of eBooks recommended by reading experts at Scholastic, Storia allows parents and children to select the books that best fit their age, literacy level, and interest. Want a personalized eBook collection for kids? Try Storia!

<b>Pros:</b>
One of the unique features of Storia is that parents can stay involved with their own view into their child's reading progress. Through the reading reports system, parents can keep track of their kid's reading progress through each book, find out what new words have been learned, how many pages have been read, and how much time was spent reading each day. In addition, through various fun activities embedded in the application, children are able to build up their vocabulary and reading comprehension skills. The animation-filled, game-oriented interface will be extremely intriguing to children.

<b>Cons:</b>
For the time being, Storia could only be accessed through PC and iPad, so there exists a device constraint. But it seems that Scholastic is trying to develop more user platforms in the future.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we think of potential e-publications for mSchool, what kind of features should those publications possess? Shall we embed a feature (like the reading report system) for users to monitor their learning progress? How does the idea of interactive activities sound if we add them into the mSchool textbook? What if the textbook itself is adaptive to individual learners?

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Apart from ebooks, we can also think about other potential e-publications for NLT like e-Journals, e-Magazines, etc.
