            Many would agree that 2012 has certainly been the year of the underdog in the sports world. The year has produced numerous David vs. Goliath instances where the underdog has come out the victor as well as several occasions where a relatively unknown athlete suddenly rises to the top. On the gridiron, the New York Giants made a remarkable run in the NFL playoffs to eventually beat favorites New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. Tebow Mania also swept across the nation as then Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow was able to guide his team into the playoffs against all odds and even manage a playoff win. The basketball ball court saw a remarkable story in that of Jeremy Lin, who experienced a sudden rise to stardom (Linsanity) after unexpectedly putting up all star-esque numbers in successive games.  Finally on the soccer pitch, the Zambian soccer national team (then ranked the 71st best team) pulled off an upset for the ages as they defeated African giants Ivory Coast in the African Cup of Nations Final.

With the 2012 baseball All Star game set to be played tomorrow, it is only right that the remarkable underdog story of New York Mets pitcher R.A Dickey be told. Dickey has taken the baseball world by storm this season by posting chart topping numbers. He currently leads Major League Baseball (MLB) in virtually every pitching category including most wins, strikeouts, one hitters thrown, and complete games.  His signature pitch the knuckleball, which behaves very much like a wiffle ball due to its unpredictability, has been baffling hitters and has become the main instrument behind his success. He will be representing the Mets at this year's All Star game, his first ever appearance in the event in his 17 year playing career.

To fully understand the magnitude of his achievement, one has to look at the road that he took to reach his current status. Dickey has spent the majority of his career playing in the minor leagues (baseball's lower division) beginning with the Texas Rangers. He then bounced from team to team before the Mets decided to sign him to a minor league contract in 2010. The Mets upgraded gave him a major league contract after several outstanding outings in the minor leagues. During his first full season under contract, Dickey had an average season by many standards but nonetheless put up career numbers. His breakthrough season came this baseball campaign as he has been able to master the knuckleball to an art form.  At 37 years of age, Dickey looks to be finishing off his career on a strong note and his story serves as a classic example of the famed quote “It's not about how you start, it's how you finish”. 

Here is an ESPN documentary on Dickey
