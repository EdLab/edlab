            <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en"><strong>President Obama announced a new campaign to improve the participation and performance of America's students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics</strong></a>
<blockquote><em> The White House partners with MacArthur and other education, industry and foundation leaders to improve student performance in math and science; PLUS: a $2 million competition, set to launch next month, will include awards for the creation of new game experiences.</em></blockquote>
<strong> </strong>

<p>The campaign, named  <a title="Educate to Innovate" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate" target="_blank">Educate to Innovate</a>, will emphasize activities outside the classroom and encourage <span style="text-decoration: underline;">partnerships with leading companies, foundations and non-profits</span>. The purpose is to  motivate students to “learn deeply and think critically.”

Included in the campaign is the 2010 <a title="Digital Media and Learning Competition" href="http://dmlcompetition.net/" target="_blank">Digital Media and Learning Competition</a>. Sponsored by the <a title="MacArthur Foundation" href="http://www.macfound.org/" target="_blank">MacArthur Foundation</a> and run by <a title="HASTAC" href="http://www.hastac.org/" target="_blank">HASTAC</a>, the $2 million annual open competition seeks proposals from designers, inventors, researchers and other interested parties in using digital media to transform learning (see a full press release <a title="here" href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.4462309/apps/s/content.asp?ct=7682383" target="_blank">here</a>). The competition starts on Dec. 14 and winners will be announced in Spring 2010.

Any thoughts for the edlab to get involved? Is this competition somehow related to our "Social EdVenture" initiative?<strong> </strong></p>

<strong> Wikipedia co-founder launches YouTube-like website for children</strong>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.watchknow.org">This site</a>, which features videos from National Geographic, YouTube, and Google Videos, among other sources, is intended to compliment and enhance the learning experience for students as they study concepts that are traditionally hard to learn.</blockquote>
I had a look at several high rated videos in language arts and feel the site is still at its initial stage regarding the quantity and quality of videos (at least in language arts). But I have no doubt that the site in the future will be a great resource for parents and students, just imagining how useful they would be for parents who have no idea about how to read with their children at home. Videos in other subjects, such as science, may be also helpful and serve as students' after school tutoring material.
