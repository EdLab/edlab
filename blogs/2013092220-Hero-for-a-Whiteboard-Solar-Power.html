While the vast majority of schools in Sub-Saharan Africa lack electricity, students across poorly-equipped Senegal have become accustomed to their interactive whiteboard. But how could such a bulky, expensive, and energy-reliant piece of equipment exist in so many classrooms in the area? Enter <a href="http://www.cybersmartafrica.org/">CyberSmart Africa</a>, an organization dedicated to reaching the poorest classrooms and supplying them with an affordable 21st century education.  Currently at work at 9 schools in Senegal, CyberSmart Africaâ€™s marquee product, the interactive whiteboard, functions beautifully in the absence of electricity. <p>

Powered simply by one solar panel, the advanced classroom device is as practical as it is portable. The entire board can be broken down in seconds, allowing it to travel from class to class. Students often take the lead in setting up the board without the need of formalized instructions. However, students are not the only ones learning the ways of the whiteboard. As part of the implementation, teachers undergo professional development training that helps them create active, learner-centered environments that incorporate technology. <p>

In what other ways is solar power being utilized in Sub-Saharan Africa (and beyond) to enhance the learning experience? How might schools without resources such as technology and electricity/solar power teach 21st century skills? Share your insight in the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9881">Vialogues. </a><p>

<b>@00:30 JordaJean:</b> It's crazy to think that schools that lack basic amenities (like food, clean water) have an interactive whiteboard inside. Is this where the focus should be? <p>

<blockquote><i>[In response]</i> <b>MartinPaper:</b> I think it's unreasonable to expect one organization to address every need of these schools. This particular organization, in my opinion, is doing a great service for the education of these students. </blockquote> <p>

<b>@00:38 Clark:</b> One of the Thiel Fellows, Eden Full, dropped out of Princeton to bring her solar powered dream to fruition.
