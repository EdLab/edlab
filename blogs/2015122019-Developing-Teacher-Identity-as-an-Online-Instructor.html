<p>Research abounds on the development of teacher identity in K-12 and traditional learning contexts, but there is a gap in the research on how online instructors develop a teacher identity. This qualitative study interviews seven first-time online instructors to understand the "teacher self" in online settings. </p>
 
<p>The researchers develop their idea of teacher identity from literature on K-12 teacher identity that emphasizes the fluid, contextual nature of identity and the idea of teacher as a guide to self-actualization. They also describe the integration of knowledge into daily life from the positions of critical pedagogy and social justice found in literature of curricular theorists such as Freire, Dewey, and Palmer. A convenience sample of seven first-time online instructors, not previously known to the researchers, in different disciplines was used. The researchers collected data through a survey of respondents’ teaching experience as well as interviews at the beginning and end of the course. They use this data to analyze the development of the online instructor’s identity. To do this, the researchers map patterns from coding the data to a framework of the online instructor’s ongoing process of interpreting their experiences, relationships to their teaching context, sub-identities, and agency. </p>
 
<p>Teacher survey responses indicate challenges in experiencing the "joy" of teaching in a context in which they often felt more like a secretary managing student work online. In regards to the process of developing teacher identity, the researchers find online instructors navigating the changes in face-to-face interaction and developing an online teacher identity distinct from their traditional teacher identity. The professional context of their teacher identity involved meeting different challenges of classroom and time management due to the nature of interactions required by an online platform. Similar to traditional teachers, online instructors also had to harmonize sub-identities, but responded to unique challenges including adjusting how they projected their professional presence (such as humor) online, communicating effectively, and establishing rapport with online students. In negotiating their teacher identity through personal agency, online instructors experienced different issues with control of the course curriculum and guidance from mentors. </p>
 
<p>The researchers present a path into an important field for educators to understand as the number of online courses, and thus online instructors, grows. Some factors that influence the development of teacher identity are unique to online courses, while others are variations of challenges that teachers face in traditional learning environments. Their findings point to ways to prepare online instructors, including offering a degree of control over the course, methods for interacting with students, and guidance on the unique elements on online learning. As a result, by incorporating these useful preparation tips, online instructors should be able to improve the quality of their practice as well as continue to develop a productive online identity.</p>
