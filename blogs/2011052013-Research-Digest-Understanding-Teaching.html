            <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=11694">Fenstermacher, G. and Richardson, V. (2005). On Making Determinations of Quality in Teaching.  Teachers College Record 107(1), 186-213</a> 

Review:
Although an ignorant newcomer to this field, I read this paper as a response to, and attack on, the trend towards quantitative evaluation of teacher quality by some appropriately adjusted measure of student achievement. The authors start with an in-depth exploration of the meaning of teaching in an attempt to reach first principles so that, prepared with the truth, we can go back and think more clearly about what teacher quality is and how to evaluate it. 
<!--break-->
At first they offer a philosophical justification for a distinction between “quality” teaching and “successful” teaching.  Quality teaching is a description of the actions and programs of the teacher, successful teaching is a description of student learning.  This distinction allows for the possibility of a good teacher whose efforts are frustrated by factors outside of his or her control.  As they write: “a person may be a good teacher in one context and a mediocre one in different context with virtually no variation in basic pedagogical form from one context to the other.”

Under this framework, our conceptualization of teacher performance must always take into account “the state of the learners, the character of the social surround, and the availability and extent of opportunity.”  After much work distinguishing the two factors of “good teaching,” the paper applies its new understanding to the different explanations available of the process of teaching.  

Teaching as Transition, which begins with successful teaching and tries to work its way back to good teaching.  After developing a list of high-performing classes, researchers on this category attempted to extrapolate from that list a common group of teacher-characteristics and strategies.
Teaching as Cognition, which develops an understanding of good teaching as informed by cognitive science.  The general conclusion is a focus on “expertise” as the vital factor.
Teaching as Facilitation, which places the emphasis on deep learning; developing an individualized educational experience that will enable the student to develop his or her own learning program.  

The purpose of these categorizations is to offer future evaluators of “good teaching” formalized schemes with which to make more precise judgments.  The paper then asks, “what implications follow for policy?”  Due to the complex and interactive nature of teaching, the authors conclude that a teacher can only be evaluated by taking into account the entire context of the learning environment, and developing a holistic understanding of successful teaching.  

Relevance:
I'm not sure if this is any improvement on current value-added models, which certainly attempt to do just that.  The general call for theoretical humility seems justified, but what does an educational researcher, desiring in good faith to take these conclusions on board, do to modify his research program?
