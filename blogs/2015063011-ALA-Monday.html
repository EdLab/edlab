          <p>
            Monday continued with some of the same themes—it seems like the hot topics at this year’s conference were zine-making and data-driven decision-making! By now, everything is starting to blur together (what’s today, today?) but I’m going to try to wrap up what I’ve learned!
<!--break-->
I attended an early panel called <b>Leveraging Your Library's Data for Decision Making, Strategic Planning, and Advocacy</b>, featuring librarians from a variety of backgrounds, including an elementary school librarian, a public library director, and a university library department head. The discussion centered on all the different kinds of data we collect in libraries: door counts, event and program attendance, usage statistics, circulation statistics, website visits… you get the idea. We—libraries in general, including EdLab—collect a <i>ton</i> of data about our patrons. But what are we doing with it? Some of the panel speakers and audience members (during a rousing Q&A) talked about assessing services and strategies with pre- and post-measures—e.g., measuring faculty requests for resources before and after attempting to get the word out about the process in order to assess whether outreach efforts were working, adjusting library staffing and opening hours based on peak student use, and allocating funds and staff time towards resources that patrons were heavily using.

Similarly, <b>Data-Driven Libraries: Capturing Users’ Behavior across Library Platforms</b> was all about using data to improve user experience across library platforms like library discovery interface, library catalogs, subject databases, and others like social media. This panel was almost more of an idea session for the LITA heads of library technology interest group, where we all discussed technologies and best practices for capturing user’s interactions with different kinds of web platforms (catalogs, databases, etc.) There were a few subgroups within the larger group, and a recorder for each subgroup took notes—they said the notes from each subgroup will be emailed to everyone who attended soon, so I should be updated on what each group was talking about in more detail soon!

I also caught a rousing discussion on the perfect pairing of Wikipedia and libraries—specifically, how libraries can use their own resources as Wikipedia citations. There are some potential minefields to avoid, but the strategy benefits everyone: libraries get to surface their own resources via Wikipedia, resulting in huge traffic redirects; Wikipedia gets to build their content on top of a mountain of scholarly research; reference librarians across the same library (or different libraries) don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time someone wants to find materials from other libraries; and people across the world get to discover quality information any time they need it. There was a mention of the National Library of Israel, whose reference librarians actually answer reference questions on Wikipedia for Wikipedia editors/users when they have downtime at their own reference desks in the library. I think they’re the only librarians who have an official policy to answer the world’s reference questions, but it’s interesting to think about what that might mean for libraries in the future. I’ll leave you to ponder some of the big questions discussed (but not fully answered, of course). I think they’re amazing ideas, because I tend to think more high-quality information for everyone is a great goal, but maybe there are some downsides to having everything at everyone’s fingertips all the time—what do you think?

<i> What if every reference in a Wikipedia article had a robust citation including access and reuse status? </i>

<i> What if every library or cultural institution exposed the best research in their field on Wikipedia? </i>

<i> What if every reusable collection was shared on Wikimedia Commons? </i>

<i> What if Wikipedia became the public’s digital reference desk staffed by professional reference librarians?</i>

Finally, I’d love to hear what sounded interesting to you all—I’ve got some D&R fodder up my sleeve already, but I’d really like to deliver something useful for all of you. If you tell me what you’re into, I can try to focus on the sweet spot where the things I learned & ideas we discussed intersect with your own interests!
