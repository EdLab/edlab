(please keep private) 
Kate's thought-provoking <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7636">article</a> about the Wall Street Journal paywall and its implications for New Learning Times got me thinking about the way we handle our subscriptions to this content. It's important to ensure that we're paying for content in a format that encourages community access. Mobile would be ideal, but cost and subscription models ill-suited to library users are barriers to adoption at present. Here's a “state of the subscriptions” for a few key publications: 

<b>New York Times</b> 
We currently offer this title in print and full text 1851-present through our Gale and EBSCO databases. The paysuggestion makes for a good, in-site discovery interface that I suspect many users attempt before searching library holdings. Even still, we've logged nearly 10,000 successful full text article retrievals since January.

As Brian and Kate mentioned, the New York Times does offer a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/account/purchases/group/group-subs.html">group account</a> for web and mobile subscriptions and they offer a discount to educational institutions. The group accounts charge by user and by week and the library would have to distribute admin passwords to interested users. Purchasing the minimum user-base (50) would run us $4,888 for web + smartphone, $6,500 for web + tablet, or $11,388 annually for all web & mobile.  

<b>Wall Street Journal</b>
We currently get the WSJ in print and have access to the electronic version through Columbia's proquest databases. As Kate explained, WSJ is weekly and users are weirdly compelled to purchase print bundled with mobile. It appears that in their corporate subscriptions, users can access web and mobile without print. 

<b>Chronicle of Higher Education</b>
We subscribe to the print edition of the Chronicle in the cafÃ© and have access to a print equivalent digital subscription through EBSCO and Gale that excludes some articles featured on the website. They also offer a completely seamless proxy web-interface for institutions that we can access through Columbia, though tablet access isn't included in this option. The Chronicle's subscription options make the most classical sense, web and tablet are offered together and digital and print together are slightly more expensive than digital alone. 

These options, though they currently present significant barriers for mobile institutional access, are quickly changing and if the NYT is any indication, publications are experimenting with payment and access models. NLT will likely emerge in a far different set of expectations for distribution. My questions around the post-ink subscription model focus on present and future offerings: How do we publicize our current access models to ensure that we're getting full usership and how do we encourage the models that will work for us as an institution? In thinking about NLT, how do we prepare for and model a profitable subscription model that works for individuals and institutions with diverse needs?
