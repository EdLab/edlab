<p><i>"[The Student Room] is [an online] student community that exists for every student to use to support each other – whatever your background. From ... University, to landing a job and everything else life decides to throw at you. The Student Room community is here for you."</i> (<a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/content.php?r=127-about-the-student-room-where-students-connect/">About The Student Room</a>) </p>

<p><b>Helping Students Connect and Communicate</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/">The Student Room</a> (TSR) is an organization that hosts an education-themed website used by over 70% of UK students. Learners come from a broad range of ages, from 12-year-olds all the way up to university level students. Part of the site’s appeal is its comprehensive approach to student life. In short, it allows students to discuss any of their interests. This includes discussion sections regarding careers, entertainment, finances, health, lifestyle, news, relationships, and university applications, in addition to traditional academic matters. As such, if you are a student who is curious about your journey through academia, TSR’s collection of online resources should begin leading you towards the tools you need to succeed. </p>  

<p><b>Run By Students for Students</b></p>

<p>One of the more distinctive features of The Student Room is its student community of over 1.8 million people. Part of the site’s appeal is that TSR chooses model users to become Section Leaders due to their understanding of the site’s underlying mission as well as their demonstrated leadership skills. Because they are members of the community, Section Leaders have intimate knowledge of student issues and help keep discussion on the site positive and nurturing.  </p>

<p><b>Affiliates Foster Learning </b></p>

<p>The Student Room is also affiliated with two other education-based websites aimed at helping students learn. The first, <a href="http://www.markedbyteachers.com/">Marked By Teachers</a> includes a digital library with 150,000 pieces of written work. It includes assignments, coursework, essay exemplars, and essay writing guides. All of this academic work was created by students, but critiqued by certified teachers to help ensure quality. The second affiliated site, <a href="https://getrevising.co.uk/">Get Revising</a>, helps students prepare to study by providing word searches, quizzes, mind maps, flashcards, and crosswords. Also, in keeping with the underlying community ethos, students can share any of the resources they discover online, or ones they create on their own, with their peers. Both of these affiliated sites are intended to promote student learning similar to TSR.

<p><b>A Model for Online Learning?</b></p>

<p>The Student Room leverages its membership to achieve real participation, gives opportunities for peer leadership, and provides learning resources. Its structure successfully includes two different forms of online communities—information sharing and collaboration. In terms of information sharing, TSR’s discussion sections allow students to exchange information in a fluid and timely manner. In terms of collaboration, by having teachers vet student work, it helps to continuously assure valid content. As opposed to more rigidly structured websites where content is exclusively created by adults without student input, the inclusive nature of TSR fosters a community where information is shared collaboratively between peers while still ensuring quality control by adults. The success of TSR offers clues for other student academic sites to improve the utility of their online educational environments and help students learn. </p>
