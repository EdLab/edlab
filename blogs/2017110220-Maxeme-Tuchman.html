Maxeme Tuchman is the CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://caribu.co/">Caribu</a>, an education technology company that helps parents, extended family, and mentors read and draw with children when they’re not in the same location. Tuchman was most recently appointed by President Obama to serve as a White House Fellow at the U.S. Department of the Treasury where she served as a senior policy advisor and worked on issues of financial inclusion. She also served as the Executive Director of Teach For America, Miami-Dade. Prior to that, she served in Mayor Bloomberg’s bullpen where she co-created the NYC Civic Corps. She is a graduate of the Coro Fellowship in Public Affairs and the Miami Fellows Leadership Program, and a current Trustee of the American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora. Tuchman received her B.A. from New College of Florida and holds an M.P.P. from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and an M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Caribu?</b><br>
<p>I’ve worked at almost every level of education from being a public school teacher, Gates Foundation consultant, Executive Director of Teach For America, and as a city, state, and district level education staffer. As a first-generation American and college student, and especially during my time teaching at a Title I high school, I came to the sobering reality that when it comes to building a strong foundation for literacy, the focus must be on 0–7 year olds. Caribu is an education platform that helps parents, extended family, and mentors read and draw with children when they’re not together, therefore increasing the amount of reading time for kids 0–7. We’re like FaceTime meets Kindle, for kids. The result is an engaging livestream shared-screen experience with a bookstore containing hundreds of books, in six languages, from leading children’s publishers, and many educational workbooks with an interactive drawing overlay.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from parents and children who have used Caribu?</b><br>
<p>The response from parents and grandparents has been super positive and we have many loyal and long-standing customers. Parents who work late, travel for work or are legally separated love the fact that they can still read a bedtime story to their kids and make sure their child is getting the recommended minimum of 20 minutes of reading a day. We get lots of messages from active duty military who are excited to have found Caribu, as it’s the best way to do engaging activities with their kids while deployed. Grandparents write in often to tell us how Caribu has helped them build relationships with grandchildren they don’t get to see very often, and the bilingual books have built bridges in multilingual families. Most importantly, children love the design and experience of our platform. They love that they get to do an activity with their family member versus answering a bunch of questions in a Skype call, and they especially love drawing in the workbooks. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Personalized learning: we finally have the opportunity to do one-to-one learning instead of batch processing our kids. To be able to meet a child where they are and remediate or accelerate learning based on their individual learning style and progress will have the most impact in years ahead.</p>

<p><b>In addition to Caribu, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>There’s not a lot of time outside of Caribu to work on much else, but I’m really involved in the startup ecosystem in Miami, and specifically on increasing the number of women and minorities participating in the space.</p>
