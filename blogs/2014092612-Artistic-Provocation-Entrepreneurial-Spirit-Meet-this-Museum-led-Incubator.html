          <p>
            I came across an interesting organization; interesting because of the way they
think about space and research: http://newinc.org/

Their mission, or tagline is, "Fusing artistic provocation with an entrepreneurial spirit to enable ideas that make culture better."

As I explore more, I increasingly feel there is a strong affinity between libraries and centers of design, schools and museums. Though distinct, the parallels are useful for renewing and re-imagining how these spaces could look in the future. Recently I spoke with a design thinking firm in the Netherlands that was inspired by theories of education to re-imagine how designers are taught and how designers work to create design solutions (stay tuned for AmIaDesigner NLT post). I also recently wrote (in press) an NLT Ed Digest on an elementary school using design thinking practices in the curriculum. 

New Inc is the first museum-led incubator that brings together people from a range of different practices to design sustainable solutions.

New Inc's shared workspace also offers professional development opportunities at the intersection of art, technology, and design. The have demo nights, hackathons, and symposiums.

The co-working space was cofounded by Lisa Phillips, Toby Devan Lewis Director, and Karen Wong, Deputy Director of the New Museum and the New Museum board is one of the major supporters of the space and initiative.

New Inc is founded on the belief that museums will have to look different in the future and that part of imagining the future of museums involves bringing together people from a host of backgrounds to design a range of ideas. 

Though an incubator, New Inc sees itself as unique because it has all the resources, people, and space a museum to offer as well.

How is the EdLab like a workspace incubator seeking to re-imagine the future library with all the resources and people of a university attached?

What questions do you have about this space? What would you want to know more about?
