          <p>
            Anyone who has ever taught high school students knows that most teenagers get the vast majority of their information from television and the movies (“Buddhism?  Oh, I already know all about that.  It was on <i>The Simpsons</i>.  Lisa becomes a Buddhist.  She finds out about it from Richard Gere.”).

So, for better or for worse, the TV-watching population of the U.S. will learn a whole lot about post-Katrina New Orleans when the much-anticipated Fox drama <i>K-Ville</i> premieres on Monday, Sept. 17, at 9 p.m. Eastern.  <i>K-Ville</i> (the hyphen is actually a fleur-de-lis) is an on-location crime drama portraying the efforts of two New Orleans cops trying to put their city back together in the aftermath of Katrina. <a href="http://www.anthonyanderson.com">Anthony Anderson</a> stars as Marlin Boulet (note the Creolesque surname) as a longtime New Orleans officer in the Felony Action Squad and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369513/">Cole Hauser</a> as Trevor Cobb, an out-of-town cop who, fresh from a stint fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, comes to New Orleans, you guessed it, to help its good citizens rebuild.    

Only TV critics and the few astute web-watchers who caught Fox's free online preview of the first episode (it appeared briefly at the end of August) have seen the pilot.  For the rest of us, it's still quite unclear how New Orleans will be portrayed in the series.  But the city faithful are cautiously optimistic.  No one wants to see the city presented as a crime-infested mess, but the reality of crime in New Orleans these days will hardly be news to most viewers.  And then there's the less-than-stellar reputation of the New Orleans Police Department, where some police officers looted in the days after Katrina (vividly shown in <i>When the Levees Broke</i>).  Will the public really buy into a show about two hopelessly altruistic New Orleans cops?  (The show presents the police in such an approving manner that the New Orleans Police Department has given its preliminary blessing to the show, allowing the actors to use authentic NOPD uniforms, badges, cruisers, etc.)

The best New Orleans can hope for is that the show will somehow portray the city as a teeming, exotic, culturally-vibrant hot spot, a fresh portrayal that can help re-invent the city in the American imagination — much the same way <i>Miami Vice</i> took the rundown debris of South Beach and turned it into the thriving tourist mecca it is today. There's a definite lesson for New Orleans here: When <i>Miami Vice</i> first hit the airwaves, the local powers that be did everything they could to try and shut it down, believing that the last thing their city needed was a show depicting it as a drug-infested crime capital. Even the title offended them. The reality is that the show did more than any other single factor to lead to Miami's rebirth: most of the viewing public cared far less about the drug dealers on the show than the art deco hotels, the palm-studded sunsets, and the evocative music.  The show made Miami cool, and within a few years, life began enthusiastically imitating art.  Can the same thing happen in New Orleans?

“It's incredibly complicated for me and for the people of New Orleans,” New Orleans <i>Times-Picayune</i> TV columnist Dave Walker said in <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/07/23/a-taste-of-new-orleans-dinner-with-foxs-k-ville-tca-report/">a recent interview</a>. “The stakes are indescribably high.  The benefit of the production in the city — the money they're going to spend, but then there's the potential deficit to the image of the city based on the product that they actually produce.”

As Walker mentions, <i>K-Ville</i> at the very least provides New Orleans with a much-needed economic boon, at least for now.  Setting up production for 13 episodes of a major TV series is a multi-million-dollar affair, what Walker describes as “a bonanza for the local production community.”  If the show becomes a hit, the benefits will be even greater.

But Walker also worries about what the average viewer will take away from <i>K-Ville</i> when they tune in.  “Almost nobody,” he wrote back <a href="http://www.nola.com/living/t-p/walker/index.ssf?/base/living-0/117384982629680.xml&coll=1">in March</a>, when it was still unclear whether Fox would pick up the series, “documentarian or dramatist, gets New Orleans quite right.  Finding the fine line between rosy affirmations and reality — while still making an entertainment — heightens the heat on the show's creators even further.”

Of course, whether the show has any impact at all depends largely on whether it sticks around longer than 13 episodes.  The early buzz on <i>K-Ville</i> is pretty good:  <a href="http://www.tvparty.com/reviews/k-ville.html">TVparty.com</a> calls it “a breathless, wild ride” that is both “heart-wrenching and action-packed.”  You've probably already seen the promos airing on Fox; if you haven't, you can watch the <a href="http://www.fox.com/fallpreview/new/kville-video.htm">trailer</a> on the network's website and a whole range of promotional goodies on the <a href=http://www.fox.com/kville>official K-Ville website</a>.

Katrina was certainly a major media event, so there's something fitting and proper about its aftermath hitting the prime time airwaves.  Educators have an obligation not to let <i>K-Ville</i> have the final word on New Orleans, any more than Lisa Simpson should get the final word on Buddhism.  But we do have a golden opportunity to use the show as a springboard to further investigation of the many important issues raised by Katrina.  (For a whole range of curricular materials about Katrina as a media event, see Chapter 2 of the Teaching the Levees curriculum, “In Our Own Image: Using Representations of Katrina to Empower Media-Literate Citizens.”) 

And just in case you were wondering, "K-Ville" is reportedly a shortened version of “Katrinaville,” a term Walker of the <i>Times-Picayune</i> says “I've never seen or heard used by anyone here.”  He says the show's creator, Jonathan Lisco, saw the words “Welcome to K-Ville” graffitied on a wall in a destroyed neighborhood while researching the show.

Stay tuned.
