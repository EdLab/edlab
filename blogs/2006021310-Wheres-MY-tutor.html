            Did you see the article in the New York Times this weekend about NCLB and tutoring?  Many students that qualify for free tutoring under NCLB aren't getting it.  Currently, less than half of eligible students are receiving tutoring in NYC.  This is due to a number of reasons--poor funding, lack of sufficient advertising, etc.  I know that private tutoring companies (such as the Princeton Review and Kaplan) are scrambling to get customers in order to get a slice of the federal Title One pie.  But, I also know that many of the tutors that these companies hire have little to no teaching experience, yet they are supposed to correct for the "failed" teaching of regular "certified" teachers.  For example, to become a tutor for the Princeton Review, all one has to do is take a 3-day course and pass a teaching audition.  If the government is willing to pay thousands of uncertified teachers to patch up America's public school woes, what does this say about state certification systems?

P.S.
I've worked at a number of education companies in the private sector and I think that public schools can learn a lot from the private sector when it comes to creating teaching and learning incentives, finding educational AND fun texts, etc. I am curious to see how and if this federally funded tutoring program impacts teaching during the school day.
