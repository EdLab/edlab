            This research guide is designed to provide an overview of library resources and services of particular relevance for students in Dr. Sarah Perry's course <em>BBSQ 5940, Evaluation of <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2019/08/Speech-Language-Pathology.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-33646"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-33646" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/08/Speech-Language-Pathology-300x200.jpg" alt="Speech-Language Pathology" width="300" height="200" /></a>Research in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology</em>.  The resources, primarily
electronic and accessible on and off campus, have been selected as ones supporting the objectives of the course, i.e., to provide students with "a way of understanding and evaluating research in speech-language pathology" and to help "both evaluate existing research and to explore a topic of interest."  The guide also includes a section describing research consultation and assistance services and options for document retrieval and delivery available to all members of the Teachers College community.
