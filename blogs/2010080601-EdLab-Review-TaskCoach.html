Task Coach is a “simple open source todo manager to keep track of personal tasks and todo lists.”  Its developers were frustrated at the fact that most todo managers do not facilitate creating composite tasks (most activities are made up of several other activities).  Thus was born TaskCoach, and along with it the ability to not only break activities down into their subcomponents, but also to track effort, budget, and write notes for each task (and subtask).

<b>[Pros:]</b> Free, Clean UI, Mobile versions for the iPhone and iPod Touch
<b>[Cons:]</b> Slight learning curve, poor explanations in Help section
<b>[Bottom Line:]</b>  If you want to go farther than Google Tasks or other list/todo apps allow you to go, then give Task Coach a try.

<font size=4><b>Full Review</b></font>

TaskCoach is a basic task management tool that functions similarly to project management (PM) tools, sans the ubiquitous Gantt charts you might see in most other PM-identified programs. It is the lack of this feature though that makes TaskCoach a more appealing option.  
 
I have been struggling to keep my projects and their various tasks organized.  Google Calendar, while good at keeping track of my meetings, wasn't helping me organize and execute tasks. Then again, it's not supposed to; I was using it because I didn't know what else there was. I needed something less complicated than a Gantt-chart producing PM tool  but more complex than a simple to-do list. Enter: TaskCoach.  

You can begin using the program by inserting either a new category or a new task. Each task has several properties that can be changed: Due date, start date, completion date, budget, hourly fee, and fixed fee. TaskCoach accounts for changes in these properties and reports them accordingly, such as days left until the due date, total budget left, and total time spent on a project. 

The UI provides the user with color-coded clues about the state of the task so they can easily decide which tasks to attend to first. For example, overdue tasks are shown in red, tasks due soon are in orange, and active tasks are displayed in black font with a blue icon.  You can even set reminders for yourself (that pop up as dialogue boxes) as the deadlines draw nearer.  

The program warns users a few times (once on the download page and once as a tip when you open it) that it is an active project and developers are constantly working to fix bugs and issues that users come across.  That being said, I stumbled upon a few roadblocks in my use of the tool.  For one, although it was easy enough to figure out how to add new tasks, there were several other features that I just couldn't figure out, like tracking an effort. The Help section did little to actually help me figure out how to use the tool as it was more a glossary than anything else.   Still, I have been using it over the past week without taking advantage of all of the features and I still like I am getting a lot out of this [free!] tool.   

<b>Final Thoughts:</b> TaskCoach helps users figure out what they need to do and by when they need to do it.  It's a  simple tool that can be used by students of all grade levels (they could get rid of their assignment books and learn time management skills) as well as adults in various professions.
