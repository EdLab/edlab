<p><i>Goodnight Moon</i> readers and bedtime-story-listeners will likely remember with overwhelming nostalgia the great green room, the telephone, and the red balloon. Whether you used the book to build your earliest reading comprehension skills or simply listened as someone read it to you, it probably isn’t quite the same as the current innovations in bedtime storytelling. Take <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Childrens-Book-Bradley-Grimm/dp/0692373039/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1443797933&sr=8-2&keywords=goodnight+lad">Goodnight Lad</a></i>, for instance. It’s an augmented reality (AR) children’s book that, not to be confused with <i>Goodnight Moon</i>, uses technology to transform the bedtime story experience. Even though AR children’s books are still a relatively new innovation, researchers are starting to ask questions about whether these tech-enhanced books can still lead to important literacy skill acquisition for young readers.</p>
 
<p>The authors behind this study focused on child–parent pairs who were asked to use a tablet on a printed picture book, where the tablet screen would show supplemental multimedia like virtual sculptures and audio narration. They then collected data via videos of the pairs reading and interviews conducted after the reading was over. The researchers categorized the pairs under four different labels: parent as dominator, children as dominator, low communicative child–parent pair, and communicative child–parent pair.</p>

<p>In the parent as dominator group, the parents did not tend to follow their children’s lead in interacting with the book, whereas in the children as dominator group, the kids were more likely to engage in the AR and reading process while the parents responded directly to the children’s actions and questions. Members in the communicative child–parent pair group showed more positive beliefs about AR reading than the low communicative group, which the authors note may be because the latter saw the AR book as a narration substitute rather than a supplemental tool.</p>
 
<p>AR picture books are still a relatively novel resource, and concerns about whether they can provide children with the requisite scaffolding for honing their reading skills are important to consider, especially if the technological enhancements take away opportunities to practice phonics and comprehension. This study provides significant insight into how parents and children can use AR-enhanced bedtime stories in a productive way that is not only enjoyable but also educational.</p>
