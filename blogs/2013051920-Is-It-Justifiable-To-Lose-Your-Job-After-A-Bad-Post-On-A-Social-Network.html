            Why do we allow our frustrations to get the best of us? What part of the human body system allows this situation to occur? I have always pondered about this question ever since I allowed my frustration to get the best of me during a soccer match in high school. The interesting thing about this tragic behavior is the feeling you get afterwards. The aftermath of expressing such a behavior is you start to wonder about the consequences you will face and you deeply try to find it within you about why you allowed your frustration to get the best of you. Sometimes people who face this kind of situation think apologizing is enough but all that the apology does is decrease the consequences you might face. This is the story of a fifth grade teacher at PS 203 in New York City. 

Ms. Rubino, the fifth grade teacher took her frustrations to Facebook to express how she felt about her fifth grade students. This incident occurred after a sixth grader from Harlem <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/nyregion/23drown.html">drowned in the Atlantic Ocean</a> on a class trip. This was Ms. Rubino's post on Facebook: “After today, I am thinking the beach sounds like a wonderful idea for my 5th graders? I HATE THEIR GUTS! They are all the devils spawn! I wld not throw a life jacket in for a million.” Ms. Rubino posted this statement on Facebook in 2010 and was fired afterwards. Three years later, this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/nyregion/brooklyn-teacher-who-talked-out-of-school-can-keep-her-job.html?ref=educationdepartmentnyc&_r=0">article</a> notes that a state judge has ruled that Ms. Rubino didn't deserve to be fired even though her post was “offensive” and “impulsive.”

Clearly, Ms. Rubino brought this onto herself; she allowed her frustration to get the best of her. However, I feel like there are two sides to this issue. My first point is I think it would have been fair if Ms. Rubino was suspended rather than fired because she needs to survive and who knows if the only job she loves is teaching. The other side of this issue is Ms. Rubino showed a bad side of herself. Many parents will not allow their child to be taught by a teacher who thinks of such evil thoughts about their 11-year-old children. After all, I believe it all comes down to how you are able to control yourself when you are frustrated about something. Please feel free to share you thoughts about this case.
