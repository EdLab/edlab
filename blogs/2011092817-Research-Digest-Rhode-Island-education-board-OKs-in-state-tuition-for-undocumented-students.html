            The state higher education board of Rhode Island approved a <a href ="http://articles.boston.com/2011-09-27/news/30209209_1_illegal-immigrants-tuition-rates-reward-illegal-behavior/2">measure</a> that will let illegal immigrant children pay in-state tuition for Rhode Island public colleges. For illegal immigrant students to be eligible for this, they must have attended a high school in the state for at least three years and graduated, and they must also try to obtain legal status as soon as they can. There were many people opposed to this new measure, but Governor Lincoln Chafee supported this measure saying that it will improve intellectual and cultural life, and allow more Rhode Islanders to attend college, which will lead to a better workforce. While people opposed to the bill say that this will reward illegal behavior.  

Rhode Island isn't the only state to have this kind of law, twelve other states have it as well. Each state has certain requirements that illegal-immigrant students must meet in order to receive in-state tuition rates. I'm not sure if these states have the intention of really wanting to provide education for everyone illegal or not. From what the governor of Rhode Island said, it seems that they want their colleges to become more diverse, and have a better and larger workforce, which would be good for the state. What most people who oppose this law do not realize is that the law will only apply if illegal-immigrant students promise to become Americans as soon as possible. For me, this means that they will be dedicated to helping America strive, and be fully committed to being the best U.S. citizens they can be. So isn't it good to have more citizens with that train of thought? But that's just my opinion, what do you guys think of this whole issue?
