          <p>
            The U.S. Supreme Court recently decided to hear the case of a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/01/16/teen.strip.search/">13-year old Arizona student</a> who was strip searched by school officials looking to see if the student possessed the pain reliever ibuprofen. The issue at hand is whether school officials have the constitutional power to conduct searches of students suspected of carrying banned substances on school grounds. A lower federal court has already ruled in favor of the 13-year old. The case is bound to ignite what is becoming a hotly contested battle between civil rights supporters (who argue students deserve the same rights as adults) and school administrators (who argue a school setting is different from other public settings and thus an entirely different standard exists there). 

In its brief existence, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/opinion/30sun1.html">the Roberts Court</a> have issued some of the most controversial decisions regarding schools in recent Supreme Court history. In the summer of 2007, the Court ruled in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_v._Morse">Morse v. Frederick</a>, where the issue at hand concerned a banner by then high school senior Joseph Frederick in 2002 that read "Bong Hits 4 Jesus," (bong is a slang for drug paraphernalia) during the Olympic torch relay on a sidewalk across from his Alaska high school. The banner was seized by Principal Deborah Morse and Frederick was subsequently suspended for 10 days. He sued the school district citing his suspension as a violation of his first amendment right to free speech. The Court ruled that controlling drugs is a compelling state interest and therefore it warrants limiting student speech on the subject of drugs. 

The Court's decision in </i>Morse</i> was seen in legal circles as a big break from the landmark Vietnam War case, <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1968/1968_21/">Tinker v. Des Moines (1969)</a>, which established the precedent for students' free speech rights on school grounds. The Court held in </i>Tinker</i> that the Des Moines school board didn't have the power to suspend students wearing black armbands as a sign of protest against the war. Justice Fortas' majority opinion established the standard for which similar cases were to meet. 

Fortas declared:
<blockquote>"the school officials banned and sought to punish petitioners for a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance on the part of the petitioners…this case does not concern speech or action that intrudes upon the work of the schools or the rights of other students….school officials do not possess absolute authority over their students. Students in school as well as out of school are "persons" under our Constitution. They are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State. In our system, students may not be regarded as closed-circuit recipients of only that which the State chooses to communicate."
</blockquote>
 
Though the current case will most likely be examined under the fourth amendment's prohibition against illegal searches or the 14th amendment's equal protections clause, it must measure up to the Tinker standards, specifically whether the students' actions disrupted the school day and if it placed the safety of other students in jeopardy. Oral arguments in the case start in April and a decision will be rendered towards the end of the term in June. How do you think the Court will rule and what effect it might have on schools as a whole?
