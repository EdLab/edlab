          <p>
            There has been a recent surge in the movement to reduce obesity and reform the American food system so only healthy foods make it to our tables and menus. There have been well documented books such as <i/>Fast Food Nation</i> and documentaries, most notably <i>Super Size Me</i>, that depict the consequences of obesity and how it is plaguing our nation. Most restaurants are now required to list the amount of calories each food has and there has been a mandatory regulation on the amount of trans-fat certain foods can have. This movement has trickled down to the school cafeteria.
 
American schools are now engraved in the thought that the food they offer must solely be healthy and suitable for a student's well being. As a result it often lacks approval from students that consume it who claim it‘s a bit too healthy while others go as far as to calling it mediocre. This makes one wonder whether if this full-scale reform is actually <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/02/01/2010-02-01_untitled__lunch01m.html">working</a> as planned. From my observation (since there are currently no long term study on the results of the reform), students are finding ways to “beat the system,' by bringing in their own lunches or taking part in an underground soda and snack selling business. These activities have risen drastically, especially in New York City due to the recent food regulations enforced on the public school system. There are no longer bake sales allowed and vending machines that sell sugary substances are banned. On the broader note Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper have pledged to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/04/coke-pepsi-and-dr-pepper-friends-for-once-in-an-ad-campaign/38330/">eliminate</a> their full calorie drinks from schools and unfamiliar, unknown low calorie or organic drinks are their replacements. This action, as you can imagine, doesn't sit well with students and is one of the reasons why they are finding alternatives ways to still get their hands on those snacks they crave in schools.
 
The question that now remains is how to incorporate healthy food on lunch menus while earning the consent of the pupils. These public schools should be credited and offered appraisal for their efforts on offering healthy food that also comes at little or no cost to students. They have instilled in our brains since kindergarten the benefits of eating healthy with the food pyramid a prime example. In order for this reform to work though, there has to be a way to include all the essentials stated in that food pyramid while at the same time earning a good rating from the students. Jamie Oliver's <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/jamies-food-revolution/school-food"><i>Food Revolution</i></a>, which previously aired on ABC, is a good example of a successful program that combined both of the aforementioned plans. There has also been efforts by the NYC public school system to help better satisfy student demands by hiring TV host Rachel Ray to <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/in-public-schools-a-new-menu-from-rachael-ray/">assist</a> in coming up with a good, healthy and nutritious lunch menu. Others have also offered help to improve the lunch menu like this <a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/che/NYCSchoolFood.pdf">report</a> issued by Hunter College (CUNY) and this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/nyregion/23bigcity.html">chef's</a> efforts. They are also selling snack favorites that are baked instead of fried, which were well received by students. Much is to be learned in the coming years about the success of this reform but if the two factors that I've mentioned are put into practice, the results will be mainly positive.
