<p><a href="https://www.busuu.com/">Busuu</a> is a standard language learning platform accessible on both desktop and through a smartphone app. Like with other peer services, there is a limited free version and a paid full version that runs around $3 per month. Busuu offers a wide variety of languages that are divided into five difficulty levels: beginner, elementary, intermediate, upper, and travel. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p> Users will be glad to hear that the service gives the option of skipping around to different lessons, topics, or levels to personalize learning. There is no wasting time at early levels or suffering through topics that are totally unrelated to specific needs. With the paid version, users are also able to download lessons so that they don’t need to use data while studying, which is especially handy for long commutes or flights. </p>

<p>The lessons are designed to make language learning quite manageable, introducing just a few vocabulary words and phrases that can be reviewed in minutes. For instance, Lesson 11 in Mandarin focuses on <i>food and drink</i>, and consisted of four sections that each take around six to 12 minutes to complete. All of the vocabulary is smartly paired with simple pictures and natural sounding audio, which can easily be slowed down with a click of a button.</p>

<p>Busuu’s community support is also a nice feature. Members of the community from around the world are encouraged to help other users with languages that they are studying. I helped a few Europeans with basic English introductions! The communal aspect adds motivation and buy-in. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>One problem with Busuu stems from the computer version when compared to the app. The functionality and features are better suited to the app. It seems like the platform was designed for mobile use. For instance, dialogues can easily be read through and selected on a smartphone, but on the computer the formatting makes it difficult to follow along. Some actions during quizzes cannot be undone during lessons on the computer, while the answers are easily edited on the app. </p>  

<p>One minor complaint is that while the travel lessons provide crash courses that focus on survival words or phrases for a trip, I am dubious that these very short lessons will actually be much benefit for completely new languages. These lessons are perhaps better thought of as refreshers.</p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Busuu is a solid language learning app that excels in user freedom and learner community interactions. While the free version still provides some useful features and most of the lessons, without the full functionality of the platform the courses are probably a bit too difficult. So, I would suggest that anyone serious about using Busuu should upgrade to a full account.</p>
