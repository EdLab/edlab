            To ensure quality education for students in Rwanda, the government has set its focus on hiring qualified teachers. The Rwandan government has made providing students with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/29/rwanda-education-teacher-training-youth-unemployment?CMP=twt_gu">quality teaching and learning</a> their top education priority. This comes on the verge of some positive news coming out of Rwanda in terms of their education. Rwanda is now ranked number one in Africa in terms of primary school enrollments; 96.5% of children are in school. Why are primary schools in Rwanda attracting so many children? People might argue that children in Rwanda are attending school simply because they want to become successful. However, there has been evidence that the quality of education in primary schools of Rwanda is the reason why so many children are enrolled.

I believe that a lot of parents don't wish to attend a school with a lack of quality of learning opportunities.  For instance, when buying a product, you look for the one with the best quality. Likewise, when the Rwandan government was searching for the best product to enhance the quality of the country's education system, the government realized that excellent teaching was needed. With the country's education system doing so well and students learning what they need to know to become successful, there is still one problem that remains to be solved in Rwanda. That problem is the high rate of youth unemployment. Currently, the youth unemployment rate stands at 42%. One of the reasons for this high number is because most of the students lack basic skills. For this reason, Rwanda's Minister of Education believes that if technology is introduced into the country's education system, students can gain some of the skills required for employment in the global economy. Rwanda is in need of engineers, electricians, and construction workers to further boost economic development.
