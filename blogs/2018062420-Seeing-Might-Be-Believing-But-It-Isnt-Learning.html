<p>How many times has simply watching someone do something convinced you of your own ability to complete the same task? Especially since the advent of YouTube, millions of online how-to videos, from tap dancing to sword swallowing, reassure us that through watching and learning, we can reenact what we see. However, what actually happens when people repeatedly watch such videos and then attempt to copy them?</p>
 
<p>In order to answer this question, researchers carried out a series of experiments to better understand the effectiveness of learning through seeing, specifically through the use of online videos. The researchers first tested whether repeatedly watching others increased viewers’ belief that they could perform the skill themselves. After exposing 1,000 participants to the "tablecloth trick" (pulling a tablecloth out from underneath a set table without upsetting anything), researchers asked participants to assess their ability to perform the task, rating their confidence. Some participants were given high exposure to the trick (watching 20 repetitions), while others were given low exposure (watching the trick just one time). Data revealed that participants who spent more time watching others felt the most confident in performing the task themselves.</p>

<p>In the next experiments, the researchers followed the same format of introducing participants to tasks such as moonwalking and dart throwing with different levels of video exposure, but this time asked participants to then perform tasks after rating their confidence, and then judged them on their ability to carry out those tasks. While high exposure bred more confidence in participants’ ability to perform, it did not translate into more accuracy in dart throwing or the ability to successfully moonwalk.</p>

<p>The final experiment looked at how participants were learning through watching, and why it failed to translate into true ability. Participants watched videos of juggling bowling pins, but some were also given a sensory experience by being allowed to handle bowling pins. Those who were allowed to handle the bowling pins felt they needed more time to handle them to fully learn, and lowered their perceived ability to juggle. While viewers tracked the steps taken by the expert in the video, they could not experience the actions; it was only through doing that participants realized they could successfully learn the task.</p>

<p>This study demonstrates through its many experiments that a severe gap exists between seeing and doing when it comes to learning. Though YouTube can be the first step towards learning a new skill, it can also lead to inflated perceptions of learning, and that confidence can have potentially tragic consequences. </p>
