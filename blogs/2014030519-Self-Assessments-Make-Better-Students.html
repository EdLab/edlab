<p><b>Title:</b> Online Self-Assessment and Studentsâ€™ Success in Higher Education (2013)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maja Cukusic, Zeljko Garaca, & Mario Jadric</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513003035">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> As online assessment tools become more sophisticated, educators have more opportunities for integrating student assessments into their blended learning classrooms. Gamified quizzes folded into learning management systems like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/223">Socrative</a> and questions embedded into student reading materials like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/590">Gobstopper</a> offer instructors methods for objectively evaluating their teaching while encouraging students to take a more proactive role in their own learning.</p>

<p>Now research is emerging that validates the effectiveness of these tools, showing links between student assessments and test scores in higher education. A recent European study recorded the improvement in exam results after information technology and math students completed regular post-unit assessments in a virtual learning environment after several semesters. After gathering data from a system in which <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> automatically scored a series of eight summative assessments, researchers ran a data-based simulation to extrapolate the results and predict effects on course completion and dropout rates.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> 
By the end of the first year, a correlation was noted between the completion of assessments and end-of-semester academic performance; after the second year, statistically significant data confirmed that the improvement in pass rates was a result of online assessments. A subsequent simulation model predicted that if the entire university were to implement assessments, completion rates could increase by up to 10%.</p>

<p>Interestingly, a negative correlation was found for one group of students whose performance decreased over time. Researchers attributed this decrease to a change in the admissions criteria which negatively affected the qualifications of students enrolling in the course.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
These findings should contribute to discussions on the value of using online assessments in higher education. Designing additional studies and conducting student interviews could shed light on how to develop assessments for specific purposes aligned with learning objectives. Also, replicating this study at the secondary school level could reveal whether assessments affect other student populations differently. For more information on the effects of self-assessments on student motivation and satisfaction, take a look at the Research Digest piece <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/529">Assessing Self Assessment</a>.</p>
