          <p>
            Following the attacks on our nation in September 2001, when most of us were still grappling with the chaos and uncertainty, I turned to the one thing which often serves as a source of great solace in times of need: music. It was during those trying times that I first heard the music of Irish singer Eithne Patricia Ni Bhraonain, or <a href= “http://www.enya.com/”>Enya </a> as she is commonly known worldwide. At first listen, I was dumbfounded by the sheer brilliance of the soothing melodies which often accompanies her songs. Enya's music served as a source of great comfort in my time of need as well as for millions of her fans worldwide. As customary, I indulged myself in everything Enya: music, posters, and videos, among others. Over the years, she has come to reign as my favorite female artist. <p>


Enya burst on the scene in 1989 with Watermark, which spawned perhaps her most famous single, Orinoco Flow (Sail Away). The album sold a respectable eight million copies with little mainstream buzz. She followed Watermark with Shepherd Moons, which sold over 10 million copies and garnered her first Grammy for Best New Age album. After four years off, Enya returned with yet another Grammy winning album, The Memory of Trees. In 1997, she released her greatest hits album, Paint the Sky with Stars, which included the hit song Only If. Enya, in keeping her trend of timing a considerable amount of time off between albums, returned in 2000 with her most successful album, A Day Without Rain. Her latest album, Amarantine, has already won a Grammy for Best New Age Album, her fourth Grammy. <p>

The genius of Enya doesn't lie in her ability to win awards or release an album every four or five years. She is perhaps the only artist in recent memory to sell millions of records with little or no mainstream support. Her songs are not played on contemporary music stations, her videos are not shown on MTV or VH1 and she doesn't engage in a media and commercial tour to promote her new releases. Such is the enigma behind this phenomenon that there is “enyanomics”-the study of how an artist can sell million of records without mainstream support. I have come to conclude that Enya doesn't need to engage in a widespread media circus because her true fans appreciate her and <a href= “http://fansites.hollywood.com/~enya/enya/equotes.html”> her work </a> just the way it is. In a culture where over eccentricity usually equates big bucks for the artist, Enya has been able to, time and again, sell more records than most of the so-called “mainstream” artists. To master a specific craft is a special gift that any person can have and when it comes to her craft, there are few better than Enya. She writes her own songs, sings in countless languages (e.g. English, Latin, Spanish, French, and her native language of Gaelic), plays almost all the instruments in her songs and works solely with Roma and Nicky Ryan, her longtime collaborators. <p>

Fact is, despite worldwide acclaim and a slew of platinum records, Enya is rarely seen in public or at ceremonies. She has never given a specific reason for her lack of public appearances. A self confessed slow composer, she puts emphasis on her work and not her image.  It is not only corporate America and Hollywood that have flocked to use Enya's music for various purposes. Some mainstream artists have sampled her unique sound. One of these artists, hip hop group the Fugees, famously sampled her song “Boadicea” for their hit “Ready or Not.” Following the release of the song, a controversy ensued because the Fugees didn't ask Enya for permission to use the song nor did they give her credit on the song. Many artists would have rushed to the lawyer's office steps in hopes of banking in on the copyright infringement, but keeping true to her character, Enya stated that she understood the song was a very key song for the Fugees and as such legal action will deter attention from what she viewed as a quality song. Instead, she simply asked the Fugees to credit her on future issues of the song. Enya simply wanted to be recognized for her work. R&B singer Mario Winans also sampled “Boadicea” for his hit song “I Don't Wanna Know” and gave Enya credit for the song. When the song peaked at #2 on the Billboard's Top 100, it became Enya's biggest hit to date. Following September 11th, many of Enya's songs were used in video compilations of the attacks. Most of Enya's songs deals with nature and love and relates little to the emotions depicted in the compilation videos. Though she didn't voice any public disapproval, she wanted all proceeds from such videos to go to the various charities established to help the victims of the attacks, a heartfelt gesture from an Irish woman rarely seen but widely heard. <p>

Though she can claim many fans the world over, few know about her personal life. Her marital status or sexual orientation has never been a topic of discussion nor has she revealed any such information to the public. She has admitted in <a href= “http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4aNDDuLfZM”>several interviews </a> that she has had relationships but nothing serious and dreams of having children someday. Her favorite movie and book Rebecca, is the inspiration behind her sprawling estate outside Dublin, Manderley Castle. <p>

In a CNN Interview from 1996, Enya stated “a lot of people know Enya the music, but they don't know what I look like or do, and I think that's really good for me and the music as well.” Enya has the power and fame to engage in constant touring, television appearances, release constant albums and much more but by withdrawing attention from herself and putting that attention on the music, she has done something that is rear in the “show-me” culture that is mainstream America. She laments that many artists have become bigger their music and a quick glance at the covers of today's magazines serve as fine examples to Enya's assessment. When asked to name the genre her music falls into, Enya simply replied that her music was “Enya-”the music not the artist.
