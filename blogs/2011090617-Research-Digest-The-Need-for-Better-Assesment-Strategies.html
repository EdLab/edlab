            <a href ="http://linc.mit.edu/linc2010/proceedings/session8Singer.pdf"> Singer, David (2010) Educational Technology: The need for better assessment strategies and for consideration of student learning styles, teaching styles, specific types of performance scores, and styles reflected in the individual technologies, 14</a>

Over the years the use of technologies in the classroom has increased tremendously. Teachers are relying on technology more and more to help them teach, and parents are buying more educational applications to help their children with a subject they are having trouble with, or their children can learn more. As more educational technology is introduced into schools and the market, there needs to be a better way to determine whether or not an educational technology is the reason why a student's performance improved. This paper shows us the different ways students learn, and also the different ways teachers teach. This is to show us the complexity of assessing a student's learning through technology.

<b>Description:</b>
Mr Sing understands the different ways students learn whether it is by  learning through simply listening, learning through asking and answering questions, or learning through reading, etc. He also states that each student has some degree of ability to use any learning style. On the flip side he also understands the different teaching methods teachers utilize and discusses the different ways they teach, and while some teaching methods might work for some students, others will struggle and try to adapt to learning in a way that is not suited for them. 

He goes on to state that in an ideal world we would be able to interface the learning styles/abilities, teaching styles and educational technologies so that a learning environment could be created that reflects the optimum educational environment for students individually. He believes that we can make better assessments of a student's improvement through educational technologies, instead of the "hit or miss" approach.

<b>EdLab Relavance:</b>

Reading this article reminds me of the qannection.com seminar we had a couple of weeks back. They had asked us how we can better determine if a student is improving on a specific subject just by using their website. This is a big question that many educational technology companies contemplate on, and I believe if they were to understand the different variables that are part of the learning process, they would be able to determine a way to assess a student's progress through their product.
