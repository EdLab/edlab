            The Quick and the Ed's <a href="http://www.quickanded.com/2011/10/quietly-killing-the-quiet-revolution-the-attack-on-open-education.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheQuickAndTheEd+%28The+Quick+and+the+Ed%29">Amy Laitinen reports</a> that the Software & Information Industry Association, a group representing software and publishing companies, have teamed up to prevent community colleges from making their resources available online freely, specifically as it pertains to job training resources. 

The case is pretty straightforward for opening up these resources online. Online education no longer has to be just a cheap alternative; it can actually be a credible alternative, especially if evaluation tools are embedded in these resources. 

The gains for consumers of education and job training resources are quite possibly huge. Moreover, these would not be one-time gains since these resources would be available on a permanent basis (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)">nonrival</a> nature of information). The loss to publishers, who are still playing catch up, hardly comes close to the potential gains of a virtually free and credible job training education.
Yet the SIIA managed to insert a section in the Appropriations Bill for HHS and Labor that prevents the Department of Labor from developing online job training resources unless it does not compete with any resource being produced by a private company.

Ugh ugh ugh. While the amount of lobbying that goes on in Congress is disgusting, I've always imagined lobbying to be most potent and pervasive in issues relating to energy, finance, and defense. The last two places I would expect active lobbying efforts to stifle efficiency are in education and technology. You typically don't hear about Apple's lobbying efforts or the big money a publisher can make from a sweetheart government deal. Yet I get the sense that this is not going to be an isolated incident (hence a trend). Publishers are striving to make all of their learning resources proprietary, which partially explains why software companies might be on board.

Here's the problem with making education a strictly private good: the Federal government already supports job training programs at community colleges, just not online. If community colleges and the Federal government find it more efficient and more desirable to post <b>their</b> content online openly, they ought to have every right to do so. If community colleges were making the <b>publishers'</b> job training resources open to the public, IP rights are being violated. But that's not the case here. 

Opening up online educational resources would likely make for a more competitive market and a more socially efficient outcome than the current situation where a few mega-publishers have an oligopoly on credible online educational content.
