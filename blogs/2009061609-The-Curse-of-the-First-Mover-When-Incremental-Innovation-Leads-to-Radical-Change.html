<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1404015">THE CURSE OF THE FIRST-MOVER: WHEN INCREMENTAL INNOVATION LEADS TO RADICAL CHANGE</a>

By Dr. Thierry Rayna and Dr. Ludmila Striukova

Synopsis 
(you may download the entire paper from http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1404015)

The literature establishes a strong link between radical innovation, first-mover advantage and market dominance. This belief that both radical innovation and being the first mover are an absolute necessity for companies to dominate the market, although valid for many years in many industries (and still well-founded for some of them) seems, nowadays, to be greatly undermined, in particular in the case of high-tech industries.   


Indeed, the recent history of high-tech industries provides numerous  examples when, despite their ability to come up with radical innovation and despite being the first-mover, companies failed. For  instance, Apple, nowadays one of the most successful high-tech  companies, nearly went bankrupt in 1997 and if, at the time, few bet on its survival, nobody would have imagined how successful it would  become. Yet, by 1997, Apple had invented and released: the first PC  with graphical interface, the first mouse, the first laptop, the first  Personal Digital Assistant, the first digital camera as well as many  other radically innovative products. More surprisingly, the resurrection of Apple and its recent success did not come from releasing even more radically innovative devices, but instead by incrementally improving existing products: MP3 players (iPod), smart phones (iPhone), etc.               


Likewise, Google, nowadays the most successful internet company, has never produced any radical innovation, but owes its success to incremental improvements of existing products (search engines, webmail, maps, word processing software, etc.). Yet, the products introduced by Google, despite being only marginally innovative, have led to landslides and have profoundly and radically altered the course of the industry.   


Of course, radical innovation is still required for new products to replace completely old ones or for new markets to emerge. However inventors of radically innovative products are not always the ones who reap the benefits of the innovation they have sown. In fact, the example of technology-intensive industries demonstrates that incremental innovation can influence the industry in a far more significant way than radical innovation and can also be more beneficial to companies.

This article investigates the relation between radical innovation, incremental innovation and market dominance. In particular, it explains why radical innovation and first-mover advantage, which are so vital in other industries, not only often fail to provide competitive advantage in high-tech industries, but might even weaken  the companies' positions. The article examines the key determinants  that explain why first-movers, promoting radical innovation, may face a disadvantage in comparison to followers, that use incremental innovations.

The theories developed are supported by four case studies of products  released by Apple, two of which correspond to radical innovations (Lisa, Newton) and the other two to incremental innovation (iMac, iPod).
