            Fred threw some punches in his <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5829">rebuttal</a> to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5826">my opening post</a>

<b>Some quick hits</b>:
On the point of China, while yes, China's rise has made Americans more insecure about the prospects for the United States as a world leader, just one look at education rankings reveals how far we have fallen behind developed and even some developing countries. 

As far as the "crisis mentality" and "contrived crisis" in education, crisis is certainly an overused term, but when resources devoted to education have historically been increasing but outcomes have stagnated, we have a significant problem. If we see education as a key input in both economic growth and future innovations and discoveries, some major changes need to be made.

Why do we make a big deal about teachers? Hanushek, while sometimes controversial, has clearly made a <a href="http://edpro.stanford.edu/hanushek/admin/pages/files/uploads/Teacher%20quality.Evers-Izumi.pdf"> convincing case</a> in the economics of education discipline for why teachers are one of the most important inputs in a child's education. No one is saying other inputs do not matter, but there are significant differences in the quality of teachers that needs to be identified more clearly.

<b>Compromise?</b>
I can understand your sentiment that too many are over-eager to use these value-added numbers. When value-added scores include controls for family income, standard deviations do start to widen. Nevertheless, as this presentation by Columbia Business School Professors <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfMxo8cVmXg">Doug Staiger and Jonah Rockoff demonstrate</a>, value-added scores are reliable <i>enough</i> to play a major role in hiring and recruitment decisions. They note how those teachers with high value-added scores are likely to continue to have high scores and those with low scores will continue to do so. For this reason, they view the benefits to outweigh the costs of hiring and firing in more cases than most. 

The other factor in all of this include the poor structure of standardized tests that still exists and serves as the foundation for making value-added judgments. While I think Rockoff and Staiger's evidence is quite convincing from the standpoint of teacher recruitment, the flaws that exist in testing (high stakes, the lack of formative tests, too little info revealed just to name a few) make it difficult to rely solely on value-added. 

All of this being said, we have to deal with the fact that we currently compensate teachers almost arbitrarily. Paying based on experience, certification, and post-undergrad degrees has almost nothing to do with student performance, which is what we should be caring about first and foremost. On the other hand, value-added <b>is</b> related to student performance, and for that reason alone, it deserves to be considered the major factor in the teacher quality conversation.
