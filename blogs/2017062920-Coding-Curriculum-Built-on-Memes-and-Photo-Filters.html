<p><i>"Vidcode teaches teens to code by empowering them to create the things they enjoy in their daily lives with code, including video filters and memes."</i> (<a href="https://www.vidcode.com/faq/">About Vidcode</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Memes Need Coding, Too</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vidcode.com">Vidcode</a> offers programming curriculum for 4th–12th grade students that introduces coding in a teen-oriented way. Instead of forcing youth to dive head first into an often-opaque programming language, Vidcode anchors all of its lessons in topics that students are already interested in. Students learn to code by creating their own Instagram-inspired filters, memes, interactive games, and video effects, to name a few.</p>
 
<p>By meeting students halfway between fun and education, Vidcode believes that teens will be more excited to learn programming. Not only that, but because the lessons are directly applicable to their social lives, students will likely remember them and use them more than they might with traditional coding curriculum. While the curriculum was originally designed by women to interest more girls in programming, it is relevant and applicable to any students.</p>

<p><b>Curriculum, Partnerships, and Contests</b></p>
 
<p>Each curriculum set is designed to be implemented in either semester or year long classes; Vidcode wants to become a part of daily student life. There are 10 courses available currently, from Coding I to Design and Technology to AP Computer Science Principles. Each unit is entirely project-oriented, meaning that there are no video tutorials; instead there are only student-led activities, discussions, and projects.</p>
 
<p>Vidcode has partnered with many different organizations, such as Girl Scouts of Greater New York and Snapchat, to reach more teens. Last year, Vidcode and Snapchat teamed up to host a contest to inspire more teens to code: the challenge was to create their own Snapchat geofilter, and the reward was seeing the social media app actually use it. Projects like this that combine learning challenges with teens’ social lives demonstrate that programming doesn’t have to be solely a career-oriented skill; it can have applications right now to teens’ daily lives. Because, let’s face it, taking a picture with a Snapchat filter is cool and all, but knowing how to create your own is even cooler.</p>
