<p>Pranav Kothari is Domain Architect and Vice President of Large Scale Education Programs at <a href="https://www.ei-india.com/about/">Educational Initiatives</a>. The company developed <a href="https://www.ei-india.com/mindspark/">Mindspark</a>, a technology-based, personalized, adaptive learning tool that draws on a database of questions and answers to anticipate common mistakes. Pranav led Mindspark Centres in the urban slums of Delhi, and oversaw the machine learning platform’s deployment in government schools across India. Pranav is a sought-after speaker in India and the USA where he promotes student assessments, educational technology, and the critical need for the science of learning. Pranav studied Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and received an MBA from Harvard Business School.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope Mindspark will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Through Mindspark we hope to deliver a high-quality, technology-based learning solution that can help improve learning outcomes at scale. While product efficacy has been established, we are piloting Mindspark with disadvantaged populations within India’s public school system who are at-risk of dropping out before completing a meaningful education. If we are able to crack the operational hiccups and the social diversity of this population, Mindspark can easily be scaled all over the country, and beyond, as a personalized remediation program for future learners.</p>

<p>The problem Mindspark seeks to address is widely acknowledged, in low-income countries, as the <i>learning crisis</i>. The evidence suggests that over 60% of children aged 6 to 14 are not able to read at a second-grade level in India, despite primary school enrollment rates of over 95%; with similar rates in East Africa. A particularly difficult challenge for education quality is the variation in student preparation within a grade or classroom. This makes it extremely hard to teach effectively. </p> 

<p>I believe an AI solution like Mindspark has an increased likelihood of success if it is:
<b>Adaptive</b>: The software adapts to a child’s current level of knowledge rather than the uniform content for the child’s school grade.
<b>Based on Research</b>: The software is grounded in a solid evidence base of the misconceptions children have, where they make mistakes, what helps in the learning process, and how to master each learning unit. 
<b>Child Centric</b>: The program offers personalized emotional, psychological, and pedagogical support to children. This could include having mother tongue language support, voice-over support (since many children struggle with reading), motivation for regularity, and gamification for practice. 
<b>Data Driven</b>: The software pays close attention to children’s learning and makes iterative modifications based on student performance and ability (from a child learning perspective). The software is not static, created once, or a platform that relies on external content, but instead uses a data driven approach to identify topics children are struggling with and suggests the most efficient approach to enable learning.</p> 
<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and professional experience shape your current work?</b><br> <p>I was privileged to receive a high-quality education, and because I received the right support at the right time (be it financial, advisory, or emotional) I feel that the best use of my education is to support others, especially those who need a high-quality education most. Each of my past professional experiences has taught me valuable lessons. In private equity I learned the basics of business economics, the relationship between access to capital for growth, and the risk appetite that different investors have. This helped me to pivot from running a chain of Mindspark Centres outside the school system, which we had previously failed to convert to a market based model, to finding ways to work within the public school system. Management consulting provided me with a solid foundation in structured thinking and analytical computations, which came in handy when we were building long-term plans and understanding the ecosystem for our products. It also prepared me for diverse roles within Educational Initiatives (EI) ranging from product management to head of Human Resources! Even my job on an assembly line as a college intern working with unions and blue-collar workers provided an invaluable lesson in the importance of motivating people at all levels.</p>
<p><b>What technology trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>One of the major challenges in education is determining the personalized learning path for a student. The AI approach to this is to try and predict the next activity, task, or problem based on student characteristics like past performance and preferences. I believe the biggest impact on learning will come from a body of knowledge known as the Science of Learning, which describes how children learn and the misconceptions they have. It will be a new interdisciplinary field of study aimed at continually improving the quality of student learning. If teaching is an art and a science, and the teacher practices the art based on an understanding of children built over time, the Science of Learning will supply the science that the teacher builds on to ensure students are learning effectively and efficiently. </p>
<p><b>What are your plans for Mindspark? Do you see the platform being embraced by edtech in other countries where learners are suffering?</b><br>
<p>Our vision is that children everywhere learn with understanding, and we are committed to making that happen. The architecture of Mindspark can be translated/contextualized to any child, region, or culture. Our immediate focus is on increasing the penetration of Mindspark to improve core literacy and numeracy skills among all learners who are studying in English, Hindi, and Gujarati. A recent article about Mindspark in <i>The Economist</i> prompted enquiries worldwide, particularly Spanish-speaking nations. Taking Mindspark to other countries means supporting learning in local/vernacular languages, and that requires research and development in those languages. We will evaluate the potential and the available funding to enable Mindspark in those languages.</p>

<p><embarrassed> I’m shy on social media. I have inactive accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. I have been advised by many to be more active, but this has been one failure of mine. </embarrassed></p>  <p><i>Image:</i> Courtesy of Pranav </p>
