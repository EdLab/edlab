<p><a href="https://www.instructables.com">Instructables</a> is a community-built online class platform for all kinds of makeables, including workshop, technology, and food creations. Its content is similar to Pinterest, except with much more in-depth and well-curated how-to guides.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Instructables’ dedicated base of users has only grown since its inception, and because of this, its content breadth is extensive. The over 100,000 classes you find on Instructables range from how to make buttermilk biscuits to wooden earphones to giant outdoor robots. There is also an entire section of the site dedicated to K–12 classroom-specific projects, particularly in science and math. Every class on the site is created by a member of the Instructables community and packaged into individual lessons. Best of all, they’re all free, making the content accessible to anyone with internet access.</p>
 
<p>In addition to the classes, the Instructables website also features sections for contests, forums, and answers. For the first, the site hosts various competitions for community members, such as sharing best recipes for food preserving or designing the coolest fidget spinner, all of which come with various prizes for the winners. In the forums section, members can begin discussion threads on particular topics of interest, and in the answers section, you can pose maker-related questions to anyone in the community.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The Instructables content is so vast that it’s almost overwhelming, which I think could particularly be the case for teachers trying to use the education section of the site. This isn’t to say that the content itself is a problem, but rather that the education could be better curated to fit the needs of teachers. For example, if there was a way for teachers to be able to search for a particular skillset they wanted to build in their students (e.g., coding), this might be more useful for some than having to scan the dozens of projects. Also, Instructables’ courses are almost entirely text- and picture-based instead of video-based. While this is my preferred way of learning something, the site’s format might not work for people who learn best via videos.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Instructables provides users with a creative and skillful community of makers and teachers who want to share their knowledge with others. It is worth diving into for anyone who wants in-depth, text- and picture-based guides to crafting and making, as well as for those who want to create their own courses. My win of the day? Learning how to properly hold a knife. And I’ll probably come back tomorrow to learn the difference between mincing and slicing. Thanks, Cooking Class!</p>
