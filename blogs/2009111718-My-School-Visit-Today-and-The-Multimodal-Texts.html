While children's books become more multimodal regarding formats of pictures and/within texts as well as presentation (e.g., 3D), the market is not ready for ebooks (even with the existence of animated computer books on web). It is clear that the major children's book awards all go to traditional handheld books. 

Today I encountered a newly published wordless book at the <a href="http://www.bankstreet.edu/sfc/">Bank Street's School for Children</a> (where I was a delegation of a UNICEF-sponsored preschool principals from China).  First, I happened to meet Ms. <a href="http://www.earlyword.com/2008/10/23/earlyword-kids/">Lisa Von Drasek</a>, a children's book reviewer, instructor, and also the managing librarian at Bank Street. She showed our group a shelf of best picture books voted by students in the recent school year and introduced about a regular annual unit of book evaluation at the school. Every year children at Bank Street vote for and give "awards" to the best books in their mind. Interestingly, while learning to be readers and writers, younger children there also learn to be book reviewers. They are taught to keep the following questions in mind:
<ul>
	<li>Does the picture match the words?</li>
	<li>Does this book make me laugh?</li>
	<li>Is this book scary?</li>
	<li>Is this book age appropriate?</li>
	<li>Would I recommend this book to others?</li>
	<li>Would I spend money on this book?</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>

What amazed me most was one of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/gift-guide/holiday-2009/20091108_best-illustrated_gg/slide-show.html?page=5#curr_item_4425">the ten best illustrated books</a> as reported by <em>The New York Times</em> recently - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/books/review/Sutton-t.html"><em>The Lion and The Mouse</em></a>.  Lisa was one of the three judges. The uniqueness of this book not only lies in its compelling pictures but also it is almost a wordless book with only seven distinct words about sound effects, e.g., an owl, stalking the mouse, “whoooo” and “screeeech”; the mouse, “scratch” and “squeak.”

It reminds me of another wordless book named<em> Wave</em>.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/books/review/Zerkin-t.html"><img class="alignnone" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/07/13/books/zerkin-600.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="318" /></a>

The wordless books enlighten teacher to teach more creatively with students with different voices and offer a great opportunity for English language learners to "read".
