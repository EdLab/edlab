<p>Daphna Shohamy, a neuroscientist at Columbia University, has made an interesting discovery about the teenage brain. She designed an experiment in which she scanned the brains of adults and teenagers as they played a competitive digital game. One result was that the teenagers outperformed the adults in the game. This finding came as no surprise, since the part of the brain that seeks rewards is very active in teenagers. However, the teenagers were also better at remembering random images that were flashed on the screen and had no relation to the game. The brain scans suggest that this is because the part of the brain that seeks rewards is in direct communication with the part of the brain that stores memories. So, as the teens were acting on their desire for rewards, they were simultaneously learning content.</p>

<p>Dr. Shohamyâ€™s findings can have major impacts on how we understand teenage learning. Instead of cautioning teens against reward-seeking behavior, educators can design learning activities that promote engaging in such behavior since research suggests that memories are formed through this type of action. How do you think this new research can impact teaching and learning? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48261">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:13 Anna Curry:</b> Yes, this research seems to suggest that experiential learning is much more suited to the way teenagers brains works. Giving them that opportunity for immediate reward that comes from diving into learning in a hands-on way would align well with their brain's preference for learning from experience.</p>

<p><b>@02:29 Carmen Cortez Morales:</b> This study shows that learning from experience and the creation of memories are not two separate phenomena but rather these functions occur simultaneously. Given this, it makes me wonder how an individual's ability to be self-reflective may influence their memory. If after each activity or experience, you took the time to process what had just occurred (to learn), then just maybe you would be exercising your memory. What are your thoughts? What does creating memories look like for teenagers? How is this different from adults? </p>
