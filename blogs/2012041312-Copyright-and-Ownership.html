            As the PocketKnowledge team is working on revamping the tool (user interaction, promotion, subscription, etc), one of the questions we've been dealing with is the notion of copyright and ownership. Under what instances can the use of copyrighted material be considered “fair use”? Who is the primary owner of material that took multiple people to create? 

This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/arts/music/springsteen-and-others-soon-eligible-to-recover-song-rights.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">article from the NY Times</a> highlights an impending legal battle between musicians and record companies about a copyright law that will take effect early next year. In 1976, Congress passed a law that all creators of works of art (yes this includes musicians), starting January 1, 1978, will have to wait 35 years to reclaim full ownership of their work from recording companies. The 35-year-old window is up on January 1, 2013 and artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel and Van Halen are all primed to reclaim full ownership of their recordings from 1978. Every artist who released an album after 1978 is entitled to the provision so long as they file a claim to regain ownership two years before the 35 years is up on that album. 

As expected, the record companies are not too thrilled with the law. With dwindling record sales, companies rely heavily on catalogs from greats such as AC/DC, Michael Jackson and the Eagles to stay afloat. It seems likely the legal wrangling over ownership will go on for years to come and may even include a possible Supreme Court ruling. The question of ownership is in itself murky as producers, songwriters, and backup singers can lay claim to some piece of ownership of materials they helped produced. 

The Rock and Roll curriculum aims to teach American history through one of our nation's most popular and influential art forms: rock and roll music. Another equally important fabric of American history and life is the idea of creativity and one's ownership of materials they create. It will be very interesting to see how this legal battle pans out in the coming months and years.
