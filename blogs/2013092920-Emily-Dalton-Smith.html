<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> One of the most significant influences was becoming the editor in chief of my college newspaper, where I learned a tremendous amount about how public education works, and met Dr. Elizabeth Phillips, who was the provost of my university.  Dr. Phillips became a mentor and later hired me to be her special assistant when she became provost of Arizona State University.  That job gave me tremendous insight to how a really talented executive thinks and manages, and how one of the most innovative educational institutions in the world operates. 
<p>
Second, in graduate school I studied the relationship between technological development and social change with professors from ASU’s Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes.  I use that training all the time in thinking about how the learning technologies I invest in can help improve underserved students’ lives.
<p> 
And third, I was an English major in college, which helped me build the writing and analytical skills that I use every single day.   
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> First, working at ASU, especially on improving student retention and online was tremendously important.  I started working with education technology startups while I was there and am fortunate to work with many more now.
<p> 
Second, the past three years of working at the Foundation itself have a huge influence on my work today.  We’re always learning and building on our prior work, so much of what I’m doing today is built on what we’ve learned through prior investments.    
 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> The Next Generation Learning team’s goal is for all students’ learning experiences – what they learn, and how, when, and where they learn it – to be tailored to their individual needs, skills, and interests. And, although where, how, and when they learn might vary according to their needs, our goal is for students, particularly underserved students, to develop deep personal connections to each other and their teachers and other adults.  My hope is that digital content and tools can support this by saving teachers time, helping them tailor instruction to students’ needs, and extending their reach and expertise.
<p>

<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think the growing personalization of students’ learning experiences will have the most impact on learning, hands down.


<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We just announced the winners of our $6m <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Grant-Opportunities/Literary-Courseware-Challenge-RFP">Literacy Courseware Challenge</a>, which is supporting the development and pilot testing of new tools to help students in grades 4-8 master high standards in reading and writing.  The winners are a really amazing group of organizations with great ideas for supporting literacy skill development, particularly the increases in writing in the Common Core.
And we have an <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Grant-Opportunities/New-Approaches-for-Evaluating-and-Improving-Efficacy-in-Digital-Courseware-RFP#RFPSummary ">RFP</a> out now for new approaches to evaluating and improving digital courseware that will award up to $2m to support short-cycle feedback on how digital courseware products are working and for which students.  The goal of this project is for teachers, school decision-makers, and parents to have better information about the effectiveness of digital courseware, and for the developers of these products to receive rapid feedback to improve their products’ impact on student learning.
