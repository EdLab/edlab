In the ideal learning environment, every student would have a personal tutor; their own Aristotle. But, as the narrator in the video above (<a href="http://www.cgpgrey.com/">C.G.P. Grey</a> of YouTube fame) notes, there are three major problems with this idea: 1) There aren’t enough humans in the world to support a 1:1 teaching scenario, 2) Even if there were enough, the entire endeavor would be too expensive, and 3) Not everyone is as good a tutor as Aristotle. So, what options do we have left? How can we ensure that students falling behind can catch up, while students breezing ahead stay challenged? The answer is the same for both cases. <p>


Currently, a wealth of information can be found on sites like YouTube and Khan Academy, but what separates these resources from a truly Aristotelian experience is an air of personalization.  At best, they can be seen as a rich collection of learning materials; at worst, they are often unnavigable, disjointed, and fail to provide a complete learning experience.  The remedy, of course, is to create the fabled "Digital Aristotle" as C.G.P. Grey suggests. The internet is not lacking content or engaging teachers to convey this content. What is needed, though, is a service to pull it all together so that each and every learner can experience something unique to their learning dispositions.<p>


As we move on from industrial models of education, the idea of one teacher to one student is refreshing (and isn’t <i>too</i> farfetched). What do you think about having a personal, digital tutor to guide you on your lifelong learning journey? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/7857">Leave your thoughts</a> in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues. <p>


<b>@00:30 Katezvdp:</b> Don't [classrooms] still look this way?<p>


<b>@02:49 ChrisGotthis:</b> I usually learn more on the internet than at school. Whenever I am bored, I end up searching things that interest me and I learn more about it. Teachers need to have a way of making students interested in the topic they are teaching. <p>
