<p><i>"Our mission is to help athletes reach the next level in sports + life."</i> (<a href="https://www.coachup.com/"> CoachUp</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Coaching Community</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.coachup.com/about">CoachUp</a> is a Boston-based private coaching community founded by Jordan Fliegel in 2011. The network has amassed over 12,000 coaches from around the United States who offer one-on-one, small group training, or virtual training in over 30 sports or activities. The communityâ€™s most popular sports are soccer, baseball, lacrosse, and basketball, but it also includes activities like yoga and dance. Users just need to enter their basic requirements and location, choose a coach from the match list, and then schedule a training session. Prices vary with each private coach and the training style of the session. All coaches can be rated and reviewed by the users.</p>

<p><b>Maximizing Success</b></p>
 
<p>CoachUp does not let just anyone become a coach on the network. In order to join the service, prospective coaches must send in an application on coaching and athletic experience, complete a general coaching and specific sport quiz, and pass a background check to ensure user safety. Some of the athletes that I found in the New York City area had collegiate or even professional experience. You can get shooting lessons from a <a href="https://www.coachup.com/searches/coaches/seang-3?r=3#about-me-tabs">former NBA player</a> at around $100 per session. </p> 

<p>The network flexes the prowess of its community through <a href="https://www.coachup.com/nation/">CoachUp Nation</a>, a website connected to the network. It offers articles with tips and advice written by various coaches of different sports from around the country, such as <i><a href="https://www.coachup.com/nation/articles/5066
">3 Benefits of Playing Multiple Youth Sports</a></i> and <a href="https://www.coachup.com/nation/articles/parentcoach-team">Becoming a Parent-Coach Team.</a></i> This resource is an added benefit to an engaging community of private coaches, and helps to make their expertise more widely available to average users.</p>
