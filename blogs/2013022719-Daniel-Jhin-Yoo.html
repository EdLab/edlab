Daniel is mobilizing technology to address some of the unique needs of special education teachers and administrators.  Melding a background that encompasses real-world teaching experience, engineering and computer science with time spent in the Silicon Valley trenches, Yoo has been able to provide a fresh perspective on educational technology that is grounded in first-hand knowledge of the field. 

<p> 
<b> EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NEW LEARNING TIMES </b>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory/background affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Starting <a href="https://goalbookapp.com/">Goalbook</a> has allowed me to combine my teaching and administrative experience in a school district with knowledge of computer programming.  It has helped me not only empathize with educators and the challenges of their work, but also imagine and evaluate a potential solution.  
<br>
I studied electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley as an undergrad and then worked after as a software developer for three years in the Valley.  After enjoying many informal teaching experiences tutoring or at children's programs at my church, I decided to take the deep plunge and get my General Ed and Special Education credentials at CSU East Bay.  I ended up as a middle school special educator in East Palo Alto, where I got to work alongside the most amazing staff of educators and school leaders. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>While I expected to be challenged by my students and their individual needs, the complexity of managing my reporting and administrative responsibilities took me totally by surprise. There were forms and processes for everythingâ€”with a hundred different potential mistakes you could make filling them out. At times it felt like I could fill an entire school day just doing paper work, scheduling meetings, writing reports, and monitoring timelines.
<br>
During one summer break, I wrote software that special educators in the district could use to enter some reporting information online.  Seeing the impact this made not only on our district compliance numbers but also the appreciation of staff who had to spend less time and mental energy on non-teaching activities, proved to me that there was a way that I could use my technology background to make an impact.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I started Goalbook to help special education transition from compliance to outcomes. The laws and accountability around special education are important, ensuring that our schools provide an essential level of support to students with special needs and their families. What are needed are a better set of tools to help educators, administrators, and families streamline and simplify the process, ensure compliance, and help teams collaborate more effectively to achieve student success.
<br>
Special education teachers experience the highest attrition rate of any other type of educator, with demands of paperwork being a top reason. This administrative burden takes time, energy, and resources away from the activities that would truly benefit our students with special needs. Ironically, while our laws and compliance regulations were intended to bring students and families into the center of instruction, they are often rendered ineffective due to the complexity of these bureaucratic systems.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer</b> Obviously, I think technology, specifically connected mobile devices (e.g. tablets), are going to change education, but the educator in me also knows that technology alone will not be sufficient.  
<br>
My hope is that more and more priority and innovation will be seen in early childhood education where research has shown that such a life-long impact can be made.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> We are in the very beginnings of our journey to have Goalbook be the most powerful and popular individual learning plan platform on the planet.  In the long-term our hope is to see Goalbook used across the entire learning lifetimes of individuals: from parents celebrating a toddler's first words to lifelong learners who are working on making a career change.
<br>
In the short-term we are building a repository of curated individual learning goals and related resources that can help special educators make the adjustment to aligning their IEPs and instruction to the Common Core.
<br>
Well, I could see myself growing Goalbook for a long time.  However, if there was another startup in me, one thing that really interests me is how to facilitate peer-to-peer learning in young children.  I've seen a few teachers really excel at creating a classroom community where students are able to help each other and feel safe in accepting help from each other.  I think the next educational revolution will happen when we learn how to empower students to teach each other.
