<p>Fake news remains a <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5178/learn-how-to-spot-fake-news-by-creating-it">growing problem</a> and people are still grappling with how to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5128/combat-fake-news-with-daily-news-quizzes-from">fight against</a> a constant barrage of misinformation. So a group of researchers set out to understand how truths or falsehoods diffuse across social media, and to what extent bots or humans factor into the proliferation.</p>

<p>The researchers used a dataset of 126,000 tweets from 2006 to 2017 that were tweeted around 4.5 million times by more than three million Twitter users. Because the term "fake news" has become so politically loaded, the researchers opted to ignore this moniker; instead, they focused on true and false information. Cross-referencing tweets with a range of fact-checking sites, such as <a href="https://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> and <a href="http://www.politifact.com/">PolitiFact</a>, the team gave labels of false, true, and mixed to every item in their dataset.</p> 

<p>The researchers found that falsehoods traveled faster and farther than true tweets, as fake information was 70% more likely to be retweeted by users. It took real information roughly six times as long to reach 1,500 users compared to misinformation, and the former rarely reached as many people as the latter. Further, these effects increased for news related to politics, with spikes in false rumors during the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.</p> 

<p>The analysis also found that bots were not to blame for the spread of falsehoods. Using sophisticated software to detect bots in their dataset, the researchers identified and removed these fake tweeters from the analysis. In this test, while news in general spread more slowly without the bots, their absence impacted circulation of true and false information at the same rate. Bots helped speed up the spread of <i>all</i> information, but humans were to blame for the rapid spread of false rumors.</p> 
 
<p>Human nature might be to blame for the attraction to fake news. The researchers hypothesized that falsehoods excited audiences through novelty. Novelty encourages virality, and the researchers found that tweets with false information were much more novel. In order to fight back against misinformation, bots cannot be the only target, as human behavior is a significant factor in the spread of fake news.</p>
