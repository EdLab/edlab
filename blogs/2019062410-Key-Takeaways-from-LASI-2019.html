            <p>	<span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">This year’s Learning Analytics Summer Institute (LASI), which is organized by the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR), was held at UBC campus in Vancouver, Canada. The LASI participants chose two tutorials and two workshops, and participated in two collaborative keynotes.</span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">           The first day of LASI consisted of registration and two tutorials. One of the tutorials that I have attended touched upon the treatment of institutional data and the goal of learning analytics. Specifically, the tutorial instructor suggested treating higher educational institutions as businesses. Thus, the purpose of learning analytics is to improve the “service” provided to students. She provided an outline of the future potential strategies of learning analytics, which include doing away with “at-risk” student system by replacing it with “student success” system, replacing the term “data” with “information” in regards data management system where data will be just one of the elements of information, and more. What do you think of this approach?</span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">            The second day of the summer institute began with the keynote presentation given by professor Philip Winne from Simon Fraser University (SFU). He discussed the nStudy software, which he began developing in 1985. The purpose of this software is to revolutionize the learners’ note-taking skills when reading PDF formats of textbooks, thereby, learning strategies. In particular, it permits annotations on images, and contains templates for note-taking, which contain “related terms” section, which facilitates schema construction. It also permits tagging of key words. The software collects data such as the amount of time spent on the content and learners’ annotations, identifies learners’ goals and classifiers, and makes a recommendation to a learner in terms of appropriate learning strategy (e.g. skill learning). It collects every observable learning event and identifies learning strategy patterns, which are then visualized in networks that resemble greatly the social network analysis networks (SNA). This, in turn, helps learners to effortlessly generate data about themselves, teaches students how to learn, and allows them to experiment with their learning strategies, which leads to self-directed learning (SDL). The layout of the nStudy software is shown below. </span></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w800/EdLab-blog/20190624100244-nstudy_layout_png_425d3b8531439526935e9f76c215fc63.png" /> </strong></p><p>	</p><p>Philip Winne is currently working on adding the nStudy to Chrome browser extensions. Nonetheless, data collected by nStudy does not take into account multi-tasking. Furthermore, it might not be suitable for visual note-takers and for subjects such as Mathematics, which require visualizations. Moreover, Winne proposed replacing achievement tests with trace nStudy student data to measure learning. There are several concerns with such proposal. First, nStudy data does not take into account information retention. Second, many students prefer the old-fashioned way of note-taking, as in, with a pencil or highlighter and a hard copy of the material. Hence, there is no data generated by these individuals. Do you think this type of software would be a useful tool at TC Gottesman Libraries?</p><p>	Nonetheless, the third day of the summer institute began with the second keynote presentation about the user engagement and user experience, which can be extended to the learning settings. The keynote speakers Ido Roll and Heather O’Brien argued that scoring high on any one particular attribute (e.g. time spent on the LMS or other software, level of activity, etc.) does not indicate that the student is engaged. What matters is the quality of the engagement, which involves cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes. The affective aspect of student engagement consists of the student’s interest and emotions during the learning process. The involvement of the cognitive aspect of the student engagement implies seeking challenges and exceeding the minimum requirement. And, the behavioral aspect of the student engagement consists of not engaging in disruptive behaviors during the learning process and establishing learning goals in order to produce a behavioral change. The keynote speakers also elaborated on how student engagement consists of episodes and the goal of the instructor is to re-engage students during the episode of disengagement where it easier to re-engage students who are frustrated during the learning process as opposed to bored students. Tasks that are more flexible and leave room for creativity contribute to higher student engagement. Likewise, bookmarking pages is also related to higher user engagement. However, more online activity (e.g. clicking, scrolling, etc.) leads to lower user engagement, which may partially be explained by the poor design of the user interface, which might cause difficulties in navigation. What is also surprising is that the higher student engagement does not exactly lead to increase in learning. There are instances where a decrease in engagement may lead to increase in learning.  What do you think of these findings?</p><p>	Notwithstanding, the workshops took place after the keynote presentations, and were each five hours long and quite intense. The two workshops that I selected were the Python Bootcamp and Text Mining Analysis using R. The workshop organizers provided a link to their GitHub repositories that contained all of the materials, including the code, needed for the workshop since not all of the material was covered given the time constraint. The participants were given lunch and coffee breaks, which were used for networking opportunities and exchange of ideas or knowledge.  </p><p>	 Overall, the summer institute was very effective and productive in regards to networking and acquiring or perfecting skills. In case you are interested, next year’s LASI (LASI 2020) will be held at Columbia University, and will be co-hosted by Columbia University and NYU.  </p><p><strong> </strong></p>
