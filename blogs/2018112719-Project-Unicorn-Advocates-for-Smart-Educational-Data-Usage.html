<p><i>"Technology will never replace great teaching. Rather, it can help educators to inform instruction, save time, and improve student outcomes."</i> (<a href="https://www.projunicorn.org/for-teachers">Project Unicorn</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Advocating for Data Smarts</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.projunicorn.org">Project Unicorn</a> is an initiative to get more schools and teachers using data in safe, understandable, and productive ways. The term they use to describe their mission is <i>data interoperability</i>, where interoperability means using technology systems or software to collect data, then actually use that data to make changes. Project Unicorn values data in education, but thinks that unless teachers and schools learn how to use that data, it won’t make a difference.</p>

<p><b>Resources</b></p>
 
<p>The group has several different resources to help schools and teachers with data interoperability. Their biggest effort has been to create <a href="https://www.projunicorn.org/pledge">a pledge</a> that districts, schools, networks, and vendors can sign, committing themselves to strive for greater data interoperability in their own contexts. Project Unicorn hopes that with enough pledges, edtech creators will take data interoperability more seriously and design products that meet this need. Since Project Unicorn’s launch in August 2016, 419 school districts and charter school networks have signed this pledge.</p>
 
<p>Another resource available for districts on Project Unicorn is an <a href="https://www.projunicorn.org/the-rubric">interoperability rubric</a> to help assess where individual schools fall. The rubric includes six types of student data, and schools assess themselves on a scale of four different levels for each. This could help school leaders recognize where their current data collection process falls and develop goals for the future.</p>

<p><b>Aiming to Change Education</b></p>
 
<p>Project Unicorn also participates in many events throughout the country, including hosting data interoperability bootcamps. Through these various outreach methods and resources, Project Unicorn advocates for data interoperability in education and supports teachers and schools in their efforts to use data in a more effective way. Project Unicorn thinks using data in a smarter way will only improve instruction, parent-teacher relationships, and a school’s impact in a community, and they hope to get enough districts and vendors committed to making a big difference.</p>
