Physics teacher Andrew Vandel Heuvel’s lifelong dream was to be an astronaut, until his sleeping passion for teaching awoke. From then on, his space-related conquests came in the form of lessons on planetary motion gravity. But Andrew has proven to be no ordinary teacher; for one, he teaches online advanced physics to students whose schools lack the offering. His mission is to make each lesson different from the last by putting his own innovative stamp on them. <p>

So it would follow that he would be one of but a few entrusted to experiment with Google Glass. Donning his expensive specs and putting his renegade teacher reputation to the test, Andrew hopped a plane to journey to a most educationally exotic destination: Switzerland. From there he took his advanced physics students on a live, virtual tour of the one and only Large Hadron Collider. <p>

Andrew’s experience opens up a world of possibilities for education. Assuming they can get their hands on one, how else might teachers and students utilize Google Glass in class and beyond? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9853">Leave your thoughts</a> in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues. <p>

<b>@0:09 MartinPaper:</b> Anyone else notice this message Andrew [seemingly] wrote to himself? It's a reminder that his job as a teacher isn't to simply explain concepts, but to "create instructional challenges." If only everyone took such an approach to learning. <p>

<b>@2:03 Clark:</b> The POV perspective that the Glass tour provides really is something else. It highlights the reality of the situation and the live Q&A/demonstration makes for an all-in-all engaging experience. <p>
