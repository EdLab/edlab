<p>The <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIq_yHravX4QIVyCSGCh3P5gtvEAAYAiAAEgKwiPD_BwE">Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</a> aims to support young women interested in computer science and connect them to resources that will help them thrive. Over the course of the seven week program, the girls work in teams on a project. This group of young women created "The Truth Behind Us," a website that features stories of women who have made an impact in various professional fields. The teamâ€™s goal was to give girls of all ethnicities female role models who can inspire them to pursue their professional dreams.</p>

<p>Girls Who Code partners with organizations in the community that want to support their mission of closing the gender gap in the technology sector. The creators of "The Truth Behind Us" worked with professionals at <a href="https://salido.com/">Salido</a>, a restaurant technology company, to turn their website into a mobile app. Together with their partners, Girls Who Code is working to lift up the young women poised to transform the technology industry. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:56 Melanie Hering:</b> Companies that collaborate with Girls Who Code and other organizations giving minoritized communities in tech a voice are opening up important networks to those who might not have access to them otherwise. Beyond creating career opportunities, the ability to connect with successful individuals, especially other women, through networks like these are a big next step for Girls Who Code.</p>

<p><b>@02:05 Hobie Terpeluk:</b> Girls Who Code might be a nice alternative for teens who feel like they've outgrown the interest groups of their youth (e.g. Girl Scouts)... There seem to be similar social and intellectual benefits, just with a more career-oriented message/mission. </p>
