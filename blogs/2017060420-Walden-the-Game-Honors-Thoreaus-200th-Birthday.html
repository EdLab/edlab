<p>Anyone familiar with Thoreau will understand why a video game on his best known book Walden is ironic, to say the least. <i><a href="http://waldengame.com">Walden</a></i> is a game that places players in a digital replica of Walden Pond. There, they experience the lessons of survival and contemplation that Thoreau did in his two-year stay by the pond. The goal of the game is to acquaint players with Thoreau’s life and words and to transfer some of the contemplative elements of nature to the computer screen. Created by the <a href="http://www.gameinnovationlab.com">USC Game Innovation Lab</a>, the game is slated for official release in time for the 200th anniversary of Thoreau’s birth this summer, and <a href="https://gameinnovationlab.itch.io/walden">will be available</a> for $18.45.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p><i>Walden</i> truly brings new life to the pages written by Thoreau almost two centuries ago. Playing the game, I experienced his life at Walden Pond across eight seasons, including both what he did to survive and the moments of reflection he later turned into beautiful prose. As players explore the vast expanse of the pond, they must survive by collecting and harvesting food, maintaining shelter and clothing, and earning money doing odd jobs. In addition, they are encouraged to increase Thoreau’s inspiration level by reading books, reflecting by fires and water, and simply listening to nature’s soundtrack of animal calls.</p>
 
<p>The game brings not only the atmosphere of Walden Pond to life, but the actual words Thoreau wrote there as well. Players can interact with almost any object in the game, and Thoreau’s own words on the subject pop up on the screen. These snippets are collected in a digital version of Thoreau’s journal, which users are prompted to read at the end of each day in the game. In addition, players can read actual letters sent to Thoreau and other literature that he had in his cabin, such as the Farmer’s Almanac. These details infuse the words and education of Thoreau into the digital environment and made both more real and poignant to me as I played, even sitting hundreds of miles away from the real Walden Pond.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite many of the game’s great features, <i>Walden</i> is not for avid gamers who get frustrated by finicky controls. That’s not to say that the game’s controls are a nuisance, but rather that they are not as smooth or easy-to-use as mainstream video games. While this simply added to the patience-building reflection in the game for me, that might not be the case for all. In addition, my inner-scholar (the nitpickiest version of myself) wished that the snippets of Thoreau’s words came attached with page numbers so that I could place them within the actual text.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Henry David Thoreau writes in Walden, "Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth." Here’s the truth, Thoreau: the video game created 200 years after your birth is a fantastic tribute to your life and work. You might prefer wandering the outdoors to sitting on a desktop computer, but I think you’d appreciate the fact that this game brings some of the serenity and inspiration of nature to a person even as they sit behind a screen. Perhaps the most telling part of the game’s success? I’m off for a hike in the woods.</p>
