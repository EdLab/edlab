<p>More instructors are including gamification in their courses, whether they’re online or in person. Gamifying class content could include turning lessons into competitions, doling out rewards different from grades, or creating playful scenarios based on the subject matter. The effects of gamification on learning are not always positive, however, and a researcher from Arizona State University recently analyzed how certain techniques affected an asynchronous online class.</p>
 
<p>Over the course of one semester, one section of an introductory political science course at a large public university used a gamified online discussion tool for class assignments and conversation. A second section of the same course taught by the same professor used an online discussion tool that was not gamified. Overall, 70 students participated. Course content and assignments were exactly the same.</p>
 
<p>The only real difference between the sections was that for the gamified group, grades were not a motivating factor. Rather, students received badges, reactions, and awards, and a progress bar reflected the quality and quantity of their online contributions. Students in the gamified group ultimately worked toward certain prizes, such as being able to submit an assignment two days late. Another prize added two bonus points to their class grade. Students in the non-gamified group only received regular grades.</p>
 
<p>The researcher analyzed students’ performances as well as their reactions to the online discussions. In particular, she looked at three factors: sense of community, participation, and cognitive thinking. She found that while most participants in both groups had overall positive reactions to online class discussions, those in the gamified group said the conversations allowed them to think critically and beyond course content. The researcher also found that students in the gamified group participated more frequently and with generally higher quality than those in the other group, and that awarding badges to high-quality posts was a way for students to figure out which posts to pay attention to more than others. That said, the researcher also found that gamified online discussion did not improve students’ sense of community with their classmates.</p>
 
<p>Finally, the gamification factors only positively influenced students who were aware of the gamification approach. This means that instructors who employ gamification in their teaching should ensure that all students are aware of the process and of the rewards of this type of learning. Moreover, while gamification might not increase a sense of community, it does seem to encourage students to think harder and to make more connections between course content and outside material.</p>
