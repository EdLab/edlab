          <p>
            Last summer, as part of a series of initial offerings for the mSchool, I worked on a course about soccer (or football as it globally known). I've been playing all my life and will continue to do so collegiately this fall. The course focused on modern soccer (commonly called Association Football) and its humble beginnings in late19th century England to the global brand it is today. The course also focuses on soccer's various competitions and the players and figures who catapulted it to become the world's most famous sport by some distance. 
 
Spain's national soccer team, La Roja, recently won its second consecutive European championship, the first team ever to do so. Couple that with their World Cup win in 2010 and many, myself included have hailed them as the <a href="http://espnfc.com/us/en/news/1120894/carlislewhy-spain-side-best-all-time-.html">greatest national team ever</a>. Older fans of the game will point to Brazil's 1970 squad or West Germany's mid-1970s squad as the game's greatest national sides. As Spain rightly took their place as one of the greatest sides, not just in soccer, but in any sport, I often wondered what's the criteria for crowning the greatest, in anything? 
 
For instance, Michael Jordan is considered the greatest basketball player of all time yet he is not the all time leading scorer in the NBA (Kareem Abdul Jabbar) nor does he have the most championships (Bill Russell). Despite not having these records, Michael's consistency in the league, prolific scoring abilities and incredible dunks all contributed to his greatness. His cultural impact, especially his Air Jordan brand sneakers, made him more popular outside of basketball circles and one can argue that visibility inevitably contributed to his greatness.
 
Personally, I think a prerequisite for greatness is the manner in which success is achieved. For instance, one can argue that FDR is the greatest president in our nation's history as his New Deal policies got America back on its feet following the Great Depression and many programs from the New Deal, especially Social Security, continues to have a great impact on the lives of most Americans. Was FDR fortunate to have been elected at that time in history? Would anyone have done a different job than FDR? Does management of crises' contribute to greatness?
 
What do you think are some measures of greatness and why?
