          <p>
            One thing that parents across the country do that shows how important their children means to them is involvement in their education. Although, it is not every parent that performs this kind of responsibility, most of them do and I applaud them. There are those parents who care about every single thing that his or her child does in school. For example, some parents will sit the child down and have a discussion about everything that went on in school on a regular basis.  On the other hand, there are those parents who only care about whether his or her child went to school and came back home safely. This is also good, but what matters the most is the child's academic performance.

According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/nyregion/city-makes-student-test-scores-available-online.html?ref=education&_r=0">article</a>, parents of New York City public schools will be able to see their children's performance on a new set of state reading and math exams next spring. This proposal will take effect at the start of this academic year. I am glad that the Board of Education has taken this kind of decision to grant parents access to view their children's scores online.  At first, parents had to call their child's school or visit the school to find out the scores. However it will now be easier for parents to view their child's exams score by logging into the student information database system known as “<a href="https://arisparentlink.org/parentlink">Aris Parent Link</a>.” I hope that parents will take advantage of this opportunity and use the database to find out about their children's test scores so the $83 million the Board of Education spent on the database doesn't go to waste.
