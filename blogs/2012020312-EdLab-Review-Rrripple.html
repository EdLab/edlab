<b>(Please keep private)</b>
<a href="http://blog.rrripple.com/index.html">Rrripple</a> is meant to be a solution for the media sharing fragmentation of recent years. It's a hybrid of the photo and video sharing, document storage, and link collection. Your uploads are corralled by date in a dashboard called My Wall and are able to be shared with contacts on your other walls. Rrripple also allows users to bedeck and publish a digital portfolio using uploads. 

<b>Pros:</b>
Rrripple is very organized, a must in large-scale file storage. Unlike Dropbox, which relies on a file/folder system based on analog filing, Rrripple emphasizes symbols, time, and tags. Rrripple also seems not to have a limit on storage and is currently offered for free in private beta. It seems probable that a pay or Dropbox-esque share to pay scale will arise in later incantations. Videos and photos upload quickly and file display is good across the board, even links source a small preview of the page for easy identification. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The UI is classy, if a little dark and it's not always easy to move items around in the portfolio though this could be a casualty of Rrripple's born mobile interface. Site definitions also get a little muddy sometimes, it's unclear whether “my portfolio” refers to the personal wall/dashboard or to the public resume users are able to create. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Rrripple uses a very nifty accordion-style calendar view similar to the one used in Pundit and soon to be used in Roomer. The site is meant to be mobile and this type of navigation alongside drag and drop portfolio creation makes it easy on the fingers. File sharing on contact walls enables commenting and discussion which make it good for sharing work among groups. The kind of instant communication, co-editing, and sharing used on sites like Rrripple represents a significant workflow improvement in teacher community and student group work. 

Rrripple also easily produces a good-looking and easily editable digital portfolio, nothing to shake a stick at in a tough job market. There are also a host of training materials on their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/rrripplevideos?feature=watch">Youtube channel</a> if you find yourself stuck. The idea seems strong for demonstrating experience, especially for students coming in to the workforce. The design is spot on right now and will hopefully continue to evolve and offer more view options, digital portfolios tend to look old very quickly.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Rrripple is a bargain and seems like it could be a good consolidation move for users overwhelmed by storage and sharing technologies.
