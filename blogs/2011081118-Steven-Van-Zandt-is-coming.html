            PRIVATE! 

Hi team EdLab!  This Monday August 15th @ 3:00 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Van_Zandt">Steven Van Zandt</a>  of <a href="http://www.rockandrollforever.org/">Rock & Roll Forever Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/news/index.html">Bruce Springsteen </a> & <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/index.html">Sopranos </a> fame will descend on the EdLab!

In anticipation, I thought I would share with you quotes that we will feature in various forms around the lab and a selection of curated vialogues created especially for the event.  Please feel free to suggest a few favorite inspirational ed-related quotes, check-out the above links and add your comments to the SVZ-themed vialogues listed below! 

<b>Quotes to feature around the lab:</b>
<b>Why Rock & Roll?</b>
Adapted from Wikipedia:  <i>Rock and roll is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s,[1][2] primarily from a combination of the blues, country music, jazz,[3] and gospel music.[4] 
Rock and roll began achieving wide popularity in the 1960s.[15] The massive popularity and eventual worldwide view of rock and roll gave it a widespread social impact... 
Far beyond simply a musical style, rock and roll, as seen in movies and on television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language.</i>

<i>There are too many young people who would stay in school if they could just find a reason to stay. Students today are looking for a point of connection. I want to give them one.</i>  <b>-Steven Van Zandt</b>

<i>The history of American music is about much more than just music. In it one finds some of the most powerful voices this country has ever heard, voices from society's margins that used music to make much needed changes. Not only should that history be studied in the classroom, we owe it to generations ahead to ENSURE that it is.</i>  <b>-Dr. Julian Bond, Chair, NAACP</b>

<i>Rock & Roll should be taught in our schools because it is the true history of our people... our struggles & political confrontations are all encoded in this music. & because a country that was founded on the premise of freedom should admit that rock & roll is one of the most brilliant expressions of this desire to be free.</i>  <b>-Jackson Browne</b>

<i>…to provoke our students to break through the limits of the conventional and the taken for granted, we ourselves have to experience breaks with what has been established in our own lives; we have to keep arousing ourselves to begin again.</i>  <b>-Maxine Greene, Releasing the Imagination — Essays on Education, the Arts, and Social Change</b>

<i>By “aesthetic education,” I mean the deliberate efforts to foster increasingly informed and involved encounters with art. -Maxine Greene, Releasing the Imagination.</i>  <b>—Essays on Education, the Arts, and Social Change</b>

<i>All depends upon a breaking free, a leap, and then a question. I would like to claim that this is how learning happens and the educative task is to create situations in which the young are moved to begin to ask, in all the tones of voice there are, “Why?”</i> -Maxine Greene, Releasing the Imagination   <b>—Essays on Education, the Arts, and Social Change</b>

<i>Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.</i> 
<b>-John Dewey</b>

<i>Education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.</i> <b>-John Dewey</b>

<i>Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination.</i> 
<b>-John Dewey</b>

<i>Too rarely is the individual teacher so free from the dictation of authoritative supervisor, textbook on methods, prescribed course of study, etc., that he can let his mind come to close quarters with the pupil's mind and the subject matter.</i>
<b>-John Dewey, Democracy and Education</b>
