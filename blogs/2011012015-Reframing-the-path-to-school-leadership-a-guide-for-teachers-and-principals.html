From the Publisher:

<strong><em>Powerful mental tools for navigating the complicated issues of everyday school life!</em></strong>

Ideal for new and experienced educators, this second edition of the bestseller presents dialogues between a novice and a master teacher and between a new and a seasoned principal to illuminate how reframing challenges can generate tremendous potential for classroom and school leadership. This updated edition provides leadership lesson summaries, solid strategies, and reflective questions that help teachers and principals grow in their practice through the use of four defining lenses:
<ul>
	<li>Political: individual versus group power</li>
	<li>Human resources: individual needs and motives</li>
	<li>Structural: clear goals and responsibilities</li>
	<li>Symbolic: culture, meaning, belief, and faith</li>
</ul>
