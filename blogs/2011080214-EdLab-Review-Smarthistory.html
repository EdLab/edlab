<a href="http://smarthistory.org/">SmartHistory</a> is a free online art history textbook. The content includes discussions of periods, styles, themes, artists, and specific paintings.  The creators emphasize, as is appropriate for an art history textbook, multimedia, and there are plenty of images of paintings, audio discussions, and videos that combine the two. The website also links to a study group maintained on openstudy.com.
<!--break-->
Pros:

The creators of the website, two instructors, have developed everything with an eye to teaching, and have included a couple sample syllabi to guide teachers.  The site is stylish and attractive, and is an easy way to “dip your toe” in the waters of art history.  All of the big names are there, and, under a “check this out as well” column, they usually have some links to other helpful resources on the Internet.  

Cons:

The content is uneven; occasionally there is informative text, but many pages are simply a video discussion, with no accompanying information.  Although there is a fair amount of “framing” content, none of it is organized well, so that the user is left largely to fend for himself.

Our Takeaway:

Although a fun introduction for amateurs interested in casual browsing, I don't think that SmartHistory is, at this point, a serious educational resource.  Most likely they'll expand it in the future, but for now it is about as informative (if more engaging) as Wikipedia.

Edlab Relevance:

I think one danger about all this new technology is that people can get too hung up on the bells and whistles, and neglect the actual content.  On the other hand I like their outside links column; an underutilized aspect of the internet is all that great stuff out there that you don't link to because it wasn't developed internally.
