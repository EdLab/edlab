Dr. Marcel Saucet is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.lcalearning.net/">LCA Learning</a>, an organization engaged in a host of learning activities. His most recent book, Street Marketing: The Future of Guerrilla Marketing and Buzz, was named the USA Best Book Award in Business & Advertising category. He is currently a visiting professor at UC San Diego School of Law.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at LCA Learning?</b><br>
<p>I have always wanted to learn, create, and share. While working on my doctoral thesis, I learned many things about marketing and innovation, and I created a few new innovative concepts. That led me to found my own company "LCA Consulting" in order to share my discoveries with others.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at LCA Learning will change the way parents and students approach the college application process?</b><br> 
<p>By using facial recognition to detect when a student is not focused, and by changing questions of the exam to make sure that all skills are well assimilated, <a href="http://ai.lcalearning.net/">NESTOR</a> will help students whose parents may not be able to help them and, by doing so, I feel it will change the college application process into a more fair-minded system.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br> 
<p>The new Artificial Intelligence program will be a solution and a revolution to the access of education. Today, one student pays $100,000 for a class at Harvard, tomorrow, with Artificial Intelligence, as an example, letâ€™s say 100,000 people in Uganda will pay each only $1.00 for the same class coached by A.I.</p> 

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to LCA Learning? </b><br> 
<p>As I mentioned earlier, my goal is to "learn, create, and share." I have written books and researched articles about Brand psychoanalysis and I founded LCA Consulting to share my discoveries with others. I also did research about innovation in marketing. My book "Street Marketing: the Future of Guerrilla Marketing and Buzz" won the 2015 Best Book Award in the business category, and I created my own advertising agency, "Street Marketing." I also created SM&B, a teaching organization based in Dubai, with world class accreditations. Our students earn their degrees from highly qualified professors, and teachers.</p>
