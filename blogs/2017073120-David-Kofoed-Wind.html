<p>David Kofoed Wind is co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.peergrade.io/">Peergrade</a> and a PhD student at The Technical University of Denmark who conducts research on machine learning and peer review.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Peergrade?</b><br>
<p>Peergrade came out of my own need while teaching a course at The Technical University of Denmark. I built Peergrade to solve a problem that I had in my class, not to make a business. Today I still teach the course and use Peergrade myself together with around 150 students. This experience of using our own product is great and is what has shaped a lot of the decisions we have made. I presently don't do too much technical work at Peergrade, but since my background is technical, I am still able to participate in the very detailed product discussions and lead our work on data science and machine learning.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Peergrade will change how students approach their learning?</b><br>
<p>Teachers are always under pressure to save time, teach more students, and spend more time on paperwork. Unfortunately, the effect of this is that assessment has been reduced to multiple-choice quizzes. As a result, students do not receive a lot of personal feedback anymore and, in many cases, they simply don't get the chance to produce as much work as they did before. With peer feedback, teachers can, in a simple and effective manner, introduce more written work to their students in any subject. Beyond that, students learn even more by not just producing work, but also reading, reviewing, and reflecting on work produced by their peers. Our belief is that peer feedback will be a completely common way of teaching in the future.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think one of the interesting future trends is the way technology and teachers can work together in a very lively fashion. Early technology in the education space has tried to push an agenda of replacing work for teachers with machines. This has been camouflaged by terms such as <i>personalized learning</i>. I hope we will see more tools that augment teachers in the classroom while they teach their class, for example like Quizlet Live, Kahoot, and our own Peergrade Live.</p>

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to Peergrade?</b><br>
<p>Honestly, Peergrade takes all of my time as it should. I am currently on leave from my PhD to focus all my energy on Peergrade, but hopefully I will be able to finish my doctorate on the side. One of the exciting projects within Peergrade is automated analysis of feedback quality. We have a lot of student-to-student feedback with knowledge about the quality of the feedback. We use this data to train machine learning models to be able to recognize feedback of high quality.</p>
