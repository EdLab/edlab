<p>How has children’s media-based play changed over time? A recent study examined the literacy practices of children surrounding the release of two iconic films: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047977/"><i>Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier</i> (Disney, 1955)</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/"><i>Frozen</i> (Disney, 2013)</a>. The 20th Century example was produced based on a television program broadcast in the U.S. from 1954-1955, and featured the fictionalized story of Davy Crockett, U.S. frontiersman and congressman; the 21st Century example was a 3D computer animated musical released in 2013 and based on the Hans Christian Andersen story, <i>The Snow Queen</i>. Both films did well at the box office and had significant merchandising power. The films also captured the imaginations of young fans and led them to play and create in new and inventive ways.</p>

<p>The author conducted a cultural analysis of the two films, by searching for references to Davy Crockett in archival materials and historical publications and combing social media for mentions of <i>Frozen</i> on the Disney website, Facebook, Youtube, blogs, wikis, and children’s fan fiction sites. The author identified seven themes that represent children’s consumption and use of media over time: viral playgrounds, mediascapes, music, brandom (corporate institutions interacting with fans), moral panics, parodic play, and other film-based play and literacy practices.</p>

<p>The study reveals that the features of childhood have endured from the 1950s to the 2010s, including the importance of play and the creativity and inventiveness with which children consume and enact media. The major difference between the two films has to do with the ways technology and commercial culture have impacted children’s lives. In the contemporary information age, both children and adults create fan responses to film texts that become local, national, and global conversations with other people who are also contributors to such discourses.</p>

<p>The study enlightens practitioners and researchers in the field of education to continue to consider the inseparable relationship between children’s play, including dramatic play, fantasy play, and language play, and their literacy practices. Creating a playful classroom environment for students’ literacy learning is essential and can leverage their play and popular culture, their use of digital technologies, and peer-to-peer multimodal, multimedia creations in both online and offline worlds.</p>
