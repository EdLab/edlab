<p>What are the best practices in K-12 online teaching? What common features are shared between exemplary brick-and-mortar classrooms and online teaching? A recent study used thematic analysis to examine best practices based on a literature review of 59 empirical studies of teachers.</p>

<p>The authors identified six best practice cases in the literature, ranging from brick-and-mortar teaching to teacher-student online communication. Major findings reveal that high quality teaching happens when teachers embody four particular traits: curriculum flexibility, clear communication, relationship building, and attention to personalized learning. The authors found that the teachers featured in the case studies were capable of making their teaching differentiated and responding to individual learners’ learning curves, emotions, and motivation; they further made ongoing modifications to curriculum and pedagogy based on changes in classroom teaching and learning.</p>

<p>The best practice teachers were capable of clearly conveying their expectations to students and making communication transparent in the school community. They made developing supportive, collaborative relationships with students and colleagues a priority through a variety of pedagogical strategies and classroom activities. For example, a teacher might use different types of social networking and digital archiving tools to interact with learners. The best teachers were also flexible in their presentation of planned curriculum and used this flexibility to attend to students’ unique learning experiences. All of the four teacher traits connect to and complement one another in creating conditions for optimal learning.</p>

<p>This study reinforces existing literature in teacher education that suggests that teaching is not static; it is a creative sociocultural process that requires constantly listening to and seeing the needs of students. This is true of both offline and online settings. With the continuing development of innovative web technologies for education, the nature of best teaching online continues to resonate with its counterpart in the conventional classroom. Meanwhile, technology has further potential to shorten the distance between schools and families, classrooms and students’ after school virtual worlds, and formal and informal learning. Future research is needed to investigate specific online teaching practices in different K-12 content areas and with different learner groups, but these results paint a promising picture of learning online and offline today and suggest a future that could exceed even our brightest classroom teaching practices.</p>
