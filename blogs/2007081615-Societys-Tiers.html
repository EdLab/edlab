          <p>
            Society has levels: lower class, middle class and upper class, service, treatment and recognition differ according to whatever class you're in.  The upper, unsurprisingly, gets the upper hand in everything.  Better service, better attention, more respect and those things diminish as you get closer to the bottom.  Humans have searched for an answer to breaking these barriers and evening out the field, but if we were to look closer we can see that it's just not possible.

It's human nature to want to have whatever your neighbor has but ten times better, and that's the reason why it would be impossible to make everyone “equal.”  Communism was seen as the answer in the past, and at the beginning it seemed as though it was the answer the world was waiting for.  Everything would be regulated so everyone would have the same thing, but there was a loophole.  The “head” of the whole nation would escape all this equality and in turn take everything that was leftover, making him the most powerful.

The main factor in all these things is greed; the dreaded monster that keeps everyone hungry for more.  Capitalism works because of greed. Communism fails because of it. Greed works in capitalism because it's the driving force that pushes people to become better, have more and as a result produce more and catapult the economy to the top.  On the other hand greed destroys the basis of Communism because of the fact that the one person in control wants to stay solely in control and as a result defeats the whole purpose of an “equal” nation.

There are many different forms of government in the world and many different beliefs and customs, but an ever present theme in all cultures is, the social class.  There were social classes in the Middle Ages and there is a caste system in one of the world's oldest religions, Hinduism.  We can't escape this grouping of people because humans always have to have a system that shows others where they stand.  We are obsessed with showing others our status, and because of this we can't settle with just being like everyone else.

Social tiers affect the world negatively in many ways because of the stark distinctions they create.  Sometimes it prohibits people from moving forward and other times it leads people to their demise.  It's simply impossible to get rid of this system, because without it society wouldn't function properly.  Human beings always need a goal, they need a purpose to live for, and the social groupings provide an answer.  Everyone wants to get to the top, and as long as humans inhabit this earth, there will always be an upper, middle, and lower class, and a race to see who can make it on top.
