<p>Maybe it's been a while since you last received a suspicious email about winning an obscene sum of money, but phishing scams persist, have gotten smarter, and have begun to target social media users. While victims of phishing include people of all age groups, young people are especially vulnerable to these cons. A comprehensive anti-phishing curriculum would help young people build their knowledge of internet safety to prevent them from becoming victims.</p>
 
<p>Researchers in Taiwan used game-based learning to instruct 5th and 6th grade students on the dangers of phishing. Game-based learning is an effective teaching strategy as it can promote learning behaviors, help learners enter a flow state, and develop problem-solving abilities. Flow is the feeling of balance during gameplay between skill and challenge. In addition to pre- and post- tests, researchers used a questionnaire to assess players' flow states and learning outcomes.</p>
 
<p>Students were provided with access to various information sources that helped during gameplay. These included reading materials, practical examples, and a forum discussion with peers. The combination of interaction and reading was the most effective learning model for players in the implementation. Surprisingly, players who reached a flow state did not show positive learning achievement.</p>
 
<p>The results of this study indicate that players can acquire anti-phishing knowledge through trial and error via a repeated gaming behavioral pattern. The authors suggest that educators encourage students to interact with peers when playing learning games. Researchers also advise educators to attend to the difficulty of games to keep all students engaged. </p>
