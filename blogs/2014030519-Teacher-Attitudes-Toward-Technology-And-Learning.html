<p><b>Title:</b> Teacher Adjustment To Technology: Overcoming Cultural Mindsets (2004)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Patricia Baker & Paul Baker</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://baywood.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,5,8;journal,36,164;linkingpublicationresults,1:300322,1">Journal of Educational Technology Systems</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Can teachers’ views of technology be shifted away from finding a purpose for a technology and towards asking why a tool should be used?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>  
This study’s hypothesis is that a teacher’s cultural mindset affects the use of technology tools in the classroom. The authors believe that though technology is commonplace in schools, teachers have yet to view it as commonplace. Baker and Baker argue that if we understand the <i>purpose</i> of a technology, our cultural mindset is more likely to change than if we are simply told <i>how</i> to use the technology. </p>

<p>The authors look at two case studies to understand how a teacher’s cultural mindset can have a <i>positive</i> influence. The teachers of a virtual graduate classroom in the first example sought to foster collaborative learning and a sense of community in an online course. The course included group work and intentionally facilitated the transition from oral communication to written communication that marks the move from a traditional classroom to an online classroom. </p>

<p>In the second case study, the objective was to integrate a student, who was indefinitely sick, into an elementary classroom. The teacher used computers, cameras, and educational programs to allow the eight-year-old child to attend all classes and complete homework during a year and half long period. The other students incorporated the virtually present child, dialoguing with him and playing chess with him during recess. </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors noted that these two cases of technology use were successful because "they addressed two issues: the issue of purpose and the issue of confronting teacher perception and mindsets." They conclude that, with the right teacher mindset, technology can transmit and assess information in conjunction with a core set of learning objectives set out by the educators .</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Several implications may be drawn from these cases. First, the landscape of learning is changing, and with these changes, an openness to new tools and ideas, spatial configurations, and concepts that can enhance the project of learning or overcome barriers is essential.  Second, educators must have a firm grasp on their objectives to use technology in powerful ways. Third, technology tools are more than a vehicle for transmitting or assessing lessons; they are ways for students to appropriate, design and build, alone and in groups.</p>
