<i>Institutions of higher learning, like all organizations, are evolving entities. To the extent that they can adapt to a changing environment, or better yet, lead the change, they survive and flourish. Like other organizations they must also be wary of institutional inertia, the resistance to change that would almost certainly bring about their demise </i> (<a href="http://president.asu.edu/sites/default/files/Building%20an%20Entrepreneurial%20University%20(Germany)%20060808%20Kauffman-Planck%20Conference_0.pdf">Building an Entrepreneurial University</a>)

<b>From Columbia  University to Cacti </b>
<p>
 
Dr. Michael Crow, the president of Arizona State University, believes firmly that "there are no sacred cows in education." Instead he favors accelerated change and a willingness to "tear- down" the more entrenched policies and practices that have traditionally governed the running of a state-funded institution. Where other presidents have feared to tread, Crow, over his ten-year career as president, has used technology as a rallying cry to plunge forward full-tilt towards a more connected and socially embedded campus.  Whether creating a high- tech <a href="http://dt.asu.edu/about">"decision theater,"</a> denying tenure to underperforming faculty or instituting a massive push to move the management of the classroom experience online, while at the same time initiating an unparalleled expansion of the campusâ€™ physical infrastructure, Crow has broken new ground to create what he hopes will serve as a model for the, "New American University."  This ability to throw out the "old" while wholeheartedly supporting an emphasis on research, (Crow has nearly tripled research expenditures) is evident even in his early career as both the Vice Provost and a Professor of Science and Technology Policy at Columbia University.  While at Columbia University, Crow was instrumental in founding the Technology and Innovation Transfer Division of the university and what is currently known as the Science and Technology Ventures group, both of which unite classic research with new, innovative licensing models to "facilitate the translation of academic research into practical applications, for the benefit of society on a local, national and global basis."  This ability to unite policy with practice has been carried through to ASU, where Crow established the <a href="http://lsi.asu.edu/home">"Learning Science Institute (LSI)"</a> which has been described as being developed for the express purpose of "supporting discovery and innovation to advance research that impacts learning" and acts as a connection point between disciplines, whose members are asked to collaborate and share these resources.
