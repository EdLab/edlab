We have been discussing about the importance of <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/12959">audio elements at the LT</a>. With the real-time location information of learners/visitors/participants from Quuppa, we may be able to design a new level of sound experiences. 

This past Tuesday I visited two sound engineers Andrew Green and Juan Aboites at Duotone Audio Group to check out their location-based sound application based on Quuppa system. They have 3 locators installed at their kitchen and coffee break area, and pre-program several sound materials to be triggered at various sub-areas (jazz music in front of the bookshelf area, sound of someone taking a shower in front of the shower room area, street ambient sound in front of the window facing the street, someone talking about the invention of microwave at the kitchen area…)

As I walked around with the headphone, I heard different pre-programed sound. The sound transition between various sub-areas was very smooth, and I ran into this spot (new finding for them too) where I can hear three overlapping sound materials: jazz music, someone taking a shower, and a talk about the invention of microwave. As I moved my body around slightly, some sound materials become more present while others shifted to the background. It was amazing to experience such nuanced differentiation based on real-time location information and movements.

I had a conversation with them about potential applications with their app. Here are some ideas:
1). learners/visitors/participants will get various sound based on their locations. We can design sound cues to facilitate movement (e.g. music from your right to draw your attention to the event or exhibition at that direction). In a sense, this can become a device with audio cues that is similar to what Google Glass can do with visual prompts.
2).  Ambient music can adjust automatically based on how many people are in certain areas (e.g. 3-5 people, light music for small group conversations; 40 people, more energetic ambient sound, etc.)
3). Depending on how people are grouping or organizing in various areas, the music or sound materials they get will be different. 

These sound design possibilities can be realized through speakers, but the experiences wouldn’t be as powerful as those using headphones. 

The app is designed with Unity and can be customized as an iOS app. This app seems to be a great infrastructure for sound design at the Learning Theater.
