<p><a href="http://www.mission-us.org/">Mission US</a> is a series of free, educational adventure games developed by New York Public Media. The series focuses on various eras in U.S. history: the first, <i>For Crown or Colony?</i>, takes place in Boston just before the American Revolution; the second, <i>Flight to Freedom</i>, puts players in the shoes of a runaway slave before the start of the Civil War. <i><a href="http://ca.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/mu10.hist.expan.cheyody/mission-us-a-cheyenne-odyssey/">A Cheyenne Odyssey</a></i>, the latest game and focus of this review, unfolds from the perspective of Little Fox, a Northern Cheyenne boy whose world is encroached by white settlers, railroads, and the U.S. military during westward expansion. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Each task within the game offers opportunities to learn new vocabulary and discover insights from conversations with other characters.  The first-person aspect of the game is immediately engaging. All of the interactions require making decisions, and though the consequences may be far-reaching (i.e., gaining specific skills or traits lead to different options in future interactions) there are no right or wrong answers. This is key: the uncertainty keeps the game interesting, but also helps kids develop both empathy and critical thinking skills by grappling with multifaceted issues. The details referenced in the game allow for a variety of curriculum tie-ins. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p> 
<p>Though some of the the visuals are striking, there are also times where they fall flat, particularly during conversations with other characters. The map navigation works fine, but it’s not very visually interesting. Each game chapter also allows players to skip the introduction, but this is a mistake, as the intro provides valuable clues to the chapter’s course of action. Finally, the game includes some violence and the content can be quite upsetting, if historically authentic. (After all, the game does conclude shortly after the Battle of the Greasy Grass—perhaps better known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Little_Bighorn">Little Bighorn</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p> 
<p>A Cheyenne Odyssey has a lot of potential for successful classroom implementation: the game is aligned to <a href="http://ca.pbslearningmedia.org/asset/mu10_doc_cheystand/">national standards for history</a>, and PBS Learning Media provides a variety of <a href="http://ca.pbslearningmedia.org/asset/mu10_doc_cheyinstruct/">instructional models</a> and other tips for teachers. The game timeline spans a crucial decade in U.S. history, and offers a compelling storyline. From Little Fox’s coming-of-age in 1866 to the Battle of the Greasy Grass in 1876, the game explores Cheyenne daily life as well as major historical events. The subject matter is challenging; though the game is respectful and manages to convey a disturbing time in our history in a way that is appropriate for kids, adults may want to play through first or prepare students for the material. (Even adults familiar with the history of violence and broken treaties may still find themselves struck by the sadness that is inherent in the game.) </p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p> 
<p>An engaging game, and an illuminating look at the lives of Native Americans during a troubling time in American history.</p>
