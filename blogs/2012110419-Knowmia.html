<p><a href="http://www.knowmia.com/">Knowmia</a> is a lesson sharing platform for teachers who are looking for better tools, lesson plans, or class content on various subjects. Lessons can be created with Knowmia lesson creation tools on an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teach/id527216211?mt=8
">iPad</a> and uploaded to the Knowmia website where teachers and students can access them for free. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
The lesson creation tool makes it convenient for teachers to customize their lessons. Teachers can choose to make slides and record a presentation, shoot a video themselves, or combine both formats, in order to achieve their teaching goals. iPad gestures make it possible to draw, type, write, highlight, rotate, or zoom in and out on any image or text added in the slide canvas. This feature is perfect for teachers to edit visualized data, which helps visual learners to quickly understand what’s been taught.  New lessons are easy to upload to the Knowmia website, and the lesson management tool allows further edits to already created lessons. </p>

<p>
Another valuable feature of Knowmia is its free lesson library where teachers can search for the most popular lessons on a wide range of subjects. Every lesson is tagged, which makes searching easier. The lesson library is an ideal solution for users who spend huge amounts of time thinking of effective and fun ways to teach a specific topic. All resources are free to both teachers and students. A teacher can either use a video for his or her own class as supplementary materials, or for students’ homework assignments. Knowmia videos are different from other teaching videos because they present unconventional and innovative ways of teaching that have proven successful for other teachers. Drama, CGI/live action hybrid, and Chaplinian monologue are some creative options of the site. Knowmia is a community that gathers innovative teachers dedicated to exploring and sharing unlimited possibilities for more engaging, more interactive, and more inspirational distant teaching pedagogies. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
We hope that Knowmia won’t let teacher fans wait too long for "MyKnowmia Tools," a homework assignment system that promises to assess and analyze students’ understanding by tracking their performance. However, it remains unclear how MyKnowmia Tools will help teachers analyze student performance data and support customizable solutions to improve the learning outcomes of each individual student. We are looking forward to seeing how much value the MyKnowmia Tools might offer to the teacher community. </p>


<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
The old-school-style of lecturing is obsolete in today’s learning landscape. Shooting a video of talking heads follows the same model, except that teachers and students are not in the same classroom. Knowmia provides hundreds of possibilities to break this model, by sharing creative ways of teaching among teacher fellows. Future possibilities lie in the idea of building up an interactive community for teachers to share their creative teaching practices, adapt both classroom and online content delivery approaches, and multiply the educational power of online delivery modes by developing open online education resources to benefit larger learning populations. <br>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b><br>
Knowmia is a gateway for innovative teaching inspirations.</p>
