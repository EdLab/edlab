Nicholas Provenzano is a high school English teacher from Michigan. When he is not teaching, he shares his thoughts on education and technology on his site, <a href="http://bit.ly/1YVqKPD">TheNerdyTeacher</a> and on Twitter at <a href="http://bit.ly/1ExqYQ7">@thenerdyteacher</a>. He also writes for Edutopia and speaks to teachers across the country about the changing landscape of education. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I was not the most studious person in school. Things were generally boring and I was not engaged in class. It was not my teachers' fault or anything; I just did not like the game of school. </p>

<p>When I decided to become a teacher, I really wanted to help the students that were like me. Kids that knew things, but needed to be pulled into the conversation. For me, I really shined when my teachers gave me the creative freedom in assignments or projects. That is why I focus on Project Based Learning (PBL) in my classroom so I can give students a chance to show what they know in class that a multiple-choice test could never reveal. </p>

<p>One of the best ways to bring more PBL to my classroom was to look at different ways to infuse more technology. Technology allows students to move beyond the poster board presentations. Access to new tools allows students to have a greater freedom to express their thoughts and share their ideas. I want all students to have that freedom and I want to show teachers the power of using more technology in their lessons. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
I hope teachers become more open to the idea that assessments can be more than just bubble tests. I want to give students an opportunity to shine beyond the standardization most schools implement. For me, I want every student to know that there is nothing standard about them by giving teachers the correct tools to help them change the way they teach in the hopes to giving students the best opportunity to learn and grow. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
I see maker spaces as an important trend to keep an eye on in the near future. They allow more creativity in the classroom and in schools in general. Education needs this movement to continue to grow and take root across the country. Students need to be given the tools to be critical thinkers and problem solvers. This will help in getting more people in STEM and STEAM programs that can help tackle the huge problems the world is facing. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
I'm currently working on helping getting the Digital Citizenship Summit in the U.K. It is a great event to promote responsible digital use for students and educators. There was a successful event in the U.S. in October and I jumped on board to help organize one in the U.K. I'm really excited to help spread the word about appropriate use of technology and social media around the globe. </p>

<p>I'm always working on spreading the value of maker spaces around the country when I speak at conferences. I love setting up examples for teachers to play with and then sharing the stories of the things I have seen students create and share. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I am on Twitter (<a href="http://bit.ly/1ExqYQ7">@thenerdyteacher</a>) and some of the interesting people I love on there are <a href="http://bit.ly/1zsx9aK">Steven Anderson</a>, <a href= "http://bit.ly/1yRIcXV">Adam Bellow</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1x2MNGz">George Couros</a>.</p>
