<a href=" http://linkd.in/15xtQCM">Eileen Murphy</a> is the founder and CEO of <a href=" http://bit.ly/15xtUCv">ThinkCERCA</a>, a platform that provides the tools and resources teachers need to work as a team to teach critical thinking across disciplines in grades 4-12. ThinkCERCA was one of the top winners in the Literacy Courseware Challenge by the Gates Foundation. Murphy previously served as a classroom teacher and was also Director of Curriculum and Instruction for over 100 of Chicago’s highest performing schools. In that role, Murphy saw the role technology could play in education and left to design a solution that supported students and teachers, but also school and district leaders in personalizing learning. Murphy holds a B.A. in the Teaching of English from the University of Illinois at Chicago, an M.A. in Writing from DePaul University and an M.A. in School Leadership from Northeastern Illinois University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> 
I was an English teacher for 15 years, before authoring a book on how to teach critical literacy (what most people might call analytical reading and academic writing.) I then worked in Chicago Public Schools at their central office. Working with CPS gave me the chance to learn about the impact principals can have on classroom instruction and how challenging it can be to improve instruction at scale. Principals and teachers had so few resources and many competing demands for their time and attention. Differentiation and new standards were just really hard to tackle. Spending time in meetings or shifting physical resources around the building wasn’t a realistic answer.
<p>
I realized then that the only way to tackle today’s teaching challenges was to leverage technology. I also knew that the kind of technology we had been selling to schools was for computer labs and not classrooms. The technology was built for the siloed teaching models that we knew were outdated. We needed something new that would help schools reorganize themselves around student growth, without stripping out deep content knowledge in favor of skills-based work. After all, kids come to school to learn from others who are knowledgeable. They don’t come to sit in a cubicle clicking on multiple-choice questions, just as teachers don’t sign up to just plug kids into those cubicles and read data.
<p>
ThinkCERCA helps schools organize themselves around the one thing that matters in all grade levels and subject areas: critical thinking. If you can read and think critically and gather and express your ideas effectively in writing, you are ready for college and for the workplace. It takes a whole school to teach those skills, not just a writing teacher or a reading app. The tasks students need to be engaged in every day go well beyond multiple choice assessment practice.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
My goal is to help schools find the right balance between online and teacher-led instruction. Right now, we have a one-or-the-other approach, but neither really works alone. We’re social beings, so we need a blend.
<p>
Great instruction is just as important with or without technology. Teachers and peers still create a context where effort is meaningful. Technology helps make the most of those learning experiences. One way that ThinkCERCA delivers lessons is by challenging learners to debate with each other. Incorporating this in-person discussion is an important part of learning with ThinkCERCA. This allows teachers to build relationships with their students, personalize their training based on each individual, and help them move to the next best steps in their education based on where they stand.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
Rethinking the use of time and space so that student autonomy and great teaching is truly valued by organizations. Right now, we waste a lot of time in schools simply because we don’t have technology to do certain jobs for us. For example, the most valuable resource a student has in school is a teacher. Yet, when you look at teacher evaluation frameworks nationally, you would be hard pressed to find one that mentions planning for one-on-one and small group opportunities during class time. Instead, they all outline specific presentation skills in their criteria. Imagine the outcomes we would have if technology delivered high quality instruction and schools were organized to give teachers time during class to help students with writing or math skills. Imagine if workloads for teachers were actually light enough that teachers could meet with colleagues to discuss the progress of the students they share.
<p>
Today’s educational systems are based on assumptions that fit a paradigm from the past, but don’t take into account the challenges of real classrooms today. Teacher accountability systems are tied to individual student growth, yet the design of schools is based on moving groups forward at the same time in the same way. We need to organize schools so teachers and students can actually achieve what they are all trying so hard to achieve.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
We have spent the last couple of years developing technology that automates teaching and learning workflows that have not been automated in the past. We focused on delivering great instruction to achieve efficacy for students and usability for teachers in our initial iterations of ThinkCERCA.
<p>
What we need to focus on going forward is a new kind of intelligence in our literacy software that takes into account the complexity of literacy, thinking, and learning of social humans in learning communities. Numeric algorithms that tell us about text complexity, for example, are not smart enough to tell anyone about a student’s background knowledge, interests, or motivation. If the student has never heard of Hitler, they are going to get the reading question wrong, regardless of their ability to read an equally challenging or more challenging text on a topic with which they are familiar. In addition, algorithms aren’t smart enough to know that a student missed breakfast or meant to say this versus that, the kinds of things teachers know. We will strive toward building the capacity of thinking humans through our technology until we can crack some new algorithmic codes that can better handle the complexity of humans and their ideas.
