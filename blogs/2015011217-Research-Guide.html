The connection between musical ability (including prior music education) and tonal language learning.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Process</b></span>

I started a fairly vague "question" to simulate reference questions that might come from people just beginning to narrow down a topic of inquiry, whether for a paper or for a literature review preceding investigative research. My goal, if someone came to me with one of these, would be to facilitate exploratory seeking, or “<a href="http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~tefko/Courses/e530/Readings/Bates_Berrypicking.pdf">berrypicking</a>,” allowing the researcher to select and discard potential sources based on the way his/her needs might shift or focus during the conversation. I started with really broad keyword searches on federated search interfaces that were likely to get me some generally relevant (and probably lots of irrelevant) results. Then, I narrowed down the search techniques based on various aspects of relevant results, including terminology found in the text of relevant results, subject terms in the metadata of relevant results, authors with multiple publications on the topic, suggestions of databases in SuperSearch results, etc.

One issue that I ran into was that I had to sort through quite a number of irrelevant results in initial broad searches because “tonal language” is a term used in music that doesn’t mean what I wanted it to mean. My biggest problem was that I stopped being able to imagine what a topical scholar-expert would really be looking for after that first round of narrowing down. Would the expert start having topical needs involving words and concepts that I don’t grasp very well (ex: the neurological causes of amusia)? If so, how would I reassure the researcher that I could help him/her unlock access to key literature for possibly-esoteric research?
