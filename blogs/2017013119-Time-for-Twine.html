<p>Big City Interactive Fate Machine, Character Creator, and Artist Survival Simulator are some of the titles you’ll see available on <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine 2.0</a>. This interactive game/storytelling generator brings a unique new spin to digital cognitive development tools. It engages in creativity, decision making, planning, storytelling, and gaming to create interactive experiences for audiences.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Twine is an open-sourced, free to use platform that can take the form of a presentation, a story, or a game. One of the games I played, Artist Survival Simulator, helped me understand how to survive on an artist’s budget, balancing inspiration and finances; overall it was challenging and fun. The tool makes it simple to connect nonlinear passages to create stories that an audience member interacts with to guide the plot. You need minimal coding skills to make a fun Twine. Whatever you create is yours to share or sell, and the possibilities are only limited to your imagination. The original version of Twine was created in 2009, but the new updated version released earlier this year has a more intuitive interface and greater options for responses with it's unique <i>Twine Code</i>.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The platform requires some basic code skills to use effectively, which can be discouraging to some. I had to refer to the tutorial video to understand how to make the story connections. However, once I understood <i>Twine Code</i>, it was easy to create and connect passages. In addition, adding scaffolding directly onto the platform to help beginners could increase the number of users and make it simpler for those who do not know coding. It can also be challenging to get started without a prompt as you are provided a completely blank page to fill in any way you wish, which can be daunting for some students. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I am sure I'll use Twine for my next presentation, as it offers audiences the chance to take in information and interact simultaneously, putting the traditional PowerPoint to shame. For educators, this can be a great interdisciplinary tool to encourage creative writing and introduce students to coding. In a world where most games stifle creativity and the imagination, I have to commend Twine for using technology to encourage creation.</p>
