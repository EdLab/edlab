          <p>
            Today I tried out Critter for the first time ever. I had no clue what Critter was or how it worked so hopefully my naivete of it will provide a fresh viewpoint for this project. 

I think Critter is a great idea and it could be a fun way to share comments with your friends about a wide variety of videos. It also seems user-friendly and the help section is thorough and does a nice job of explaining how Critter works and what it is all about. I do have a couple of hopefully helpful suggestions that I thought of as I was trying out Critter for the first time. I would like to preface my suggestions with the comment that I am giving this advice from a purely layman perspective, but I hope that it gives a sense of what the average person might think during the Critter experience.

One suggestion that I had was to have the option of making the videos fullscreen. I think that YouTube and other sites have spoiled me, but I definitely like having that option especially since some videos are in widescreen format (like the theatrical trailers). I'm not sure if this is possible with the format the videos are uploaded in, so if it's not then disregard my suggestion.

My second suggestion is to have the option to have interactive discussions be either private or public or to just have a few discussions public so new users can see real examples of how discussions work. As a new user, I was a little timid to create groups and start discussions without seeing a real discussion first. I would have liked to comment or read the commentary of real discussions before I began creating my own discussions. 

Other than that, I really liked Critter and think that it has a lot of potential.
