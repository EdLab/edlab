<p> The refugee crisis is one of the world’s most intractable problems. According to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/key-facts-and-figures.html/">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>, there were 9.5 million refugees at the end of 2014. Even more disturbing, 59.5 million people have been forcibly displaced around the world. Unfortunately, this problem looks likely to persist. The <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/21/top-global-risks-wef/?utm_content=buffer6aeeb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">World Economic Forum</a> 
predicts that large-scale refugee flows will be one of the world’s most pressing problems over the upcoming decade. As a result, many refugees will face unrelenting pressure to survive, potentially losing hope and giving in to despair.  </p>

<p>Muzon al Meliha fights to keep cynicism and hopelessness at bay—not only for herself but for others. She is a 17-year-old Syrian refugee who lives in a camp in Jordan. Muzon transcends her problems by advocating on behalf of education for girls and young women in the Jordan refugee camps that surround her. Muzon understands these challenges personally—she faces her own struggles to become educated. For example, her family does not support Muzon’s academic goals. "Even though a girl might want to study, her family prefers marriage," says Muzon. Given her challenges, Muzon’s courage is inspiring. Even in the midst of desperate times, she demonstrates that we can gather strength within ourselves to help ourselves by helping others.  </p>

<p>How do you advocate for vulnerable people around you, like refugees with few opportunities for education? Are you able to use technology to help refugees and the less fortunate around the world? Tell us about the potential of using digital tools to assist global humanitarian causes, such as education for refugees, in the ongoing discussion <a href="
https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/26577/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:47 jennyshen:</b> It's incredible to see how nowadays, social media and online publications can get one person's story out to every corner of the globe. I'm sure al Meliha felt inspired by Malala's story, and now al Meliha's story can serve as an educational inspiration to others as well.</p>

<p><b>@01:06 Sanda.amani:</b> Education is a form of salvation for Meliha. Inspiring change and tackling the corrupt system she lives in motivates her peers to transcend the difficulties [they’re] experiencing. </p>
