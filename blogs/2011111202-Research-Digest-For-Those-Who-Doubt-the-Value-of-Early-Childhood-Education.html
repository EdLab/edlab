            <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentID=15440">Camilli, G., Vargas, S., Ryan, S., & Barnett, W. S. (2010). Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Early Education Interventions on Cognitive and Social Development. <i>Teachers College Record, 112</i>(3), 579-620.</a>

Education researchers Gregory Camilli, Sadako Vargas, Sharon Ryan & W. Steven Barnett conducted a meta-analysis of early childhood education studies to determine whether there was in fact any truth to the claim that benefits to ECE investment are lost in subsequent years. While the consensus is that investment in early childhood education has the biggest bang for the buck, ECE has its share of skeptics (largely fellows at conservative thinktanks who do not think HeadStart is a worthwhile investment). 

<b>Description:</b>
The ECE studies that were analyzed had to meet a set of conditions. The programs/interventions studied had to be center-based and provide services directly to the children for at least 10 hours/week over a two-month period. The programs/interventions had to focus on language/cognitive development (excluding special needs students) and needed to be implemented post-1960. Every study included some control group to compare against. The randomized selection of these studies led these researchers to the conclusion that that there is indeed a significant long-term benefit (especially in terms of closing the achievement gap) to ECE. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
We've been discussing on the EdLab blog the disillusionment with higher education. Indeed, the returns to higher education for the average person have been highly overrated. Yet instead of simply saying that we need to cut funding for higher education, it might be wiser to re-direct existing funding to ECE instead. Given the benefits, it seems that there is an equal under-emphasis in the ed-tech world. The empirical evidence certainly tells us this is where we edtech folk should be focusing.
