<p>In this study, researchers measured teachers’ ability to develop their TPACK, or technological pedagogical content knowledge, in math and science classrooms. The teachers, who taught grades K-8, were in a three-year-long online Master’s program for practicing teachers of math and science, and worked to apply their own increasing knowledge of the benefits of technology in the classroom throughout the three-year duration of the study.</p>

<p>The intent of the authors was to observe how effectively the teachers were able to form their own TPACK and execute it. The researchers took inspiration from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), both of which stress the importance of teacher implementation of technology in math and science curricula to further foster critical thinking skills. In order to adequately determine how successful teachers were with their individual TPACKs, the authors analyzed self-assessments and interviews with the teachers and observed some of the lessons in which the teachers tried to use technology to further student knowledge. They created their own rubric to use as a guide in measuring the progress of the subjects, which is included in the article.</p>

<p>The findings of the study demonstrated a disconnect between teacher perceptions of their own TPACK development and their actual implementation of technology within their lessons. Many teachers indicated on their self-assessments that they were farther along in their TPACK than the observers found while watching the same teachers in the classroom. The researches theorize that this may be because of teacher comfort with technology for personal use, but they are firm in their assertion that TPACK is an entirely different method of technology usage, requiring different skills and methods. The authors also observed that the studied teachers would often become comfortable using a single digital technology in their classroom, and would make no efforts to explore other platforms.</p>

<p>Overall, this study indicates that teachers, even those in a graduate program designed to increase their TPACK, struggle with fully incorporating a variety of digital technologies into their original lesson plans. Educators may need to take a few steps outside of their comfort zones to learn new platforms along with their students.</p>
