<p>Robots made in the image of animals is no stretch of the imagination, but plant-inspired robots, though less intuitive, might have just as much to offer. Vines, for instance, can weave through tight spaces and around structures. Interested in how these properties might be put to use in the field of robotics, mechanical engineers at Stanford University have been developing soft robots that look and function like vines. The difference is that these bots can grow much faster, thanks to an inflation machine positioned at their bases.</p>

<p>Made out of plastic and fabric, these flexible and shape-shifting vine robots extend outward as they are filled with air, and can explore hard-to-reach locations, configure themselves into 3D structures, and adapt to the space around them. Since these robots can create their own shapes and structures, the team hopes that one day they will be able to weave themselves into novel shapes based on the functions required.</p>

<p>In what other contexts could this device be used to teach us more about different places or environments? What intrigues or concerns you about bio-inspired bots? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44731">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:26 Morgan Platt: </b>In addition to reaching inaccessible small crevices, assisting in search and rescue scenarios, and performing inspections, this technology would also be helpful in accessing areas deemed too harmful for human contact. Areas where perhaps inhaled fumes or dust would be toxic, for example.</p>

<p><b>@01:40 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>I like that these scientists are modeling their robots on nature, with a view to helping us better live within the world. It makes their use seem natural and supportive as opposed to artificial and threatening.</p>

<p><b>@02:33 Monica Brown: </b>Like 3D printing or VR, this seems like a technology that could be used in interesting ways by artists.</p>
