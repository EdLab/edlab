While I am not a TC student, I have long admired the tradition of progressive and innovative learning happening here.  As a former educator, I find TC and EdLab an inspiring place to be for positive change in education and public service.

<em>Where’s your hometown?</em>

Chicago, Illinois

<em>What did you want to be when you grew up?</em>

As a kid, I wanted to be a performer or singer but often daydreamed of having many different jobs.  I knew early on that I never wanted to be bored at work.

<em>What was your first job?</em>

At around 11, I got my first job as a paper delivery girl.

<em>What has been your best job?</em>

I've truly enjoyed all of my work (maybe except delivering papers), but my recent favorite is working as an editor at an indie publishing house and in the past working as a PreK geology teacher at Northwestern University's Center for Talent Development.

<em>Your favorite meal:</em>

My father moved to America from Greece when he was 17, and my grandmother's cooking is my favorite: whether it's fresh baked bread or moussaka, it's always delicious - and at 89 years old, incredible!

<em>Are you a morning or night person?:</em>

I love it when I wake up early, but I'm usually a night owl and late sleeper.

<em>A delicious dessert:</em>

Fruit tarts, chocolate everything

<em>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:</em>

Anything by Selena.

<em>A country you’d like to visit:</em>

I would love to go to Iraq, Iran, and tour the entire Middle East.  Incredible cultural histories, the foundations of civilization, and delicious cuisines definitely call me there.

<em>A book you strongly recommend?</em>

	<li>Coppernickel The Invention by Wouter van Reek</li>
	<li>Press Here by Herve Tullet</li>
	<li>The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman</li>
	<li>One by Kathryn Otoshi</li>
	<li>Lulu and the Brontosaurus by Judith Viorst</li>
	<li>The Magician's Elephant by Kate Dicamillo</li>
	<li>D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths by Ingri d'Aulaire and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire</li>
</ul>
<em>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)?</em>

I used to play and coach soccer, but also enjoy running, swimming, and biking.  Basketball is my favorite sport to watch (go Bulls!)

<em>TOP THREE….Best places to read?</em>

1.  Gottesman Library, in the loft of the 4th floor stacks

2. Large comfy sofa, wood burning fireplace: I'm daydreaming of a cabin upstate

3. On one of the treadmills on the first floor of Gottesman!
