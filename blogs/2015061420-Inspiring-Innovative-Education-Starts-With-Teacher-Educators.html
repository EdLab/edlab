<p>Could educational technology courses inspire pre-service teachers to use more technology and inquiry-driven teaching strategies? The authors conducted a case study of 12 pre-service teachers enrolled in a technology-based science education graduate course. In the course, pre-service teachers investigated the principles of heat transfer using temperature probes, computers, and digital microscopes. The authors collected data through interviews, field notes, surveys, lesson plans, and video reflections. They also collected and evaluated the portfolios students created at the end of their student teaching.</p>

<p>The authors found that the pre-service teachersâ€™ own educational experiences and the experiences that they had student teaching did not prepare them to effectively use technology to conduct inquiry-based science lessons. Their student  teaching placements did not provide opportunities to explore digital tools for science teaching due to budget constraints and a focus on teaching test content. Although the pre-service teachers featured in the study were able to meet the science lab requirement using traditional tools, they reported that their student teaching experiences demonstrated that technology use in science education needed improvement. </p>

<p>Though the pre-service teachers reported limited opportunities for learning about digital science tools in their student teaching experiences, they used technology tools in projects and sample lesson plans they created for their portfolios. For example, they included computer-linked microscopes, iPhoto books, and concept mapping tools in their lessons and let their students develop digital maps that might represent ecosystems. They also videotaped their lessons and edited the videos with narratives as a way to analyze and reflect on their own teaching.</p>

<p>The article represents the beginnings of a mindset shift for teachers. Like the participants in this study, many current pre-service teachers are digital natives who grew up with the duality of learning in analog ways at school and digital ways at home. These pre-service teachers were very familiar with the (still very analog) classrooms they entered as student teachers, but naturally gravitated towards digital tools for their own planning and reflection. When this cohort graduates to classroom teaching, they will likely also gravitate towards using technology with their students, but questions still remain around whether they will be able to use it effectively and adaptively. The new technological teaching context will bring new challenges for teacher educators to demonstrate effective pedagogy and to design practicum-based learning experiences for future pre-service teachers.</p>
