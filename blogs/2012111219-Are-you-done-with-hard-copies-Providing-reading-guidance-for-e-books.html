<p><b>Title:</b> Construction of cognitive maps to improve e-book reading and navigation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang-Yi Li, Gwo-Dong Chen, Sheng-Jie Yang</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> E-books are becoming increasingly common, but the experience of reading an e-book can be disorienting. When reading a physical book, it is easy to measure how much text remains to be read, how much has already been read, and where particular content is located inside the book. The process of creating a mental map of knowledge is called "cognitive mapping."  <i><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512001704">Construction of cognitive maps to improve e-book reading and navigation</a></i> explores ways to mimic this experience in e-book reading. </p>

In this study, three groups of computer science undergraduates read the same selection from an operating systems textbook. The control group read an e-book as a student might naturally, the second group was given guidance in the form of a reading instruction handout, and the third group was given a visual cue map and adaptive reading guidance. Each participant was asked to do 10 tasks after reading, including locating paragraphs, pictures, and specific pages within the text. Their comprehension was measured before and after the search tasks. They also filled out a questionnaire about their reading experience. </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results showed that e-book readers that were given a visual cue map with guidance were able to map the text much more easily than the natural and static guidance e-book readers. They were able to navigate the text significantly faster than the control group, though they showed no particular advantage in text comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The findings in this study suggest that the visual cue map and additional reading guidance contributed to the creation of a cognitive map around e-book content. These findings may be important as publishers seek out ways to improve the reading experience of digital books.  Though the authors found that cognitive mapping had no impact on comprehension, further investigation of this subject could reveal cognitive differences in the way we learn from physical and electronic information. Until then, we know that an included text map may help make e-reading more efficient and comfortable.</p>
