            The New York Times had a timely <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket">discussion forum</a> on declining acceptance rates that coincided with the release of admissions results for elite colleges and universities on what is now known as D-Day.

Here's a quick summary of the opinions expressed:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/the-rejection-game">Mark Bauerlein</a> says elite schools compete for, rather than collude to, lower acceptance rates and are hyper-competitive in their attempts to attract the best and the brightest (a bit obvious, eh?)

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/a-dangerous-trend-for-higher-education">Kevin Carey</a>, as mentioned earlier in TiE, had a good piece on the unsustainable trend of declining acceptance rates at elite schools. At some point, acceptance rates will just appear ridiculous and there will be a large pool of talent available to schools that want to become one of the elites.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/parents-need-to-stop-obsessing-over-college">Stephen Joel Trachtenberg</a> says parents should stop pushing children so hard to make it to Ivy League schools and explore the great colleges that are not always at the forefront of conversation. (A bit delusional to think parents, and even students, are going to ease up in the quest to attend an elite school)

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/a-vicious-cycle-in-college-applications">Martha O'Connell</a> claims that the acceptance rate numbers are overblown because applications have become easier to submit. She points to the fact that the percentage of those who make it to their first-choice school has stayed constant.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/the-yale-versus-jail-problem-in-college-acceptance">Anthony Carnevale</a> doesn't worry much about declining acceptance rates because there are plenty of great schools ready to accept Ivy League rejects. The bigger tragedy is the number who cannot attend college for non-academic reasons.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/four-years-to-relax-in-college">Philip Babcock</a> raises the important point that college has become a time to just relax for four years after a hyper-competitive process in high school. The sad fact is that elite schools produce little value added beyond signaling the quality of their students to employers and graduate schools.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/overinvestment-in-higher-education">Richard Vedder</a> seems to think college admissions are the only place where it makes sense to limit the number of consumers. (Isn't that true for most goods and services produced by high-end brands?). He does not adequately explain why we should stop subsidizing higher education though.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/elite-colleges-game-the-admissions-process">Jane Shaw</a> explains the incentives that lead to such low acceptance rates, and then says there are plenty of other great schools worth attending; so don't fret.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/03/31/the-college-acceptance-rate-racket/think-about-the-fit-between-student-and-college">Sean Decatur</a> claims students should choose based on fit, not on the acceptance rate.

The running theme through most of these viewpoints is that there are plenty of other great schools out there. That is probably very true, but one has to admit that it is only getting more competitive to land a prestigious career in finance, medicine, and law. As a result, the signaling advantage the elite schools hold makes a difference and will result in students and parents trying their very hardest to land a spot in the Ivies. There are plenty of problems with how the elites go about their business, but the solutions are not going to necessarily come from more universities catering to students's needs. An undergraduate education gives you an advantage in the labor market, but for all the wrong reasons. Students pay 160k not to gain intelligence but to have that elitebrand name on their resume that signals to employers their ability and potential worth, and it is totally worth it for these students. But the question needs to become how we can make this signaling less costly if we are to get anywhere on this issue.
