<p><b>Title:</b> Leaderboards in a Virtual Classroom: A Test of Stereotype Threat and Social Comparison Explanations for Women’s Math Performance (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katheryn R. Christy & Jesse Fox</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131514001195">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What is the impact of leaderboards in an online learning environment on women’s academic performance?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Gamification is a frequently-discussed trend in education. Many studies have focused on the benefits of gamifying the classroom, and introducing leaderboards is a common method of gamifying digital classroom environments. However, there has been little research on the consequences arising from leaderboard-prompted comparisons. In order to explore the influence of leaderboards on academic performance within the context of women and math skills, the authors placed 80 female undergraduates into one of three conditions: one where men held the majority of top leaderboard positions, one where women held the majority of top positions, and one with no leaderboard at all. The study used a virtual representation of a classroom rather than an actual online course to allow for very strict experimental control, and participants were required to complete a brief math quiz within one of the three variable conditions. Participants also completed self-assessments of their academic identification and their math identification before and after the experience.</p>

<p><b>Findings: </b> The results indicated that while participants in the female-dominated condition performed worse on the math quiz than the other conditions, they demonstrated stronger academic identification. The outcomes suggest that leaderboards can affect academic performance in some circumstances. In this study, leaderboards seemed to inspire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_theory#Competitiveness">social comparison processes</a>, rather than the experience of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">stereotype threat</a>. The participants appeared to make upward social comparisons with the high-achieving females in the female-dominated leaderboard condition; conversely, participants in the male-dominated condition either made no comparisons or only self-enhancing comparisons to the lower-achieving females. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Given that the sample was comprised of only women, it is not possible to generalize the findings to men. Future research should address the questions in the context of a diverse sample of learners. That the study was conducted in a virtual class as opposed to a real online course is another limitation, as there was no natural social connection to any of the names on the leaderboard. Still, the study does deliver an important lesson about some of the unanticipated negative influences that new tools can have on learners. While other researchers have also <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513000031">challenged some common beliefs about the benefits of gamification in education</a>, this study provides empirical evidence that leaderboards can affect academic performance and proves the need for careful investigation of new tools before they are widely implemented. </p>
