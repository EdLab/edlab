<p>Neo, the main character in the famous sci-fi film The Matrix, chartered fresh territory when he found out everything he knew was a lie and the reality he existed in was not reality at all. With the onset of the information age, pervasive misinformation has many confused about what is fact and fiction. In a new study, researchers found that even the most studious experts passively accepted inaccuracies portrayed in films as fact. The study took a fascinating look at the effects of science-fiction films on our perceptions of science, something serious educators and researchers might find alarming.</p>
 
<p>In past research, studies revealed that students who were taught history accurately in class still had stronger memories of fictional films they watched that covered the same event. Their memories resulted in a distorted and inaccurate historical understanding. For example, students who read historically accurate accounts of the slave trade from textbooks, but then watched clips of the film <i>Amistad</i>, found themselves recalling inaccurate scenes from the film as fact.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers wanted to understand the impact of fictional films on student’s perception of scientific facts. The participants were 11 science doctoral students. After watching the film <i>Contact</i>, they were asked to write a critical review of the film. Researchers analyzed their reviews and followed up with in-depth interviews. The study revealed that even these astute graduate students found themselves unintentionally accepting false information in the film as fact.</p>
 
<p>The researchers cite this as a more problematic issue than some may realize, pointing to the reality that the majority of the public, who lack the scientific awareness of these students, are even more vulnerable to the misinformation portrayed in these types of films. They note the need to expand a framework in K–12 education to address the assumptions in science used to propagate false truths in sci-fi films. For pedagogical approaches, the researchers don’t recommend shielding students from sci-fi movies, but instead showing students the films, asking them to reveal their takeaways, and driving the fact-checking discussion from there.</p>
 
<p>One important takeaway from the research revolves around the reality that most of the information we absorb from media is involuntary. We are not often conscious of the messages and conclusions formed in our minds. Though some might say that we can begin to train our minds to absorb information critically, most people who engage with media simply want to sit back and relax, oblivious to any inaccuracies or falsehoods in the stories.</p>
