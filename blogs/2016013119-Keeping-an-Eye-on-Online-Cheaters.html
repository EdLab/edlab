<p>When online courses started to become popular, critics everywhere pointed to the endless possibilities for students to cheat, effectively nullifying the purpose of exams. And although there are certainly other ways to evaluate understanding, some are looking to modify the traditional test-taking process for online classes. For example. the researchers from this study set out to determine the efficacy of using webcams to proctor exams for online courses.</p>
 
<p>Students enrolled in an online course at a Jamaican university were split into two groups—one that was monitored using a webcam and one that was not. Results showed that students who were not monitored scored higher and took longer to complete their tests than those who were. The authors posited that the higher scores could have been a result of being able to reference external sources of information, and that the longer test-taking time could have been due to either referring to those materials or feeling more relaxed. </p>
 
<p>In addition, those who were not monitored reported in a survey that they felt as though they had a greater opportunity to "cheat"—either by working with others or by using external resources—than their monitored counterparts. The authors suggest that "opportunities to cheat" must be reduced in order to lower levels of misconduct in online test-taking.</p>
 
<p>This study has implications for future research, which could investigate other forms of proctoring besides webcam technology, or how students respond differently for recall versus analytical questions while being monitored by webcam. It also could mean big changes in eLearning, as learning management systems may be able to implement webcam-based test proctoring in the future. If so, students might once again feel their teacher’s eyes over their shoulder, even while test-taking at home.</p>
