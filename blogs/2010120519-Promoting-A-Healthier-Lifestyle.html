            As we all should know, eating healthy and being active are keys to living a healthy lifestyle. It helps us fight against one of the biggest problems our nation is currently facing: obesity. Obesity is more common amongst youth, can reduce the life expectancy for an individual and can increase health problems. According to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, nearly one in three young people are overweight or obese, which shows that more should be done to create a healthier generation. Such concerns calls for an increase in projects to help fight obesity to raise awareness amongst today's youth.

Last Thursday, December 2, 2010, I was one of several youth panelists at a <a href="http://www.healthiergeneration.org/teens.aspx?id=5598">youth summit</a>, sponsored by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Scholastic Choice, the Clinton Foundation and Fox5 News, on fighting obesity and living a healthy lifestyle, specifically in an urban environment. There were around 50 people, mainly youth, from all across the city in the audience. I was representing South Bronx United Soccer Club and spoke along other panelists from all over the nation such as Rubi DePerez-Howard, Miss Teen Prince George County, Maryland and Myles Spence of Paul Pierce's FitClub 34 from Boston, Massachusetts. Guest speakers also present at the Youth Forum were Bob Hugel, editor of the Scholastics Choice Magazine, Dr. Sapna Parikh, Fox 5's medial correspondent, Mike McKenzie, NFL free agent and Super Bowl XLIV Champ, and Reed Alexander, best known for his role on the famous Nickelodeon TV Show “iCarly.” Dr. Parikh summed up the even best on <a href="http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/good_day_ny/medical_headlines/invisalign-warning-overweight-problems-20101203">Fox 5's Good Day Show</a> on Friday, “it was like a town hall meeting, but it was for teenagers and run by teenagers.”

At the forum, panelists answered questions based on health and activeness from audience members. The need to raise awareness was one of the key discussion points during the forum. Youth are often ignorant or unaware of their negative eating habits, which may not show signs of obesity, but can put them at risk for future health problems such as high blood pressure and Type 2 Diabetes. The need to start and promote projects was also discussed as they can help those at risk as well as inform people about the importance of eating healthy and being active. After the summit and “jammin' minutes” with Mike McKenzie, the event ended with all participants at the forum (audience, special guests, and panelist) vowing a commitment to promoting a healthy lifestyle. My commitment was to help raise awareness about eating healthy amongst my teammates on SBU, and at school and also taking on challenges such as eating at least one vegetable or fruit a day. I often eat apples and bananas, which are usually served as my daily meal at school and also available to me at home.

It was a very good event overall and I would be more than excited to participate in another forum again should the opportunity come along. It helped me realized the different struggles people face when trying to eat healthy and be active as well as share some challenges I face, even as an athlete, in trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Some of the audience members and panelists shared their struggles as well as strategies in eating healthy, all of which I will try to implement or share with others. So to all those reading this blog, I want you to know that there are always ways to overcome our negative eating habits. Be active, even during times when you spend your days indoor, alone or with a friend, or outdoors. Creative is key and just have fun!!!
