<p>Are web-based modules effective for increasing pre-service teachers’ knowledge and competence? Do participants successfully meet online learning objectives in online teacher education courses? Do teachers like web-based modules better or think they are more effective than traditional classroom instruction? A recent mixed-methods study examined these questions using effectiveness data and opinion surveys from a blended face-to-face early childhood teacher education course in a higher education setting.</p>

<p>There were 19 undergraduates enrolled in the course which featured research-based intervention practices in inclusive settings. Three web modules were selected to blend with face-to-face instruction, representing research on effective professional development regarding <a href=" http://community.fpg.unc.edu/connect-modules/learners/module-1">embedded intervention</a>, <a href=" http://community.fpg.unc.edu/connect-modules/learners/module-5">assistive technology</a>, and <a href=" http://community.fpg.unc.edu/connect-modules/learners/module-7">tiered instruction</a>. Each module was implemented with both in-class instruction and after-class voluntary participation. Module-related online and offline activities included exploration of video and audio content, written activities completed in and outside of class, and small and whole group discussions in class.</p>

<p>The study revealed that students completed 64-85% of the standard written activities required online. Students deemed the web-based modules effective for increasing knowledge and competence, especially for their understanding of specific evidence-based teaching practices. In addition, students found videos related to real-life practice examples and dilemmas to be the most useful resources in their blended learning experiences. </p>

<p>The findings of the study provide a unique perspective for understanding pre-service teachers’ learning from practice in action. Although they may not be able to serve as a substitute for quality face-to-face practicum placements, web modules embedded with videos that convey stories of teaching and family involvement may help pre-service teachers enhance their field experiences and further understand children and families by learning from various real-life lessons.</p>
