<b>Overview:</b>
<a href="http://www.icivics.org/">iCivics</a> was started in 2009 by <a href="http://schoolsofthought.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/19/sandra-day-oconnor-champions-civics-education/">Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</a> as a way to engage students in learning about civics. The site includes several games relating to different aspects of civics (including the branches of government, civic involvement, and the courts), as well as lesson plans and materials for teachers to use in the classroom.

<b>Pros:</b>
Really, anything that can get students interested in civics is good, considering how important it is. While I can't speak for the lesson plans, most of the games are entertaining. The games each allow you to log in to track your progress over all the games that you've played, but you can also play them without logging in (I consider that to be a plus). There are also links under each game to view the related lesson plans and appropriate state standards.

<b>Cons:</b>
While one of the games I played (<a href="http://www.icivics.org/games/win-white-house">“Win the White House”</a>) allowed you to select different grade levels, most of the games had no indication of target grade. Even with “Win the White House” I didn't know about the grade level selection until I loaded the game.

Some of the games were also strange or boring, like <a href="http://www.icivics.org/games/supreme-decision">“Supreme Decision”</a>, in which you listen to Justices argue issues in a case and select a winner or loser. There was a lot of watching and very little interactivity. On the other hand, <a href="http://www.icivics.org/games/responsibility-launcher">“Responsibility Launcher”</a> was simply strange (aim: launch anvils relating to aspects of civic responsibility at citizens).

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Overall, this reminded me a lot of UFR, mainly because it's a curriculum for an important, but typically overlooked, subject area in education. It was also interesting to see how the gamification treatment worked as applied to civics.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Quite a few interesting educational games related to civics (my favorite two were <a href="http://www.icivics.org/games/do-i-have-right">”Do I have a Right?”</a> and “Win the White House”). With all the rhetoric of an election year coming at us from all sides, it's the perfect time to direct students to these games in hopes that they have a better understanding of current events and government. Informed citizens are the best kind of citizens.
