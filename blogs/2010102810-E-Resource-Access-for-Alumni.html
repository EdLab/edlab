            Graduates of Teachers College who have earned either a masters degree  or a doctorate are entitled to a free one-year subscription for access  to a select package of electronic resources. New grads must sign up for  the free subscription by the end of the calendar year in which they  graduated. Instructions for signing up are found on the <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/alumni.php">Alumni Services</a> page of the library's web site. This  special package designed to meet the needs of college graduates includes  six databases.

Education Full Text provides comprehensive coverage of an  international range of English-language periodicals, monographs and  yearbooks. Indexing coverage begins June 1983; abstracts are included  beginning spring 1994; full text of some journals is available beginning  Jan. 1996.

ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) is a  government  sponsored site that provides free access to more than 1.2 million  bibliographic records of journal articles and other education-related  materials and, if available, includes links to full text. ERIC is  sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education  Sciences (IES).

Academic Search Alumni Edition is designed for the research needs of  the post-college professional. The database provides full text for more  than 2,300 journals as well as indexing and abstracting for more than  8,000 journals. The database offers information in nearly every area of  academic study including biology, chemistry, engineering, physics,  psychology, religion and theology, and more. Academic Search Alumni  Edition also includes valuable peer-reviewed full text journals,  offering critical information from many sources.

Business Source Alumni Edition is designed for the research needs of  the post-college professional. The database provides more than 1,360  full text business magazines and journals, of which 590 are  peer-reviewed.

ABI/INFORM Complete offers hard-to-find local and regional business  news coverage of large corporations, privately held companies, local  start-ups, executive profiles, marketing, finance, and industry news. It  provides access to business information not typically found in national  news sources. From 1985 to the present, it contains news and analysis,  information on local markets, and more gathered from major business  tabloids, magazines, daily newspapers, wire services, and city, state,  and regional business publications.

ProQuest Research Library (Alumni Version) provides access to more  than 1,700 full-text journals from 1971 to the present across a wide  range of subject areas, including business, education, literature,  political science and psychology.

You can <a href="http://af8aa8vu6b.search.serialssolutions.com/">search the package</a> to see if your favorite journals are included. Digital Dissertations,  Jstor, ISI Web of Knowledge and the APA Psyc... series are some of the  resources that are not included, but all of the library’s electronic  resources can be accessed from on-site in the library.

On-going subscription to the Alumni E-Resource Package after the first free year is $100.00 per year.
