Article Review
Teaching and learning in an online  environment is not innovative nowadays. The difficult financial climate  makes online learning a more attractive option for many students with  limited resources. Many scholars have been trying to explore the effects  of online learning in comparison with the traditional face-to-face one.  Lester and King's (2009) paper provides new empirical findings in this  regard, and explores an unique online instruction approach that combines  both Second Life (SL) and Blackboard for instruction and learning. 334  undergraduate students who attended a semester-long visual  communications lecture class participated in this study: 161 took the  class in the traditional face-to-face manner, and 173 attended it via  online instruction. Pretest and posttest were administered to gather  students' learning of course content and attitudes toward their learning  experiences. Although authors hypothesized that students choosing online format might be more computer literate and knowledgeable about  the content, results did not support this hypothesis. Furthermore,  course format did not impact knowledge gained from this course. Students  in both online and offline courses offer both positive and negative  responses to this course. More online course takers, however, are  critical of the course format. In addition, this study provides rich  appendixes including sample transcript of online interaction in SL and  sample student responses to weekly discussion boards. 
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;While  the major finding that online students learned just as much as offline  students is encouraging, a further analysis of qualitative data of  online learning (e.g. transcripts of online course interactions,  in-depth interviews of participants, etc) would greatly enhance our  understanding of learning experience in online environment. This is  important because it could expand the narrow definition of learning as  content attainment, which is popularly employed in most of similar  studies, and potentially lead to new research agenda for effectiveness  and effects of online learning.

EdLab Connection
For this past  semester, many Development & Research team members have developed various online  courses that aim to build a community of expertise sharing. While most  of our current works are housed in TC Moodle, and some on Ning and  PBWorks, the online model of Second Life in combination with Blackboard  (or Moodle) deserves our consideration for new course development.  Teaching and learning in virtual worlds such as Second Life could  provide more visual and audio cues of participants that are missing in  LMS such as Moodle, and thus could offer richer learning experience. A  good example of virtual world used in meetings is reported in <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/view/?utm_campaign=viewpage&amp;utm_medium=grid&amp;utm_source=grid" id="db2o" title="Digital Nation (clip7)">Digital Nation (clip7)</a>.  Surely, the cost of such development (e.g. training for SL usage and  longer time for course development) is one concern for this initiative.
