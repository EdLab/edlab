            I'm sure that many of you here at the EdLab might be interested in knowing more about the soccer team that George Nantwi coaches and what the team is really about. <a href="http://www.southbronxunited.org/">South Bronx United Soccer Club</a> is the only fully functioning soccer program (recreational and travel) in the Bronx. It currently has five teams from ages 10-19 with more expected in the coming year. 

As one of the players on the U16 team, most of my teammates have their own story of how they came to be a part of the growing South Bronx United family. <p>

I was first introduced to the team by a family friend  about tryouts for the U19s, an older age group. Having not played for a team in a year, I believed it was a great opportunity to play organized soccer again. It was during the tryouts for U19 where I first met George, who then offered me a chance to play for the U16s, which was my appropriate age group. I trained consistently with the U16s until I was recently given a spot on the travel team. In keeping with the team's tradition of naming every player after a soccer player, I was abruptly nicknamed Milito after Argentina's goal scoring machine <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=198273/index.html?cid=google_playeronebox">Diego Milito</a>. <p>

Being part of SBU U16s has been a learning experience as it has afforded me a chance to meet and friend people from various cultures and countries. It has also given me a chance to play competitive and organized soccer with my peers for free. Most travel teams in New York City and across the nation charge ridiculous amounts of money per player and often times skillful and willing players are left out in the cold because they are not able to afford the steep fees. <p>

I eagerly anticipate the start of the summer season in a few weeks as it will be my first official league season with the team and also looking forward to playing in the league and state cup in the fall.
