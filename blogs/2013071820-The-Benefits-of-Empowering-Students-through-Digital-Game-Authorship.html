<b>Title: </b>Empowering students through digital game authorship: Enhancing
concentration, critical thinking, and academic achievement
<p>
<b>Authors: </b>Ying Tang, Sachin Shetty, Xiufang Chen

<b>Study Design:</b> 
Examples of successful game-based learning activities have been garnering more attention and excitement in education circles. Digital games combine entertainment and education and place students at the center of the learning process.  Recent advancements in the design of games have made it easier for students to create their own games. Educators observe that students who participate in digital game authorship (DGA) show signs of increased motivation, creative and critical thinking, and problem-solving. However, there are few studies to empirically demonstrate these results. This study, funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan, sought to determine whether involving students as designers of digital games can effectively enhance their academic achievement.
<p>
To perform the study, researchers divided 67 seventh grade students from Taiwan into an experimental group that built digital games based on biology curriculum and a comparison group that created Flash animations based on the same content. Students in the experimental group collaboratively created digital games using a simple program, <a href="http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/"target="_blank">RPG Maker</a>, which allowed them to focus on storyline and content, and worked within a DGA framework structured around inquiry-based learning criteria. The comparison group created quiz questions using Flash to design animations, buttons, backgrounds, and sound effects, but without the development of characters, narratives, and challenges used by the experimental group. The two groups were observed over a 19 week period and assessed in the areas of concentration, critical thinking, and academic achievement by comparing pre-test and post-test scores using a variance-analyzing method.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Results of the post-tests showed that the digital games group demonstrated greater improvements in critical thinking skills and academic achievement as well as an increased retention of content. The authors attributed this difference to the inherent challenges of cooperatively making decisions while incorporating specific subject material. 
<p>
The positive correlation between DGA and enhanced critical thinking skills and academic achievement suggests that game designing can be used in science education not only to empower and engage students, but also to improve studentsâ€™ understanding of content. 
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
As more researchers and educators explore the benefits surrounding student-created games, further studies should explore the advantages of pairing similar programming projects with course material outside of STEM. Allowing students to create their own digital games could also be linked to improvements in learning outcomes like creative thinking and problem solving for social sciences and language learning. There is great potential for game authorship to transform the way students interact with and think about content.
