Dylan Arena is co-founder and Chief Learning Scientist at <a href="http://kidaptive.com/">Kidaptive</a>, a platform that empowers learners of all ages and their parents and teachers by creating a vibrant ecosystem of personalized learning experiences. Arena spent eleven years at Stanford University studying cognitive science, game-based learning, and next-generation assessment while earning a bachelor’s degree in Symbolic Systems, a master’s degree in Philosophy, a master’s degree in Statistics, and a Ph.D. in Learning Sciences and Technology Design. He has been a MacArthur Emerging Scholar in Digital Media and Learning, a Gordon Commission Science and Technology Fellow, a Stanford Graduate Fellow in Science and Engineering, a Gerald J. Lieberman Fellow, a FrameWorks Fellow, and a United States Presidential Scholar.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Kidaptive?</b><br>
<p>My undergrad and graduate training focused on cognitive science, statistics, and assessment, all of which are directly relevant to the work we do at Kidaptive. My professional experience as a software developer at Oracle has also helped me to understand and communicate with partners about technical aspects of their system and our solution.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Kidaptive will change the way children learn?</b><br>
<p>We view every conversation we have with potential or current partners as an opportunity to help advance a vision of personalized learning that is consistent with learning-sciences research. This includes, among other things, (a) respecting each learner's agency and dignity, (b) focusing first and foremost on human social interactions, with technology playing a supporting role where appropriate, and (c) considering how to involve the community of stakeholders supporting the learner (parents, teachers, tutors, etc).</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Technological trends: AI-driven advances in natural-language processing and computer vision could lead to more naturalistic human–computer interactions that make technology more peripheral to collaborations (cf. Dynamicland in Oakland for an example of how this might look in practice).</p>

<p>Social/political trends: Huge and growing gaps in funding for education have already driven some schools (e.g., in my home state of Oklahoma) to move to a four-day week, and an aversion to active efforts to integrate schools has led to de-facto segregation that is approaching pre-Brown-v.-Board levels. Both of these trends effectively marginalize entire communities of learners, depriving them of the full benefits of free public education upon which our society depends. Great research has highlighted these problems, but the political will to effect change has not yet materialized. </p>

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to Kidaptive?</b><br>
<p>Becoming a better father, day by day.</p>
