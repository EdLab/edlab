<p>
After years of developing and implementing a variety of educational practices for online learning, educators & consumers are still trying to answer the same set of questions - how effective is online learning? How, if at all, does blended learning enhance learning? What practices and conditions influence the effectiveness of online learning? Dr. Barbara Means, along with co-authors Toyama,Y., Murphy. R., Bakia, M., and Jones, K., have conducted a series of meta-analyses that examine <a href="http://ifap.ru/library/book440.pdf">the effectiveness of online learning</a>. 
<p>

The paper investigated thousands of relevant journal papers from 1996 through July 2008. Among all of the online learning studies (either entirely online or a blended approach with both online and face-to-face settings), only those 45 studies with a rigorous enough research design to yield some effect size were chosen.  The learning content included a wide range of subjects, from computer science, teacher education, mathematics, languages, medicine or health, and so on.  Itâ€™s worth noting that over 85% of the studies were conducted in higher education. The average instructional period exceeded a month in duration and the average learner ages in the studies ranged from 13 to 44.  Most of the studies were conducted on a modest scale (between 16-1857 learners), and only 10% of the studies included more than 400 learners.	
<p>
Among the studies investigated, students performed only modestly better on average in online conditions than those learning the same material through traditional face-to-face instruction. The authors further looked at the effectiveness of different online learning practices, including different sample sizes, types of knowledge tested, study designs, measures of achievement, instructors, and curriculums. None of these yielded a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of online learning. Blended learning was only found to have significantly stronger learning outcomes than face-to-face instruction when the online instruction portion was collaborative or instructor-directed. In those studies where online learners had to work independently, there were no significant differences in learner outcomes. There were, however, conditions that appeared to influence the effectiveness of online learning, such as giving learners more control, or providing individual personalized guidance; both of these methods effectively enhanced online learning.
<p>
This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive summary of our current state of understanding on evidence-based practices in online learning. The results partially confirm the positive values of online learning. At the same time, the results also imply that we do not yet have sufficient instructional design principles to produce consistent advantages for online learning. In the meantime, there are more and more online courses being offered from multiple institutions, which accommodate larger numbers of online learners.  Inevitably this means that it will become much more challenging to validate and compare across traditional face-to-face learning and blended learning approaches. Essentially, more rigorous studies are needed, particularly studies involving K-12 students.
