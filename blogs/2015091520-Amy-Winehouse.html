<b>The Death of Amy Winehouse and Endless Life of Confessional Videos</b>
<i>A film’s use of self-shot videos demonstrates the peril of capturing ourselves</i>

<p>The constant churn of social media impacts students. YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/en-GB/statistics.html">1 billion users</a>. Approximately <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1012167">72% of millenials aged 18-34 years of age watch YouTube</a>, higher than cable TV, Netflix, and network television. Facebook’s newsfeed and Twitter decks relentlessly compel users to add their voice to the stream. It forces students to feed its insatiable appetite for content. We shoot more video and photographs on our digital devices than ever before. It was estimated that  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/selfies-and-2013-2013-12
">880 billion photos</a> were taken in 2014, over 100 photographs for every person on earth. Being social beings, we inevitably turn the cameras on to ourselves. “Selfie” was named the word of the year by the prestigious <a href="http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/press-releases/oxford-dictionaries-word-of-the-year-2013/">Oxford English Dictionary</a>. As a result, selfies and confessional videos have started popping up on the internet.</p>

<p>Mass media also influences student behavior. Confessional videos have long been a trope of reality programming. Television shows like Big Brother include a single camera left in a solitary room allowing reality characters to wax poetic, express mea culpas, and most frequently, lay blame on others. Raised on reality programming, a generation of students has been educated in the art of the confessional video including breaking the fourth wall, and becoming narrators in their lives. </p>

<p>Asif Kapadia’s intimate new documentary <i>Amy</i> gives viewers an in-depth look at this promising singer who left us much too early. The film chronicles a long trajectory of the beehived torch singer’s short, troubled life, from long before she became famous until her end. </p>

<p>One of the most striking narrative devices in <i>Amy</i> is the inclusion of a wide array of confessional videos shot by Amy and her friends, similar to ones students shoot every day on their phones. These behind-the-scenes vignettes convey her sweetness and innocence. Given Amy’s later bouts with drug addiction and alcohol abuse, these snippets create a jarring contrast. The videos convey the essence of a young girl, full of life, who you know will pass before the final spool of film unrolls. What once started with bright light comes back to black. </p>

<p>Life is unfinished and provisional. Circumstances easily spin out of control. And with it, we can lose our grip on life. As well, we can betray ourselves in the simplest acts. A glance away or a stuttered voice can involuntarily let others know who we are and what we believe. And Amy’s consistent portrayal of herself through these behind-the-scenes videos shows her inability to imagine what would become of this footage. Given the good-natured feel of these home movies that celebrate her life, I cannot believe Amy could have ever imagined that the first time they would be widely shared with the general public would be in a reality-based documentary film that concludes with her tragic death. </p>

<p><i>Amy</i> is a sad story of a person unable to help herself. Towards the end, she seemed directionless. She did not appear to have unconditional supporters who should have demanded her removal from the rigors of performing until she had become more stable. Lives are easier to understand when they are examined from back to front, in the stillness that settles in the void after their conclusion. The videos, photos, online posts and other artifacts that we create to chronicle our existence are the fragments of life that will be sorted out and puzzled over to figure us out no matter which way our lives turn. </p>

<p><i>Amy is currently in theaters. </i></p>
