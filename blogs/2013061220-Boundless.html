<p>
<a href="https://www.boundless.com/">Boundless</a> is an <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education-program/open-educational-resources">open educational resource</a> (OER) platform that provides free college level e-textbooks on various traditional learning subjects. The platform pulls its learning content from open source websites and then organizes the content in a way that makes sense for the learner. Every e-textbook comes with flashcards and quizzes so users are able to test themselves after reading.</p>

<p>Boundless also has a collaborative element so users can see what their peers are reading and whether they have taken a quiz or used flashcards. The Study Guide feature hovers at the right side of the page during reading and allows users to take any section, picture, or equation from an e-textbook and add it to a study sheet. They can then supplement the Study Guide with their own notes and export it to a pdf for personal viewing or sharing. Boundless and similar sites like <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/352">CK-12</a> are working to integrate OER ideals into the classroom.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Text content on the site can be easily highlighted and Boundless lets users write down notes in the text. On each subject homepage, statistics are displayed to show the user how much they have read, how many study guides and flashcards they have created, and how many quizzes they have taken. The collaborative element of the site lets users view the notes others have written down for sections of the text.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some subjects on the site do not include flashcards or quizzes. Although it is possible to see the activities of other site users, Boundless has no built-in communication. Expanding with more social features and sharing might increase use and community on the site.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Boundless provides free learning content and a suite of tools to help users learn the material and discover new ideas. Each section of the text contains a feedback system that lets users rate the learning content as good, needs improvement, or bad. </p> 

<p>This rating system could also be applied to the note content generated by Boundless users. The notes with the best ratings would become more visible and possibly even integrated into the work itself. An evolving resource would give users access to the best-rated learning content, whether it comes from an open source or a Boundless user, and it may inspire users to take more meaningful notes. The platform is off to a great start in providing free learning content, but there is much room for it to develop to provide the best possible free learning content.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Boundless lets you freely view and remix learning content. </p>
