            Preschool is supposed to be all about learning and having fun. This is the time every child begins to develop his/her mental capacities. They learn basic numeracy and literacy skills. Many pre-schoolers are occupied with numerous learning materials. This is the way to get children involved in different kinds of activities with the hope that they will obtain a valuable lesson in the end.
During pre-schooling, children learn how to draw and paint, play with puzzles and listen to their teachers read stories. All these activities contribute to the child's development. However, there are a lot of preschool children in developing countries who do not have such opportunities. This vialogues demonstrates the struggle preschoolers are facing in Mozambique. Despite the lack of resources, preschoolers there are still performing well.

Then there are those children who never attend preschool. Children who don't attend preschool cannot read or write or solve basic math problems. However, the children who are in preschool are able to write, read, and solve math problems. In essence, if help is provided for these children, they will be more engaged in learning. Additionally, those who missed preschool will be able to catch up.
