"These touring companies would arrive in some town square and instantly ask, 'who's the biggest bastard in town?'" says head of physical acting at the Yale School of Drama and founder of the Funny School of Good Acting,  <a href="http://christopherbayes.com/bio.php
">Christopher Bayes </a> of the commedia dell'arte theater tradition that swept Italy and much of Western Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. Commedia utilized specific details like this as hard hitting comedic fodder for improv-based performances that aimed to expose corruption, change people's minds, and even change the world all the while entertaining the masses with a kind of unbridled vulgarity, spirit, and physical expression that was in direct opposition to most of the popular theater of the time. Few artifacts remain that go as far as preserving the massive influential legacy that is commedia dell'arte aside from a codified understanding of the archetypical masks that represent distinct characters. Divided into groups of servants, masters, and lovers that create a complex and pervading hierarchy, these masks lent themselves to inspiring the extensive slapstick and often musical improvisations, practiced by actors even to this day. </p>

<p>In the final week of a month-long intensive workshop series at the <a href="http://christopherbayes.com/school.php/">Funny School of Good Acting</a>, Bayes breaks out his trunk of leather masks and invites his students to try on this playful art form for themselves. Through extensive warm-ups, prompts, and group scenarios students are challenged to step out of their heads, into their bodies and truly bring the masks to life. It's not about being right, being clever, or even being funny but simply surrendering oneself to the character; embracing the physical transformation and all the blunders, blows, and lowbrow gags that come with it. Just as commedia players once did in markets and town centers, actors are able to speak about injustices and express tensions through their characters on stage while expanding their repertoire and skill set as performers.</p>
