            What a nice surprise... The New Media Consortium and the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative decided to make my job a lot easier this morning by publishing the <a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/CSD5320.pdf">Horizon Report.</a> The study profiles six technologies that “will likely enter mainstream use in learning-focused organizations” within the next 1 to 5 years. They are:  

<b>Grassroots video</b>
<i>Creating video has become user-friendly with the advent of inexpensive equipment and free(ish) software. Video sharing sites are full of tutorials and other informative videos. The presence of schools and colleges on such sites is increasing.</i>

<b>Collaboration webs </b>
<i>As with video software, it is no longer expensive to collaborate with colleagues because of free open programming interfaces, examples being Google docs and wikis.</i>
  
<b>Mobile broadband</b>
<i>The knowledge of the internet has become even more portable and affordable than ever- network and learn on the go! Let us give thanks in a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Blackberry%20prayer">BlackBerry prayer</a></i>
  
<b>Data mashups</b>
<i>Mashups combine data from different tools and put them into a single tool.  From the study, “the availability of large amounts of data is converging with the development of open programming interfaces for social networking, mapping, and other tools.”</i> 

<b>Collective intelligence</b>
<i>Collective intelligence will continued to be gathered from large groups of people either explicitly (through projects like Wikipedia) or implicitly (by studying the “repeated activities of numbers of people”, like their search patterns).</i>
  
<b>Social operating systems</b>
<i>The organization of a network is moving towards being based around people instead of content: the focus is on relationships.  While most tools are still in the conceptual stages, here are some examples: <a href="blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=7503">Yahoo Life!</a>, <a href="blog.jonudell.net/2007/05/22/hosted-lifebits/">Hosted Lifebits</a>, and <a href="www.hcii.cmu.edu/M-HCI/2007/PittDental/">Team ORCA Project Site.</a></i>



The report places each of the above technologies on one of three “adoption horizons”, or likely timeframes in which the technology will be admitted into mainstream use in teaching and learning.  The inclusions of grassroots video and collaboration webs are expected to occur within one year or less, mobile broadband and data mashups within 2-3 years, and collective intelligence and social operating systems in 4-5 years.
