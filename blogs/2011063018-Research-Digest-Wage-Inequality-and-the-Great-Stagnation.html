<a href="http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/tlemieux/papers/educ.pdf">Lemieux, Thomas. (2006). Post-secondary Education and Increasing Wage Inequality. The American Economic Review 96(2), 1-23.</a>

I should preface this Research Digest with a brief intro to what many call "The Great Stagnation", the title of Professor Tyler Cowen's brief e-book on the slowing of technological change since 1973. Difficult thesis to wrap one's head around given the arrival of the internet, but his thesis is backed up by plenty of concrete evidence, most notably the stagnation in median wages and the slowing of total-factor productivity growth, the key ingredient to making society wealthier.

<b>Description:</b>
Coincidentally, 1973 also marks the beginning of the widening gap in incomes, according to Professor Thomas Lemieux, a trend that has led to record income inequality we currently witness. Professor Lemieux claims that much of the rise in wage inequality can be explained by the increase in return on post-secondary education. Note, this does not necessarily mean that post-secondary education became more useful and led to more productive people. Rather, a post-secondary degree yielded a larger portion of the economic pie to said degree holder. According to Lemieux's model, much of the widening in the income gap has occurred at the top. 

Lemieux uses a variance components approach to measure distribution of returns to education across heterogeneous individuals. His data comes from hourly wage rates as observed by "the May and outgoing rotation group (ORG) supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS). His findings indicate that "only workers with postsecondary
education experience a substantial change in their relative wages between 1973 and 2005."

In his concluding remarks, he points out that it is puzzling why post-secondary education plays such a dominant role in creating income inequality, something I think Arnold Kling has written about on his blog on more than a few occasions (see Schoolyard Brawl posts).

If post-secondary education is widening the income gap, as Lemieux claims, and the rate of innovation has stagnated, as Cowen claims, is there a case to be made that the social returns to higher ed are less sound than most would think?

EdLab Relevance: The main relevance is in how great a force post-secondary education has become in shaping our society. EdLab seeks to find innovative solutions to getting students the knowledge and skills they need in a way that is both effective and efficient.
