            I must admit, I was skeptical when I heard that TC was buying an island in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">SecondLife</a>.  I envisioned that it would lay undeveloped until someone forgot to pay the bill, at which point it would receive the server equivalent of Hurricane Katrina.  However, I was surprised to find that there has been quite a bit of development on the island, including an amphitheatre, cafÃ©, reflection pool with underground room, sand pits for trying things out, power carts, and classrooms in the sky.  Most of it is developed or bought (with Linden dollars) by TC students, except for the amphitheatre that <a href="http://www.electricsheepcompany.com/index.php">the Electric Sheep Company</a> provided.  

I think it is interesting that even in SecondLife, you have to be aware of space limitations.  A cluster of three classrooms are placed in space levitating above the TC island so that they don't take up too much of the island's real-estate.  Since the space around the island may be bought-out at some point, the island's space could run-out, leaving a space issue as real at the one in Morningside Heights. <i>(read more)</i>

Another interesting development in SecondLife is that their client interface has been made Open Source.  I imagine that this could lead to many interesting things for the higher education sector, such as the integration of student information systems (SIS) with SecondLife (e.g., imagine using your University ID to login and gain access to a University-only island).    

Below are some snapshots from the island:
