<span style="text-decoration: underline">From the Publisher:</span> This practical guide presents inspiring, research-based activities for teaching students in grades K–12 how to read and think critically about informational texts. With five essential types of strategies, seasoned and preservice teachers learn ways to help students select engaging, challenging reading materials; develop their knowledge of history, science, and other content areas; master vocabulary that aids understanding; build essential comprehension skills across the curriculum; and write effectively about texts they have read. Each of the 35 strategies features a helpful reproducible worksheet in a large-size format. The teacher-friendly appendix lists recommended books, magazines, and websites for each grade level.
