Pizza is part of New Yorkâ€™s DNA. It's iconic. It's omnipresent. And better yet, it's arguably the best. Between the late 19th and early 20th century, more than 4 million Italians immigrants set sail for the United States, bringing with them a love of good food and mastery of its craft. For the last quarter century, <a href="http://www.goodfellas.com/"> Goodfella's Pizza</a> has continued this tradition.</p>

<p>Opened in 1992, the Staten Island all-service restaurant has been serving up gourmet wood fired brick oven pizza and winning national acclaim. When lifelong pizza fanatic and Goodfella's founder, Scot Cosentino, first set his sights on opening a pizza parlor he relied on trial and error; taking months to master dough stretching and getting the attention of the local fire department more than once. With partner and master chef, Andrew Scudera, Cosentino has invited entrepreneurial hopefuls from around the globe to learn from his early mistakes and enduring success. During week-long one-on-one sessions, students at the 
<a href="http://www.pizzaschoolnewyork.com/"> Goodfella's Pizza School </a> step behind the pizza station and learn the craft for themselves and their future businesses. From day one students start throwing dough and pushing out pies for Goodfella's patrons. By the end, they're ready to open profitable establishments and bring great pizza to their communities back home. And like a family, Goodfella's instructors provide support for their students long after they complete their training; fielding questions, dishing out advice, and celebrating their culinary triumphs.</p>
