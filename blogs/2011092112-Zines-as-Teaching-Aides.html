            If  your goal in teaching is to inspire your class to create works of text  or art, you might consider using zines as teaching aides.  Alison  Piepmeier, author of Girl Zines: Making Media, Doing Feminism,  reports that, “Every time I teach a class about zines, a significant  percentage of the students begin making their own. Many of them have  never heard of zines, but when I bring in a pile for them to flip  through and take home, they become inspired. This doesn’t happen if I  require them to read a published anthology of zines... getting their  hands on actual zines is necessary to ignite this creative urge.”  Piepmeier goes on to discuss the materiality of zines--that their  physical form is inherent to their creative charge--but rather than  leverage the community-building aspects of paper verses electronic  formats, I felt curious about investigating the possibility that zines  ignite a desire to learn and create in students (or perhaps anyone)  discovering them for the first time.  How can teachers incorporate zines  into their lesson plans?

But  first: what’s a zine? Zines are independently produced publications,  usually hand-made and self-printed, stapled together, and handed out or  sold through the mail at or slightly above cost. Zines tend to be  self-edited or perhaps overseen by a friend, but do not adhere to  standards of professionalism found in mainstream media.  A particular  set of socio-political mores tend to accompany zine production:  anti-capitalist, unpretentious, pro-message, do-it-yourself mottos  inform the subculture whose participants create zines. Zines are most  often compared to blogs, though zines are their print precursor and  continue to occupy a separate, if tangential sphere. What makes zines so  accessible to new readers is how easy they are to make.  Anyone with  thoughts, a pen and paper, and access to a photocopier (or printer) can  make their own small publication and join the zine community.

So,  how can you get your hands on some zines?  Well, you can buy zines at a  few independent bookstores in the city--St. Marks Books and  Bluestockings come to mind.  But in the true spirit of zine credo  (accessibility, spreading the word, distributing the publication at or  below cost) you probably want access to zines for free.  Luckily, there  are a number of zine libraries in New York City where you can search  through, view, and sometimes check out copies of zines.  ABC No Rio is  the oldest zine library in the city, and their collection focuses on  anarchist and political zines, though they also collect personal zines. <a href="http://www.abcnorio.org/facilities/zine_library.html">Their collection</a> is open to the public, though you should check their hours carefully  before making the journey to Rivington Street.  Brooklyn College, whose <a href="http://dewey.brooklyn.cuny.edu/resources/index.php?view=subject&amp;sub_id=178">collection</a> focuses on zines connected to Brooklyn, newly created a zine library this year. NYU’s Fales Library houses a <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/riotgrrrltest.html">riot grrrl archive collection</a> that features zines by and about riot grrrls (to access the collection  you need to email the archivist first).  Closer to home, and most  relevant to Teacher’s College students, Barnard has one of the only <a href="http://zines.barnard.edu/">circulating zine libraries</a> in the country, and their collection is accessible through CLIO.  You  can visit the library in person to peruse their collection, or you can  search through their online catalog (CLIO).  A handy tip: their call  numbers all start with “ZINES” so if you want to browse, simply type  ZINES into the call number entry field and then select to search within  call number.  And lastly, the annual <a href="http://nyartbookfair.com/about.php">NY Art Book Fair </a>hosted  by Printed Matter and held at MoMA’s PS1 features tables and tables of  current, active zine publishers.  You can meet the authors and buy their  zines.  This year, the event is September 30-October 2nd.

But  how would you go about using zines in your classroom?  Handily, a  number of librarians and teachers have created teaching guides on using  zines in the classroom. The best of these is by Nicole Pagowski, a  reference librarian for Dallas County Community District, who created <a href="http://nicolepagowsky.info/zines_instruction.html">a thorough teaching guide</a>.   Another excellent resource is We Make Zines, an online social  networking resource for those who make and read zines; they host a group  called <a href="http://wemakezines.ning.com/group/teachingzines">Teaching Zines</a> that features a discussion forum with excellent advice on using zines  in the classroom.  To read academic research on the topic, try searching  “zine” as a keyword in <a href="http://web.ebscohost.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/ehost/search/advanced?sid=e8accd97-52b5-4838-944c-b251af192c8d%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=126">ERIC (EBSCO</a>) database, the <a href="http://vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/hww/advancedsearch/advanced_search.jhtml;hwwilsonid=CR01YZDLITITVQA3DILSFGGADUNGIIV0?prod=EDUFT">Education Full Text</a> database, or try <a href="http://vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/hww/advancedsearch/advanced_search.jhtml;hwwilsonid=CR01YZDLITITVQA3DILSFGGADUNGIIV0?prod=EDUFT">Library Literature and Information Science Full Text</a> (many zine authors who create instructional guides happen to be  librarians).  You can further narrow your search by adding subject  terms.

I hope this is helpful!
