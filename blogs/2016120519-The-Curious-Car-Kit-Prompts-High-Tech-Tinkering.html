<p><a href="https://samlabs.com/shop/curious">SAM’s Curious Cars</a>, from <a href="https://samlabs.com">SAM Labs</a>, is a kit that allows kids to program and build their own cars with postage stamp-sized gears that connect via wifi. Instead of hooking up wires between parts, users connect their Curious Cars to the app or website and connect and control each part wirelessly from there.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Unlike similar kits, Curious Cars utilizes the internet of things to teach kids the ropes of programming. The kit comes with six rechargeable gears, including a light, wheel axles, direction switch, plastic wheels, and a car body. In all, it’s enough to make one car. While building their Curious Cars, kids follow the instructions given on the app to turn on each individual gear and make connections between the different sensors. By doing this, kids can gather a better understanding of how different gears and switches connect to function as a system.</p>
 
<p>The kit also includes six paper cutouts that kids can fold and glue together to transform their Curious Car into a bulldozer, racecar, or truck. It also comes with an instruction manual for other projects users can create using the Curious Cars gears. These include kid-friendly projects like a contraption to stir cereal in a bowl or to splatter paint a canvas. Users connect these gears via the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sam-space/id1033131754?mt=8">SAM Space app</a>.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although there are many creative and educational possibilities with SAM blocks and the SAM Space app, the Curious Cars app seems to be a bit limited. There are two missions for kids to complete that would also guide them through connecting the gears, but the app would be improved with more activities. Those that are included ask the child to turn on each gear, then connect the pieces on the app by tracing a line through a maze. While this could be fun for kids, the lesson on how parts connect and function together in a system might be too subtle for many to grasp. In addition, since the gears were connected via wifi, the car only works when the app is on. Each time the app is turned on, the car must be reprogrammed before use, which could be frustrating for those who just want to play.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Curious Cars was fun to put together and play with, and the different car designs would keep kids entertained. Although kits are pricey at $199 each, the blocks support an incredible number of possibilities when connected in different projects via the SAM Space app. Curious Cars could peak kids’ interest in programming, but for a more in-depth educational experience, users will want to browse the included project guide and download the SAM Space app, as well.</p>
