<b>TALK TITLE</b>: Learning Processes in Online Graphic Environments: The Added Value of Visualization and Modeling

A key problem facing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education research is the dearth of data upon which to base understanding of learning phenomena and recommendations for teaching
practice.  This is ironic in an era when many sciences are practically drowning in data due to advancement of sensing technology and data collection. These data are being collected in STEM education research in the form of activity data from online learning environments, but we as a discipline have not mined these data for
optimal results.

<b>From Professor Martin:</b> 
In this talk, I will present research findings in two major STEM learning areas: children's learning of rational number and adolescents' learning of programming. The three online learning environments we have created to enable this work are Refraction, NumbOp and IPRO.

Refraction is an online fraction game (see http://games.cs.washington.edu/Refraction) based on the concept of splitting and partioning. Users arrange and split laser beams to archive their objectives (freeing spaceships). These tasks are created
so that users are solving fraction equivalence, operations, and comparison problems, while being engaged by the environment so that they do not give up on even difficult challenges.

NumbOp is a virtual online manipulative in which students solve different types of basic arithmetic problems using an infinite set of simple shape manipulative objects. NumbOp records their activity while problem-solving.

IPRO is a mobile, constructionist, virtual robotics programming environment designed to teach computational literacy. Students use a simplified programming language on a handheld device to control the behavior of a robot agent as it undertakes various collaborative and competitive tasks.

In each case, I will present data demonstrating the added value for understanding learning processes of using modeling and visualization techniques to examine data at a fine grain size compared to simple pre-post learning measures.

<b>Bio</b>:
Taylor Martin received her Ph. D. in educational psychology from Stanford. She also holds an M.S. in cognitive psychology, and a B.A. in linguistics. She has worked in research and development in curriculum and design of instructional systems on projects such as the Adventures of Jasper Woodbury and the Algebra Project. She has also worked as an elementary school teacher, particularly in the area of mathematics. She was an Associate Professor in the Department of
Curriculum and Instruction and was an affiliate faculty in Developmental Psychology and the Learning Technology Center at the University of Texas, Austin. Taylor collaborates extensively with partners in the College of Engineering, the Physics Department, and
the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas, Austin, in Computer Science and Learning Science at the University of Washington, and with the Regional Educational Laboratory Mid-Atlantic.
She is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences at Utah State University.
