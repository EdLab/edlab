When it comes to international education, the focus always seems to be on developing countries and the lack of educational (and career) opportunities for students. However, this problem is also prevalent in the developed world. This video highlights data and an interview with an international education expert about the slow growth of educational mobility in many industrialized nations. </p>

<p>According to recent data and analysis from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), there is a lack of upward educational mobility for individuals in most industrialized countries in Europe and North America. The trend is worse among young and recent graduates with lower educational attainment than their parents. The greatest barrier to educational attainment is often the socio economic background of students. This is especially true in countries (e.g., France, Italy) with inequitable school systems. </p>

<p>How can we reverse this disturbing trend in developed countries? Do you agree with the OECD’s recommendations for improving school systems? <a href= "https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/17515">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>00:27 Nantwi: </b> "Education as the great equalizer," first coined by Horace Mann, has been commonly used by education reformers and policymakers to highlight the role education can play in creating a more just and equal society.</p>

<p><b>01:25 Clark: </b> So this subset of young people received more schooling but are ultimately less qualified than their parents? That seems surprising, but I think it's important to identify what they are less qualified to do (and recognize they might be more qualified than their parents in certain areas!).</p>

<p><b>03:06 g7status:</b> I couldn’t agree more with the sentiment that education needs to be more relevant to careers that students will inevitably pursue. If a lot of employers are complaining about lack of skilled workers for job openings, then we should look at how we are "preparing" students for professional life.</p>
