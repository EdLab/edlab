          <p>
            A <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/pregnant-teen-wins-abortion-battle-150554993--abc-news-topstories.html">pregnant teenager is suing her parents</a> because they are forcing her to have an abortion.The teen, identified as a 16-year-old Texas girl, called a center for help after her parents found out about her pregnancy and insisted she go for an abortion. A Texas judge granted the 16 year old the right to give birth after her lawyers successfully defended that by denying her the right to have the baby, her parents were "violating her federal constitutional rights to carry her child to term by coercing her to have an abortion with both verbal and physical threats and harassment." To further outrage the parents, the Court is also insisting her parents are responsible for paying half of her medical bills unless she marries the father of her impending baby.

This situation raises alot of ethical, educational and social questions. For instance, on what grounds do the parents have the right to insist on an abortion? In my opinion, I think when someone reaches a certain age, namely mid- teen years, they have a right to make their most of their own decisions as they've reached a stage in their physical and mental development where they can somewhat assume what is in their best interests. Additionally, the girl in question, may really want to have child on religious and moral grounds and therefore her parents cannot enforce their will on her. One way in which we could avoid such situations is to increase or enhance sex education in our schools. 

Do you think the parents in this situation have an argument in wanting their daughter to have an abortion? Why or why not?
