<p><i>"We kids have great ideas but lack the ability to make them real. Nobody takes us seriously. I designed features in the app to help kids take their idea to the next level."</i> (<a href="http://www.kidzideaz.xyz">Nathaniel Dsouza, KidzIdeaz Founder</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>For Kids by Kids</b></p>
 
<p>Nathaniel expresses the frustration many kids feel when trying to get adults to listen to their ideas. Few spaces give children the opportunity to express themselves to serious audiences. However, <a href="http://www.kidzideaz.xyz">KidzIdeaz</a> is seeking to change that situation through their new platform and app. This technology democratizes developer spaces so that kids are not simply consumers of digital products. Instead, kids record, share and develop ideas with other children on the platform. The founder, 12-year-old Nathaniel Dsouza, leads the way in this endeavor. </p>
 
<p><b>A Space to be Heard </b></p>
 
<p>Nathaniel serves as a manager and mentor for his staff of other children. They work together to support ideas through likes, comments, and shares. The team plans to implement an idea rankings system that pushes great ideas to the top through crowd-sourced opinions. They also plan to start contests that award creative ideas. Of course, adults are not completely absent in this endeavor, they serve as supervisors, approving the sharing or receiving of ideas for users.</p>
 
<p>Some might question the viability of a platform run by children, especially during the school year. However, many would argue the importance lies in the platform's purpose. As many parents fear the zombie-like behavior that most apps unfortunately engender, it is refreshing for children to have a place online that encourages them to tap into their ingenuity. KidzIdeaz seems to be an excellent starting point for children who want their ideas taken seriously.</p>
