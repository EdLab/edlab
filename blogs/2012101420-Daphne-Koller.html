<i>Daphne Koller is enticing top universities to put their most intriguing courses online for free — not just as a service, but as a way to research how people learn. Each keystroke, comprehension quiz, peer-to-peer forum discussion and self-graded assignment builds an unprecedented pool of data on how knowledge is processed and, most importantly, absorbed</i> <a href="Ted.com">(Ted.com)</a>.

<b>Education for the 100%</b><br>
 
Despite being the product of a more traditional education, with parents who were both academics and an impressive academic CV of her own, Dr. Daphne Koller, who is the co-founder of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) provider Coursera.com, is a rising voice in the MOOC movement.  Koller’s own path led her to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where she received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees (when she was only 18). Shortly afterwards she came to the US where she received her Ph.D. from Stanford University. In 2004, she won a MacArthur Fellowship for her groundbreaking work exploring biomedical and genetic data. Currently the Rajeev Motwani Professor in the Computer Science Department and on the faculty of the Artificial Intelligence Lab, Koller leads a research group affectionately known as "DAGS" (Daphne’s Approximate Group of Students).
 <p>
Even though her education is more "traditional" Koller’s desire to gain new skills quickly and turn theory into real-world practice is a tenet of the Coursera experience.  Koller not only embraces efficient, cost-effective methods of educating learners, but she also looks to her machine learning and artificial intelligence background to unite the best of science, technology and intelligent algorithms to make this experience both easily transferable and trackable. Embedded within the Coursera experience is self-guided assessments, peer-graded exams, forums, and feedback aimed at encouraging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">"mastery learning."</a> With over a million students enrolled in Coursera to date, Koller is moving closer to her goal of making education both affordable and accessible to the largest number of people possible, versus the current status quo that favors the top 1%.
<p>
<b>MOOCs under the Microscope</b><br>
 
As movements like <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/5367">unCollege</a>, and alternative credentialing mechanisms such as badges continue to challenge the traditional practices of higher education, MOOC providers like Coursera continue to grow, evolve and expand. Coursera now incorporates instructors and free content from (among many others) Duke, Princeton, the University of Michigan and the University of Edinburg and encompasses over 117 courses on topics ranging from Cryptography to Greek Mythology. What truly sets Coursera even further apart from other online learning experiences is the founder’s unique expertise in analyzing the growing corpus of learning metrics that had previously been impossible to assemble at such a large scale. Koller is contributing not only to the movement to empower and encourage self-directed learning, but she is also helping us to understand and study learner behavior in ways that should inform and shape the field for years to come.  At a recent lecture at Carnegie Mellon’s Computer Science Department, Koller explained to the audience a sentiment shared by her colleague Sebastian Thrun, (also a professor at Stanford University and the founder of rival MOOC provider, Udacity.com) that education online has the potential to impact millions more students than could ever be reached by a professor standing on one podium in one classroom at a single university. Coursera just might, in the not-too-distant future, become the standard of affordable, scalable education.
