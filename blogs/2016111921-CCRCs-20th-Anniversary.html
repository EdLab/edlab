            On November 17, the Community College Research Center (CCRC) celebrated its second decade. The center, which is devoted to compiling data about how community colleges can best serve their student bodies, and how those students go on to impact their communities after the completion of a two-year program. So who better to invite to celebrate twenty years of exemplary research than Dr. Jill Biden? 

Many know Dr. Biden for her work alongside her husband, Vice President Joe Biden. She is a champion for community colleges, and has advocated for free public college during her time in the White House. But she is also an educator; with thirty years of experience spanning from elementary to college level, she currently teaches English at a two-year institution in Virginia. The Second Lady taught her course sections before attending CCRC's anniversary ceremony, which isn't out of the ordinary for her after eight years working for both her students and her country.

Dr. Biden often calls community college's "America's best-kept secret." At this event, she proclaimed that the secret is out - claims that these institutions do not offer prestige or adequate learning and career opportunities are being disproven, thanks to partnerships being forged with local industry and high schools, as well as promotion by the leaders of this nation. Teachers College's own President Susan Fuhrman opened the evening by stating that we, as an institution of higher education, are obligated to make sure that all students have equal learning opportunities, especially for students who are immigrants. This statement holds extra weight coming just one day after members of the Columbia community attended a student-organized walk-out to pressure President Lee Bollinger to make Columbia University a sanctuary campus for undocumented students.
