<p><b>Title:</b> Comparison of Traditional and Digital Visualization Technologies in Architectural Design Education (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Tayfun Yildirim & Arzu Ozen Yavuz</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> Architectural design education is moving into a new era. Digital imaging techniques have changed the way many architecture students and architects in the field perform their tasks. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812032582"><i>A Comparison of Traditional and Digital Visualization Technologies in Architectural Design Education</i></a> reports that in fields like architecture design, traditional and digital technologies are often concurrently used in the education of students. The study sought to identify which strategy was more efficient and effective for learning.</p>

<p>A field study was conducted with a group of students selected from Gazi University
who were tracked over four semesters. The studentsâ€™ visual designs were evaluated for time spent in production, hardware needed, sensitivity to scale, photorealistic results, ease of revision, ability to produce new alternatives, ease of archiving, compatibility for distance education, and satisfaction of lecturers and students. Traditional paper and digital 2D & 3D drawings were ranked on a five-point scale in each category.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results showed that the digital methods required less production time and yielded higher quality. Digitally drawn objects were more realistic, easier to revise, and students were able to produce new design alternatives more readily. Few drawbacks were found in the switch from paper to digital drawing in architectural design programs. The authors suggested that this move is inevitable but acknowledged that the transition to fully-digital architectural education will be arduous.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The study found that digital images were not only equivalent in quality to those created traditionally, but also had several advantages for learning. Most incoming students will be accustomed to the ease of adaptation and revision in digital work, and schools of architecture and design should ensure that their software and hardware infrastructure supports digital imaging on a large scale. The reluctance and complexity of institutions making the leap from traditional to fully-digital practices is one factor in the skills gap between graduating students and workplace expectations.</p>
