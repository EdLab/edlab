<p><i>"Since 2003, StoryCorps has collected and archived more than 50,000 interviews with over 90,000 participants. Each conversation is recorded on a CD to share, and is preserved at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress."</i> (from <a href="https://storycorps.org/about/">StoryCorps</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="http://storycorps.org/about/">StoryCorps</a> is one of the largest oral history projects in the United States. The project aims to capture the culture, tradition, and history that are passed down through songs, stories, and other verbal forms of communication. StoryCorps spreads the (spoken) word by sharing history-laden tales weekly on the radio to millions of NPR listeners. StoryCorps’ mission is to preserve, share, and provide opportunities for a diversity of people to record their stories. The nonprofit maintains that preserving these stories in the form that they are told will be an invaluable resource for future generations.</p>

<p><b>Recording Your Story</b><br>
StoryCorps wants to make it easy to share a story and there are many ways individuals can participate. StoryCorps accepts monetary donations and also encourages everyone and anyone to share a story in their StoryBooth. StoryBooths are soundproof recording studios where would-be storytellers make appointments either online with their user-friendly reservation system or by calling a toll free number. StoryBooths are located in Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco.</p>

<p>In addition, StoryCorps offers door-to-door interviews that can be booked in advance for storytellers outside of large cities. Storytellers are encouraged to have a natural conversation, rather than reading a script and StoryCorps provides a list of questions in person and in the booths to help get the conversation flowing. Some examples of questions include: "Who has been the most important person in your life?", "What was the happiest moment of your life? The saddest?", and "Who has been the biggest influence on your life?" StoryCorps also provides tissues in the booth in case things get emotional. </p>

<p>Participants receive a CD copy of the recording and are asked to make a donation to the StoryCorps cause, they suggest $50. StoryCorps also offers a DIY recording guide for those looking to record stories at home, in the classroom, or at the library. These stories are not nationally archived, but they offer students, teachers, and others a way to learn about and practice preserving oral traditions.</p>

<p><b>Treasured Stories, New Directions</b><br>
StoryCorps works with NPR and the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The stories are archived at the Library of Congress and StoryCorps pulls the content from NPR from recordings archived at the American Folklife Center. These stories are edited down from the original 40-minute recording. NPR’s Morning Edition and the NPR website are significant marketing tools for StoryCorps and many of their best stories have come on personal recommendation from people who encountered the stories on NPR.</p>

<p>In 2010, StoryCorps released a series of animated shorts, stories selected from archives and then animated by Rauch Brothers Animation. The animated shorts were particularly successful in school settings and StoryCorps has since released more animated content. They now offer these animations along with classroom and curriculum content under their StoryCorpsU division.</p>
