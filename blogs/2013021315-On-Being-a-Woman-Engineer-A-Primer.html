          <p>
            Apparently I caused a bit of a stir over the last couple of days when I featured in my Gchat statuses a couple of links to different websites referencing the difficulties of being a woman engineer. I've tried to make this clear, but this is NOT in any way a criticism of the culture of EdLab. The interesting thing is that I've been going to these websites and although I can empathize with the problems these sites are talking about, I've never actually personally experienced them &mdash; and I'm aware of how fortunate I am and I really and truly count my blessings every day. For me, each time I'm sent one of these kinds of links, I'm reminded of what a great place EdLab is to work as a female engineer, and it makes me want to go out an evangelize the lab and hire all of my female developer friends and acquaintances who have experienced these problems firsthand. If anything, my happiness here is often accompanied by a pang of guilt when I remember that most other female engineers don't have it nearly as good as I do.

In any case, here are the links I was talking about:

* A couple of days ago, my friend Ni (former tech fellow at TalkingPointsMemo) IMed me a link to the <a href="http://femalesoftwareeng.tumblr.com/">Female Software Engineer tumblr</a> that has exploded in popularity over the past few days. It's basically a series of humorous GIFs from the perspective of someone who is probably the only female software engineer at her company (contributed to by many other women in the field).

* Then, this morning, several friends tweeted a link to <a href="http://futurewomanintech.com/">futurewomanintech.com</a>, Stacey Mulcahey's heartfelt letter to her niece about her hopes for the next generation of women engineers given that the current status quo can be pretty grim.

These are not the first such sites I've seen, and they probably won't be the last; I've been following this online conversation about what it's <i>really</i> like to be a woman working in tech for quite some time now, and there's a sizable corpus of really good reads on the topic on tumblr, GeekFeminism.org, and various other blogs. When Pranav came and talked to me about these issues, he seemed to be surprised at some of the things I mentioned. So, I figured I'd put together a "primer" of some of these worthwhile reads (with Kate's encouragement :D). This is far from complete, as I've read so much on the subject that it's hard to remember the best ones off the top of my head, but this should be enough to get you started:

* <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/primer-sexism-tech-industry">A Primer on Sexism in the Tech Industry</a> from .net Magazine. If you're only going to read one thing, read this one, because it basically covers all the bases.

* <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2012/09/17/how-to-exclude-women-without-really-trying/">How To Exclude Women Without Really Trying</a>, by Tim Chevalier. A good insight into how gender manages to pervade everything by someone who for a long time identified as genderqueer. This one doesn't really deal with the workplace as much; it's more focused on developers as a community.

* <a href="http://thecodergirl.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/do-you-wear-a-bra-the-truth-about-being-a-woman-programmer/">Do You Wear A Bra? The Truth About Being A Woman Programmer</a>, by thecodergirl. Talks about examples of direct harassment over the more common micro-aggressions, but also has some nice bullet points at the end for things we can all do better.

* <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/mar/22/technology-women-sexism-question">Why aren't there more women in technology? Here are a few clues</a> from The Guardian's technology blog, in response to several incidents that occurred right around the same time last March.

* <a href="http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/mar/21/lighten-up/">Lighten Up</a>, by The Real Katie (also referenced by The Guardian blog post above). About how the common response when we speak up about these problems is to be told to "lighten up", or that "you're too sensitive".

* <a href="http://asherwolf.net/dear-hacker-community-we-need-to-talk/101/">Dear Hacker Community: We Need to Talk</a>, by Asher Wolfe. This addresses both direct harassment as well as the issue of gender imbalance at conferences.

* <a href="http://xkcd.com/385/">How it Works</a> from xkcd. Short but sweet and basically sums up ~80% of the problem.

* <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Sexualized_presentations">Sexualized presentations</a>, a wiki article with examples of presentations from conferences that use sexualized images of women (which is surprisingly common).

I'm putting this out there because I think it's important for all of us to be aware of these issues and do what we can to make things better. In EdLab's case, thankfully we don't have any of these cultural problems that have been described, but there are still things we can do! ...for starters, by hiring more female engineers! ;D And I know we've been trying, and a big part of the problem is that they just haven't been applying, and so maybe the question is how to get more women to apply.

On that note, it might be worth considering how Etsy did it:
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kellan/more-women-in-engineering-something-that-actually-worked-14630106">"More women in engineering: Something that ACTUALLY worked."</a> (presentation) by Kellan Elliott-McCrea
...or, check out a write-up with video of the presentation here: <a href="http://firstround.com/article/How-Etsy-Grew-their-Number-of-Female-Engineers-by-500-in-One-Year">How Etsy Grew their Number of Female Engineers by Almost 500% in One Year</a>

I know that we don't have a vast resoource of money available, but is there something similar we could do with our summer internship program?

Also, given the way we've been expanding our role from simply developing our own products to also supporting other companies and researchers in the edtech community, I wonder if there's some way we can leverage that new leadership position to help support other women who are interested in working at edtech companies. Kate, I wonder if you have any ideas!?

Feel free to share other good reads on this topic, or ideas you might have for how we can recruit more women for our tech team!
