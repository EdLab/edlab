            Millstone, Jessica. <a href="http://joanganzcooneycenter.org/Reports-34.html">National Survey and Video Case Studies: Teacher Attitudes about Digital Games in the Classroom.</a> Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop. 2012 May 2.

Full disclosure: I'm on the fence re: gamification. I think games primarily serve as a means of escape, and introducing real life applications based on gameplay seems counteractive. As such, I was particularly interested in the results of the author's research.

This study polled over 500 teachers who used video games in a classroom setting in order to get a sense of their experiences. The makeup of those polled vary widely; 20% of educators polled worked in special education, and 60% taught in Title I schools. 5 case studies were also analyzed and used to enrich the quantitative data. Some of the statistics that stood out are as follows:

<li>18% used games in their classrooms on a daily basis, with K-5 teachers utlizing them most often.</li>

<li>70% of teachers believe gaming increases motivation in students
62% say games level learning and make it easier to teach to students different aptitudes</li>

<li>>10% of teachers reported negative experiences with games</li>

<li>Half of games used were designed to improve reading/literacy</li>

<li>Only 12% of teachers reported learning about gamification in preservice training (80+% learned about games through professional development or on their own)</li>

<li>21% of teachers already using in-classroom gaming use tutorials from online video sites to further their knowledge<strong> (Vialogue's opportunity alert!)</strong> </li>


<li><5% of teachers had issues with parents/administrators questioning in-class gaming</li>

Here's a video detailing one teacher's experience with gaming in the classroom. Hers was among the case studies included in the study.

<strong>EdLab Relevance</strong>

With the recent seminar on gamification, this article struck as particularly relevant.  I would have liked to see more student achievement data, but this study was mainly gauging teachers impressions of gaming in the classroom.

I remember playing educational games in school, but computer time was generally used more as a reward, i.e. an incentive for getting traditional schoolwork done, and I (vaguely) recall understanding it as just that, like getting dessert if I finished eating my broccoli. But again, it will be interesting to see, in an age where computers are more prevalent in schools than they were even just 15 years ago, if today's generation of kids grow up with different perceptions of games/computer aided learning. I imagine gamification is a concept that needs to be instilled in students as early as possible, so learning while gaming is essentially unnoticeable. 

I think EdLab should follow the trends in gamification, because I think there's definitely an opportunity to reach out to educators via video tutorials on educational games, as well as coming up with resources for preservice teachers to become familiar with the different types of games to enrich their future students learning experiences.
