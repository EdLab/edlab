          <p>
            Formed in 1945 to replace the failed League of Nations, the United Nations has become part of the international effort of global peacekeeping. The <a href=http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html> Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a> states the aim of the UN as the “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.” 

The Peacekeeping forces were formed under this umbrella in 1948. Their main purpose is to “maintain or re-establish” peace in an area of armed conflict. Armed or un-armed troops partake in peacekeeping operations with different tasks. Un-armed troops become observers in identifying the progress of opposing parties in a conflict. “Lightly” armed troops are used to maintain order in an area and may only use their weapons in self-defense. The nickname “Blue Helmets” was given to them because of their uniform in which they are required to wear distinctive blue helmets. See <a href=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-un-holds-head.jpg/250px-Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-un-holds-head.jpg> this picture </a>.
<p>
	Concern with the use of the Blue Helmets in “peacekeeping missions” has become controversial due to rising accounts of psychological trauma, abuse, and prostitution in the areas of conflict due to and affecting the troops. Mental health issues are apparent in all war-torn areas but the difficulties faced by Blue Helmet troops comes from the war and the attacks on humanitarian workers from the native people. Deliberate acts of violence by the native community of a war-torn region very often affect troops. In addition, post-traumatic stress disorder is prevalent in these soldiers often increasing alcohol, drug-abuse and attempted suicide rates. Despite these issues, the troops are not free of guilt in the issues widespread within their organization. Often, prostitution and sexual abuse occur with the women of these areas. During the 1960s, the rise in forced prostitution of children in Cambodia was related to the move-in of Blue Helmets.  Recently there have been investigations of direct involvement of UN Peacekeeping forces with the rise of sexual abuse in areas such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti and Sudan have begun. 
	<p>
My mother was involved in the Conduct and Discipline Unit for the MONUC, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Her department was in charge of investigating complaints issued by Congolese citizens regarding the misconduct of UN Peacekeeping forces. She would often tell me stories of women giving way to prostitution in hopes of a better future. The troops are also trained in various workshops warning them of the consequences of any misconduct within the team. The discipline within the UN troops is equated to that of any state-run army. Ultimately the pit falls that these soldiers face are the same as any warring soldier. The real problems lie in the purpose of having the troops in a given area, not with the troops themselves.

<p>
	The difficulties that United Nations Peacekeeping Missions and their troops face may be a large factor in the relative ‘failure' of many of them. The criticism the United Nations receives is relative to the leadership it upholds. Nevertheless, the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces received the <a href=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1988/un-history.html> Nobel Peace Prize </a> in 1984 and continue their efforts of keeping the peace throughout conflicted countries of the world.
