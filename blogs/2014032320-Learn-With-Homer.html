<p><a href="http://learnwithhomer.com/">Learn with Homer</a> is a reading app designed by a group of literacy experts led by founder <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stephanie-dua/36/b51/6">Stephanie Dua</a>, who has a long history of education advocacy and most recently served as an advisor to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Coleman_(education)">David Coleman</a>. The app teaches phonetics with highly detailed characters and audio recordings of students’ out-loud reading. Learn with Homer is more than a phonetics teaching app. It also includes tools that students can use to create recordings and draw pictures.</p>

<p>Students can then apply their newfound reading skills to the app’s vast library of storybooks. Learn with Homer encourages cross-curricular learning with a <i>Discover the World</i> section, which lets students dig into science storybooks and connect them to famous folklore and fables, like <i>The Tortoise and the Hare</i>, for deeper learning.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>An interesting component of the app is that it uses the iPad’s microphone to record the student’s voice, which allows them to listen to their own voice making a sound or reading. Users can play games that will help them better understand the phonemes of the English language. Learn with Homer also includes reading materials that explore U.S. Presidents, animals, and holidays. The story time sections allow users to practice their newly-learned reading techniques.</p> 

<p>The app allows up to three users to create their own profiles and customize their avatars. A parent portal is available so parents can view their children’s activities and access their reading statistics. It contains information like reading progress, recommended readings, learning activities based on performance, and a collection of artwork and recordings produced by the student. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> Though the app is free, some of the reading material will cost parents as much as $2. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Learn with Homer uses the iPad's recording feature to help users master the 44 phonemes of the English language. The app also has plenty of learning resources so users can practice the reading skills they have learned. It would be interesting to see a feature that could record as users sound out words to evaluate their pronunciation and intervene to correct mispronunciations. The cross-curricular aspect of the app is unique and encourages critical thinking and deeper learning.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Learn with Homer will usher students into the bright and colorful work of reading, science, and art.</p>
