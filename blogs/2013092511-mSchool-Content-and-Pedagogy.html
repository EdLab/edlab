The Inspirational Teacher

STEP 1: Categorize the courses
- Generate a schema to make sense of all the mSchool courses we have created. 

- What are ten offerings you think we should invest in? Be prepared to explain.  

(Here is the link to the EdLab Turntable: http://turntable.fm/edlabturntable. The theme is "learning.")

LARGE GROUP DISCUSSION
- Observations from the group:
* What is missing?
* What does it reflect about EdLab?
* Who is represented? Who is marginalized?
* What do we need in order to achieve the mSchool objectives?

STEP 2: Propose a premier mSchool offering
- Write a title and description of the offering?

- Who is the target audience?

- What are the objectives of the offering?

- Describe the pedagogy, if any? If there is a teacher, what will s/he do?

- What will learners do? What activities will they be engaged? Please be descriptive.
