<p>Newly produced by PBS Kids, <a href="http://pbskids.org/apps/play-and-learn-science-.html">Play and Learn Science</a> is a free app that lets children five and under participate in real world science exploration games and hands-on activities. It includes twelve different activities and games that build science inquiry skills and help children learn core science concepts relating to shadows, weather, cause and effect, and forces and motion.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Play and Learn Science presents an intuitive approach to basic science concepts for young children. Using the characters from other PBS games, it provides a variety of activities through a fun, colorful design. The app utilizes spoken instructions as well as visual demonstrations, featuring a healthy amount of repetition for short attention spans and memories. From learning how to read three different types of thermometers to making an effective umbrella out of found objects, children engage in activities that encourage experimentation in order to make discoveries. The narrator poses questions throughout to aid reflection and inspire further inquiry.</p>

<p>Another great feature of the app is its For Parents section. The guide provides tips, explanations of the activities featured, stimulating questions caregivers can ask children, and further ideas for science exploration in the real world.</p>  

<p>The app is also offered in Spanish, with all narration and written instructions translated, providing equal opportunity for many families who don’t primarily speak English at home.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The app is broken down into four basic topics, but I found two of these topics, Weather Control and Gear Up, to be very closely related. While there is nothing innately wrong with this, because the other sections aren’t necessarily related, it seems like combining the two and adding a completely different fourth topic would strengthen this app in terms of variety.</p>

<p>One small but important technical problem that should be addressed is the inability to turn off the sound on the app. Though the games do not employ loud, disruptive music or narration, parents subjected to repetitive sound might be disinclined to let their child use this app.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Play and Learn Science holds promise for parents wanting to engage their children in scientific discovery and exploration from an early age. As a free resource produced by a nationally recognized leader in early child entertainment and learning, this app is an easy and accessible way to introduce important and fun STEM concepts.</p>
