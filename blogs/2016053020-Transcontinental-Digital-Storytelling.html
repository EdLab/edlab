<p>One of the oft-mentioned benefits of technology today is the dissolution of geographical barriers that once existed between countries, continents, and hemispheres. This usually pertains to emails, social media exchanges, and video calls between friends and family. But what about between complete strangers from different countries?</p>
 
<p>The authors of this study ground their research in <i>border pedagogy</i>, which prompts students to think critically about their own experiences and then break down geographical barriers by reading or listening to other people’s stories. Its specific purpose is to challenge dominant narratives that come from class-specific and Western perspectives. The authors questioned whether technology can help students understand otherness and "what it means to be human."</p>
 
<p>The students in this study, 25 from Michigan and 80 from the Western Cape in South Africa, were given resources that addressed what it means to be human. This included readings, TED Talks, and other videos. The students were all part of a Facebook group, where they reflected on the resources, answered questions about their knowledge of the other country, and shared digital stories about themselves.</p>
 
<p>The students reported that they were surprised to find so many similarities between each other in their stories, despite being from different cultures. One student said, "Just being a part of this course has opened my eyes. It has softened my heart also." The researchers also note that many of the stories the students shared focused on overcoming challenges, which speaks to the question of what it means to be human. The authors conclude that using Facebook to engage in digital storytelling allowed the students to understand themselves better and to think critically about otherness, both of which are important in developing a global consciousness that transcends geopolitical boundaries.</p>
