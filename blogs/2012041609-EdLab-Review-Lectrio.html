<a href="http://lectrio.com">Lectrio</a> is a new free LMS that just entered the beta "friendly-invite" stage of their service to individual instructors. Lectrio allows anyone to create courses that integrate a wide range of multimedia and allows instructors to easily set timetables, engage in discussions, assign and grade student work and, finally, generate performance reports. The group will soon offer a <a href="http://lectrio.com/easy-to-use-lms-service">"freemium" plan for institutions</a> as well. I have created a test course for you to explore as a "student" <a href="http://lectrio.com/course/legosined/news">here</a>. Sign-in with the following access code: 56tA2.      

<b>Pros:</b>
Speed.  It really does only take the promised 3-minutes to set up a course. Once set up, it is a seamless experience to add multimedia from various sources ranging from Slideshare presentations to YouTube videos and even <a href="https://vialogues.com/">vialogues</a>!  Also, the system is able to easily connect to Google Docs.

<b>Cons:</b>
Although the platform has an impressive array of add-ons and links to other services like Google Docs, the menus and navigation to find these options is not easy to use or intuitive. A dashboard to manage all interactions and track student progress would be much appreciated; currently the system seems a bit too simplistic. Finally, the discussion board also seems too stripped down and merely mimics an instant messaging focused UI (see screenshot below), offering only a comment and response format with no visible tagging or ranking of interaction. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Turnkey LMS have been around for a while. What is fresh and new about this particular solutions is the way that we approach this space; namely, through distinguishing features like truly "alive" discussion boards and seamless integration to other leading media options. Additionally, as mentioned briefly above, both a student and teacher-facing dashboard really seems lacking here and is another important area to explore. Finally, mastering an effective dance between instructor-led and peer-to-peer-focused resources seems to be the real special sauce for future systems.   

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Lectrio is a stripped-down, easy-to-use, free "LMS lite." A good start that needs a better "roadmap" and additional features to entice and retain long-term users.
