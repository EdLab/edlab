<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/958680/Selfknowledge_VR/">Self-Knowledge VR</a> is a free experience optimized for the HCT Vive virtual reality headset. It is comprised of four gamified tasks that are based on real-world psychological theories. As the user engages, the program collects and interprets data, then presents it in the form of insights about the user’s personality and characteristics. The hope is that this set of exercises will increase self-knowledge and in turn benefit users’ future learning.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Self-Knowledge VR’s beautiful graphics were what initially drew me into the experience. The quality of the VR made each task engaging and realistic, especially when it came to physical tasks such as throwing a rock or rowing a boat.</p>

<p>The concept was also effective in drawing me in; a short, gamified, interactive psychology quiz in VR is a fun and low-commitment way to learn a bit about yourself. If you don’t enjoy a task, you can power through it very quickly, but if you want to take the time to strategize or persist with a challenge, you can take as long as you want. The various peculiar tasks were mysterious enough to provide intrigue but clear enough to allow you to complete them. They were also entertaining to watch others complete.</p>
 
<p>At the end of the experience, you are provided with rudimentary analysis of skills like multitasking, persistence, and decision-making. Tied to the analysis are the results of important psychology studies that have been conducted on these characteristics. Those of us who tried Self-Knowledge VR felt that the analyses were accurate and that the experience was an engaging way to introduce people to these psychological concepts.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>One of the four tasks required you to row a boat along a certain path, and while I liked the premise of the task, the fact that your vision was wobbling with the waves beneath the boat made me very motion sick. Others commented on this feature on Steam; perhaps keeping the headset camera aligned with the user’s movements would help solve this problem.</p>

<p>Another task asked you to choose the animal you identify with the most, but as there were only four animals and the task was over as soon as you chose, it felt far too short and arbitrary for any real analysis. Though you are told in the analysis that the animals have different cultural meanings, there is no explanation of which cultures the creators are referring to, and they fail to recognize that users may come from different cultural contexts that might have influenced their choice.</p> 

<p>While this program is fun, it’s pretty simple. It is a one-and-done sort of activity and doesn’t go deep into serious psychological analysis. This makes it a great experience for a museum or traveling exhibit about psychology, but it probably wouldn’t be too practical in, say, a classroom setting.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Self-Knowledge VR was a very enjoyable experience that fulfilled its promise of teaching me a bit more about myself. For it to become an even better learning tool, however, it could expand some existing tasks and work to eliminate design problems.</p>
