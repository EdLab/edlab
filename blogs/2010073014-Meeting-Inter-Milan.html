          <p>
            This past Wednesday, my club team, South Bronx United, was invited to meet the players and staff of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Internazionale_Milano#Current_squad">Football Club Internazionale Milano</a>, commonly known as Inter Milan at the Nike store on 5th Avenue. Inter were in the city to debut their brand new kits for the upcoming season. If you don't know much about soccer, Inter Milan are one of the top sports teams in the world and are the current holders of the Champions League title. The Champions League is an annual season long tournament featuring most of Europe's teams with the winners seen by fans and pundits alike as the best team in the world since most of the top teams and players are in Europe. <p>

When we arrived, our seats in front of the stage were taken by another team so the organizers created space in the front to give us the best seat in the house. As the anticipation for Inter's arrival grew, some of SBU's players, including Erick, were invited to take part in a freestyle. When the players and staff finally made their way to the stage, it was mayhem as fans started chanting and singing Inter songs. In soccer, fans often create songs for the team and some of their favorite players. The players waved and made gestures to an adoring crowd while manager Rafa Benitez and some of the senior players engaged in a Q&A with the moderator. <p>

Personally, it was quite a fun experience as I got a chance to see great players such as Samuel Eto'o, Diego Milito, Marco Materrazi, Mario Balotelli, Ivan Cordoba and Javier Zanetti. After the Q&A, the players were ushered away to the back. We all thought that was the end of the event but a few minutes later, the players had changed into their team polo shirts and started shopping like normal patrons. It was during this time that some of us were able to take pictures and receive autographs from players such as Nelson Rivas, David Suazo and Ivan Cordoba. <p>

The whole event seemed surreal as it was the first time Ive ever met any famous soccer team or player. I was also very surprised by the size of the players. On TV, they look so big and tall but in person, they looked really small and I even towered over most of them. I learn three important things during the Q&A section from the players: listen to your coach (Cordoba), you must be fearless on the pitch (Materazzi) and being physically fit (Zanetti).  I hope my teammates also took the advice of the pros and start implementing them right away during practices and games. <p>

Although we left Niketown with no new shirt sponsors for our upcoming season, we had a great time and we learned some tips from the pros. Maybe the EdLab can sponsor us so one day we can be the ones people come to see ïŠ. <p>
