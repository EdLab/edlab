<p>Victoria Nash is the Deputy Director and Policy and Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk">Oxford Internet Institute</a> (OII). In the latter role, she is responsible for connecting OII research with policy and practice. Her research interests draw on her background as a political theorist and concern the practical application of fundamental liberal values in the internet era. Recent projects have included efforts to map the legal and regulatory trends shaping freedom of expression online for UNESCO, analysis of age verification as a tool for balancing the interests of children and adults online, and the role of information and Internet access in the development of moral autonomy. She is also Course Director of the OII's <a href="http://sdp.oii.ox.ac.uk">Summer Doctoral Programme</a>.<p>
 
<p><b>How have your education and professional experiences shaped your work? </b><br>
<p>In some senses, it’s remarkable that I’ve ended up where I am. My undergraduate and graduate degrees were in politics and philosophy. I have a Ph.D. in Political Theory, moreover, on a topic (liberalism and John Rawls) that has little to do with the internet. But if you move beyond the dry-sounding subject matter, there is a clear thread that has led me to where I am today. That thread is a concern with normative politics, or the study of how the world should be governed, and according to which values. My professional experience in a think tank prior to coming to the OII helped me understand how empirical research and normative conceptual analysis could inform policy-making. And in my current role, I get to think about this a great deal, it’s just that the focus happens to be the internet. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape? </b><br>
<p>My colleagues at OII are doing tremendous work, designing and delivering courses that help us understand the complexities of life online. Our multi-disciplinary approach sees students taught by computer scientists, sociologists, geographers, lawyers, and even a physicist. This is genuinely cutting edge but it’s essential in our subject area as no one discipline is sufficient to help us understand the effects of digital technologies on our relationships, our labour, our culture, our institutions, and our identity. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
<p>I think that the capacity for data collection online is extraordinary. In our case, this enables even Masters students to undertake really original thesis projects where they write their own scripts, scrape, clean, and analyze their own data. In earlier decades you would have had to go out and work with other people’s ready-collected survey data or rely on conducting your own qualitative research. I really believe that there’s nothing like hands-on research to really embed learning. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project? </b><br>
<p>I’m currently working on finalising the agendas for our Summer Doctoral Programme and our Internet Leadership Academy. The latter is only in its second year, and brings bright stars from the policy world to the OII to learn more about digital policy issues. As for my next big project, well, I think I have a backlog of papers to write before I’m allowed a big new project! :-)
