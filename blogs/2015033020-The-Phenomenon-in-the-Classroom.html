<p>Soccer is undoubtedly the world’s most famous and popular sport. Last year’s FIFA World Cup final drew close to a billion viewers from all corners of the globe. This has made soccer players global icons. The soccer player whose star shines the brightest across the globe is Portugal and Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Fresh off his third straight World Player of the World award, Ronaldo’s every move off the pitch is front-page fodder while his eye catching soccer skills grace the back pages. Such is Ronaldo’s popularity that he is now the subject of a college sociology course. </p>

<p>Professor Luis Aguair at the University of British Columbia is using Ronaldo as the cornerstone of his course on global citizenship. Aguair was first introduced to the Portuguese phenomenon and his broad appeal during a World Cup qualifying game in which the commentators spent the bulk of the game mostly discussing Ronaldo. Ronaldo’s appeal transcends cultures and thus makes him the ideal candidate for a course on global citizenship.</p>

<p>What other cultural icons can serve as the basis for a college level course? What are the pros and cons of teaching a course on a celebrity? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/20236">Join the discussion on Vialogues. .</a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>02:15 Nantwi:</b> Apart from his soccer ability, Ronaldo is also a cultural phenomenon. His image can be seen in many magazines and commercials and his jersey adorns kids and adults alike all across the globe. </p>

<p><b>03:03 sarpong18:</b> I will definitely take such a course. I think featuring Ronaldo as the primary focus adds a different element to the course. It makes it more interesting as students are able to discuss global issues through the lens of an individual who typifies globalization. </p>

<p><b>03:09 lassinebamba:</b> Such an interesting concept for a class. I am curious as to some of the activities Professor Aguair plans to have for his students in the course. Will some of it focus on Ronaldo’s life off the field? His influence for both Portugal and Real Madrid? </p>
