Have you ever heard of the term, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking">"design thinking"</a>? Ever wonder what it looks like in practice? In this video, a group of Stanford University students engaged in design thinking to develop a new product for their fellow classmates. 
<p>

These playful design students tackled the challenge of students who ride their bikes to class and wish to carry a cup of joe along the way. The video showcases the core principles of design thinking, including understanding a problem or unmet need from the user perspective (in this case riding a bike while carrying a cup of coffee), prototyping ideas (designing a drink holder specifically for a bike), user testing (asking students with bikes to test out their models) and iterative design based on user feedback. In the end, the students came up with a unique product that they believed addressed an unmet need of their fellow classmates. After watching their design process showcased in the video, do you think design thinking was a useful approach in their pursuit of problem solving? Should design thinking be incorporated into other college courses? Join the conversation and add your two cents on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/7126"> Vialogues</a>.

<b>@02:42 Carla: </b>I think this step is really important--- clarifying the problem and understanding it from your user's perspective
<p>


<b>@05:13 Glamorgan:</b> The video does a great job of exemplifying of how a group of students came up with a product to solve a simple problem. I wonder if and how design thinking could be used for addressing more complex problems embedded in systems. Would it work and could it be taught in a course similar to the one highlighted here?


<p>
<b>@05:34 elisa.brazil:</b> What happens when users offer conflicting feedback (or simply have incompatible needs)? How does this affect the design process?
