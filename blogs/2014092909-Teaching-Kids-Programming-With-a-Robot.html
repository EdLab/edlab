          <p>
            <P>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/business/using-robotics-to-teach-computer-programming.html?ref=education" target = "blank">NY Times article</a> is a very cool idea. The little blue robot can be programmed by kids through a tablet or smartphone. Per creators, the interface and procedures to program this robot is appropriate for children around five years old. <p>
<P>I agree with the creators that teaching kids programming at a young age is very important, especially for the development of mathematical thinking. Some mathematical concepts (like logic operation, sequencing, looping, etc) cannot be easily understood by kids most of the time. Programming a robot would be a perfect way for them to learn these concepts. <P>
<P> The article also mentioned that computer programming is part of the first grade curriculum in Estonia. I was shocked by this fact. The K-12 Math and Science education kids receive in this country is lagging behind in many areas compared to their international peers.<P>
<P> While the government is pushing STEM education in college, it is important to build a solid math and science foundation for kids in K-12. I was a computer science major in college. We initially had a lot of people that wanted a degree in CS; However, the retention rate was horrible. At least half of them switched after first year. If they had a better math foundation, the situation would be different.<P>
