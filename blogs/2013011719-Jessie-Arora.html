Jessie Arora is an educational technology entrepreneur and thought leader.  Both the writer of <A href="http://edtechhandbook.com/">The EdTech Handbook</a> and the founder of TeacherSquare.com, Arora combines thought leadership with practice in her mission to create a "square" for teachers and stakeholders to unite around solving educational challenges. We had the chance to talk with her about her past and current work. 
<p>
<b> EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NLT </b>

<p>
<b>Q: How did your educational trajectory affect your current work?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> During my senior year at UCLA I took a seminar course as part of my minor
in Spanish Language where I taught at an adult literacy center in South
Central LA. That was my first real experience teaching and I was so
inspired by the transformation we were making in people's lives by
empowering them with the ability to read. At that point I directly saw the
impact that education had on people and the quality of their lives and knew
I wanted to focus my energy on this work.
<p>

<b>Q: What experiences do you apply to your work with TeacherSquare?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> <a href="http://www.teachaclass.org/">Teach-A-Class</a> is an early stage education nonprofit with a massive vision to actually deliver a free, world class education to anyone, anywhere. Having partnered deeply with Khan Academy and other OER content providers, Teach-A-Class is focusing on the last mile work of training local teachers and
providing them with offline access to all the amazing free online OER (Open Educational Resources) content that is more easily available to students in the developed world.  Teach-A-Classâ€™ work is quite similar to <a href="http://teachersquare.org/">TeacherSquare</a> because the focus is on supporting teachers and empowering them with the skills to make the technology work to improve instructional practice and not just the software. The technology is merely a tool and the real innovation is making it accessible to children in schools and communities all over the world.
<p>
<b>Q: How were you impacted by your involvement with Stanford's Ed 333B: "Envisioning the Future of Learning"?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> Stanford is really a magical place. The quality of individuals, energy and
ideas is unmatched and I was honored to bring my work with Teach-A-Class to <a href="http://educ333b.pbworks.com/w/page/50802750/FrontPage">Ed 333B: "Envisioning the Future of Learning"</a> through the Khan Academy design challenge. As an alum of the Stanford School of Education (POLS '08) it was really inspiring to come back to campus and build relationships with some of the current students. The education technology space has developed substantially in the past few years, so it was interesting to see how newer technologies were being incorporated into designing models for learning opportunities on a global level.
<p>

<b>Q: What lessons did you learn during your time at Google that you apply to your work as a founder?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> (Wow! This is really a tough question as Google was my first 'real' job in
the tech world after spending a year teaching English in Japan.) I joined
Google in late 2003 as one of the first members of the AdWords team and it
was phenomenal to help grow that team (in India and beyond) and support a
product that is one of the best business models on the web. Of all the
lessons I learned during my 4 years at Google what has been most
influential is the importance of building a strong company culture. You can
read a ton of books and articles about how to do this but nothing is as
powerful as seeing an organization grow and evolve from the inside and how
much that culture drives growth and success. People naturally want to be a
part of a community, a movement; something larger than themselves and one
of Google's enduring qualities has been cultivating an amazing culture that
celebrates people, innovation, quality and utility. I see lots of
organizations talk and think about this, but making it a reality is a
different story.
<p>
<b>Q: How do you envision TeacherSquare helping to change the
current/future learning landscape?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> TeacherSquare is building a community of educators who are passionate about learning and sharing their expertise. We know how much teacher quality
impacts student outcomes and that providing meaningful professional
development helps retain high quality educators, yet when we think about
'edtech' we often focus on the software and less on how it will be
implemented and integrated into pedagogical practice. While technology has
tremendous potential to make an impact on K-12 education, the real challenge
and rewards are around preparing teachers to best utilize the 'new'
innovative tools and resources. TeacherSquare is technology agnostic,
focusing on the human capital piece of the K12 system, built on the idea
that once teachers have the access and support to use various education
technology tools they will find their own creative ways to transform
teaching and learning beyond the current fixation with online content
delivery.
<p>
<p>
<b>Q: How do you imagine the EdTech Handbook helping to push forward
better/more relevant educational technologies?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The Edtech Handbook is a community curated guide to help aspiring education
entrepreneurs gain a better understanding about some of the nuances and
complexities of working in the education startup space. I am excited to see
that so many talented individuals are interested in solving problems around
teaching and learning and found myself answering the same questions over
and over again around where to start and what are the key challenges to
keep in mind, especially when taking on issues in the K12 world. The Edtech
Handbook is a living resource with new posts added each month, so I invite
anyone with expertise in the education startup space to contact me if they
are interested in contributing their thoughts and experience.
<p>
<p>
<b>Q: Why is educational technology emerging as a way to "save education?"</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The most promising elements of the current wave of education technology
tools is the ability to personalize learning and truly make it accessible
to anyone, anywhere. Previously it was considered cost prohibitive to think
about delivering education to everyone in this manner, and the recent
developments in education technology, especially around online content
delivery, has shifted this mindset. I wouldn't call it a revolution quite
yet, but the early implications are very promising.
<p>
<p>
<b>Q: Final thoughts?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The more we can create opportunities for students to take control of their
own learning goals and foster a culture of achievement and motivation for
all students, the more we will see improved learning outcomes for all
students. Education software, and the data that it surfaces, has the
potential to make learning more engaging and relevant, which are important
factors in motivation. Overall, I think we must be mindful of our
expectations of what software tools can offer and remember that learning is
a social practice as well and community plays an important role in the
learning process, for students and teachers.
