          <p>
            It is seldom to see women who are engineers or have acquired computer-programming skills. Often, many women pursue careers in health, business, agriculture, or commerce. This doesn't imply that women can't be engineers or participate in STEM fields. Many women don't seek to become engineers because they are not motivated. Additionally, it appears that engineering is mostly associated with men. In Senegal for instance, women have few chances to acquire computer or programming skills. As a result, one young woman from Dakar has set out to end that.
<p>
Binta Coudy De has created a Jjiguene Tech Hub that <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/nasikiliza/women-and-girls-are-answer-innovation-africa?hootPostID=ed55dd572446ab0bd6f50cf860f9205c" target = "blank">trains women in computer or programming skills that will help prepare them for a career in the high-tech sector</a>. She wants the world to recognize that women have potential. In essence, anything that men are capable of doing, women can also do as long as they are empowered and motivated. I strongly believe that if people would invest in her tech hub, it would benefit many women in Senegal and Africa particularly.
