<a href="http://www.classconnect.com/">ClassConnect</a> is a web-based application that helps teachers build lessons online and share them with their students. Teachers can also look at and share lessons posted by other teachers. The story behind the creation of this website is an interesting; you can read it on their <a href="http://www.classconnect.com/about/us">about</a> page.

<b>Pros:</b> 
The site itself is very easy to use and users can get plenty of help on navigating the site and performing several tasks. The help isn't simply text-only; it feels like your own personal guide is walking you through the site and its features. The search feature is very useful for finding lessons and, when you perform a search and receive a list of results, you can filter the results by grade level & subject, Common Core standards, file types, and instructional type. The site encourages collaboration among teachers, a feature that many teachers would want to have.

<b>Cons:</b> 
Although users can upload most types of documents and media onto the site there is a limit of 1 gigabyte, unless users invite other teachers to ClassConnect. This is a good way to bring in more users but if a user does not have anyone to invite then they are stuck with the 1 gigabyte storage.
 
<b>Edlab Relevance:</b> 
I like that the help tab is always on the right side of the page and if the user is familiar enough with the site, they can get rid of the tab by clicking on “end the ‘Getting Started' wizard”. It is interesting that the site opened up shop on March 5th yet when a user searches for a lesson plan there are plenty of results! It could be connected to the fact that when users invite their colleagues they receive more storage space. It's an interesting way to build up the user base.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
ClassConnect may be a useful resource for teachers who follow the Flipped Classroom model. It has a very clean user interface for a site that is much like a learning management system.
