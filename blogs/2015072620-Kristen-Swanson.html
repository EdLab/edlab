<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I've been an educator all my life. By the time I graduated from high school, I was already teaching developmental ballet classes to 4-year-olds. I love seeing people have an "aha" moment when they realize that they are growing in a world where anything is possible. </p>

<p>My longtime history with teaching and learning shapes every decision I make today, both personally and professionally. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
I hope that my work changes the learning landscape by <i>increasing empowerment</i>. I believe the greatest change we can make is to help another human being to see him/herself in a new light. Edcamps and much of the educational work I've done are designed to do just this. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The ability to connect seamlessly to others will greatly impact learning. Learning will no longer be about a specific place. Instead, it will be driven by carefully curated relationships that you nurture throughout your life. School will become an experience, not a building. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> 
I'm currently working very hard to connect Edcamp organizers across the globe. This has been a labor of love, and I'm delighted to see the impact of these connections. <p>

<p>My next big project is one related to technology and learning. I'm collecting data to measure the impact that technology has on the learning process. Our early findings are very interesting and encouraging.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter? </b><br>
The three most interesting people I follow on Twitter are <a href="http://bit.ly/1KT38DQ">Gayle Allen</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1KT37j9">Kasey Bell</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1JBSowq">Jay McTighe</a>. All three of these practitioners are leading the way when it comes to schooling and innovation.
