            As most of us know, education has and continues to play an important role in the development of humans. An organization that is doing its part to ensure that the next generation keeps the education dream alive is BUILD ON:  (Changing Lives for Good), an organization dedicated to empowering high school students to improve their communities by promoting the importance of education in developing countries.
 
Usually when one hears globalization, the first thing that pops up in their head is marketing and making of products and outsourcing. Globalizing education is becoming a new phenomenon as well as a leading global social issue. In addition, it will provide educational opportunities to young people in developing countries who may not have the means to do so otherwise. Last semester, students at my high school, Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, traveled to Mali to help build schools for a rural town through BUILD ON. Through their class presentations and personal recollections, I got the sense they came back humbled by the experience and now have a greater appreciation of other cultures, including their own. They also realized how important education could be to the less fortunate and how through it, our world can truly became a better place for all. 
 
I hope to see more organizations such as BUILD ON as it will provide opportunities for other high schoolers to learn more about the developing world in all its wonder, mystery and hope.
