            STEM leaders recently gathered in Washington, D.C., to address future jobs for our global economy. During the meeting, the leaders confronted the difficulties that some countries are facing. In this <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2014/02/13/op-ed-a-strong-education-for-a-strong-economy">op-ed</a> based on the conference, the author makes a case for increased attention to STEM in our schools to prepare students for 21st century professional life. 

She notes that in some countries, youth do not have the necessary skills to compete in the 21st century. This is extremely important as youth employment (and eventual continuous employment) can lead to an increased economy for some countries. American students are competing with their Chines and Indian counterparts for jobs in STEM. However, Americans are struggling in this competition due to poor performances on STEM related exams.

In order to prepare American students for 21st century professional life, access to a strong STEM curriculum must be paramount. This access must also include all students regardless of their gender or socio-economic backgrounds. We failed as a nation to prepare the current generation of engineers: only three percent are African American and 13% are female. To this end, educators play a vital role in introducing students not just to technology but how to critically think and analyze data (and all the information) in front of them.
