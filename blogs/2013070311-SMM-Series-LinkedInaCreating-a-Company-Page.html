            For Edlab, you can search "Edlab" and find different employees that are currently working or have worked at EdLab in the past, but we don't have an actual company page.  I'm not sure if we want one, but today's post will be on creating a company page on LinkedIn. Here's the article I've included in my course that shows the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/01/20/10-steps-to-create-a-linkedin-company-page/">steps on what to do when creating a company profile</a>.

I think all the steps are incredibly important, but the ones I especially like are:

<b>6. Ask your employees to connect with your page</b>
I believe that for people who may not know what a company is/does, they automatically look at the summary as well as the people that work there. You don't want to get involved with an unfamiliar company (by working there or using their products) without knowing the type of people that work there. 

<b>7. Ask for product and service reviews</b>
I think we all know that the main goal is to keep customers happy, and to listen to their feedback.  Hopefully, by finding out what most people like, we can learn about some things we can improve on to attract more users.

<b>9. Promote your LinkedIn Company Page</b>
This one can be done by just adding a “Follow us on LinkedIn” button on your company's main website, right next to “Like us on Facebook” and “Follow us on Twitter” buttons.

The main drawback of creating a LinkedIn company page is just that it's another site to maintain and update.
