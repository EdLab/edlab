          <p>
            With the <a href="http://vialogues.com"> Vialogues</a> team making rapid changes to the aesthetics and functionality of the tool, I feel it is time for Vialogues to receive its shine in different expos and conferences. 

With that said, I came across information about <a href="https://www.peteandc.org/default.asp">The Pennsylvania Educational Technology Expo and Conference</a>. The conference has a tagline of "Innovate…Collaborate…Educate". I think this would be a great conference to attend and also provides us with a chance to take a look at what other educational technology / programs are out there. Take a look at the list of <a href="https://www.peteandc.org/program.asp">keynote speakers.</a> I am currently working on a proposal for submission - please let me know if you would like to provide your perspective of how Vialogues would fit in the conference.

I just registered to retrieve for info/ guideline about the conference please see proposal guideline below...

Vendor/Exhibitor Sessions: A conference presentation by a commercial enterprise or it's agents requires representation on the exhibit floor. Contact Marilyn Chastek for more information. Vendor sessions are reviewed in the same process as non-vendor sessions and are subject to selection, but will not be reviewed if there is not appropriate representation on the exhibit floor.

Return to this site beginning on November 15, 2011 to see if your proposal has been accepted. Accepted proposals will be listed in the Tentative Concurrent Sessions section of the web site.

Choose the type of session that best fits your proposal:

One hour sessions: Concurrent lecture type sessions lasting one hour. Discuss your topic and include audience participation whenever possible. These can be listed as BYOL by including BYOL at the end of your Presentation Summary for Conference Program Books.

Poster Sessions: Presenters prepare a display to exhibit their topic and discuss it with interested attendees as the attendees visit their display. Poster presenters are expected to remain with their poster throughout the assigned 2 hour and 15 minute time period. (Covers two one hour sessions and the break between).

Panel Sessions: This one hour session gives a panel of up to four presenters an opportunity to discuss varied perspectives on a topic of choice and promote discussion with the audience.

Peer Reviewed Sessions (Higher Ed): The proposals submitted for Peer Reviewed Sessions are evaluated for research basis required for promotion and tenure tracks. Session presentations are one hour. Presenters from Higher Ed institutions are welcome to submit proposals in other session types as well.
