            Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine
<i>Understanding our fascination with Jobs helps us begin to know ourselves.</i>

<p>Executive <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/02/25/kids-cant-wait-apple/">Phil Schiller once said,</a> “Education is deep in Apple’s DNA.” It wasn’t a line. Two years after the company was founded, Apple signed a contract with the Minnesota Education Computing Consortium to supply computers. California later passed a law that former CEO Steve Jobs pushed. It allowed a 25% tax credit for any computing equipment companies donated to schools. Apple disseminated approximately 9000 computers in California under its Kids Can’t Wait program. Jobs could exert his will within corporate boardrooms, political circles, and classrooms.  </p>

<p>But the higher Steve Jobs rose professionally, the further he fell personally. Apple overtook Exxon as the world’s most valuable company in 2011, shortly after his death. It has remained among the highest valued corporations in the world ever since. However, despite his meteoric career trajectory that would make Horatio Alger envious, Jobs later fell to horrible lows. Given Apple’s ubiquity across the world, it’s difficult to remember more tenuous times. Jobs once resigned from the beloved company he co-founded with Steve Wozniak. Before he re-emerged from this purgatory, Apple teetered on bankruptcy. Luckily, the company’s lucrative relationship with the educational market, as well as base of diehard fans, tided them over until Jobs wielded his Midas touch once more. </p>

<p>Alex Gibney’s penetrating documentary film, <i>Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine</i>, moves beyond the mostly hagiographic portraits that have been painted since Jobs’ death. It’s a nuanced examination of the complex person who almost singlehandedly propelled the computer industry into the mainstream. </p>

<p>Eschewing simple chronology, Gibney attempts to understand this iconic tech mogul through a novel lens. More specifically, Jobs wasn’t a gifted athlete, talented musician or commanding actor. So why did people across the globe mourn his death? By attempting to answer this seemingly simple question, Gibney pulls apart the intricately woven threads of Jobs’ life and the carefully constructed persona he publicly projected. </p>

<p>For example, instead of focusing exclusively on major turning points such as product launches or IPOs, Gibney examines a mostly forgotten investigative story. Who was the inspiration for Apple’s “Lisa” computer? Gibney also details a series of missteps that plagued Apple the end of his life. These include incidences involving Foxconn factories, backdated stock options and, perhaps most revealing, his complicated relationships with former employees. For a person renowned for his minimalist aesthetic and deep interest in Zen Buddhism, Steve Jobs lived a life that was remarkably cluttered, confrontational, and full of animus. Similar to the cinematic depiction of one of his well-known Silicon Valley peers, you don’t get to 500 million friends (or in his case, Apple customers), without making a few enemies. From Gibney’s film, it looks like Jobs made more than a few.</p>

<p><i>Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine</i> becomes even more revealing by shifting its inquiry away from our collective affection for Jobs and turning it inward. This helps us reflect on our complicity in a society where we willingly purchase technology of all types. Gibney asks us why we are so attached to Apple products? And how do we reconcile the paradox of devices that keep us perpetually connected yet feel ever more isolated? </p>

<p>Jobs describes his design team members who developed the multicolor Macintosh computers that became beloved by educators. He believed they would reveal that working with him was the most inspiring, and demanding, time of their lives. Achieving perfection on a complex project like an Apple device is incredibly draining. The links in the supply chain stretch too long, too many components must be woven into a seamless whole, too much smoothing is necessary to winnow away superfluous features. In sum, to sculpt a masterpiece of design, it can only be all consuming. 

It's heartbreaking to hear former colleagues, friends, lovers and even journalists speak frankly about their alternating attraction for, and repulsion towards, Jobs—much like the oscillating current on one of his beloved circuit boards. A long-time Bob Dylan fan, Jobs learned the careful art of self-mythologizing. He pushed himself to become more than man, greater than machine; something universal, even elemental. Jobs burned blisteringly hot in his single-minded vision to craft a future where computers seamlessly co-existed with people, becoming unquestioned extensions of man, even in the classroom. Unfortunately, from these earnest testimonials, those drawn too closely into his lofty orbit of relentless ambition often tragically fell from the sky like a latter-day Icarus. However, for those brief moments when they were up close and could bear the burning heat, the view was spectacular. </p>
