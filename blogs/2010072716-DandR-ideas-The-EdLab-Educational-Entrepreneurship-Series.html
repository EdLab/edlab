As part of the D&R seminar today, we asked participants to imagine an ideal EdLab-produced learning/professional development experience for educational entrepreneurs.  They were further pressed to imagine that the experience would take place within 2 weeks.  Could it be done? 

Here are the ideas of the five groups in attendance. The italicized sections are questions I had for that group. If any member of the group could enlighten me, that would be awesome :) Also, if I got anything wrong, please don't hesitate to correct me!

<b>Group 1: A new version of the EdLab Venture Competition</b>
<li>Utilize the alumni network (via online collaboration tools)</li>
<li>Create specific categories for entrants. This would encourage participation rather than limit it</li> -- <i>Can you elaborate on this point? Did you have specific categories in mind? Why do you think this style would nurture creativity?</i> 
--<i>Also, I think I missed how exactly this differs from the previous EVC...</i>

<b>Group 2: "Failure [to adopt]" Conference</b>
<li>First we would do a case study of EdLab products that would enlighten as to why they aren't being adopted.  </li>
<li>Then, we would come up with interventions and implement them.</li>
<li>At the end of this research process, we will present our findings (in the form of "lessons learned" at the Failure [to adopt] Conference</li>
<li>The underlying goal of this study/conference is to establish EdLab as a credible  educational entrepreneurship resource.</li>--<i>What would the length of this experience be?</i>
--<i> Also, would it only be EdLab presenting? If so, maybe as it evolves we could invite others to present at our failure conference... I'd pay to see that!</i>

<b>Group 3: Online courses and face-to-face workshops to help people start a business</b>
<li>This would be a paid experience but "learners would get their money's worth"</li>-- <i> What would make this  a worthwhile investment?</i>
<li>Strategy: Release at least one course as soon as possible to see if it garners interest</li>
<li>Create a series of face-to-face workshops that would appeal to entrepreneurs. Invite "big names" (i.e. Phoenix Wang) to give the workshops within their specialty (marketing, PR, getting funding, etc)</li>


<b>Group 4: A series of workshops</b>
<li>Help bring educators and developers together via workshops</li>-- <i>How will you reach these groups?</i>
<li>Start small (so, start at TC) and exceed expectations.  Grow from here. </li>

<b>Group 5: Reality TV</b>
<li>Focus on "the idea"</li>
<li>The reality TV show would showcase how ideas can make a difference</li>
<li>The show could also link people with ideas to people who can help execute them</li> --<i>I may have misinterpreted this.  As a side note, another cool show would be to connect aspiring entrepreneurs with whatever they are lacking ($, office space, mentorship...).. it could be a gaaame show!</i>
<li>Inspirational TV show that features current educational entrepreneurs.</li>
<li>Create a website full of resources</li>--<i> Like what?</i>
