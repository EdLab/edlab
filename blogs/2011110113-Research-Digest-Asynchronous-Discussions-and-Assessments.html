            <a href ="http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/maclachlan/EDER_679.06_Fall_2009/Assessment_Discussions.pdf "> Vonderwell, Selma, Liang, Xin, and Alderman, Kay. (2007). Asynchronous Discussions and Assessment in Online Learning. <i>Journal of Research on Technology in education</i>, 39(3), 309-328 </a>    
   

<b>Description:</b> This paper explores learning through the use of asynchronous online discussions, and assessment processes. The authors believe that tools that have an asynchronous discussion function can be used in classroom assessment to determine what students are learning in the classroom and how well they are learning. The paper also discusses many of the positives of online asynchronous discussion tool when used for classroom assessment. Some include how instructors can get immediate feedback and help students take ownership of their learning, how through practice in assessment students can be self motivated to manage their own learning through self and peer assessments, and how students can learn to better communicate through writing.

<b>Method:</b> The method used to test the effectiveness of assessment in online asynchronous discussion was a case study that employed participants from five master's level online courses. The online application that was used was WebCT, which was used as a course management tool. Three data sources were used for collecting data and analyzing from the five classes: online observations of the asynchronous discussions, an open-ended online survey, and the transcript of an asynchronous discussion on online learning and teaching.

<b>Results:</b> The results were divided into several key points of assessment through online discussions, and discussed throughout the paper. These key points are structure, learning community, self-regulatory cognition and activities, learner autonomy, and writing skills. These key points influence student learning, and online learning can benefit from assessment as inquiry and assessment of constructed knowledge in asynchronous discussions.
   
<b>Edlab Relevance:</b> Asynchronous discussion is one our main features on Vialogues, and I believe that in order to fully promote Vialogues to other schools as a learning tool, we need to understand the full learning potential of our site. When talking to other educators about Vialogues they will want to know how exactly their students would benefit from using this feature on our site. When I talked to  <a href ="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6715"> Katie</a> about Vialogues she said that she wasn't sure if some of her students would be fully interested in participating in a Vialogue, she believed that only the enthusiastic students would be fully active. I'm sure most teachers will ask us this which is why I think that by looking through previous papers like this one we can build up an argument on why Vialogues is the <b>best</b> tool that will have <b>all</b> students engaged. So while I'm waiting for feedback from the flipping educators, I will be looking into different ways teachers can use Vialogues for their own learning styles and ways to make Vialogues appealing for all students.
