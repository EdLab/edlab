            There was a recent report from the second “State of Web Development” survey of professional web designers and developers published. It includes details and analysis of the current technologies, and techniques used by today's web professionals, to give a sense of what kind of techniques are becoming popular and what are dying in terms of web development. 

Here are some interesting results from the survey and a few comments from me: 
<!--break-->

<li>Few respondents(2%) use any form of Internet Explorer (IE) for their day to day web use, but IE8 is the leading browser(84%) developers test their sites on. (I guess web professionals are not big fans of Internet Explorer, but let's face it, there are still 33% internet users who are currently using IE.)</li>

<li>Google Chrome has jumped dramatically as the browser of choice for developers to 3rd at 17%, just behind Safari at 20%. Firefox still remains the number one choice by some way. </li>

<li>Over half of respondents now use Mac OS X as their primary operating system. (In the mean time, there has been news that Apple has become the biggest technology company in the world, surpassing Microsoft based on market capitalization. Apple lost in the '90s to Microsoft's MS-DOS and Windows, maybe Apple is winning this time?)</li>

<li>Nearly a third of respondents (up from 16%) use Mobile Safari, while Android use is at around 4%. (Nexus One turns out to be NOT an iPhone killer, looks like Android and Google still has a long way to go on the mobile phone market.)</li>

<li>JQuery has become even more dominant, with nearly 80% of all respondents using the library, up from 63% last year. (I guess I really need to learn JQuery now before it's too late...)</li>

<li>More respondents (45%) than not (44%) use CSS3 and experimental CSS, up dramatically from last year (only 22% then were using CSS3 and nearly 70% not.)</li>

<li>HTML5 is now used to some extent by around 30% of respondents, up from under 10% last survey. (I will try using HTML5 more and more, and here is why: <a  href="http://googlewebtoolkit.blogspot.com/2010/04/look-ma-no-plugin.html">Google Engineers Recreate Quake II In HTML5</a>.)
