          <p>
            Every day I am greeted with an e-mail from Cynopsis Kids explaining the new trends and moves in children's media.  Today, I saw something that we at the EdLab could keep an eye on for our disaster preparedness project.  It appears that Big Bird, yes that lovable bird from Sesame Street, and the Sesame Street team are developing a family / kid friendly kit to help in the aftermath of a disaster in China.  But, of course, this will be done in a fun way - through games, songs, and an activity book.  It may be interesting to see how Sesame Street develops and shares their content.  While this project is specifically for China, it may spark our own ideas and creativity when working with the National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) project.

<i>Here is the post: </i>
Sesame Street's Big Bird gathered in China with executives from Sesame Workshop, China Youth Development Foundation (CYDF), which launched the Project Hope program that helps provide underprivileged kids with access to education in China, and MSD, a global healthcare company, as they announced the production and distribution of emergency response and preparedness content for kids and their families in China.  The initiative is designed to help provide families with free educational information, featuring Big Bird and friends, to help in the aftermath of a natural disaster and support the development of Hope Primary Schools in poor rural areas in two phases.  Two different kits, one addressing emergency response and the other on emergency preparedness, will be distributed in 15 provinces that have been severely impacted by or are prone to crises such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Henan.

In the first phase the partners will focus on providing emergency response content in a kit that includes age appropriate games, activity sheets, and a caregiver's guide, and a kid's activity book, which will be available from March 2011.  The kit aims to help provide a sense of normalcy following a disaster.
Phase two takes aim at emergency preparedness, and will include distribution of another kit that contains a DVD featuring songs and activities that will help kids learn about getting ready for emergencies with their families - this includes knowing your whole name, parents' names and putting together an emergency kit together, as well as a parent/caregiver magazine with further emergency preparedness information, and a kid's activity book.  This kit will be available from September 2011.
