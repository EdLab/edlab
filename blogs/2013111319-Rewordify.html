<p>Rewordify.com is a free online reading tool to help people easily understand difficult English texts. The site allows teachers and learners to copy and paste advanced-level text into a field that replaces difficult words with simple synonyms, much like a language translation site.</p>

<p>For example, the following text (from a <a href=" http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/amazon-couples-print-digital-books-with-new-program/?ref=technology"target="blank">New York Times article</a> about ebooks):</p>

<p>is "re-wordified" to the following:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><i>There's little doubt some book fans exist who are as <b>excited</b> about the benefits of e-books as they are <b>sad and thoughtful</b> for the sight of colorful book spines on their walls.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>The goal of the tool is to empower ESL students to learn independently and comprehend more challenging reading exercises and to assist teachers in creating vocabulary exercises.</p>


<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Rewordify has many features that are extremely helpful for teachers trying to plan their lessons quickly or use in-class tools: it’s completely free, doesn’t have any ads, and doesn’t require login or registration. Additionally, the simple layout and re-wordify box at the top of the page make it extremely easy to translate a page or text quickly. A demo video assists teachers who may need more hand-holding. Translations are also accompanied by a note indicating the level of difficulty – a feature that is essential for planning appropriate material.</p>

<p>Because learners may have different preferences as to how they would like synonyms displayed, they have the option to change the highlighting settings and have the word appear as a suggestion in brackets in the text or by hovering over the word. It also encourages learners to practice their new vocabulary words with on-screen flash cards and quizzes. Teachers have this option as well, and can create activities and tests based on the most difficult words in a passage. </p>


<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>It appears that most of the synonyms and alternate expressions are more often geared for intermediate to advanced learners, making this tool less helpful for beginning-level speakers. And as with traditional translation exercises, over-reliance on this site could cause students to become dependent on it and less skillful at using other methods of determining meaning. Teachers might also be tempted to rely on this as an automated lesson generation tool, so it would be best used in limited, purposeful, structured ways alongside other methods for communicating and deriving meaning.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>The simplicity and accessibility of Rewordify encourages teachers to incorporate more advanced texts easily into their lessons and encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning in new ways. Outside of class, students can use it as an independent reading tool or as a tool to enhance their web browsing. Rewordify joins the ranks of other products like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/716"target="blank">Ponder</a>, <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/735"target="blank">Actively Learn</a>, and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/590"target="blank">Gobstopper</a> that allow learners to interact with and manipulate texts for their own learning needs.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Rewordify is a valuable tool for teachers and students seeking to expand their vocabulary through more advanced reading.</p>
