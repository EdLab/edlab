          <p>
            Once again an online scam has made the news. This time it is sex traffickers posing as boyfriends, or someone from an agency in an effort to get to know the females that they target in person. It is very important for people to be aware that this can happen to anyone. With so many people using the internet, there is really no way to tell if the person you meet online is real or not, which is why it's best to not talk to anyone you don't know online. One shocking aspect of this new online scam is that the majority of females that are getting caught in this are smart educated women who probably had no idea such thing will happen at the time of their meeting up. 

What are some ways to prevent this? For example, many people want to date and can't find a significant other in person due to not having enough time, so they sign up for dating sites to meet them. Should people use applications like Skype and FaceTime before they meet in person to know what the person look like and to have an idea of what to expect? Sometimes you can judge by looks and have a feeling if you should meet the person or not.
