Dreambox Learning is a mathematics learning application that is tailored for use in schools. Currently, the application is geared to K-3 students, with an emphasis on basic counting and four operations skills. The mathematical pedagogy focuses on the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_manipulative">manipulatives</a>. Each math exercise is turned into a simple game that is part of a larger adventure.

<b>Pros:</b>
Dreambox has got the design down. It is beautifully and elegantly presented to the K-3 student. There is a mascot to guide the student along through the adventure and the instructions are very easy to follow. Dreambox also does a great job of incorporating progression game dynamics effectively. In each exercise, there is a unique progress bar that serves to indicate the student's progress in the exercise. It should be noted however that the progress bar is asymmetric, in that it will always seem like you are far away from the goal based on the progress bar but you are actually quite close to success. Each of the exercises has a visible reward or badge that can be used to gain further rewards along the adventure. Ultimately, these rewards can be used to play games within the application. All of this makes for an incredibly enjoyable game layer for this application.

<b>Cons:</b>
In many of the exercises, there's an opportunity to game the system and only do problems you are comfortable doing. Choice is a tricky thing and can easily be abused by the student. Dreambox's emphasis on manipulatives and its tricky explanations (e.g. explaining a 6x6 array as 9 groups of 4 in the first multiplication problem I could do) makes it difficult to extend Dreambox outside of the classroom without other instructional tools to complement. I would have liked to see some appointment dynamics to draw the student back to the application, but if this is solely intended for the classroom, it may not be necessary.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Obviously Dreambox has many parallels to the EdLab math application with its use of progression game dynamics and mascot. Dreambox adds some real insight on the design side of the math application. Nevertheless, EdLab's math application will probably take a different pedagogical approach.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Dreambox Learning has the game layer down pat and is great for giving students additional practice with math problems. On the other hand, Dreambox is limited in its pedagogical approach and can serve to confuse students who are being exposed to a certain concept for the first time. My tip: learn an efficient algorithm, then use dreambox to hone those skills.
