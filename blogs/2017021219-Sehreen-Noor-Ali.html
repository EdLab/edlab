<p>Sehreen Noor Ali is the head of business development and corporate partnerships for Kaplan's New Economy Skills Training practice areas: Metis and Dev Bootcamp. She is responsible for building corporate training programs to help companies keep their talent relevant and competitive in the tech economy. Noor Ali was previously the head of business development at <a href="https://www.noodle.com/">Noodle</a>. She has consulted for littleBits, the Clinton Global Initiative, and the Mastercard Foundation's ICT in Africa program. She started her career at the State Department where she was a strategist on the public diplomacy team covering innovation, entrepreneurship, and education in the Middle East and South Asia. She worked in the UAE, France, and Nepal and also led the team that developed the first set of digital diplomacy products to engage Iranian citizens. Noor Ali is a graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Brown University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at EdTechWomen/Kaplan?</b><br>
<p>My father’s career in international development meant our home was a train station for a motley crew of guests. At one dinner we hosted: a political dissident who had fled Tajikistan after running against the incumbent president; the head of USAID’s Central Asia office; and a generous philanthropic donor who was an immigrant from India and built his wealth through gas stations. Participating in discussions of geopolitics from a young age made me obsessed with factors limiting economic self-determination. While at Brown, and later at a research institute in London, I studied international development in South Asia and the Middle East.</p>
 
<p>When I landed at the State Department after several years of school, the Department was at the very early stages of developing technology-driven diplomacy. I led the team that made the first set of digital communication tools to engage with Iranian citizens. I became immersed in product development and user-centric design for foreign users at a time when learning content was becoming democratized. You can’t imagine how much soft power we derive from our education system and the content we produce, so helping increase access to these assets was important. After five years at State, personal reasons drove me to NYC and I decided to leverage my master’s degree in education to land a job at an edtech startup, Noodle.com. I intentionally sought a for-profit organization because innovation in government wasn’t fast enough for me. Noodle.com gave me chops in sales and the illustrious art of defining product-market fit. At Kaplan, I use these skills daily as we develop the training and opportunities to help companies adapt their workforce to the needs of the current and future economy.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at EdTechWomen/Kaplan will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I’m passionate about workforce development. How we educate students to be productive citizens of the economy and of civil society are matters of national security in my mind. One of the reasons I love my work at Kaplan is because we focus both on the rigorous technical skills that students need to succeed in the tech-driven market, but also on the ‘liberal arts’ skills required to be empathetic, critical thinking employees that bring important perspectives to product development and business practices.</p>
 
<p>In terms of EdTechWomen (ETW), it’s the women who participate in the network that are changing the landscape. My co-founder, Margaret Roth, and I open-sourced the brand in 2016 so that anyone could start an ETW chapter. What we did was offer a platform for a latent desire of connectivity that was already there. I recently met one of the founding members of ETW Tokyo. Their work to help train STEM teachers and lift up businesswomen in education is mind-blowing. Each chapter prioritizes their own goals, but overall, my hope is that women find ETW as a platform they can amplify and make visible their own impact in edtech. It blows my mind that there is still so much interest in the platform and Margaret and I have a couple of goals for early 2017 that we hope to implement soon that’ll make engagement easier - stay tuned!</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The explosion of data will hopefully drive how we learn. It’s making artificial intelligence more viable as the basis of consumer products, and when it finally reaches education, I think it’ll accelerate the model of education from teaching to self-directed and individualized learning.</p>

<p>That being said, the challenge to the role of machine learning in education is that we will become less accustomed to identifying products that have inherent bias in terms of how they are designed. Whether the models that underpin artificially intelligent education products are human or machine made, we should be prepared to understand how they are constructed on the backend. Crudely, we can perhaps correlate this challenge to information illiteracy. In many ways, as consumers in the digital era, we are becoming less critical of what’s served to us, in the way that Facebook can become an echo-chamber, because we see technology as self-correcting or neutral. Our view of the world can be designed for us unwittingly and we need to be cognizant of this as the power of data enters education.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at EdTechWomen/Kaplan, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I’ve become interested in how narratives of education define the way parents make decisions about their children’s education. A good example is our focus on STEM skills that makes some parents I know scramble for more math and science classes without consideration of what is actually being taught and for what purpose. Another is the singular focus some have with Ivy League universities as the do-or-die option for their child to be successful in life. There’s a gap between what we believe is a ‘good education’ and the realities of what are the seismic technological, civic, and economic changes coming our way. There’s opportunity in this gap of information that I’m exploring on my own and through the <a href="http://pahara.org/">Pahara NextGen Fellowship</a>.</p>
