Class, meet your new teacher, Saya. She’s heavy, expensive, and cold. Before you all make a mad rush for the exit, some added knowledge that might compel you to stay: she’s a robot. 
<p>
Japanese engineer and Tokyo University of Science professor Hiroshi Kobayashi is the man behind the machine. Saya is a formidable marvel 15 years in the making. Though her natural state features a soulless, blank gaze, she can show 6 different emotions: surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness. Currently, she can be counted on to take roll but not too much else. 
<p>
To those who criticize his creation as a poor attempt to replace teachers, Kobayashi offers reassurance. "We are not looking [to make] something that will take over teachers." Instead, his goal is to expose children to the new technologies that make up the robot teacher as a means to enhance lessons in STEM. However, Kobayashi does admit that planting more Saya’s throughout rural Japan could address the current teacher shortage in such areas. 
<p>
While they likely won’t be taking over your job just yet, it’s still too early to say sayonara to Saya and her robot brethren. Who knows, you could soon find yourself locked in competition with a classroom robot, vying for the attention of a captivated student audience. 
<p>
Watch how elementary students react to their substitute teacher in the vialogue above (spoiler alert: they take "hands-on learning" a bit literally) and add your thoughts to the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8650">Vialogues.</a>
<p>
<b>@00:54 Clark:</b> In the time it takes to build the robot using "new" technologies, wouldn't those same technologies become obsolete?
<p>
<b>@1:53 Lola:</b> I don't know if this teacher was just being polite, but it's interesting that he has the attitude of "the technology isn't there yet" vs. "it'll never get there." He doesn't seem worried about losing his job to a robot!
