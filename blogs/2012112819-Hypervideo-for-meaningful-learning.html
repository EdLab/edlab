<b>Title:</b> Hypervideo Design and Support for Contextualized Learning (2004)
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Teresa Chambel,  Carmen Zahn, and Matthias Finke  <p> 
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b>
Video is a powerful resource for learning, especially when learning is dependent on visually understanding an idea, process or action. But watching videos has typically been a passive activity, which does not encourage reflection, a key component of the learning process. With hypervideo technology, we have the potential to provide the kind of scaffolding that encourages reflection and supports the overall learning process.  Broadly defined, hypervideo is the integration of video in <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia> hypermedia structures</a>. It combines interactive video and hypertext, allowing learners to add their own materials to selective videos.  When designed properly hypervideo technology can offer guidance on what to view, manage the tempo of information flow, provide helpful notes, encourage targeted discussions, and make connections to other relevant material. 
<p>

To explore the potential of hypervideo in online learning environments, the authors of <a href= "http://mummy.intranet.gr/includes/docs/Conferences/_03_HypervideoDesign4Learning-Chambel-ICALT04.pdf "> this paper </a> developed a model that was grounded in socio-cognitive learning theory. Using this model, they then developed online math and literacy course materials that centered around hypervideo and that aimed to support different learning styles as well as different stages of learning  (including reflection). Using hypermedia spaces as case studies, they then examined the learning experiences of students enrolled in online courses from four universities that utilized the authorsâ€™ hypervideo course material. 
<p>
<b> Findings: </b> 
The authors concluded that students were more motivated to watch hypervideos compared to traditional videos because the hypermedia spaces provided a more flexible and engaging learning environment. The authors also believed that learners preferred the hypermedia spaces because searching for information was easier compared to searching for information in more traditional video formats. 
<p>
<b> Moving forward: </b> 
Technology today has tremendous potential to support learning, but in order to create effective learning tools and environments, it is imperative to understand human cognition and social learning processes. The authors of this study discovered that integrating video into hypermedia spaces encouraged more meaningful learning. The key, however, was setting up the hypermedia spaces in a mindful way that supported different stages and styles of learning. The authors warned that information overload in hypermedia spaces can potentially deter learning. They concluded that more research should be done to inform design guidelines, and the development of hypervideo production frameworks to support meaningful learning.
