Bror Saxberg makes a passionate plea for more <a href="http://brorsblog.typepad.com/brors-blog/2012/09/innovation-in-education-is-still-missing-common-grounding-in-learning-science.html">"learning engineers"</a> who will help us not only to develop new educational technologies, but also to understand which ones we should focus on and why.  Through his work at <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/">Kaplan</a>, Saxberg has the scale and research reserves to take us into a future where engineering learning is as carefully thought out as designing a bridge. In this case, a "bridge" that replaces steel with scalable learning opportunities.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW </b>

<p>
<b>Question:</b>  How did your educational trajectory affect your current work?<br>  
<b>Answer</b>: Oddly enough, I started doing work on the intersection between neuroscience, computers, information theory, and cognitive science way back in college, in the late 70's, during a summer job I had at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories.  They asked me to identify a new, tough, area for them to apply their remarkable communications research skills - lots of coding theory being done for space science work, but the money was starting to run out.  I thought how the brain stores and codes information was a big unsolved problem and spent the summer working in one corner of it for them - and caught the bug.<br>  
I had also been very lucky to have a very long succession of really excellent teachers from grade school through high school (let's not talk about Kindergarten - end-of-year report card said, "Will be a juvenile delinquent - does not listen, always talking, bothers the other children...") <br>
My graduate school life continued the theme of my interests in the overlap of information theory, technology, cognitive science - I studied human and machine vision at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory during the 1980's, which gave me a pretty rich exposure to many areas of cognitive science, as well as expanding computing technology.  By the time I left McKinsey in the mid 90's, what had been research hardware in the early 1980's were simply personal computers in the mid-90's, and so I embarked on a series of practical, at scale, implementations of the overlap of technology, cognition, and various types of topics of skills and knowledge from then forward. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>  
<b>Answer</b>: My work helping to start the education company K12, Inc. was very important to the work I do now.  From its founding in 2000 until later that decade, we would read as much as we could about learning science for the age of kids we were targeting that year, including general studies about how media and text affect learning and how that might affect kids as well as specific studies about topics and roadblocks kids had, especially mathematics and reading understanding for the younger grade levels.  Every year, we then had to develop our program in time for fall, so we had a real "learning engineering" problem every year:  use the learning science that existed (as best we could understand it) within the constraints of time, funding, and our users' abilities, to build the most efficient, engaging, and effective learning environment we could.  And then we did it the next year, and the next.
That experience of going back and forth between the science of learning and practical, scaled up, multiple-media implementations is a critical part of what we're trying to do at Kaplan.  Kaplan has a much wider range of students, starting a bit older (middle school is as young as we do anything right now) but stretching right out through post-secondary and career training.  It's also much larger, with more than a million students per year, stretching across 16 time zones.  The goal is to get all the different learning environments we've got (there are many!) to start sharing a common set of concepts, ideas, language, even processes to put evidence-based methods from learning science to work solving practical learning problems, every day.  "Learning engineering," done at scale. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>   
<b>Answer</b>: Several ways.  It's remarkable how little true "learning engineering" as I described above goes on in education:  very few people are out there everyday, with the fundamental principles and guidelines from learning science emblazoned in their minds, using those to solve their learning challenges as they come to them, page by page, screen by screen, lesson by lesson.  It's as if physicians did not know that many diseases come from bacteria, but many come from genetic issues, and the two are dramatically different.  Or a mechanical engineer who is not following the most recent developments in materials science.  In so many fields, there are practicing "engineers" (clinicians don't think of themselves that way, but they sort of are engineers of biological science) who avidly follow the latest information on how the world really works in their domain - the science - because they know that the world is going to affect their attempts at solutions, whether they know it or not, whether they wish it were that way or not.  So I'm hoping our training, work, and results in "learning engineering" can show how this can make a difference at scale. 
The other thing we're doing that might lead to broader changes is to develop ways to do many controlled trials at once.  Some of our learning events will have hundreds, even thousands, of students starting every month on a specific topic.  We want to start learning from many more of those interactions, by doing more careful data collection and controlled trials, which could scale up to many trials every month.  That brings education closer to what places like Google, Amazon, Facebook are able to do - not guess about what will help their users, but really see if well-intentioned changes actually work as intended at scale.  This is a part of the "learning engineering" mindset, but, again, the infrastructure to do this quickly has not been available to educators.  With virtual courses and tools, we can do more. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br> 
<b>Answer</b>: Clearly technology can and should have a major transformative impact as it becomes more ubiquitous and more powerful, especially its use to personalize each student's learning experience: each student should wind up with a very different, targeted, set of information, demonstrations, practice, and feedback, even for the same outcomes.  However, this will only happen if people think about the learning problems and affordances first - in any domain, if you assume your "software package" will solve a problem that you cannot, you are likely doomed.  You have to first solve the problem, and then technology can take the good solutions (just as it can for bad solutions) and make them affordable, reliable, available, and data-rich.  24/7 videos of college professors?  Twitter feeds as a main line to teach biochemistry?  Technology could deliver such things - but learning is unlikely to benefit efficiently from them alone, because that's not how the learning system works best. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> We're working on a lot of things, but perhaps the two biggest things we're working on were mentioned above. 
First, a training environment for Kaplan's people who are working to shape learning environments, that can help make them "learning engineers" by exposing them to evidence-based results about learning, and giving them experiences (including coached development experiences) building learning environments using those principles.  The course is intended to use the very principles it tries to teach - it, itself, is an example of how to make the tradeoffs while leveraging what we know about learning.  Lots of practice and feedback - and that "minds-on" project-development part, to really cement how to apply principles in practice, by having the learners apply them in practice. 
Secondly, with several businesses within Kaplan (including both the Kaplan Test Prep organization, and the virtual Kaplan University), we're working to build out semi-automated ways to execute controlled trials quickly.  The idea is to streamline all the processes for setting up and executing such trials ahead of time (which requires real investment!), so that the next trial, and the next, have minimal new overhead - they just need to build whatever is going to be tested, and any new metrics that are needed, but the rest of the machinery should be in place.  If we succeed at this, we also need to build processes to generate and decide on many different pilots to test:  that's not an easy process by itself!  We're likely to have many ideas bubble up from within Kaplan, but we'll also likely eventually be looking for well-founded (i.e., consistent with, or at least not contradictory with, good learning science) ideas from outside Kaplan to test as well - from researchers, publishers, start-ups, perhaps others.  
All in all, an extremely exciting time to be engaged in improving learning.  While there are major problems in education right now, with the large amount known about learning that has not yet been applied, and increasingly flexible and affordable technologies available to alter the economics of applying the right learning science, we're hoping for major benefits for learners (and families, and institutions, and employers) over the next decade or so.
