Scott Lee is the CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.gooroo.com/">Gooroo</a>, an online platform that connects parents and students with qualified tutors based on their specifications of subject, location, learning style, and educational aspirations. While private tutoring is notorious for being only available to affluent households, Gooroo aims to change that by making individualized instruction more accessible.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Gooroo?</b><br>
<p>Growing up in Seoul, South Korea, I was exposed to the city’s saturated tutoring market. I was used to the multitude of learning opportunities, and it was not uncommon to see 10 different learning centers on one street.</p>
 
<p>I first experienced the American school system when I moved to Connecticut to attend high school. That is also when I realized how difficult it was for students to gain access to qualified tutors. While I was lucky enough to receive a quality education, not everyone was as fortunate. So, I founded my first company, PeerTutor, a non-profit volunteering platform that connected underprivileged high school students in South Korea with English tutors.</p>
 
<p>I went on to serve in the Korean army for two years as a sergeant and squad leader. Afterwards, I returned to Columbia University to finish my bachelor’s degree in operations research. I had to get back into the rhythm of studying after being away in the army, but the issue of tutor accessibility still existed. So, I expanded my vision to found Gooroo. I wanted to provide individualized learning to everyone, regardless of their background, learning style, or financial situation.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Gooroo will change the way students and parents seek tutors?</b><br>
<p>The current tutor matching system is broken; it’s unaffordable, unpersonalized, and inefficient. Instead of looking to get to the core of a problem, tutoring agencies tend to look for the short-term solution. Not only that, there is also a constant expectation that students fit into an ideal mold. Parents have told me their experiences of being told their child simply would not understand a subject because he or she learned differently. Most of the time, a student’s issue lies beyond just a "bad" test score; it is connected to other factors, such as learning approaches, personality, and interests.</p>
 
<p>Gooroo is looking to change the traditional tutoring approach and matching system. There is so much more to tutoring than just fixing the one visible problem. Each qualified and verified Gooroo is perfectly matched to each student. It goes beyond just being an expert in their respective subjects; a Gooroo is matched with a student after our platform specifically evaluates the student’s learning personality through diagnostic tests and personality assessments. Each student is completely unique in his or her passions and interests, so a student’s Gooroo ends up being much more than just a tutor. They are there every step of the way to act as a mentor, instructor, teacher, and role model. Throughout a student’s learning journey, a Gooroo is there to completely understand his or her needs and to get to the core of any learning problem.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The lecture-based classroom setting is not effective and is carried out because of convenience. Moving forward, I see education being reimagined through the utilization of technology in order to ensure that each student’s individual needs are being addressed. Specifically, I believe that machine learning can heavily impact this reimagination of education. By assessing educational insights, we are able to find ways to optimize learning and make it more specific to each student. With each student’s unique learning style comes a distinct way to educate them.</p>
 
<p><b>What, if any, are your future plans for Gooroo?</b><br> 
<p>This new school year brings a lot of exciting developments for Gooroo. We are an official vendor for the New York City Department of Education. This partnership will level the playing field and minimize the education-wealth gap through after-school education programs at several New York City public schools. We will also launch our Gooroo Learning Portal that allows students, parents, and tutors to track progress, set goals, and discover new learning opportunities. The portal allows digital tracking of strengths and areas of improvement to help further develop each student’s education. Students also have the opportunity to explore different learning fields that they might never have considered. The ultimate goal is to allow students to unlock their full potential by exploring every single learning opportunity. By sharing passions, we hope that each student will be able to gain more.</p>
