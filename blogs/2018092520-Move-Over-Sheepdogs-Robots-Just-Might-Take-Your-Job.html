<p>Sheepherding is a practice that has existed for tens of thousands of years, and the breeding of dogs to assist in the activity has long been associated with it. While herding might now seem to be a largely irrelevant characteristic in pet collies and cattle dogs, a group of researchers recently wondered if this skill could have repercussions in modern robotics. Could a robot be programmed to collect and herd animals or objects as sheepdogs do? What could herding robots contribute to the study of collective animal behavior? </p>

<p>In order to answer these questions, researchers devised an algorithm inspired by sheepdogs and tested its effectiveness in training robots to collect, transport, and herd objects. They conducted a series of experiments to explore the capacity of robots to follow the algorithm in an arena where different objects needed to be collected in a particular fashion, and compared their performance to real sheepdog herding behaviors. During the first phase of experimentation, robots had to collect a fixed number of objects (two, four, eight, or 16) in four trials. In the second phase, they were tested in three trials in which they had to collect a number of objects, but this time the number changed as the objects were being collected. Each trial was timed, and the robot’s ability to successfully collect all objects was assessed.</p>
 
<p>Results revealed that the robots were able to reliably and efficiently herd objects of all kinds. The robot herding behavior was consistent with sheepdog herding behavior, in terms of both effectiveness and distance from the objects being herded. There was also no large difference in completion time based on the original configuration of objects, and there were no losses in time between fixed and dynamic environments.</p>

<p>One difference noted between real sheepdog herding behavior and that of the robots utilized in this experiment was that while dogs responded to noise negatively, making them less effective herders, robots didn’t respond to noise at all. This means that robots could be more reliable herders in noisier environments when programmed to clean up objects in the environment, keep animals away from sensitive areas, or collect and herd animals to a specific location. Additionally, herding robots, as they interact with animals, have the potential to investigate collective animal behavior and leader-follower dynamics within a group.</p>
