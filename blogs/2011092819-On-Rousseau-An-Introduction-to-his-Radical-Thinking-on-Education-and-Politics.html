Few would want to dispute that Jean-Jacques Rousseau was one of the most  fascinating figures of the Enlightenment; a man whose interests ranged  over a variety of subjects, from politics, to education, to music, to  botany. He was also one of the most contradictory and controversial  thinkers and exciting writers of his time; the writer of the first  modern autobiography and author of the best-selling novel of his day.  Emile was among his most celebrated works, a book he regarded as his  crowning achievement. Its revolutionary ideas have influenced radical  thinkers and made him famous with generations of educators right into  the twentieth century. Rousseau made other contributions to education,  but his more political works on the subject are usually ignored by  commentators. There has been no shortage of books about him in recent  years, including general introductory ones. But a comprehensive  introductory book dealing with all the aspects of his thoughts about  education and politics has long been overdue. On Rousseau: An  Introduction to his Radical Thinking on Education and Politics fills  this void, and should interest educators, educators of educators,  philosophy students, and all with a general interest in education and  politics and the history of ideas.

<strong></strong>Kenneth Wain is a full professor at the University of Malta. He began his professional career as a state primary school teacher after graduating from St Michael’s College for Teacher Education, then taught for several years in state secondary schools until
he joined the University of Malta’s newly-created Faculty of Education in 1979 to teach philosophy of education. In the intervening years, he graduated with an Honours degree in philosophy from the University of London and, shortly afterwards, obtained a Master of Arts degree in philosophy from the University of Malta, and afterwards a Post-Graduate Diploma in Education from the University of London specializing in philosophy and sociology of education. He later completed his PhD in philosophy of education with the University of London under the supervision of Prof. John White writing a thesis on the philosophy of lifelong education which was later published as a book by Croom Helm (London). He currently teaches political and moral philosophy, beside philosophy of education, at the University of Malta and has served as Head of Department and Dean of the Faculty of Education sitting on the University Senate and MATSEC Board. He is the author of several books, chapters in books, and academic articles in international peer-reviewed journals. Over the years he has been heavily involved in different policy-making roles in the most significant reforms in the Maltese educational system by the Ministry of Education; in the strategic forum to introduce IT in the schools in the mid-1990s, as Chairperson in the project to define the future of schooling in Malta (‘Tomorrow’s Schools’ 1995), as member of the committee that produced the National Curriculum of 1999, in chairing the strategic planning team for the first five years of the National Curriculum, in setting up and chairing the Foundation for Educational Services, in the Ministerial consultative group exercise to decentralise and reform the schooling system that created the ‘colleges’ reform and the document ‘For All Children to Succeed’ (2005). He is also a
published poet and short story writer. For a number of years he was the art critic for the Times of Malta and still writes about art occasionally.
