            <b>Goals of web analytics fundamental</b>

Goals are the centerpiece of analytics. Without goals, you have no direction. If you want to transform your analytics, there are three primary questions that you need to ask. Simply asking these three questions will completely change how you view analytics or reporting for your organization.

<b>Where did visitors come from?</b>
Just based on that question, you'll start to understand that visitors behave differently based on where they come from. Your search visitors behave much differently than visitors who click on a link from another website. And they react and behave much differently from people who have a bookmark or type in your domain directly. Knowing where visitors come from, will in large part enable you to understand them much better.

<b>What did they do?</b>
This is where your goal comes in. What did visitors do on your site? Did they meet a goal? Did they convert? Did they do something of value? Something that you can measure, understand, and apply in your marketing plan?

<b>What is your marketing plan?</b>
Without these three questions, you'll never know if your website is successful in making your business money. It's all about understanding the goal. The goal helps us understand the overall purpose of what we want them to do. But analytics, in breaking things down to their elements such as what did they do and what should we do will help us understand all the jumble of information and the behavior that visitors show. We need to understand that people come to our website with vastly different motivations. So, in analyzing goals, we need to understand what happened, why, and then deduct how we should react.
