          <p>
            The National Academies' National Research Council recent report "<a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11625.html">Taking Science to School: Learning and Teaching Science in Grades K-8 (2007)</a>" takes some hard swings at current educators and education debate.

First, the report argues that the shallow understanding of science held by many teachers in the U.S. proscribes in depth understanding and the pursuit of more than memorizing facts. But much of the criticism is directed at the current debates and nature of science curricula...<!--break-->

The report argues that many debates in educational curricula are rooted in values, not questions of what makes for better learning.  And in response to the commonly asked question, "Is Inquiry Better than Direct Instruction?"  the authors respond "Better for what?"  

That this latter question seems to continue without answer may explain the nature of science curriculum in the United States in contrast to other countries.  The authors note that while many competing nations have curricula which encourages students to:

<div style="padding: 30px; font-family: courier new;">
learn topics in depth, to use science in meaningful contexts, and to engage in scientific practices.  In contrast, as noted earlier, the U.S. curriculum and standards are seen as a "mile wide and an inch deep."
</div>

They also point out that in science and math classrooms, teachers "motivate a scientific idea (perhaps with a surprising demonstration), present the normative view, and then assess students' understanding... Immersed in these patterns, students come to view science as a compilation of 'right answers' ..."  In short, these final notes from the authors capture an idea most of us "hard science" folks have thought for a long time: High school (and even early college) science just isn't science.

<div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #555555">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
And while your at it, take a look at the <i>Table of Contents</i> and give the "skim" feature a once-over.   One downside of the net is that passing quickly from page to page is often far more cumbersome than with ordinary paper.  This feature serves as a nice first shot at closing that gap.  Of course, the education gap is different story.
