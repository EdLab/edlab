<p>Massive open online courses have a checkered past. Touted as both a model for and a threat to the future of traditional education institutions, they haven't quite had the revolutionary impact many hoped. As Robert Zemsky once 
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jgeneeduc.63.4.0237">disparagingly remarked about them</a>, "They came; they conquered very little; and now they face substantially diminished prospects." As such, it’s pretty clear that online learning courses could use a massive rethink to reach their massive potential. </p>
 
<p>A recent study examined the retention and completion rates of a persistently popular UC San Diego course, <i>Learning How to Learn</i>. This course is exemplary both in terms of enrollment and quality: it has reached over one million learners and boasts a 4.55/5 rating in terms of student satisfaction. The study investigated evaluation data from the third session of the course during January 2015. </p>

<p>The study found three primary factors that correlate with student retention and completion. The first is instructor quality, which includes the personality and demeanor of the instructor, how they deliver materials, how they use examples, and the quality of their speech. The second factor affecting retention is conceptual clarity, which involves the relevance of materials, explanation of concepts, and the content based on science and research. And the third factor that was connected to completion was the format, including overall length, length of videos, and course timing.</p>

<p>The study also reveals the course creation process and factors contributing to its success. This includes: using metaphors and analogies to explain complicated ideas, showing a continual sense of motion (including the instructor’s hands), scripting material with occasional doses of humor, instructing in a relaxed demeanor, offering impactful assistance from teaching assistants, and providing timely feedback on quizzes. As the success of this course demonstrates, constant care for all aspects of course building is necessary to create a successful experience. </p>

<p>This study is important due to the explosion of offerings in online learning. If you are an educator creating online content or a student unsure why you found your online learning experience so good or bad, this study helps create a framework to improve education for all. </p>
