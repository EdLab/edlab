<p><b>Title:</b> Retaining Students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Majors (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Watkins & Eric Mazur</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://ccdc.morainevalley.edu/pdf/20000083-RetainingStudentsinSTEMMajors.pdf">Journal of College Science Teaching</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
Could switching up the teaching method help retain STEM majors?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Though these subjects are central to 21st century work, retention in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects is notoriously low. A report by the <a href="http://www.heri.ucla.edu/nih/downloads/2010%20-%20Hurtado,%20Eagan,%20Chang%20-%20Degrees%20of%20Success.pdf">Higher Education Research Institute</a> suggests that students exiting introductory science courses are driven away from STEM because of the lack of interaction with content and uninspiring presentations in class. The authors of <i><a href="http://ccdc.morainevalley.edu/pdf/20000083-RetainingStudentsinSTEMMajors.pdf">Retaining Students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Majors</a></i> sought to understand whether pedagogical changes, specifically peer instruction (PI), could lead to increased retention in an introductory physics course. PI relies on interactive strategies, like clickers and discussions, to gauge student understanding and promote engagement.</p> 

<p>The authors looked at data collected between 1990 and 1996 in an introductory calculus-based physics course at Harvard. During this period Harvard made the switch from traditional, lecture-style teaching to a system that integrated and encouraged PI. The study sample included 105 students in the traditionally taught course, 101 of whom indicated that they were a STEM major at the start of the course and 1,072 PI-taught students including 997 STEM majors. The researchers estimated the probability of switching out of a STEM major based on the different background characteristics of students and whether they took traditional or PI courses.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results showed that students who were enrolled in the traditionally taught introductory physics courses switched out of STEM majors more than twice as frequently as students enrolled in the courses taught using PI. The impact of pedagogy on STEM major retention was consistent across both genders. The authors also found that age made a difference in student retention; freshmen were 10 times as likely to abandon STEM majors as upperclassmen.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
These results are promising and may encourage more educators and researchers to think about experimenting with PI to increase engagement and retention. The use of a simple regression and historical data means that these results should be taken cautiously, as many pedagogies were likely used in the courses studied and the results should not be attributed to PI alone. Further studies should focus on the effectiveness of PI and the impact of other strategies to increase retention in STEM courses.</p>
