<p><i> Innovation means to endeavor unknown territory - heavily loaded with lots of open questions. Surrounded by the overwhelming and unknown, we offer a process that both gives meaning to the creative chaos and flexibility to adapt to constantly changing demands.</i> (from <a href="http://www.thedarkhorse.de/en-we-are-innovation">Dark Horse</a> site).</p>

<p><b>Playful Transformations</b><br>
This 32-person German-based innovation lab is working with companies and teaching them how to innovate through play. The team runs workshops where groups can let down their collective hair and think creatively. The firm uses everything from Lego to dance to inspire the creative spirit in clients. <a href="http://www.thedarkhorse.de/en-we-are-innovation">Dark Horse</a> has worked with Audi, Volkswagen, DHL and the German government. A <a href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/global-observer/in-berlin-a-dark-horse-in-innovation/">recent article</a> suggests that the popularity of Dark Horse "may indicate a new advent for design thinking in Germany, as well as a remedy to the frequent accusation that Europe -- with particular respect to its business establishment -- is too failure-averse."</p>

<p><b>Evolved Model</b><br>
The team came together after graduate school at the <a href="http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/d_school/home.html">Potsdam Design School</a>. The firm is organized so that all 30 partners have equal decision-making power. Partners are not allowed to work more than three days a week. "With some 25 different professional and degree-based competencies among them, each project workgroup requires at least one member to have no knowledge in the subject at hand." Could innovation firms like Dark Horse be poised to rethink how we do business together?</p>

<p><b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW with Dark Horse co-founder, Monika Frech.</b></p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Who is the target audience of Dark Horse generally and who is the target audience of the firm’s education branch?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Dark Horse is an agency for innovation development. We develop products and services for and with corporations, SMEs and NGOs and help our clients to set up their spaces, software, structures and - most importantly - their minds for innovation. We apply Design Thinking and built upon our own unusual company structure: We are 30 interdisciplinary co-founders who work together without any hierarchies whatsoever. </p>

<p>We have done many workshops with institutions of higher education and have recently invited high school students and teachers to introduce our way of working and explore possibilities for educational settings. A number of colleagues have led or mentored for education initiatives in Germany and abroad. I, for example, spent six months with a school network in the Indian Himalayas, where I introduced a collaborative learning approach to students and teachers.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Where do you see the Dark Horses education initiative in six months? How do hope Dark Horse will help the learning landscape/educators?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I want to apply here in Germany, what I have learned in India: Together with the Berlin-based ed-tech http://www.klab-berlin.com/, we will soon offer Design Thinking Workshops for German high school teachers. We also currently explore how we can best enable these teachers to use Design Thinking and similar approaches within the existing school structure. We believe a combination of workshops and teaching material could be very valuable for them.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What is your role at Dark Horse? How did you find yourself at the firm? What has your experience been?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am a co-founder and partner at Dark Horse. I co-founded the firm together with 30 friends from 25 different disciplines right out of university in 2009. All of us are involved in client projects and workshops as well as in strategic decision-making for Dark Horse. To stay agile and creative, we don’t have permanent job roles within our company and we don’t have a boss, either. We have developed a set of tools and processes that enable us to collaborate efficiently and creatively - we call it post-hierarchical management.</p> 

<p><b>Question:</b> What has Dark Horse's biggest impact been on your target audience? Do you have an example of a success story and/or a challenge? Do you see other ways Dark Horse may indirectly effect the ed sector, i.e., you might also see ways Dark Horse will have a broader effect in the business world, for example, that will influence the education world?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Apart from the specific products and service that we have co-created with our clients, I think our biggest impact lies in the way we work. Our biggest challenge in the beginning was that only very few of us had entrepreneurial experience. However, in hindsight this enabled us to disregard conventional wisdom and structure our company in a way that now makes us happy and innovative at the same time. As we didn’t know "better," we created the rules and roles at Dark Horse as we saw fit for ourselves, as "typical" members of the networked and collaborative Generation Y. At the same time, our interdisciplinary, post-hierarchical and flexible approach is very well suited to tackle the complex, interdependent problems of the 21st century. In my opinion, these innovative processes and structures that we currently see at a lot of Berlin start-ups, will also have a big impact in education in the long run.</p>
