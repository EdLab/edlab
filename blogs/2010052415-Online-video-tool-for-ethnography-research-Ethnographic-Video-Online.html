            Ethnographic Video Online is an online video tool for ethnography research hosted by Alexander Street Press, LLC, which has a lot of common features with Critter. Alexander Street Press used their press resources to create this video database containing 750+ hours, 1000 films videos, all with full transcriptions, useful research tools and study guides. Below I will disseminate the features of this tool.

I first created a free account and logged in. In the top navigation bar, I can link to various pages such as home, what's new, help, as well as: 

* Browse: browse videos by ethnographer, location, cultural group, subject (tag), date, etc.
* Advanced search: search videos by title, transcripts, recording date, release date, publisher, etc.

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/advanced search.png" width="550">

* Playlist: create and customize playlists containing videos on this or external websites.

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/add to playlist.png" width="550">

Then I picked a video and go to the play-video page. The page contains a secondary navigation bar where I can:

* View video details
* Download study guide
* View release notes
* View full transcript
* View the whole list of transcript segments, with thumbnails of the screenshots
* Embed/link to the video. But one can only embed the video, not the transcripts
* Print the screen.

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/vid player.png" width="550">

Under the secondary nav, there is a local search tool that searches transcripts by word within the video. Searched results are represented by red dots in the long timeline (described later), and text highlighted in the transcript panel.

The main video player has the following features:

* A long video timeline at the top, which shows red dots to represent searched transcripts
* Create clips of the video by specifying a title, start/end time, accessibility, and notes
<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/make clips.png" width="550">
* Change video size and toggle full screen
* Default video control with timeline, time, and volume control
* Video metadata

On the right panel, there are three tabs for:

* Transcripts. While the video is playing, transcripts are highlighted sentence by sentence. There is a sync checkbox to define whether to autoscroll the transcripts while the video is playing.
* Clips. Displays all the user-created clips for the video
* Release notes by the ethnographer.

As we can see, the design of this tool is similar to Critter in may ways. However, this tool is created for serious ethnography researchers instead of the public because:

* This tool is very controlled. Users cannot create video with their own resources.
* No social networking -- unless it appears after subscribing to this tool with a one-time perpetual or annual subscription fee, one can be involved in their institutions. However, there's no guidelines as for how to subscribe or to be involved in an institution.
* No user discussions.

The following features of this tool may inform the Critter design:

* Global search (videos and discussions) VS. local search (comments within a discussion)
* Create clips based on the videos
* Create and share playlists
* Institution support - involve users to an institution or organization
