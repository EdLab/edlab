<p><a href="https://fakey.iuni.iu.edu/">Fakey</a> is a game that aims to teach media literacy by having players interact with a simulated newsfeed. The game was created by the <a href="https://iuni.iu.edu/
">Indiana University Network Science Institute’s</a> <a href="http://osome.iuni.iu.edu/">Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe)</a> to study how people react with real news and misinformation.</a>.

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>In Fakey, players take quizzes consisting of ten recent news stories and must decide how to interact with them via social media. The options include liking, sharing, skipping, or fact-checking. The strategy of the game is to like or share articles from legitimate news sources, while skipping or fact-checking dubious posts. Users can choose to play the game without signing up or registering.</p>       

<p>When an action has been selected, the game reveals the source for the article and tallies the points as users play along. Legitimate sources come from a variety of news sites, such as traditional media, like CNN or <i>The Washington Post</i>, but also from new media, such as <i>The Verge</i>. The dubious articles have sources from real clickbait, junk science, and conspiracy sources that people commonly see shared in their newsfeeds.</p>      

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The game’s basic design and content are in need of some professionalization. Currently, it is better optimized for smartphones and is somewhat awkward to play on a computer browser. Texts in the game need some basic editing, too. For instance, some of the publications were not capitalized (instead of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, the game listed <i>The wall street journal</i>). As the goal of this resource is to build media literacy, these kinds of issues will cause some to lose trust in the game.</p>

<p>Another issue that I had with the game was its choice of BuzzFeed as a legitimate source. While the website has done solid reporting in recent years, it still relies upon clickbait headlines, listicles, and quizzes. For instance, one article used in Fakey was "On A Scale From 0 To 100, How Intensely Have You Lived? Prepare for your whole life to flash before your eyes." The game considered it a legitimate article simply because it came from BuzzFeed, however, the headline is also clearly clickbait. Potentially, this distinction is more nuanced than can be conveyed through this simple game.</p>

<p><b>Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Fakey is a free, easy tool to help boost media literacy skills for social media. While the content is quite simplistic, it could be a nice resource for parents, teachers, or anyone looking to design a lesson, teach, or learn about the fake news phenomenon.</p>
