          <p>
            I had a couple of ideas regarding the redesigns of TCR and PK that I would like to propose.  That said, I'm not actually sure we're doing redesigns; so if not this blog makes for excellent filler :)


<b>TCRecord</b>
One idea that came up during our last seminar was "TCRecord reader types."  In essence, one could ask what categories readers fall into by various psychographic characteristics.  While broader categories (e.g. liberals v. conservatives, quick v. careful readers, etc.) could be used, we don't really have the data or the marketing personnel to interpret the data.  Instead, why not break users up into categories for data we have such as content type preferences, number of article views, etc.  

For example, we might divide readers into two categories: (1) those who read more than <i>n</i> articles in a sitting; (2) those who read less than <i>n</i>.  If we notice interesting disparities, we could use this to alter our content highlighting, or implement a strategy to differentially push content.

A more simplistic idea would be to highlight content on the basis of reader groups.  Our editors have highlighted 10+ categories of articles, ranging from "Administration" to "Technology" (more if we include subcategories).  But one could ask if readers really fall into these groupings.  Is there an "Administration" reader? Or do those readers fall into an "Administration, Policy, Assessment" category?  Brian C's dissertation apparently goes into this and a dirty factor analysis could be done in even a few days if the data isn't too poor.  Once we identify readership groups, we could use this to highlight content on TCR.  For example, suppose we found that most of readers were either interested in technology and science, or policy and curriculum.  We could use this to make the home page most attractive to our readership by highlighting those broad categories.

<b>PocketKnowledge</b>
Do users like intersections? Unfortunately, we never thought to ask that question, so we don't have statistics designed to answer it.  Perhaps Stephen will be able to hint at an answer in his report, but it's likely to confirm what we know from user feedback, personal usage, and the user testing we performed earlier with Anna and Nabeel: Intersections aren't used and don't make sense.

One problem may be vernacular.  Instead of display "Intersection" we could suggest that users look at "X and Y" (logical conjunction is intersection).  But UI principles dictate that users should know what they are clicking on, and that they shouldn't have to click more than absolutely necessary.  So I suggest that instead of displaying, for example, all of the intersecting pockets, we display the most relevant subsets with a preview of the contents.  Content is key.

In the image below, you see a quick example of how this may work.  The vernacular is weak ("From ..." corresponds to pockets, "By ..." to authors, "More ..." to tags) but the idea is there.  I believe it offers all the power of intersections in a way that is useful and sensible.

What do you think?  If we are to redesign these sights (and PK desperately needs it), what do we add?  What do we remove?  And what just needs an artistic touch?
