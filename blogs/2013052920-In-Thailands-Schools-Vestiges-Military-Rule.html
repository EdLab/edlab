          <p>
            According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/world/asia/thai-students-find-government-ally-in-push-to-relax-school-regimentation.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0&ref=education">article</a>, students at Thailand are fed up with the military's role in civic life and have proposed changes to the education system. In Thailand, students in public schools go through a drill that is performed during school hours. The drill is very similar to what I went through during my schooling years in Ghana. I think it is a good drill because it eliminates segregation between students and enable students to learn more about their culture. It also lead students to adopt a discipline that will be vital to their educational and career successes. Similar to the drill in Ghana, Thai students are forced to wear a school uniform, reprimanded for long hair (girls have to cut their hair below the ear and boys must have buzz on the sides of their hair like military cadets), inspected for dirty fingernails, colored socks or any other violation of the school dress code. Additionally, students must sing the national anthem and recite a Buddhist incantation and a pledge. This drill is what some students believe to be militarily and a dictatorial act that was performed in the past but has no role in the current culture.

This issue has cause a Thai student nicknamed Frank (Nethiwit Chotpatpaisan), to create a Facebook Campaign to abolish the military's role in the education system. The group, Thailand Educational Revolution Alliance, claims its goal is to abolish the “mechanistic” education system in Thailand. Frank describes the teachers as dictators because they give too many orders and students cannot challenge these orders out of fear of receiving a beating with a bamboo cane. 

I think there are two sides to this issue. Not every country has this “mechanistic” education system but I think what this system does is bring a lot of discipline to a  schools. The other side of this issue is that the drill takes away from precious school time. Besides the drill, students in Thailand learn by memorization, which according to education minister Phongthep Thepkanjana is not effective in learning and that critical thinking is the way for the students to learn. Mr. Thepkanjana has also proposed for major changes in Thailand's education curriculum.
