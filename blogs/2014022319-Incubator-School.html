<i>The Incubator School is a small, 21st century learning community whose mission is to foster, network, and launch the entrepreneurial teams of tomorrow. Just as an incubator nurtures hatchlings and a business incubator grows ideas into ventures, the Incubator School provides its students with the support, skills, mindsets, mentors, resources, technology, social connectivity, and ethics to help their fledgling ideas fly. The Incubator School prepares future collegians for a complex, ever-changing, globally integrated world by unlocking their self-starting spirit.</i> (From <a href="http://www.incubatorschool.org/mission">the Incubator School Site</a>)

<b>Incubating Education</b><br>
<a href="http://www.incubatorschool.org/">The Incubator School</a> is an L.A.-based pilot middle school program focused on nurturing and launching the next generation of entrepreneurs. "Inc. believes that whatever the future brings, the ability to self-start will be key."  The program is based on the premise that many of the same elements that make an early stage startup founder or business leader successful can be taught in school; these include self-definition, resilience, creativity, productivity, goal setting, and intergenerational relationship building.  To convey these hard-to-teach skills the program embraces an overall "entrepreneurial frame" and tries to integrate the kind of iterative development processes most often found in the design of new technologies into all elements of the school from curriculum development and planning to administrative decisions.  
<p>

Incubator School learners are asked to start their own businesses as a part of the program and are ultimately assessed not only on more traditional standardized tests, but also on the strengths of their project portfolio and business plans.   
In addition, the program has created a feedback loop using social, connected technologies (Facebook, Twitter, <a href="http://voicethread.com/">VoiceThread</a> etc.) to better "listen" to and connect with the needs of learners, parents, and educators.  The program describes this process on their site as, "...learning, adapting, listening to feedback, circling back to its premises, assessing and reassessing its methods, forms, and structures."  Furthermore, the program takes these processes and practices seriously and thinks of the school itself as a startup with the end goal of creating a learning "product" that young people "<i>want and need</i>."  
 <p>

<b>Better than Show & Tell, Xprts</b><br>
The Incubator School invests in strategic partnerships (referred to internally as "Xprts") and the ability to connect learning to the real-world of entrepreneurship through parents and contacts in LAâ€™s growing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Beach">Silicon Beach</a> (now ranked #3 in the world behind Silicon Valley & Tel Aviv for tech startups).  The goal is to have students "surrounded by role models: diverse teachers, community partners, parents, and mentors who team together as growing, thinking, adapting, innovating self-starters to help launch the students towards adult life."  In addition, the program utilizes formative and summative assessments to "mobilize iterative self-starting."  Some of these methodologies include both traditional standardized testing, as well as teacher-student conferences and newer assessment methods that include dashboards, digital "badge portfolios," and student-led conferences.  The Incubator School is part of a wider <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/20/local/la-me-lausd-school-20130321">pilot school trend</a> in the Los Angeles Unified Schools.
