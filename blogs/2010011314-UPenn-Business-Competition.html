          <p>
            This post is a follow up to Adrienne's post about the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3604">UPenn Business Competition</a>. They decided to use a template format for submission. I thought this might be interesting for those on the Social Venture team. The update email is included below. <br><br>

Dear Educational Entrepreneur,
<br>
Thank you for registering to compete in the Milken-PennGSE Education Business Plan Competition! We appreciate your interest.
<br>
As we promised, we are now ready to accept the actual executive summary of your idea. (To date, we were simply asking for expressions of interest.) The deadline for submitting Executive Summaries has been extended, and is now 2/12/10 (extended 12 days).
<br>
Prior to submitting your summary, we ask that you first read the rules of the competition to make sure you are comfortable with them. They can be found at: http://www.gse.upenn.edu/entrepreneurcomp/rules. Know that by submitting you are explicitly accepting the rules of the competition and agreeing to them.
<br>
We also ask that you look at the list of judges. If you see one that may present a conflict of interest (you work with them or they own a service or program that would directly compete with yours), we ask that you let us know so that we can recuse them from judging your submission. Here is the link to the list of judges: http://www.gse.upenn.edu/entrepreneurcomp/content/judges
<br>
In order to level the playing field and make it easier for the judges to access the executive summaries, we have created a form; so rather than submitting a two page executive summary per se, we ask that you follow the form, which will then create a template form for the judges to read your submission. In this way, all submissions will look the same at this stage.
<br>
You may also want to refresh your memory on the overall competition overview: http://www.gse.upenn.edu/entrepreneurcomp/overview. We also provide you with the Judging Criteria: http://www.gse.upenn.edu/entrepreneurcomp/judging-criteria.
<br>
When you submit your entry, you will receive an on-screen message confirming its receipt. We will not contact you again until we have the results, either inviting you to move forward or thanking you for your submission and encouraging you to submit again in the future.
<br>
To submit your Executive Summary, please fill out our online application form at: http://www.gse.upenn.edu/entrepreneurcomp/exec-summary-submission. Guidelines for the Executive Summary are included within the fields of the online form. If you have already submitted your Executive Summary in an emailed file, please be sure to enter the information again in our online form.
<br>
We look forward to reviewing your submissions -- good luck!
<br>
Best wishes,
<br>
