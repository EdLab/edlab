          <p>
            *Private*

<p>Saturday was my last day at the American Copy Editors Society conference and I have a few more takeaways worth sharing. For full-on conference geekery, feel free to dive into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUmtY5QgOVLINZkxGP_MvOk76lrGaprR-8XkoH-tONo/edit?usp=sharing"target="blank">all of the notes</a>.</p>

<p><b>Giving Copy a Facelift, With No Pain</b></p>

<p>Merrill Perlman (<a href="https://twitter.com/meperl"target="blank">@meperl</a>), former managing editor of the New York Times News Service, walked us through her three rules for copy editing: 

<ol type="1">
<li>Do no harm.</li>
<li>If you can't explain why you want to change something, you can't change it.</li>
<li>No surprisesâ€“they can damage relationships with authors.</li>
</ol>

<p>With these rules in mind, there are several ways to make your writing smoother and tighter: look for things like back-to-back quotations from different people that might cause indirection or confusion about the speaker; use people's titles as an aside to the reader; don't use words that will send readers to the dictionary; don't refer to something you haven't mentioned yet; and avoid <i>crash blossoms</i>, words that can be either a noun or a verb (e.g., this confusing headline, "<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25878202"target="blank">Citizen Science Charts Horse Chestnut Tree Pest Spread</a>").</p>

<p>Although these seem like perfectly common sense, it's amazing how many bad examples you can easily pull from respectable publications.</p>

<p><b>Headlines, Not Cheapline or Borelines</b></p>

<p>I loved this session by ACES President Teresa Schmedding (<a href="https://twitter.com/tschmedding"target="blank">@tschmedding</a>) on criteria for writing good healines. To be frank, I think we struggle with this on NLT (myself included), and to be fair, a lot of publications do. It's really not an easy task because you need to do a lot in just a few words.</p>

<p>I'm a sucker for puns, but Teresa made a compelling case against them that's making me rethink my dad humor. A punny headline might be a good laugh, but it might miss the point entirely, or may convey something you didn't mean to. Example: a local paper's article about a new Chic fil A restaurant with the headline "Frying the Coop" is catchy, but it misses the interesting pieces of the story: the business added 70 jobs to the local economy, it's part of an expanding food mecca, and they gave out free chicken to 100 people.</p>

<p>Some guidelines for creating interesting headlines that aren't cheap or boring:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Pique curiosity while respecting intelligence and understanding interests.</li>
<li>Write for your audience and their friends. <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-most-popular-words-in-most-viral-headlines"target="blank">16% of all viral headlines contain the words <i>you</i> and <i>your</i></a>.</li>
<li>Include unusual or unexpected information. In Teresa's newsletters, negative superlatives have a 63% higher click-through rate than positive.</li>
<li>Sound human and trigger some emotion. Example: "<a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/272231-lets-get-depressed-sugary-favorite-foods/"target="blank">We get it, desserts are bad for us. But this chart finds sugar in the unlikeliest of foods</a>"</li>
<li>Tell readers what they'll learn with active key words (e.g., <i>how to, tips, why, best, great, meet, watch, see</i>).</li>
<li>Tell readers how fast they'll learn it. The headline "Cuisine, No Controversy" was changed to "5 Reasons You Should Try These Student-run Restaurants" and saw a big increase in click-through rates.</li>
</ol>

<p>IMHO I think a question you should always ask yourself about a headline you've written is, "If I saw this, would I want to read it?"</p>

<p><b>Building Your Brand With Social Media</b></p>

<p>We've been active on social media for a while, but there are areas where we can improve. Although most of this session was a primer for people who still have an egg as their Twitter profile pic, there were some tips that would be good to revisit.</p>

<p>Creating and maintaining a voice on social media is tricky enough as an individual, and as an organization it's even trickier. I think we have to be careful not to push out messages without sounding human. It's not easy to reduce articles down to a sentence, but we ought to do it in a simple, precise, relatable way. After you've written a post, think "Would <i>I</i> want to click on this?" before hitting send.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading if you've made it this far! Feel free to ask questions about these sessions. I'll build some of these ideas into a D&R so we can work together to improve our writing, editing, and social media skills.</p>
