          <p>
            Exciting EdLab news: our new website is nearing completion. Nabeel has done a great job learning and modifying the Drupal system, and Dan came in for a last-minute clutch play. Thanks to them both.

For now, I've taken the reins as the administrator/editor of the site (perhaps this will be a rotating honor?), and there are a few things I would like to update everyone onâ€¦<!--break-->

1) You have no doubt seen (but maybe the person next to you has not) that your sign-in name has been changed to your full name (not case-sensitive). Your password is the same.

2) The blog now operates slightly differently from the administrative end. Because the blog is highlighted on our website, which we hope to show to any prospective partner, funder, etc., only the posts we ("Gary") wants to show to the world will be published as so (made "public")... Don't worry, don't do anything differently if you don't want to--we still want the blog to be a "working" site. Hence, posts are "private" by default, and you will need to log in to see them. People outside of the library won't see them even if they do log in.

3) If you write something with a robust editorial slant, and good grammar, etc., then I will make it public (I am now a slave to the editorial process, and you are subject to censorship). Also, all past blogs have been made private, and I will be working to make a bunch public.

4) I will upload all content to the journal: projects, publications, and events (but I won't be writing it all!) Once there are more examples, it will be easier for everyone to write for the site. Basically, I will need a Word doc (+ a short abstract for the publications section) sent to my tc.columbia.edu email. No doubt we will be refining as we go for a while.

5) Please update your biography by going to your personal page and clicking "edit" and then "personal information." Everyone doesn't need to have the same style, but remember, the bio is about YOU and your academic/professional life.

6) When entering content for blogs, etc., you'll notice the "rich-text" WYSIWYG editor is enabled by default. I find this causes more problems than it solves, but maybe it's just because I use Safari on the Mac. If you'd like it to be disabled by default, you can choose this on your personal setting page.

That's enough info for now... watch this site get populated in the next week or so in preparation for the AERA conference, and the TCR Blogging project 7 of us are embarking on. This should be a nice way to introduce EdLab to the wider world of ed researchers and institutions/businesses.

I hope you like the site. It's been long-coming! Thanks again to everyone who created it.

I'll do my best to keep everyone in the loop.

Your faithful editor,
Brian
