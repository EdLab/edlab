          <p>
            For most college athletes, the ultimate goal is to become a professional in their respective sport. However, some college athletes value their education as important as their sport. This may be due to their awareness of the probability that they will not become a pro athlete. This <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/307746-college-vs-pros-should-athletes-be-allowed-to-leave-school-early">article</a> sheds some interesting light on how some renowned athletes decided to leave school early to play professional sports and still succeeded. Conversely, other athletes failed in their respective professional sport after leaving school early.
<p>
Some might argue that leaving school early for a career in professional sports enables one to earn a living in order to provide for their family. Most college athletes decide to leave schools when their stock is very high and that also plays a role in their decision. Should they stay in school and become injured; it will decrease their value and ultimately their earnings. The counter argument is that staying in school is more important because it secures your long term future.
