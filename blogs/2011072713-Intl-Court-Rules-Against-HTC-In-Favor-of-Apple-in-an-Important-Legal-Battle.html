            This is a dark day for the movement towards a more open mobile platform.

The court has ruled that HTC did infringe upon some of Apple's intellectual property by making Android phones. Should Apple decline to license its technologies to HTC, HTC will no longer be legally able to produce Android phones.

Read on...<!--break-->

The problem is that the court has ruled that the infringements were on the Android technology. The fact that Apple has won this first battle gives them the possibility to go after other producers of Android devices as well, such as Samsung and Motorola. Simply put, Apple could choke out Android simply by making it illegal for companies to produce them.

Obviously, the companies should have exclusive rights to their intellectual property. But what Apple's claiming to be exclusively theirs... is it really theirs? Everyone that's not an Apple fanboy knows that Apple was not the first to make a touchscreen smartphone. What about Windows Mobile? What about Blackberry? Isn't it obvious that they are going after Android because they pose the biggest threat to Apple's profit margins? Just as these sketchy IPs are being protected, shouldn't free market and competition be protected as well?

I don't know. Without serious competition, Apple is likely to make the mobile platform even more closed and exclusive than it already is on the iOS. That's not a mobile future that I would like to see.

Disclaimer: I do not like Apple or Steve Jobs as an entity.

EDIT: The technologies that are protected by patent are things such as touching the phone number to call someone, or the gestures such as pinch-to-zoom. Since Google gives out Android for free, it is much easier for Apple to win a lawsuit against the producers (who actually make money off of it) than it is to win a lawsuit against Google.

Think about this analogy, however... if Ford sued Toyota for making vehicles with transmission systems, would that make any sense to you?
