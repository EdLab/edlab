<p><i>"Through effort, community supports, and training, we help beginners with little to no technical background reach a level of proficiency that allows them to get paid to continue learning on the job as junior web developers."</i> (<a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-ruby-javascript/overview/">About Dev Bootcamp</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Immersive Coding</b></p>

<p><a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> is the first short-term, immersive <i>web development bootcamp</i> in the world that transforms beginners to web developers. People interested in the program need no prior experience in coding, just an ambition to dive into the world of programming languages and curriculum.</p>

<p>From the time students enter the program to the time they graduate, Dev Bootcamp spans 19 weeks. Budding programmers complete the first nine weeks remotely with a series of introductory online courses. During the second nine weeks of the course, students move to one of the program’s campuses (there are seven throughout the U.S.) and completely immerse themselves in the coding experience. In this portion of the program, students may work 60 to 80 hours a week to hone their development skills. The last week is devoted to job-readiness, career counseling, and presenting final projects to potential employers. Dev Bootcamp is intense, but those who complete the program are prepared to take on full-stack jobs as junior web developers. So far, they’ve graduated more than 1,900 students who work at companies around the world.</p>

<p><b>A Holistic Educational Approach </b></p>
 
<p> Although the main focus at Dev Bootcamp is coding, the company is devoted to creating a holistic educational experience for their students. One way they do this is through an emotional intelligence training program called Engineering Empathy. Engineering Empathy exercises students’ abilities to work effectively socially, individually, and in teams by tackling difficult intrapersonal and interpersonal issues.</p>

<p>In addition, Dev Bootcamp shows its dedication to students’ well-being by offering yoga classes on campus. In fact, during the first half of students’ immersive on-campus experience, they are required to attend the yoga sessions to maintain their mental and physical well-being. The goal is help students not only to become adept at computer programming but also to feel balanced enough to take a big step forward in their lives. </p>
