             <h3>Panel Session: Advice on setting up social platforms for school environments
</h3>

          o What lessons for someone who wants to change platforms, try a new social technology and work within the confines of a school administration.
                + Decision to go to Elgg at Harvard Extension class --> need for portfolios and lack of support for it on a traditional LMS motivated adoption. When you want to try something, do it small scale and see if it works. 
                + Think about what will get people hooked on to a particular platform?
          o What is the right technology strategy in terms of deploying in the school
                + Depends on technical staff inside of the school --> public schools usually don't have high technical staff inside.
                + Want as much as possible to go down a path where you own the data.
                + Try to look for things that you can do initially yourself and try to do them to show success. Especially if IT resources are limited.
                + Need to address bad connotations of "social" in educational environments and change the culture in schools such that they accept and encourage social communities more. Need to alleviate fears about social technologies that can often be barriers to proper adoption.
                      # Nervousness among teachers and faculty about what they have put on in social forums and exposing that to students.
                + Do something small that can be successful and then try to exploit the success to expand the initiative.
                + One perspective: start with the teachers first and not the students and get them to think about how the tool can be effective. Then begin to market to students.
                + Concept of risk: what happens if you fail in a new social tech venture??
          o What kinds of arguments to make to support the use of social media in schools and how should these be presented.
                + Imagine future where all technologies are banned from schools -- would create a very negative society and culture.
                + As kids go in to the real world where social technologies exist, they need a mentor and safe introduction to these tools and school is the best place to do this.
                + Facilitate conversations with parents and students to express their concerns and address them.
                      # Parents often need just as much if not more education about social media technologies than their kids and need to be included in this process.
                + Education itself is a risk, not technology. Many of the policies covering social technologies were conceived well before the technologies were developed. Putting kids out in to the world without training with the social technologies is itself is a risk.
                + Put anecdotes of isolated incidents with social media in perspective.
          o How important is the issue of cost with many of these social media technologies?
                + reality: often don't have a budget for new ideas. Often, open source or free tools are all that teachers can afford. But, there could be costs associated with these as well. 
                + Often, higher cost among educators signals better quality -->
                + Don't be afraid of failure -- need to try things in order to make big improvements.
          o Where to get assistance for Elgg outside of community forums outside of the elgg site?
                + Membership in community that is often more responsive than traditional support models.
                + When evaluating an open-source application, look at how active the community is to ensure that there are people available to help you.
          o Role of technology and social media in urban education
                + Need to get hardware and can't always count on school districts themselves to pay for this. Netbooks typically run $300 per student. Try to run open-source tools instead of purchased.
                + Teaching: need to get teachers up to speed with using and applying new technologies.
                      # New teacher induction can include instruction in bringing in new technologies to the classroom.
                      # New teachers vs. experienced teachers: use experienced teachers who want to apply tech to mentor new teachers.
                + One-to-one netbook open source systems for public schools.
