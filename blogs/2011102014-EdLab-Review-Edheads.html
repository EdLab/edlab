<b>Description:</b> <a href ="http://www.edheads.org/#"> Edheads</a> is a unique educational gaming website as it doesn't really focus on teaching students normal school subjects but instead focus on harder to teach subjects. Each game puts the player into different situations like a crash science investigation, designing a cell phone, virtual hip replacement surgery, etc. Each game has their own problem that must be solved in different ways.

The first game I tried out was designing a cell phone for senior citizens. I had to go through the research and statistics on the different sizes, weights, etc, that senior citizens prefer for their cell phones and use that information to develop a perfect cell phone for them. After I created my cell phone, I would have a focus group of senior citizens to give me feed back on the phone. If they were dissatisfied, I would go back to the lab and try to create a better phone that would be a perfect fit for them. Once I'm confident of my cell phone design, we then flash forward a couple of months after they have been sold publicly, and see whether we reached our profit goal or not.

<b>Pros:</b> These games are very engaging and require the player to search for their way to an answer on their own, where most games have much more direction and hints making their problems easier to solve. Students can practice their problem-solving skills in these games, and what makes them more engaging is the fact that these games are based on real-life situations. The website also provides pdfs for teachers with activities and discussions that students can do based on each game, and tips on how to use the site for their students.

For such engaging games, the fact that they're free makes it so much sweeter. I used to buy these types of games for the PC years back and they were usually around $20. I like how the design is very nice looking and clean and the colors are very well done. The audio sounds very clean and professional, although you might be able to hear some static noise if you listen carefully.

<b>Cons:</b> The only con I can think of is that since there is not much direction in the games. A player might get stuck in one part of the games, and might quit playing out of frustration. Maybe some hints would help more students, and hints could just be reminders to use the different resources to solve the problem. I also wish there was a way to skip some of the dialogue, like with the cell phone designing game, I kept re-designing my phone and when I came back to the focus group part of the game to get feedback on the phone, I had to sit through the same introduction dialogue again and again.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> There are many games, and resources to help students on specific school subjects but it would be interesting to make a game or resource outside of the regular school subjects, or one the encompasses more than one subject area.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> I love how this site supports teachers by providing them with free material to use with their students. We are seeing more and more companies and individuals sharing their learning materials online for all to use, without having to worry about paying a fee. Sharing is caring!
