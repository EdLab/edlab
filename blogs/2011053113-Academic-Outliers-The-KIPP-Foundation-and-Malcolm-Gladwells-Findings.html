          <p>
            I recently finished Malcom Gladwell's book <i>Outliers</i>, in which Gladwell examines singular, isolated success stories and searches for common themes and characteristics among them. With examples ranging from Bill Gates to Canadian professional hockey players, Malcolm ultimately finds that extraordinary successes are grounded in complex networks of circumstances and inheritances, claiming that societal and community factors play a much larger role in these stories than we believe.

Especially interesting and relevant is Gladwell's discussion on academic achievement disparities between students from low-, medium-, and high-income families. Examining the results of scholastic aptitude tests given to New York grade-school students in June and August, Gladwell finds both how much students learn over the school year and how much students learn over the summer. The results are surprising. Low-income students actually learn <i>more</i> than high-income students over the course of the school year, but high-income students continue learning over the summer whereas low-income students do not. Gladwell attributes this to the various activities (e.g. summer camp, special classes, etc) that children from more privileged backgrounds can afford, and the slight education boost higher-income students receive over summer accumulates over the years. Gladwell thus identifies the main problem in socioeconomic education disparities as not a function of lacking resources, but instead a difference in the amount of learning time. More learning time, not quality of learning, is thus the factor.

Gladwell then examines the <a href="http://www.kipp.org/">KIPP Academy</a>, an alternative-schooling project geared towards disadvantaged Manhattan middle school students, many of whose parents have never attended college before. Over 90% of the students in KIPP are African American or Hispanic, and nearly as many qualify for federally-subsidized meals. Yet, 84% of them will be performing at or above their grade level in math by the end of the program. Gladwell then follows the daily life of Marita, a student at KIPP, to illustrate the intensity of the KIPP program. Marita wakes up before 6:30 a.m. every morning, commutes to KIPP, and usually leaves the school around 7:00 p.m. She then works solely on homework until her bedtime after 11 p.m. Gladwell notes that because she spends 60% more time in class than her peers, she is able to keep up with students from high-income backgrounds.

Gladwell's examination of education is worth exploring further, as his findings have significant consequences for education design.
