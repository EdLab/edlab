<p>Mobile devices have been lauded as having changed the face of education. From personalizing learning to addressing educational inequality, the movement to integrate mobile learning into the classroom has claimed many benefits. While there has been much anecdotal evidence on the positive effects of mobile devices, there is a need for increased research on the benefits of devices in classroom settings.</p>
 
<p>New research examines how using mobile devices enhances instructional practices in a Pre–K classroom. Participants were students from two Pre–K classrooms at a rural, public charter school in Florida. Both groups took a Florida Pre-K standardized assessment in September. The classroom assigned to the experimental condition then spent two days a week from October until May practicing literacy and math skills using iPad apps. Informal observational feedback, based on curriculum relevance and teachers’ perceptions of student engagement with apps, was used to determine app appropriateness. The control class did not have access to iPads. In May, students took the same standardized test.</p>

<p>While results did not reveal any difference between the experimental and control groups on the September test, students in the experimental group had significantly higher scores in Math and Phonological Awareness categories on the May test. While scores were high across the four categories tested, there were no significant differences between groups on Print Knowledge or Oral Language. The results of this study suggest that mobile learning using informal feedback to guide instruction could significantly increase students’ early math and early literacy skills.</p>
 
<p>Mobile devices enable students to learn anywhere anytime. Though this study did not allow students to use devices beyond the classroom, the findings are consistent with informal stories that highlight the value of mobile learning. This study demonstrates not only the impact of mobile devices on learning, but also the importance of choosing appropriate apps to shape learning experiences.</p>
