Dr. Hannah Dee founded the <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/outreach/lovelace-colloquium/">BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium</a>, an annual conference where women computing students in the UK network and acquire career advice from successful women in tech. She is a lecturer in computer science at Aberystwyth University and a noted champion of women in IT.</p>

<p><b>In 2016 you were voted 9th most influential woman in IT in the UK, in large part for your commitment to the BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium. Have you seen significant progress for women in tech in the last decade?</b><br>
<p>We've seen a lot of change. When I started the BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium there were no events for undergraduate women in tech, and there were very few organizations in the women-in-tech sphere. BCSWomen, in the UK, was pretty much the only organization I could find. There were networking groups, like Girl Geek Dinners, but none visible to me that were working across the whole of tech. Now there are loads of excellent organisations: STEMettes, ACM-W, Girls Who Code, Code First Girls, Girls Who Tech, Women in Technology, and a host of regional ones, like Women Tech Cymru and other organisations aimed at particular subgroups like Women in ML for the AI community (and that’s just off the top of my head). Ten years ago, the thought of progress wouldn't have crossed my mind. So, on that level, there's a lot of progress and a lot of change. It's easier to find support, it's easier to find your network, and it's easier to get together with like-minded women in tech. There are even more undergrad events; the ACM have started up Womencourage, an undergrad conference, and various tech firms have recruitment days for women students, women-only hackathons, and so on.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we've seen very little progress in other fronts. The stats are exactly as dire as they were 10 years ago. In the UK, academic entrants into CS programs are still hovering at 7-15%. Workforce percentage is pretty much level. So the effort that is going into "the women problem" is not really bearing fruit (yet). Also, there seems to be a hardening of gender roles generally; online abuse aimed at women is increasing, and this might be a perception thing, but I get the feeling that the guys are pushing back a bit. We've had complaints from guys about running women-only events, which is particularly disappointing because our events are not women only. (The Lovelace Colloquium is aimed at women, and the poster contests are women only, but the day is open to all and it’s free to attend).</p>
<p><b>How has your educational trajectory and professional experience shaped where you are now, professionally?</b><br>
<p>My first degree was in cognitive science, which incorporated psychology, philosophy, and computer science; I think this led me towards my research area (computer vision and AI) but also opened me up to ideas of gender through the psychology and philosophy strands. After graduating, I worked full-time as a teaching fellow, and really got into ideas of teaching and communication whilst studying part-time for an MA (1998) in Philosophy. I have a post-grad certificate in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (2001) and a Ph.D. (2005) in Artificial Intelligence. I have gotten more and more involved in the representation of women in STEM over time, and have always been interested in teaching and the communication of ideas.</p>
<p><b>How do you see the BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium influencing the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>The BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium is now a regular fixture in the UK academic calendar. We had 200 attendees at this year’s conference and support from 14 companies through sponsorship and stands. It's an event which brings together some of the best women undergrads in the UK (which is why the companies like it), and one of the only opportunities students get to meet fellow undergrad peers from other universities. It's also a real learning experience in terms of "soft skills" like presentation and communication. For many of the attendees it's their first experience of work-related travel (and expenses claim forms!). Students present on their project work so it links lots of research into the effective use of projects in Higher Education, and the importance of students taking ownership of their work.</p>
<p>However, it's just one event. Our evaluations show that it has a massive effect on the attendees, but it's not something that everyone can take part in, as we’re selective. So I’m not sure how much influence it has on the entire learning landscape, but it certainly has an influence on UK women undergrads in computer science.</p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the future?</b><br>
<p>That's a really difficult question. I like to hope that the wave of cool science toys aimed at both girls and boys will mean that STEM subjects stop being seen as a boy's club, and that the coding clubs for girls and the events for women and all this effort we're currently putting into the problem of women's underrepresentation in the scientific sphere will pay off. This isn't so much a broad trend as a lofty hope though!</p>
<p><b>What are you currently working on? Is there a big project in the pipeline?</b><br>
<p>I've become convinced that if we want to change the overall picture with regard to women in tech, it's a mistake to work at just one level. So I work in higher education, and obviously a lot of my work happens at this level looking at people in the (broadly speaking) 18–22 age range. But as most girls are turned off tech long before 18 we also need to look at what happens in schools, and in the home. So I've been working on family coding workshops for kids, helping out with robot club, and working with the <a href="http://www.playfulcoding.eu">Playful Coding</a> project to bring creative computing and playful coding to a younger audience. I am convinced that one of the problems with women in tech is that tech itself has an image problem: it's not seen as creative or collaborative, and it ought to be both of these things. So a lot of my current projects are working in schools and with families trying to encourage younger learners not to run away from computing just yet.</p>
<p><b>Who do you follow religiously on Twitter?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Stemettes">@STEMettes</a>, who do great work with women at the start of their career (teenagers mostly); <a href="https://twitter.com/MissPhilbin">@missphilbin</a>, Carrie Anne Philbin, a one-woman force of nature when it comes to school kids and tech (geek gurl diaries, raspberry pi, CAS include...); <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_Black">@dr_black</a>, Sue Black, who founded BCSWomen and many other organisations. I don't need to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/bcswomen">@bcswomen</a>, as I am on the committee and have a fairly good idea of what they're doing, but everyone else in the UK women in tech scene should.</p>
