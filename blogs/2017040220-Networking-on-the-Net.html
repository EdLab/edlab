<p>Social media isn’t just for sharing snaps or food photos. Online social networking has an increasingly significant impact on an individual’s career development. Effectively using social networking sites like LinkedIn is of growing importance to how young people progress in their careers. Schools incidentally, if at all, discuss the importance of how students present themselves on social media.</p>
 
<p>The authors of this study examine the characteristics of social networking sites and virtual learning environments that could support students in practicing career networking skills. The researchers identify four important skills for students to develop: introducing themselves, sharing relevant experiences, interacting, and connecting.</p>
 
<p>Four schools put a different social networking site to the test. Each school engaged students aged 12–14 in developing online career skills. Students were instructed to prepare a professional profile page, share experiences that related to their future ambitions, and build relationships through connecting and interacting with other users. After analyzing these pages, researchers found that students were more likely to write about their hobbies or interests than their aspirations, which is less relevant information from a career perspective.</p>
 
<p>In a changing employment landscape, students may not be aware of the opportunities or risks in how they present themselves online. The results of this study demonstrated that social networking sites, even ones not explicitly intended for career use, such as Facebook, could be used to help students develop career competencies. This research further reinforces that teacher guidance is crucial for developing students’ online networking skills.</p>
