<p><i>"Our mission is to enable anyone, anywhere to acquire the skills, experience and relationships they need to succeed in the job market." </i> (<a href="https://genm.co/about">About GenM</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Getting Students Job Ready for Digital Marketing</b></p>

<p>Demand is growing even for entry-level candidates to have already demonstrated the acquisition and application of practical skills in professional capacities. As expectations for a more skilled workforce drive up competition, many young people are finding themselves at a loss for how best to prepare for their careers. Good grades donâ€™t necessarily translate to the possession of specific technical skills; so how can students supplement their school experience to prove themselves ready for their first job?</p>
  
<p>GenM was founded to remedy this lack of exposure to opportunities to build practical skills, especially those directly applicable to tech jobs. This organization matches students to free digital marketing apprenticeships so that they can gain experience remotely while going to school. GenM has connected 20,000 students to 5,000 businesses and believes that through building this network, their students will have greater career opportunities and collaborating businesses can gain future employees.</p>

<p><b>Apprenticeships That Grow Individuals and Businesses</b></p>

<p>GenM internships require 10 hours of work per week for 12 weeks. Before being paired with a business, students take courses in social media marketing, search engine optimization, and analytics led by industry experts so that they are fully prepared for their apprenticeship. Through mentorship at GenM and the businesses where they intern, students have the opportunity to participate actively in building their future in digital marketing.</p>

<p>GenM also hopes this program can help small businesses trying to grow their size and influence. Being connected to a student marketer can help such businesses build new projects and lead to them potentially even hiring the apprentice after the three-month internship is complete. By creating a service that has the potential to foster small business growth and young professional success, GenM hopes to expand both the types of people in the startup world and the ideas that permeate it.</p>
