          <p>
            Private Please! 

Thank you team EdLab for making last-night's demo 
night a success!  The feedback I received was unanimously good.  It seems that EdLab is providing an important opportunity for the edtech community to connect in a highly credible setting.  

<b>Here is some of the buzz I overheard:</b> 

"you are providing a valuable resource" (from an edupreneur)

"I was hesitant to ask my 'hard' question, but I thought, 'why not, this IS Columbia'" (Teacher & edupreneur)

"You could only hold the demo portion of the night and I would still come." (edupreneur)

"I love this space it looks like a warehouse..." (networker)

"I want to put my desk right there & work here (pointing to a space in the seminar area near the window)." (edupreneur)

"When is the next demo night?  Next month?" (CTO)

"How can I present a seminar or demo?" (after telling them that all presenters had to first conduct a seminar)

"The energy of this event was so much better than others... and the timing of demos was impressive." (edupreneur)

"Great job!  I know how hard an event like this is and I really appreciated all the details and forethought." (organizer of another edtech Meetup)

Overwhelmingly, the feedback was really amazing and it was thanks to your hard-work and support that this event went-off without a hitch or technical difficulty!  You represented the EdLab with flair and energy. Thank you for tweeting on our #EdLabDemos tag and asking great questions! 

I want to extend my <b>biggest thanks to my co-host Janice!!!  And... to Hui Soo, Brian, Daniel and Gary</b> for your hard-work, support and help making this event happen!  Also, a <b>special thank-you to Danielle</b> for her beautiful design elements throughout the event!  

I want to thank the team that stepped-in and manned special elements of the event like check-in, Q&A, Timing and more... <b>Jo, Rebecca, Laura C., Laura S. and Megha!  Thank you to the services team who stepped-in to greet guests and direct traffic (Michelle, Jordyn and more!)!</b> Finally, I want to thank <b>George & his team, including Danny, Oumar, Francisco and more</b> for your valuable help with set-up and event management.   

<b>Excited for you to share your thoughts, feedback and takeaways (& pictures!) in the comments below!</b>
