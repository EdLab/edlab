            Education has been changed over the years. But the physical schools remain to be (almost) the same. What should new schools look like in parallel to various trends in ed? According to this interesting <a href=”http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2012/07/10-things-in-school-that-should-be-obsolete/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+kqed%2FnHAK+%28MindShift%29&utm_content=Google+Reader”>article</a>, new schools call for flexible learning spaces, more learning interaction and technology. In order to reach this goal, several things need to be cleaned out. 

Corridors, which take up a lot of valuable real estate in a school and are unoccupied most of the time, seem not to be a good fit for the new school. Flexible learning space means that education can appear anywhere in school, not necessarily in physical classrooms. Corridors can thus be made into informal learning spaces. Along with this, the traditional function of corridors to connect classrooms will be minimized because common area is created for teaching and learning, indicating that students and teachers no longer need to sit in one isolated classroom but instead to learn in an open space where more interactions are encouraged. Sounds familiar? This idea has already come true on Internet, the hotbed of MOOCs. The community-based learning mode is being implemented in the real world.

Learning in prescribed places is also obsolete. As <a href=” http://www.tonywagner.com/about-tony”>“isolation is the enemy of improvement,
”</a> new school should also be a place where teachers could interact freely with each other when learning and practicing their teaching. Isolated cells, closed classes… these will never appear on the new school blueprint. Teachers need interaction to help them learn how to teach. 

A wider coverage of internet access in school is another call. Traditional computer labs, as the only place with internet access in old schools, should be removed. When devices like laptop, tablet, or mobile can be connected from everywhere in school, learning-assistive technologies will be more frequently used.  The following video envisions a learning environment highly injected with interactive technologies.
