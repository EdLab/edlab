<p> Phil Chen, the Chief Content Officer at HTC, believes its virtual reality headset, HTC Vive, has incredible potential for education and learning. Engineers and mechanics can use it to work on engines; neuroscientists can practice procedures on 3D brains; and any user can develop greater empathy by seeing the world through new eyes. The multiple perspectives granted by the HTC Vive provide a first-person experience to an unlimited number of engaging stories. Interacting with different surroundings from multiple points-of-view prompts users to feel within the computer-generated environment, potentially making them more open-minded and empathetic.</p>

<p>The capacity for user agency, interaction, and multiplicity of perspectives distinguishes the HTC Vive from other forms of virtual reality and enhances its educational potential. Where normal stories are told from one camera angle at a time, stories on the HTC Vive come from an unlimited number of cameras; the story surrounds users as they work their way through it. Acting as the main characters in their computer-generated tales, users can interact with their surroundings and experience the world from novel perspectives. Whether the virtual saga involves moon exploration or fantastic world adventures, the HTC Vive can provide these environments, and Chen thinks the world will be a better place because of it. The only remaining question is when it will be accessible enough for the general public to use.</p>

<p>Do you think the storytelling component of this virtual reality system will promote empathy and open-mindedness? What are some other educational benefits the HTC Vive might have? Join the discussion  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/28814/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:20 dinosossi2:</b> Possibly the most fruitful, although problematic, aspect of VR "storytelling" is the novel perspectives it brings. Although possibly immersive it also pushes against the more fixed perspective of typical storytelling reality.</p>

<p><b>@02:23 idrissa10:</b> Interacting with the virtual world could help elevate learning to a whole new height! Students could now have the ability to feel like they are interacting with whatever they are learning and help them to focus and enjoy the experience.</p>
