            Studies have shown that starting a project is the biggest barrier to productivity. However, it is important to develop a strategy that will help you get a project started. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-productivity-trick-one-author-used-to-write-over-40-books-2015-7" target = "blank">Anthony Trollopeâ€™s strategy</a> made him a prolific writer and led him into publishing over 47 novels, 18 works of non-fiction, 12 short stories, two plays and an assortment of articles and letters over the course of 38 years. His trick to accomplish tasks would make anybody productive. He cites division of time as the secret behind his success. As simple as it sounds, it was very effective.

When dealing with big projects, it is advisable to rank priorities based on their importance. The benefit this strategy offers is that it forces you to put a lot of time and effort on the task with the highest value. Also, his feeling of accomplishment was not after completing a book but rather after making constant progress along the way. Small periods of time must be set and something must be accomplished each period. This will not only ensure progress but it will help get constant and rapid feedback on the project. Fast feedback will determine whether the project is moving in the right direction and if so, the same path will be followed.
