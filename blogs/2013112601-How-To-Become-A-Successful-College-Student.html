          <p>
            Nowadays, graduating high school and going away to college has become the mission of many high school students. How many of them actually become successful college students? The transition from high school to college is a very important step in a student's education. Going away to college is very convenient to previous high school students due to being independent for the first time in their lives. Many people go away to college to have fun and live the college experience, while others go away to focus on their studies. However, this envy of being away just for the sake of the college experience could have many unpleasant consequences.

My current school, Alfred University, has an overall 73% acceptance rate every year. However, the university has only 68% full-time student retention rate, and a 29% transfer out rate. These numbers are primarily caused by the location of the school. It is away from everything and everyone. Most students find themselves hardly managing their time properly. As a consequence, they barely or never turn in their assignments or plagiarize. They are then subsequently kicked out of school.

I am currently doing research with school officials to collect information from old and current college students on their educational experiences at Alfred. This research is to inform future students to make the right decisions in order to be successful here and beyond.

How did you manage your schedule in college? Please share some tips you have previously used to stay on task as an undergraduate student.
