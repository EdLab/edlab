Dr. Dan Hughes is President of <a href="https://www.learningmachine.com/">Learning Machine</a>, the blockchain credentialing company he co-founded with partners from his prior company SlideRoom, the admissions and portfolio pioneer. He taught himself to program at Radio Shack on a TRS-80 when he was ten-years-old. Hughes quit high school and went on to build multiple companies while completing university degrees in religion, media, and philosophy. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Learning Machine? </b><br>
<p>My pre-college education was an extremely patchwork experience. I grew up a third culture kid following my diplomat parents around the world. I changed schools twelve times in my K–12 years and I actually dropped out of American high school in Grade 11 as I was already working for PaineWebber at the time (an American stock brokerage) and found high school to be largely redundant.</p>

<p>My early experience was not just one of changing schools, but of changing national education systems and dominant surrounding cultures. This extreme volatility in my early life had a profound relativizing effect on me. I came to see courses, institutions, and even whole systems as malleable, wieldable pedagogical experiences that were first and foremost mine to make something of, or not. As a result, I became quite comfortable taking or leaving things on my own terms. The variability of expression across cultures developed in me a capacity to see intentions and invariants across many forms. This is largely the good that came from my education. There were negative things as well: curriculum that should have built year-over-year was often out of sync or incoherent, some things were entirely missed given the differing emphases in the different systems, and the like. Overall, the theme of my early education was learning to learn on my own as it was up to me to navigate constant change and to bring my own coherence to the overall process.</p>

<p>This theme continued after I dropped out of high school and began higher education. I never saw college as a particularly vocational activity. For me, everything I studied was building a broader and more subtle frame from which to live. I studied what helped me build out my frame of reference while working at what made money, software for the most part. I was lucky enough to grow up between worlds and due to this I was not kept strictly with my own age group when I was young. This created a unique confidence in me as well as openings for high-stakes engagements with the world. For example, it seemed completely natural to me to sell my first consulting contract to the U.S. government when I was twelve. From my point of view at the time, I knew something that they did not and it simply made sense for them to buy those services from me. Lucky for me, I was able to convince them of this too and my early successes opened up the world in uncustomary ways.</p>

<p>So, here we finally are arriving at the answer to your question. Education was and is for me simply the building up of myself in skill and outlook so as to be and to build something in the world. I was lucky enough to have real world feedback loops to learn at an early age many of the organizational and leadership lessons that are generally reserved for later in life. As difficult as it was at times, it was from out of this strange crucible that my adult life came to be characterized by the continued entwining of organization building and formal learning up to the present day. I cannot imagine a time where I will not be doing both.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Learning Machine will change the way institutions, educators, and students approach learning? </b><br>
<p>If you think of the mission of Learning Machine in light of the European Commission Joint Research Centre’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/open-education">ten dimensions of open education</a>, Learning Machine is all about <i>recognition</i> and the powerful cultural and institutional forces that are unleashed with <i>open recognition</i>.</p>

<p>Recognition simply means that two things can take place: something of formal value like a diploma or certificate can be issued by an organization and that issued claim can be verified by others with whom it is shared. That may seem simple, and it is, but it is this recognition of the achievement by the issuer and the verifier that gives tangible value to learning outcomes. This is where Learning Machine comes in.</p>

<p>What we do is add a third actor into this mix by inserting the learner and worker back into the recognition cycle. Unlike traditional recognition where students and alumni can never own their official record, but merely possess unofficial copies that act as pointers to an official document that is kept on file by the issuing institution, Learning Machine’s open recognition technology gives institutions the ability to issue learners their official records that they can then own and share with prospective employers, banks, governments, and the like. Student-owned official records were not possible until Learning Machine and MIT Media Lab built this open recognition technology we call <a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/">Blockcerts</a>, which is now a part of the W3C verifiable claims working group and the IMS Global Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI) standard.</p>

<p>Learning Machine’s enterprise platform is based on our open source, standards-based Blockcerts project. With the Learning Machine platform, schools, governments, and companies can issue something of formal value like a diploma, certificate, or transcript to individuals or cohorts. The official document that is issued is then directly owned by the student or employee and it can be freely verified at will by others with whom the owner shares it <i>without</i> needing to go back to the issuing institution. The document itself holds its verifiable authenticity.</p>

<p>This is what we call <i>open recognition</i> because, once issued, the learning outcomes of everyone can be owned, shared, and verified directly. This not only empowers the learner with student-owned official records, but also the learning providers and employers with near-instant validation of backgrounds during grad school admissions, employment applications, visa applications, and the like. The transformation of learning outcomes into verifiable claims is a powerful accelerator in all areas as it builds direct trust into situations that would have required extensive verification in the past.</p>

<p>It is my contention that recognition is one of the unsung pieces of social infrastructure that enables all areas of learning and its impact on the world. Over time, removing outmoded bureaucracies, compressing the cycle times on decisions, and rooting out the injustices of systemic friction and subjective prejudice will be possible through the presentation of durable, verified claims about what a learner or worker has achieved without the need for third party validation. This opens up the door to rapid transformation in how we deal with college admissions, hiring, and even the social traumas of displaced populations.</p>

<p>Having one's claims at hand in such a durable and effective fashion upends fee-collecting middlemen. It also provides the conditions for what is called <i>self-sovereignty</i>, that state of being in the world where people are able to selectively disclose their identity through curating the key information about themselves that is appropriate based on context rather than having to over-disclose in an all or nothing situation. Solving the inefficiencies and gaps in the area of recognition is central to Learning Machine’s mission as we seek to empower learners and institutions in ways that are mutually respectful.</p>

<p>There will be a lot of companies and projects claiming to have <i>blockchain</i> as a feature of their offering in the years ahead. As an education leader, one needs to immediately assess any vendor offering by whether it enables unfettered student ownership, vendor independence, and decentralized verification. Most solutions will not. Vendors are already attempting to layer on blockchain as a buzzword feature while retaining proprietary lock-ins that break student ownership, vendor independence, and open verification. The easy way, though not the only way, to assess a vendor is simply to ask, <i>Is this solution Blockcerts compliant?</i> As mentioned before, Blockcerts is the blockchain certificates open standard that we developed with MIT and which is being used in school systems and governments around the world. Being <i>Blockcerts Compliant</i> means that a vendor has implemented the standard into their platforms such that issuing, owning, and verifying official documents is open.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I was educated largely in international schools. Upon my return to my passport country, I ended up quitting high school due to the broad content disparities between the systems. I suspect that, like with most things that have a major information component, there will be an encroaching force of homogenization across global curricula and, perhaps more slowly, even pedagogical practices. This is simply part of the bargain after the information turn. Differences will remain, but radical difference will dissipate.</p>

<p>Besides this, I think that continuous learning will become the dominate differentiator between the haves and the have nots; second only to capital inequalities. In my ideal world, the transformative effects of universal basic income on higher education (HE), vocational education and training (VET), and specialized education will begin to improve the currently horrendous problem of skills and purpose discovery among the young. All the general stuff about virtual reality, artificial intelligence (AI), etc. is all impactful as well, of course. But I am much more interested in the societal shifts underway with the pervasive collapse of distance and acceleration of information exchange.</p>

<p><b>In addition to Learning Machine, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>We are still collaborating with MIT on the next generation of admissions systems as well as the open source blockchain certificates standard. Personally, I am reading widely in machine learning, AI, integrated information theory (IIT), mathematics, and phenomenology, as I am keenly interested in the <i>boundary</i> where the quantitative and qualitative arise.</p>

<p>More practically, I have been interested in the empowerment of the faculty in new modes of pedagogy and credentialing enabled by technologies of connection (web/mobile) and trust (blockchain/decentralized identifiers or DID). We should see some progressive and powerful new forms of accrediting, teaching, and credentialing in the not so distant future. For example, why are we accrediting institutions and not professors? Why are departments not more autonomous and modular? Why can’t credit and degrees be granted in different ways and over different timeframes? If 12 PhDs who graduated from a particular department of a university endorsed a researcher’s public work as a novel contribution to their field, could the school offer this researcher a doctoral degree? Perhaps more interestingly, if two dozen people with terminal degrees from different schools did the same thing could we imagine the network credentialing the person without a sponsoring institution? These are things I think about.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<p>This is a hard one. There are too many great people on Twitter. I love the academic work coming out of <a href="https://twitter.com/erikphoel">Erik Hoel</a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/NSmolenski">Natalie Smolenski</a>. I also love the readable commentary from <a href="https://twitter.com/mikejcasey">Mike Casey</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisjagers">Chris Jagers</a>. My cryptocurrency commentary comes largely from <a href="https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4">Nick Szabo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us">Adam Back</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/WernerTwertzog">Werner Twertzog</a> is who makes me laugh.<p>
