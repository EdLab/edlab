Several weeks ago, a research colleague asked if there was any discernable difference between self-regulated learning (SRL) and self-directed learning (SDL). It has just never occurred to me there was a noticeable difference in the terminology. I often assumed both terms were used loosely to describe the same thing. However, to my surprise, there is a clear and very distinct difference between SRL and SDL.

In a conference presentation aptly titled <em><a href="http://txcdk.unt.edu/sites/default/files/2010Fall_ScottBracey_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">Twins or Just Friends</a></em>, Professor Pamela Bracey (N. of North Texas) tackles the unique characteristics of each term. She notes that SRL is a “frame of mind that students achieve through attaining and satisfying the desire to be independent in any type of classroom setting.” SRL is the process by which learners decide what, when, where, and how to learn (Weinert, 1982). They essentially decide every aspect of their own learning. SDL is “a characteristic of discipline, possessed by students only in online courses where no instructor or facilitator is present.” SDL is, therefore, the process in which learners that the lead in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating goals, identifying resources and appropriate learning strategies and ultimately evaluating the learning outcomes.

In her presentation, Professor Bracey did note that both terms were used interchangeably in the literature.  As we continue to think about potential offerings of this Institute, it is important for us to draw a clear distinction between the two terms and how we can best support learners interested embarking on the SD journey.
