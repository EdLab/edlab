<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slatemath-for-kids-kindergarten/id589371294?mt=8">SlateMath</a> is a learning platform to support kindergarten and first grade students in math through games and interactive activities. This platform takes learners through a series of activities that increase with difficulty as the child develops a mastery of the concept. There are two different versions, one designed for home and school use and one educator version that provides analytics software and assessment tools. The educator version also enables teachers to build a targeted learning center. This app helps young learners develop flexible thinking and reinforces math concepts taught in the classroom.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This application offers young learners a number of visually stimulating tools to practice counting, number drawing, pattern recognition, odd/even identification, and simple addition. Sections focus on specific tasks for improvement and can have as many as eight adaptive levels to enhance concept mastery. Each level is equipped with a different method for applying the targeted skill and encourages interactive "touch and play" approaches for counting, pattern recognition, and more. Friendly, responsive graphics support each learner through their mathematical journey, offering suggestions and hints when needed. SlateMath’s professional version provides educators with real-time feedback and insight into each student’s learning progress. The interface features a comprehensive dashboard with assessment tools like classroom diagnostics and individual student progress reports and supports blended learning styles with elements like screen sharing and self-paced practice. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some of the graphics can be confusing. For instance, during a counting game, users are asked to count each type of animal depicted in the scene. Varying sizes, different angles, and similar colors often make it difficult to tell one animal from another. The exercises are lengthy and each level feels slightly longer than it should be. The app is currently only available for iPad.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> SlateMath is a simple, intelligent application ideal for home use. This tool enhances basic mathematical learning by providing interactive ways for students to practice, draw, and identify numbers. The app is free of charge for the basic edition but the cost for the professional version is not publicized. Although it is marketed as a classroom enhancement, SlateMath feels more like an independent learning tool as it adapts to each user and their learning style. Its design is a welcome change from many other math applications that use the bright colors and jarring characters to attract children with "game-like" practice. This app is straightforward and engaging in the simplest way, which works to its advantage. </p>
