<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1OSK9ds">Phil Bronner</a> is the CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1nu8i3D">American Honors</a>, a selective program that helps two-year college students across the country find and transfer to four-year schools that best fit their needs. Bronner’s career reflects his lifelong passion for education and its ability to transform students’ lives. Prior to leading American Honors, he was a General Partner for Novak Biddle Venture Partners, a venture capital firm with a focus on investments in education, where he led 16 investments over the course of more than 12-and-a-half years. During his tenure, Bronner served on the board of several education companies, including ePals, 2tor, UniversityNow and Fidelis College. Before joining Novak Biddle, Bronner served as a management consultant with McKinsey & Company and as a software engineer for IBM.</p>

<p>Bronner holds a BS in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, a Juris Doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law, and an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He currently serves on the Alumni Advisory Board for the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, and is a Board Member for the Georgetown Day School, a private institution in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>

<p>Attending Carnegie Mellon was an inflection point in my life. When I first got to college, I was just some African American kid from Baltimore who played basketball and did well on his SATs. Being in the computer science program challenged me in a way I had never experienced before. I was working 24 hours a day, surrounded by people just as focused and dedicated as I was. Being a part of that experience, being in that environment, was completely transformational.</p>
 
<p>When I was 22, I wrote a mission statement for my life. I knew I wanted to do something that had an impact on education. So I became a venture capitalist and joined a firm with a focus on education. We invested in Blackboard in 1998, and after that, given our experience, we saw about 50% of the education deals in the U.S. at that time. I was very active in all of the education ventures we invested in, and that experience led to <a href="http://bit.ly/1VkTbUw">Quad Learning</a>.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>My hope is we’ll be able to transform so many students’ lives, so profoundly, that others will see what we’re doing, see that it works, and start implementing it at their own institutions. A major part of why it works is how we do advising. When you think about an educational experience, advising is something people within education realize is important, but prospective students often don't see the value in it—so they don’t seek it out, they don’t demand it, and they don’t want to pay for it.</p>
 
<p>As a result, student-to-advisor ratios are too high. If the ratios were lower, we'd see dramatically improved student outcomes. So we created a program called American Honors where high-touch, "intrusive" advising was a core component of the program. There’s no choice for the students: if you join the program, you get the advising. That advising comes from our dedicated academic advisors, but also from faculty and peer-to-peer advising. Students are completely immersed in a supportive environment. What we're seeing so far is that this model dramatically improves outcomes.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The biggest driving factor for change will be higher education’s broken economic model. The current model doesn’t work. We know it doesn’t work. As a result, we’ll see major change over the next 10-20 years that will have a dramatic impact on the higher ed landscape. Online education will become more prominent, specifically hybrid experiences. Online education is rapidly becoming just as good as a face-to-face experience for particular uses. As we get better at identifying what online education is best at, we’ll see an increase in hybrid experiences where some is done online, some in person.</p>
 
<p>Global education will have a significant impact on higher education. More and more students want to study abroad, more and more employers want to hire people with global experience. It will become a core skillset that will drive a rise in alternative pathways to higher education. The traditional 4-year experience isn’t for everybody, and it’s not necessary for every career. We’ll start to really understand and appreciate that fact more. Finally, public-private partnerships will proliferate. One thing that private enterprise can bring to education is private capital—which is desperately needed in education right now. If you think about how education traditionally gets funded, you see it’s mostly tuition and donation. But with new ways of bringing in capital, we can open the gates of higher education to a whole new group of people.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Everything right now is about Quad Learning. What’s so exciting about it is that our program works. The advising, the small classes, the faculty support, the community—it all comes together and it works. It produces a high quality education, and it does it at a low overall cost. It’s affordable, it’s sustainable, and it’s accessible.</p>
 
<p>The key is pairing low-cost educational infrastructure with high quality programming and support—the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The next big project is integrating more global elements. Global experiences leave students with capabilities to do extremely well at a university, but also prepare them to be global citizens and part of the global workforce of the not-too-distant future.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>The most innovative individual in the U.S. right now is <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">Elon Musk</a>. He's created companies that compete in the traditional marketplace, but the result of their success has double-bottom-line benefits. Just look at Tesla: the more cars they sell, the smaller our carbon footprint becomes.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1RIOLZF">Dr. Angel Cabrera</a>, President of George Mason University. Those who can provide a high value education that scales will do extremely well over the next few years. One of the most innovative instances of this is at George Mason.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1VkUy5J">Jeremy Johnson</a> of Andela. He’s onto the fact that the future is global. Think of taking something like General Assembly, and putting it in Africa. Investing this way in emerging parts of the world creates extreme benefits—bringing access to truly top-tier, global talent.</p>
