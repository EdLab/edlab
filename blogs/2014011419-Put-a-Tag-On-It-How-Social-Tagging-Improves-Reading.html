<p><b>Title:</b> A tag based learning approach to knowledge acquisition for constructing prior knowledge and enhancing student reading comprehension (2014)</p>

<p><b>Author:</b> Jun-Ming Chen, Meng-Chang Chen, & Yeali S. Sun</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513002558">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> 
How can prior knowledge and social tagging be combined to improve the reading comprehension of students studying English?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> 
Effectively improving reading comprehension for EFL students depends on integrating information in a given text with preexisiting knowledge. When learners are familiar with subject material before they read, their motivation and performance improve; however, assembling relevant background texts can be time-consuming for educators. Researchers sponsored by the <a href="http://web1.nsc.gov.tw/mp.aspx?mp=7">National Science Council</a> in Taiwan proposed compiling supplementary reading material through a tag-based learning approach. Their development of an online collaborative reading platform encouraged students to use social tagging to identify and share related material. It also allowed students to practice summarizing skills while creating a pool of semantic data for recommendation programs.</p>

<p>An experiment was designed to measure improvements in comprehension by evaluating high school freshman in Taiwan using tag-based prior knowledge recommendations (TAK) against a control group. A post test measured their progress after four weeks of tagging level-appropriate, science-related texts.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> 
Results indicated that incorporating additional information in students’ social knowledge and increasing interconnections among users raised reading comprehension levels. The students in the experimental group performed significantly better on post tests, confirming that the TAK system had enhanced the science learning environment. Additional analysis verified that the tagging system did not require significantly more time to read background information than other systems. A post-experiment survey found that participants agreed that acquiring prior knowledge was beneficial to their understanding and that the TAK system facilitated this, with the overwhelming majority claiming it was easy to use.</p>
<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> 
There were some limitations to this study that should be taken into account if further research is conducted. Unfortunately the experiment was limited to scientific articles, so additional studies should determine if using other subject material yields similar results. Research would also benefit from expanded tag suggestions and improved algorithms to keep recommendations germane. This would address the problem of "data sparseness," which occurs when users don’t apply any tags to a section of text. This may happen when students aren’t already familiar with the material, it was too new to link to, or it was just uninteresting. The authors suggest creating a forum for students to discuss the appropriateness of tags to mitigate this and increase interactions. Lastly, expanding the pool of experts who verify the accuracy of content will ensure tag quality. Implementing these recommendations and developing this system further will represent a significant step forward in effectively utilizing technology to create smart, social reading tools.</p>
