Description: BetterLesson.org is a website being developed by a group of public school teachers in Boston to aggregate and share course curriculums and lesson plans.  It is by educators/for educators, and restricted to K-12 schooling.  Like a social networking site, teachers sign up, create profiles, and then upload course plans to share with others.  
<!--break-->
The website is divided between educators and resources, the former a social networking component, the latter encapsulating every kind of lesson plan. As the acronym SWBAT (Students Will Be Able To, ubiquitous throughout the site) suggests, the focus in each lesson is on imparting concrete and specific skills/knowledge.

Pros: The resources posted range from full courses with year long lesson plans to small 1-day units, but all are easily organized with the sorting tools provided in a sidebar, and suggested categorization.  Lessons are rated by other teachers, and listed under their subject. 

Cons: Creating a lesson plan is not a very intuitive process.  Some teachers throw everything in disorganized attached files, and others list everything on the page itself.  Also, there is little to encourage collaboration or meaningful feedback.  Comments can be added to any lesson, but discussions are rare, and not well supported by the site.  Ultimately it doesn't seem that much communication goes on between teachers, which somewhat defeats the purpose.

Relevance: The tool can be useful for teachers searching for a new lesson plan, or trying to share with others their own plans.  But it is fairly static in fulfilling this function, and doesn't seem to create any opportunities for further collaboration.  To use a business term, there's no “synergy” going on; the content is merely the sum of its contributors. This problem highlights the importance of not neglecting the social networking aspects of these educational sites.
