          <p>
            I just finished reading <i>In Plain Sight</i> a book about educational reform in New Jersey. Under the landmark <i>Abbott v. Burke</i> decision, additional school funding was filtered to districts found to be consistently underserving its students. These districts, on average, "spend at a level that is about 120 percent of that of wealthier districts in the nation's highest spending state" (p. 29). Despite this increased funding, these districts continued to struggle until--according to MacInnes--they directed attention to students who were 3 years old. New Jersey educational policies focused on getting these students to be confident readers when they graduated third grade. Doing this, they believe (and MacInnes cites data to support this belief), will narrow the achievement gap (which is--according to the data MacInnes uses--starting to happen).<p>

So, what does this have to do with adaptive learning? In New Jersey, the most successful Abbott districts--according to MacInnes--focused on using methods that were responsive to each student as developing readers. Relying less on textbooks and other non-customizable forms of instruction, they used materials that could be most easily adapted to their students as individual learners. Assuming that the story MacInnes tells is correct, how might we create learning environments for 3 year olds that help them become confident readers when they graduate third grade? What will this type of tool look like? While I don't doubt that human interaction--an older person reading to and with a younger person on a consistent basis, listening to that young person and encouraging her or his verbal development--can best accomplish this, how might a tool--or set of tools--approximate the experience?
