Gail Breslow is Director of the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network and has overseen the dissemination of the Computer Clubhouse to community-based organizations both nationally and internationally since 1995. In addition, she has spearheaded the development of programs such as Hear Our Voices (a Clubhouse program for girls and young women); Clubhouse-to-College/Clubhouse-to-Career; and Beyond Four Walls: The Computer Clubhouse as Invention Studio. Gail served for many years on the Technology and Youth Advisory Committee of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and has led workshops about the Clubhouse’s unique learning approach at youth, community and technology conferences around the country. Gail holds an MBA from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University and an undergraduate degree from Oberlin College in Ohio, and has worked for Fortune 500 companies as well as within the nonprofit sector.

Gail Breslow was joined by local youth and "alumni" from the Computer Clubhouse at the Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement (HCCI). At the Clubhouse, youth work with adult mentors and staff to explore their own interests, develop skills, and build self-confidence through technology. In the process they become inspired about learning and develop a sense of their own potential. The youth from HCCI shared their experience through demonstrations of their work and reflections on their Clubhouse activities. Each participant described what first brought them to the Clubhouse, then showed an excerpt of a Clubhouse film, animation, song, or other work they created. They then described the making of the piece -- what inspired them, who worked with them, what they learned during the process, and how the Clubhouse’s make-up influenced the project. They concluded with where they are now, and how participation in a community like the Clubhouse has influenced them.

This book talk was co-sponsored by Teachers College Press and the Gottesman Libraries.  It followed an edlab event earlier in the day when Gail Breslow  spoke about the history and development of the Computer Clubhouse, its impact on young people’s lives, and her role in developing the Computer Clubhouse Network.
