<p>
<a href="http://curatr.co.uk/">Curatr</a> is an online course design platform that encourages <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/tutorials/active/what/index.html">active learning</a>. The system is focused on creating and curating learning content as an alternative to passive learning strategies such as looking through slides or watching a video. The courses that teachers create in Curatr use <a href="http://www.bigdoor.com/gamification/">gamification elements</a> such as points and levels to promote engagement and encourage interaction and exploration.</p>

<p>Courses are organized in levels which contain learning objects: videos or websites accompanied by a comment section for discussions. Students earn points by interacting with these learning objects and leaving comments. When students earn enough points, they ascend to the next level. Student tests are also built into the system and include multiple choice items, discussion questions, and uploading new learning content and having it peer reviewed. Curatr is also available as an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/curatr-for-ipad/id504360180?ls=1&mt=8">iPad app</a> for mobile learning.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>To level up in Curatr, students must display their knowledge by inputting external urls or files in response to questions. Encouraging students to search externally for answers can help improve <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-lack-basic-research-skills-study-finds/28112">information literacy</a> and is an example of active learning. Students are also able to see their peers’ submissions which gives the online course a more open and social feel.</p>

<p>Teachers have full customization control over how many points users need to proceed to the next level and the number of learning objects in each level. In this way teachers can control the workload of each level, though the natural approach might be to start with easy levels and have each subsequent level become more difficult.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>First time users may find it difficult to navigate the course space and might have to consult the help videos for explanation. This ambiguity might be intentional to encourage users to explore the site and discover the various functions for themselves. The system is also unable to differentiate comment quality; for instance a student may give a short generic comment that may not be meaningful and still receive the point.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Curatr’s way of allowing users to create online courses is startlingly different from similar online platforms. Normally online courses depend on the educator to provide all of the learning content, but in Curatr the students are asked to input in online resources that can also be used as learning content for the course. The other unique feature in an online course design platform is using gamification as a means to encourage users to fully interact with the learning objects and become motivated to move through each level in the course. Teachers can use this to their advantage and design a course in which more interaction and curation is required. Though there is plenty of customization in Curatr, it is still up to the teachers to intelligently design their course to reach the classroom’s learning goals.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Curatr makes online course creation all fun and games.</p>
