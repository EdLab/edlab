          <p>
            Duncan had a post on this earlier about the proposition of paying student athletes. Consider this a follow-up. While I should have been studying for my statistics midterm, I decided to peruse through the EdLab blog and click on Hui Soo's Sachin & Sehwag link. I soon headed to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/index">OTL homepage</a>, where I started watching a series of videos they have on the controversies surrounding the NCAA.

One of their interviews was with Mark Emmert, president of the NCAA, and the debate over pay-for-play. Anyone with even an Econ 101 background can see through the NCAA's charade. Emmert denies that athletes themselves play any central role in producing value for the NCAA (he instead counters by saying the money generated comes from the fans, clearly confusing consumers and producers). To the honest observer, college football and basketball players are simply not paid justly for the value they produce for athletics programs.

Which brings me to second problem with Emmert's claims. When asked about the effective salary cap in the NCAA, given that athletes' compensation is capped at the cost of tuition, room, and board, Emmert disingenuously responds that there are no salaries in the NCAA. Sure, no monetary salaries, but there are still other forms of compensation to consider. The question to ask in all of this is whether we ought to deny high-performing college athletes their just share of revenue they directly help generate? Currently, this revenue is going straight into the coffers of athletics departments. 

Another issue to point out is the difference in academic standards for athletes and non-athletes at almost all schools. From the Big Ten to the Ivy League, there is an unwritten rule to take it easier on athletes with regards to their studies. And why not? These athletes are working their tails off 24/7. How can we expect these hard working young adults to have time to earn a quality education when they are constantly under pressure from their coach and the athletics director to perform at the highest level?

ESPN even pointed out some of Emmert's blatant attempts to be willfully disingenuous. Emmert claims that only 14 schools have positive cashflow in athletics, when it is clearly more important to see the amount of money flowing through basketball and football programs specifically (since they subsidize most of the other interscholastic sports teams).

A final claim Emmert makes is that athletes do not have the excuse that they accept extra benefits because they are broke. He seems to think these athletes are ungrateful for the education they are receiving for free, which he sees as more than just compensation (this strikes me as a tad racist). Mo matter how much tuition, room, and board cost, the athlete is still liquidity constrained. Place on top of this the fact that it is often these athletes' families that are in trouble, and it seems obvious that athletes will take extra benefits if it means their mother avoiding foreclosure. Remember Amare Stoudemire's situation?
