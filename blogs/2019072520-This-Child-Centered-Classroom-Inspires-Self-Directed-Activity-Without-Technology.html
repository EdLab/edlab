<p>In 2012, <a href="http://www.dillon3.k12.sc.us/LattaElementary/index.php">Latta Elementary School</a> in South Carolina became a public Montessori school. Although self-directed activity is an important part of the Montessori method, the teacher plays a fundamental role in setting up the environment to foster attentive, engaged, and sustained learning. There are specific requirements for setting up a Montessori classroom. These requirements are based on the 40 years of observations by <a href=" https://amshq.org/About-Montessori/History-of-Montessori">Dr. Maria Montessori</a>. The physical space, learning objects, and schedule are all carefully designed to suit the developmental needs of growing children.p>

<p>Today, we often associate self-directed learning with laptops or other personalized digital devices. However, Montessori classrooms exclude the use of technology for young children, insisting students engage in real-world activities such as washing dishes, dusting, gardening, and feeding animals to foster attentiveness and responsibility.</p>

<p>Can you imagine any scenario where technology can be used effectively in the Montessori classroom? What comments or questions do you have about the Montessori Method after watching this video? Share your opinion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50915">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:06 Melanie Herring:</b> I feel like Montessori classroom or not, digital technology in a classroom or not, there should always be large windows in classrooms and a connection to the outdoors. The physical spaces we learn in - no matter the method or medium of learning - impact us. Natural light and nature should be valued regardless of the kind of academic program a school wants to put in place, which is why I sometimes get irritated that these aspects become affiliated with specific models of education.
 </p>

<p><b>@02:50 Sara Hardman:</b> Montessori method definitely still seems applicable today, perhaps even more so than ever. We're valuing autonomy and agency more in children, and Montessori schools seem to educate students in these abilities as much as in the content itself. </p>
