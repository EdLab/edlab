            I was recently awarded a new 3rd generation iPad as part of a scholarship package. After a couple of days playing around with it, I am beginning to come to grasp with its full capabilities. However, I have been wondering whether to forgo buying a laptop, in an attempt to save money, and use my new iPad as a replacement. As a result, I decided to do an analysis of the pros and cons of an iPad and a laptop.

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/5-reasons-why-the-iPad-is-a-great-replacement-for-your-laptop.jpg" alt="ipad"/>

For starters, the iPad is extremely lightweight thus making it much more portable than a standard laptop. I can take it everywhere without having to worry about carrying a heavy item as is the case with laptops. Second, the iPad takes half, if not 1/3rd, the amount of time to startup as a laptop. It also has a fairly decent storage capacity which will allow me to store countless amount of files. If it does occur that I need more space, I can always utilize Apple's iCloud service. In terms of browsing the web, the iPad has virtually the same Internet browsing capabilities as a laptop with the exception of playing flash videos. Presented with these facts, the iPad technically can perform any function as a laptop and therefore it should seem like a slam-dunk decision to forgo buying an iPad right? Not exactly.
 
Speaking from the point of a soon to be college student, the iPad fails to accommodate me on the one thing that I will be doing a lot of in college: writing. Considering the sheer amount of papers I'll be writing for my classes as well as for the school newspaper (which I plan to join), the iPad simply doesn't provide me with the necessary tools to comfortably execute these functions. For one, the iPad lacks a fully integrated physical keyboard. Virtual keyboards just don't have the same feel of physical ones and take far longer to type. This will be important considering I'll need to be fast with my typing when I take notes during class.  Sure I could purchase a keyboard and connect it but that will mean having to carry an extra accessory. Also the iPad doesn't support Microsoft Word, the writing software that I am most accustomed. I've used Word for as long as I can remember and I am unsure of how well I'll be able to adapt to Apple's version Pages.

 
With this analysis in hand, I've come to a conclusion that the iPad isn't a suitable replacement for a laptop but rather a supplement. One way in which I plan to explore its supplemental potential is to use it as an ebook both in reading books as well as viewing textbooks.
