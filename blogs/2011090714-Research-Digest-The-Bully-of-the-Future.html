Every now and then a news story pops up lamenting the damage caused by school bullying, and demanding a cultural, legal, or policy response.  Finally I decided it was time to get to the bottom of this issue, so I went and looked for relevant research in the literature. It turns out what we call bullying psychologists call “relational aggression.”  In a paper published in 2010, Stephen S. Leff and co-authors review the research related to relational aggression and its prevention.
<!--break-->
<b>Summary</b>:

Relational aggressors (bullies) are weird.  Although they have a “wide range of social processing, peer relationship, and social adjustment difficulties,” they also seem to have “considerable social influence within the peer group.” Their anti-social dispositions can often take physical form, but as a category relational aggression covers a wide range of behavior, including 3 year olds putting their hands over their ears, and 15 year olds posting mean comments on Facebook.  Generally speaking, relational aggression seems to correlate with a variety of dysfunctions, particularly aggressive dysfunctions, and so attacking bullying may, as one would expect, lead to less aggressive societies overall.  Of course, this presupposes that such behavior is amenable to intervention.

In reviewing the relevant research, the authors of this article found 16 programs developed and implemented to reduce relational aggression within a school, of which 9 were sufficiently clear and well-designed to be worth comparing.  Generally, these programs involve targeted lessons and teacher attention to students identified as relational aggressors.  Occasionally parents were involved as well.  Although the authors of this paper felt that none of the studies were reliable enough to offer many conclusions with any confidence.  Although there are some promising leads, this seems like a field in need of further work.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:

Relational aggression as played out in distance learning networks is a potential danger, and it would be good to have mechanisms in place to meet it.  Unfortunately, the more “online” education becomes, the less approachable students will be with the face-to-face interventions discussed in this article.
