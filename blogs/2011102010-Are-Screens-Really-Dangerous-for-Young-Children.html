<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/health/19babies.html?ref=health">This NYT's article</a> appeared today and highlights a new study from the <a href="http://www.aap.org/sections/media/toddlerstv.htm">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> describes the risk of screen time for children under 2 years-old.  While not new, a similar, though more alarming bell was sounded in 1999, this new warning comes at an especially inopportune time as we experience an exponential explosion of educational games, programs and technology aimed at young children.  From the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Laugh-Learn-Apptivity-Case/dp/B004UU9W78"> Fisher Price iPhone "rattle"</a> to Disney's investment in the <a href="http://www.babyeinstein.com/en/discovery_kits/">Baby Einstein video series</a>, technology and children has become an ubiquitous combo. 

<b>What are the issues highlighted by this study?</b>
Some of the potential issues & dangers cited by this study include the straight-forward warning from the AAP that, "Video screen time provides no educational benefits for children under age 2 and leaves less room for activities that do, like interacting with other people and playing."  The article goes on to explain that young children learn more from direct peer-to-peer or adult-to-child interaction than on screens.  Perhaps this is one of the best cases for early childhood education?  <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/search?fulltext=Screen+time&submit=yes&x=11&y=8">The Journal of Pediatrics</a>  also cites recent findings that for every 2 hours of screen time for children under 2, they spend 50 minutes less time interacting with a parent and 10 percent less time engaged in creative play.  

<b>Takeaways:</b>    
I find the fact that children have less creative engagement sadly ironic, as many game developers and children's tv programmers invest in what they consider to be educational, creative content for children (Ardent lifetime <a href="http://www.sesamestreet.org/">Sesame Street </a> fan here!).  I think the biggest mistake is to blame the messenger (information providers), and instead to educate parents on the potential risk of the proverbial digital babysitter.   

<b>Here are questions that this study brings-up for me... </b>
What does this mean for game, video and technology developers?  What ethical issues arise for both parents and producers of this technology?  Do we move towards warning stickers on technology to protest young children's neurological & social development?  Where do we draw the line & how feasible is it for busy, stressed parents to NOT hand-over the smartphone to your screaming toddler as you wait in line to check-out at the local grocery store?
