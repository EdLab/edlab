            Hey everyone, I would like to share a web browser based educational game for kids that I worked on last semester. It was a DARPA funded project aimed at teaching science to kids aged 6-8, and the game our team worked on specifically taught the concept of balance. 

You can check out the demo of the game on the project website <a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/projects/impact/?page_id=18
">here</a>: (For best performance, try it in firefox. Additional browsers are listed on the demo page)

The process involved a lot of research and play-testing with kids. In the beginning, we looked at different options for game mechanics, and selected two interactions. We tested both these interactions with kids at a nearby school, and selected the one which seemed easier. For the whole semester, we repeated the same process, worked in the development cycle of 2-3 weeks, and then tested our new features with the kids. This was extremely beneficial as it helped us gauge the improvements needed in the game really fast, and also to test the success of the new features we added in every cycle. By the end stages of development cycle, we saw a marked improvement in how much the kids enjoyed the game, which was a good indicator of our success.

The game was entirely developed in a Javascript based game engine called ImpactJS. Our client DARPA required that the game should have maximum accessibility to kids, so it should run in web browsers without any plugin. Thus, choosing an HTML5 and Javascript based game engine was the way to go. We also found out the limitations of HTML5 as a platform: it's not quite there yet as the much hailed web technology that works everywhere, but that discussion is for another day.  

We also wrote a research paper about the game that got accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Computer Games, 2013. 

You can check out videos about the project (in the media gallery on the project website), and also further information about the project in detail.

Any feedback would be really welcome!
