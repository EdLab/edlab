<strong>Author: </strong>Bronwen E. Low<strong></strong>

<strong>Publisher: </strong>Stanford University Press

<strong>Call Number: </strong><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/c?SEARCH=LB1631+.L69+2011&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit#">LB1631 .L69 2011</a>

<strong><a href="http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=17511">From the Publisher</a>: </strong>Mainstream rap's seductive blend of sexuality,  violence, and bravado hardly seems the stuff of school curricula. And  chances are good that the progressive and revolutionary "underground"  hip-hop of artists such as The Roots or Mos Def is not on the playlists  of most high-school students. That said, hip-hop culture remains a  profound influence on contemporary urban youth culture and a growing  number of teachers are developing strategies for integrating it into  their classrooms. While most of these are hip-hop generation members who  cannot imagine leaving the culture at the door, this book tells the  story of a white teacher who stepped outside his comfort zone into the  rich and messy realm of student popular investments and abilities.

<em>Slam School</em> takes the reader into the heart of a poetry course in an urban high  school to make the case for critical hip-hop pedagogies. Pairing rap  music with its less controversial cousins, spoken word and slam poetry,  this course honored and extended student interests. It also confronted  the barriers of race, class, gender, and generation that can separate  white teachers from classrooms of predominantly black and Latino  students and students from each other.

Bronwen Low builds a  surprising argument: the very reasons teachers might resist the  introduction of hip-hop into the planned curriculum are what make  hip-hop so pedagogically vital. Class discussions on topics such as what  one can and cannot say in the school auditorium or who can use the  N-word raised pressing and difficult questions about language, culture  and identity. As she reveals, an innovative, student-centered pedagogy  based on spoken word curriculum that is willing to tolerate conflict, as  well as ambivalence, has the potential to air tensions and lead to new  insights and understandings for both teachers and students.
