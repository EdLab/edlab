<i>Founded in New York City in 1987 by Steve Mariotti, a former entrepreneur turned high school math teacher in the South Bronx, NFTE began as a program to prevent dropouts and improve academic performance among students who were at risk of failing or quitting school.</i> (From the NFTE site) 

<p>
<b>Real-world Learning</b><br>
Founded over 25 years ago, the <a href="http://www.nfte.com">Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE)</a> has served over 500,000 disadvantaged youth across the US and abroad through a unique blend of private sector entrepreneurship training and a public education context.  NFTE was created by <a href="http://www.nfte.com/who/founder">Steve Mariotti</a>, "a former entrepreneur turned math teacher in the South Bronx," to help ameliorate the rising secondary-level dropout rate and boost academic performance for at-risk learners.  Playing on both his private sector professional experience and belief that "street smarts" translate naturally into business acumen, Mariotti pioneered one of the few programs to tie classroom learning to economics and entrepreneurship concepts found in the real-world.  Through <a href="http://www.nfte.com/what/partners">domestic and international partnerships</a>, <a href="http://www.nfte.com/what/classroom-programs">in-class activities</a>, <a href="http://www.nfte.com/what/bizcamps"> intensive "camps"</a> and <a href="http://www.nfte.com/what/national-challenge">competitions</a>, the program offers a comprehensive immersion into the world of entrepreneurship and an introduction to 21st century business practices usually found only in higher education institutions. 

<p>
<b>The Stage is set for Entrepreneurship</b><br>
NFTE offers <a href="http://innovation.nfte.com/">global competitions,</a> that allow young people to be a part of the global entrepreneurship community and further the idea that what you learn in school has the potential to directly impact a global community.  It is this international focus that is perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of the NFTE program.  Not only are young people learning to make connections between what they learn and how a global market behaves, but they are learning 21st century skills that have the potential to impact much more than their local community.  With curricula like, "<a href="http://www.nfte.com/resources/buy-resources#owning-your-future">Owning your Future</a>" or "Exploring Careers for the 21st Century," NFTE provides a future-focused tool-kit to equip learners for a future that values not only "the Core" subjects, but also the ability to share and develop new ideas, concepts and services geared to an interconnected digital marketplace.
