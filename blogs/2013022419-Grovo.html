<p><a href="http://www.grovo.com/welcome/5">Grovo</a> helps digital citizens master online sites such as Facebook, Dropbox, Paypal, and more. Each digital tool and online site has a course made up of lessons on specific functions. The lessons are available in video and text, both of which are created by the team at Grovo. A lesson is comprised of a video lesson (though a text version is always available) and is usually followed by a very short quiz. Users can also take a quiz to become certified in mastering an online tool. A digital certification is received upon passing a quiz, and users can download or post the certificate on their social network profiles. </p>

<p>Grovo also provides video lessons such as <i>Data Driven Investment</i>, <i>Transforming Real Estate</i>, and <i>Making a Social Enterprise Work</i>. These video lessons from experts in the relevant field are grouped in courses based on specific learning goals such as creating a blog or saving money. There is also the option to create a custom course based on user-specified learning goals.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Each course includes video lessons that cover the functionalities of an online site thoroughly and usually take no more than a minute. The courses are constantly updated with video lessons on newly released functions. This is especially valuable for online sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ that continually add and change features. The quizzes are trickier to answer correctly on Grovo than on similar sites; users may need to watch the video again and more closely to answer them. Most of the lessons on Grovo are not only free but can be shared in many different ways including by embedding a widget on your own personal site.</p> 

<p>The social element is very prominent throughout the site. Users can invite Facebook friends to sign up for Grovo, take lessons together, and assign lessons to one other. Grovo incentivizes socializing by upgrading users that inspire 30 or more new accounts to a premium account for one year, which gives them access to more advanced courses.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although there is an option for users to customize their own course, they cannot browse through other user-made courses. This would be an interesting option to add to future versions of the tool and would help to enhance the social aspects of the site.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Grovo has the potential to become an online institution for learning how to use 21st century tools. The rapidly updated courses should be a model for any site with learning content because they evolve as quickly as their subject sites. Grovoâ€™s goal driven courses and the fact that they allow users to create their own courses and define their own learning goals for each course they create are some of many forward-thinking features of the site. It is refreshing to see that the lessons for each tool are not siloed and that they can be mixed together to help users achieve their goals. Grovo is a very customizable space for information.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Grovo can help users achieve 21st century learning goals.</p>
