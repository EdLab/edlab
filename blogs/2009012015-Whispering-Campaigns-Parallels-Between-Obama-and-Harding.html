          <p>
            Many are already aware of the so-called “whispering campaign” that claimed (through supposedly state-of-the-art genealogical research) that then presidential candidate Warren G. Harding was part African-American.  While today, of all days, this allegation seems an historical anomaly, the language of refutation used by the press at the time (<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9503E6D8173AE532A25752C3A9669D946195D6CF" target="_blank">this article</a> described the assertion as a “cowardly campaign of vilification” and an “unthinkable assault on Warren G. Harding and his family”) calls to mind the controversy surrounding the use (or lack of use) of Barack Obama's middle name.  

While the <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_barack_obama_muslim.htm">e-mail campaigns</a> that “proved” Obama's secret Muslim faith inarguably appealed to the deep-rooted xenophobic fear of far too many Americans, the media's unhesitant debunking of these rumors as “false and vile” is perhaps more troubling.  Don't get me wrong — it's important to clarify facts and expose deliberate mendacity.  Still, the majority of our country seems far too comfortable conceptualizing a major world religion as dangerous, deceptive, and damaging — and interpreting, as did Senator McCain — the use of “Hussein” as “disparaging.”  Along these lines, this <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1718255,00.html?referer=sphere_related_content">
Time</a> article makes some salient points. 
 
On this monumental inauguration day, as we celebrate the great steps forward our country has taken, it is important that we examine the parallel “assaults” on Harding and Obama, and that we consider the necessary change that still lies ahead.  Ironically, we might do well to take a page out of Harding's book.  Unlike the Obama team, which by necessity dedicated a <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/factcheck/2007/11/12/obama_has_never_been_a_muslim_1.php">large section of their official page</a> to fact clarification, Harding, when confronted with rumors of his mixed heritage, reportedly said with casual ease: "How do I know, Jim? One of my ancestors may have jumped the fence."

Not the most PC response, perhaps, but one at least free of disgust and denial . . . .
