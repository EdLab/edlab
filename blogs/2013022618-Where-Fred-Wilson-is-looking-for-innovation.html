Last night I had the opportunity to talk to Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, at a really terrific InSITE event. Fred is one of the most well-known VCs in the city, having investments that include/included Twitter, Foursquare, Zynga, SoundCloud, Delicious, and lab-favorite turntable.

He spoke to a small group of us about where he is looking for innovation in the next year. He mentioned two main areas:
<ul>
<li>Gadgets and devices that can, using cloud connectivity, compliment our existing phones, tablets, and PCs. He mentioned watches and glasses as areas of particular interest. While it's been discussed for a long time, he thinks we are finally entering an era of pervasive computing, due to the confluence of cheap processors and cloud storage. With at least one device not in sleep-mode at all times, we will be connected always and forever. 
</li>
<li>
Machine learning. Artificial intelligence has been underwhelming for the last 30 years despite lofty promises, but he thinks that once again, the amalgam of cheap number crunching and the production of tremendous amounts of data as a natural byproduct of digital life finally mean some promises of ML will come to pass. He pointed specifically to <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/">Google Now</a> as a slightly scary example of what triangulation and machine learning can do. He talked a little bit about ML as a service as well (something his partner Albert Wenger has been writing about). 
</li>
</ul>
Afterwards, I got to chat with him a bit about EdTech and where he sees it going. He's invested in Codecademy, Edmodo, Duolingo, Skillshare, and a few other more tangential Ed startups. He thinks that the credentialing issue has to be dealt with for education to get cheaper, but it probably won't be anytime soon. His take was that the government is basically in cahoots with higher-ed organizations to keep the landscape exclusive, and until that changes, the market won't change. I guess that's part of the reason why he's focused much more informal learning/corporate training opportunities. 

We were discussing the application of machine learning in domains outside finance and marketing when he got pulled away to take a tequila shot. The conversation never recovered.
