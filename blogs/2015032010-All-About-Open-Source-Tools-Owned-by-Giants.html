          <p>
            This is just my opinion following Facebook's acquisition of <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a> and Google's of <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, two leading backend-free database-as-a-service products for front end and mobile development.

I don't know about Google's deal, but there was an interesting analytic article about Facebook's decision to acquire Parse. Facebook doesn't want to end up buying another viral mobile app like Whatsapp with that amount of money again, so buying Parse will make sure it can oversee all the mobile apps using Parse's service. This means that if it sees a promising traction in one, it can quickly strike a deal with the startup early on without having to wait until it grows into another Whatsapp.

Now, that should reflect on how we are using open source technological tools owned or sponsored by these giants. They will have a huge say in the future of the tools and the direction of the users. To give you an idea of some:

- Angular.js and Go are Google's.
- Tornado (Python's asynchronous web framework) is Facebook's.
- Swift is Apple's.

This is in contrast to some other tools like Meteor.js, which is owned by the founders but was funded (handsomely) by external investors, or Rails, which was created by 37Signals (now Basecamp), which is more of a small, hip semi consulting startup with a more truly open-source mind. When startups become giants, priorities change. For instance, a major overhaul in Angular 2.0 may have come from Google, and arguably the decision must have incorporated Google's direction toward the web.

Most of the times we won't have a choice, but it's better to know than not. Open source may not sound as free is in free speech.
