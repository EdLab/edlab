In the era of standardized testing, much attention in the education arena has been given to various pedagogical strategies and technologies that promise to increase student test scores. Fewer discussions focus on the social foundations that support effective learning and contribute to better academic performance. Social and emotional learning programs (SEL) are those that believe supportive relationships are a fundamental for meaningful learning. SEL aims to help students <a href="http://www.casel.org/social-and-emotional-learning">understand and manage their emotions, be caring and have empathy for others, establish positive relationships, and make responsible daily decisions</a>. <p>

For kids from under-resourced communities, SEL programs are crucial for providing a safe and supportive learning space and equipping students with important social skills that could help distance them from school and community problems such as violence, bullying and dropping out. They also create constructive solutions to conflicts students face throughout their days. <p>

As one <a href="http://www.wingsforkids.org/wings/">SEL program</a> alumnus explains in the video above, it "opened up my eyes to who I was as an individual and it allowed me to establish my creative ideas." She also learned that "it's ok to dream as long as you have people that have faith in you and want to see you succeed."<p>

<b>@00:40 Wang: </b> It turns out the shy girl isn't that introvert at all — it is just that she hasn't found a comfortable space for her true self. WINGS and SEL help her find her voice! <p>

<b>@01:53 Carla: </b> While not normally listed as 21st century skills, social awareness and emotional intelligence are incredibly important for kids to learn. <p>

<b>@02:28 Carla: </b> I’m so curious about the type of projects and activities WINGS implements to encourage students to grow out of their shells and communicate with each other! <p>
