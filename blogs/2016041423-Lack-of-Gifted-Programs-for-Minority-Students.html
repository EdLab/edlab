          <p>
            Talent often goes undiscovered in impoverished and unrepresented communities. This is proving the case when it comes to gifted education. There is a large amount of African-American and Hispanic students in public schools, but few are considered gifted when compared to the White and Asian peers. 

The disparity is quite startling. Black third graders <a href="http://www.aera.net/Newsroom/NewsReleasesandStatements/DiscretionandDisproportionalityExplainingtheUnderrepresentationofHigh-AchievingStudentsofColorinGiftedPrograms/tabid/16171/Default.aspx" target = "blank">are half as likely as Whites</a> to be included in programs for the gifted, and the deficit is nearly as large for Hispanics, according to Vanderbilt researchers Jason Grissom and Christopher Redding. New <a href="http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/universal-screening-NBER21519.pdf" target = "blank">evidence</a> suggests that schools play a major role in African-American and Hispanic students realizing their untapped potential.  

What happens when a large school district alters the way it screens students? The number of African-American and Hispanic children identified as gifted doubled in <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/upshot/why-talented-black-and-hispanic-students-can-go-undiscovered.html?_r=1&referer=http://m.facebook.com" target = "blank">Miamiâ€™s Broward County</a>. This happened because they altered the way they screened children. Broward County has one of the most diverse student populations in the country. In 2005, "in an effort to reduce that disparity, Broward County introduced a universal screening program, requiring that all second graders take a short nonverbal test, with high scorers referred for I.Q". The implementation of the new policy increased the number of gifted Hispanic students. 

This policy exposes the flaws of public schools. The question of why the new screening system found so many more gifted children, especially among African-Americans and Hispanics still remains. Researchers have found that "teachers and parents were less likely to refer high-ability blacks and Hispanics, as well as children learning English as a second language, for I.Q. testing". This could be due of the lack of communication that leads to racial and ethnic disparities. I believe education institutions should emulate this policy to further discover talent within the African-American and Hispanic communities.
