Do you love books about art?  Me, too!  The Staff Picks theme for the mid-November and December display is All About Art curated by artist and TC Librarian April Siqueiros.  This collection includes books about artists, art history, art appreciation, art making, and even one that intersects art and science.  Looking for more books about art?  Browse the N section (that's Library of Congress' classification for Fine Arts) in the stacks, curriculum, and juvenile sections of the library.
