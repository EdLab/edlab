<p><a href="https://www.icandiapps.com/icandiapps/night-sky-4/">Night Sky</a> is a free AR guide to the constellations and planets above us. You can learn about current space missions, participate in night sky and moon tours, and learn to identify constellations and satellites from your current location. With a $1.99 a month or $9.99 annual premium membership, you can also explore and manipulate an AR model of the solar system, landing on and learning about planets up close and personally.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>What makes Night Sky stand out from the other digital star guides and AR constellation maps is that this app packs in so much more than simply constellation identification and illustration. Since the first month is free, I decided to opt for the premium subscription. Not only does this version map out and provide detailed descriptions of stars, planets, satellites, and constellations above you, it offers star tours as you pan your phone across the sky. You can also take moon tours that guide you through recreations of the Apollo 11 and 15 lunar landing sites.</p>

<p> Night Sky keeps you updated on what will be visible each night in your location, stargazing conditions, and what upcoming nights will have the best visibility. Beyond exploring the night sky in your own area, you can opt to view the sky in any other location on earth, or zoom in and out of our solar system and land on different planets to view the surrounding night sky anywhere from Neptune to the moons of Jupiter.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>For all of the time and care that has clearly gone into making Night Sky a quality resource, it was a disappointment to me that the star and moon tours were conducted through an automated voice system. Having a real narrator’s voice read the script would have made the experience more authentic and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Another disappointing feature was that while the moon tours provide significant commentary, the star tour audio does little more than help users locate constellations and planets. While extensive information can be read about all interstellar objects, it would have been nice to include that information in the narration.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While there’s no harm in the free app, the premium subscription is really what makes Night Sky both a fascinating exploration and a useful learning tool. For any aspiring astronomers, this is a must buy.</p>
