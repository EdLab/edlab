<p>Turning hacking into a spectator sport has finally happened, and with a multi million dollar prize pool, the stakes are high. DARPA, a U.S. government defense agency, led the charge by collaborating with gaming companies to display artificial intelligence battles on the big screen during their Cyber Grand Challenge. They even had broadcasters to comment on <i>plays</i>, keeping the audience engaged.</p>
 
<p>The event took place in August and pitted seven autonomous hacking bots against seven super computers. The graphics created by the gaming company, Void Alpha, displayed the battle in real time, and allowed the audience to visualize what was happening inside the computers the moment programs were hacked. Until the event, "we havenâ€™t seen any real representations of the logic and memory of computers when they are being attacked and when they are being defended," says Mike Walker, a DARPA Program manager.</p>
 
<p>Taking hacking out of the abstract promises to produce a heightened awareness of the digital realm. It also serves as a model for using computer programming design challenges as learning opportunities, and it creates some serious questions surrounding the ethics of hacking. As a computer programmer or technology enthusiast, what do you take away from this event? Join the discussion<a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/31503/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@01:28 AimeeLee: </b> If it's framed as a "design challenge," of course hacking seems like a good learning opportunity. But are there ethical dilemmas in teaching people how to hack? Are we also teaching people about rights to privacy?</p>
 
<p><b>@02:16 saraehardman:</b> If people learn how hacking works and experiment with it, that could lead to more secure networks at an individual and societal level.</p>
