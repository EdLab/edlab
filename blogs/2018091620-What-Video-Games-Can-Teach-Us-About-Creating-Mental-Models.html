<p>The great feats of the human imagination are typically considered to be iconic creative pursuits, from <i>Harry Potter</i> to the Eiffel Tower, yet imagination's greatest value is perhaps how it helps us function on a daily basis. Imagination helps us to create mental models, or mapped-out thought processes that let us repeat, navigate, and generally remember what we’ve learned. Mental models also help us predict how systems will react, such as knowing that pressing on the accelerator of a car will speed up the vehicle. But how does an individual’s level of expertise with a given system or task affect how our brains build these models?</p>
 
<p>In an attempt to answer this question, researchers at the University of North Carolina recruited 158 participants with varying levels of experience and observed them playing the video game <i>League of Legends</i>. Video games are good for studying mental model theory because they require players to learn and remember facts as well as performative skills. Additionally, those playing video games transfer mental models from one game to another.</p> 

<p>The researchers organized participants into three groups based on level of experience: low (1–100 hours of the game played), medium (101–1,000 hours played), and high (1,001+ hours played). Participants completed in-depth surveys on their experiences while playing the game, with a particular focus on how participants found key game concepts related.</p>

<p>The researchers created visual networks with the survey results to highlight the connections among key game concepts participants noted, then compared the networks based on participants’ level of experience. They discovered that while novice players made connections mostly between natural language concepts (the way words are used in everyday conversation) to understand the game, those with medium experience displayed more procedural connections related to performing certain actions and accomplishing goals in the game. Experts also made procedural connections, but they made abstract connections as well, relying on theoretical links and creating subnetworks of interconnected concepts.</p> 

<p>In showing how participants of different experience levels learn and create mental models, the researchers hope their work can be used to design, assess, and improve the effectiveness of a variety of training programs. From game design to driving a car, learning a skill can be more effective if the training syncs up with how your brain processes the activity. If training parallels mental models, it might just make learning a new skill that much easier.</p>
