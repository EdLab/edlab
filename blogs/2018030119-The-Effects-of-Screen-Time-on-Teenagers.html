<p>Screen usage has been heavily researched for its connections to various health outcomes, some <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4663/screen-time-and-unhealthy-behaviors-in-chinese-adolescents"> negative</a> and others <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/2565>positive</a>. Because half of all mental health disorders develop  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/a-heavy-burden-on-young-minds-the-global-burden-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders-in-children-and-youth/2086CED8DE6F40969CB026095041C8E2>before the age of 14</a>, it is important to explore the relationship between the growing role of this technology in adolescent development. Accordingly, researchers from the University of Newcastle in Australia launched a six month investigation into how changes in screen time habits can impact early teen mental health.</p>

<p>The sample contained 322 seventh graders from Catholic secondary schools, who had all recently transitioned from primary school, in New South Wales, Australia. Students were evaluated on various mental and physical health indicators, including weight, BMI, and self-assessment of appearance, along with screen usage habits. The teens were tested twice, once in the first half of 2014 and again in the latter half of the year. The team then compared the results.</p>

<p>Running multilevel linear regression, the researchers found a range of negative associations between screen time and mental health. Changes in recreational usage of phones or tablets was associated with negative physical self-assessments. For psychological well-being, they found that both total recreational screen usage and computer usage were negatively associated with this indicator. Additionally, increased television viewing brought with it more psychological difficulties, including stress and loneliness.</p> 

<p>Despite these negative findings, the researchers warned that there were no clear trends across devices. Additionally, for non-recreational screen time, such as using a computer for homework, the researchers found no association with the tested health indicators. </p> 

<p>The researchers believe that interactions on social media play a considerable role in the declining mental health of adolescents. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat place unrealistic expectations on self-image and allow for bullying to follow students anywhere. The team concluded that continual studies are needed for this intersection of technology and teenage development.</p>
