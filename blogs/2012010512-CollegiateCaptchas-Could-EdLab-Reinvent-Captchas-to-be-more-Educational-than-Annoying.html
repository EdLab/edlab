<b>Could EdLab reinvent the Captcha?  Please add your thoughts to these questions and ideas... together we could potentially reinvent this annoyance!</b>

<b>The backstory...</b>
While I was traveling home from the holiday break, I grabbed the most recent issue of <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> and discovered <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/new-ways-to-captcha-bots-12152011.html">this article</a> on start-ups dedicated to making these often annoying security measures more fun.  As I was reading I kept things... "What is the potential for education?" and "What would be the EdLab take on the Captcha?"  

<b>What is the history of Captchas?</b> 
Captchas were developed in 2000 to help stop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">"malware"</a> by Luis Von Ahn, a Carnegie Mellon CS professor.  Ahn founded ReCaptcha which still accounts for half of the captchas generated & solved in the world each day and was sold to Google in 2009.  In addition to ReCaptcha, Solve Media and <a href="http://areyouahuman.com/">Are You a Human?</a> (one of the best co. names of all time) are explored in the aforementioned article.  Captchas and other security measures will only grow in importance as the malware and bots created by hackers grow and evolve in sophistication & sneakiness.  

<b>How do we use Captchas at EdLab?</b>
Here at EdLab we only employ captchas for the "Export to Email" function for a logged-in user's starred "favorites" <a href="http://pundit.tc.columbia.edu/">Pundit</a>.  Are there any additional tools that make use of these bot-blocks? I believe you need to enter a captcha for TCR subscriptions?  Where and why could we use them in additional tools?  What are the benefits and balance of user benefit/frustration?   

<b>What would an educational captcha look/function like?</b>  
Many of the startups mentioned in the Bloomberg article linked above are focused on revenue from creating captcha-based games that are really glorified in app ad campaigns.  I wonder if there is an opportunity to create instead, captchas that can offer entertainment, a chunk of wisdom AND security to a site?  These captchas could be fun for students to engage with and tailored to each school's site or organization.  How could these opportunities be executed?  Instead of a drag & drop game... could the captcha answer utilize AI (like this) to detect a typed-in or spoken human guess?  How could we test this?  Would a hacker's AI tech be able to easily beat this?  What distinguishes a human answer?  

<b>The big questions... for Team EdLab</b>
Could the EdLab create a new captcha generator that utilizes unique AI, promotes an institution, site or organization's goals and most of all provides protection from prying perps?  Would this new product be game-based, employ unique research into how people learn and engage with text and be inclusive to multiple learning styles and abilities?  What is the benefit for the lab?
