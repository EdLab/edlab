Discovery is brewing at Stanford’s <a href="http://vhil.stanford.edu/">Virtual Human Interaction Lab</a>. The mission of the lab is to understand the implications of the time we spend interacting with virtual reality (VR). One of its latest projects looks at the digital footprints left behind during VR experiences and uses them to predict identities, actions, and even future behaviors. This is done by quantifying facial expressions and body movements with cameras and the Kinect. <p>

What can our body movements tell us of learning? To find out, researchers from the lab brought in two participants: one teacher and one student. The participants then engaged in a creative, collaborative task. Watching their nonverbal movements, the researchers were able to measure how much the student learned and how well the teacher taught the student. Let’s play that back: <i>Watching their nonverbal movements!</i> They were even able to predict aspects of the student’s performance based on the way they were moving their bodies. <p>

If this breakthrough is any indication of what’s to come, online educators should take note. Having access to information that tells you if a student is learning could help shorten the distance felt by many online learners.  Then again, having your every movement watched and defined could feel like quite the violation of privacy! <p>

What’s your opinion of quantified body movements in the context of education and work? Add your thoughts to the ongoing discussion on Vialogues. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:39 MartinPaper:</b> Sounds like the lab was at the forefront of exploring the effects of virtual spaces on identity. What was the state of virtual spaces 9 years ago [when the lab was founded]? Was Second Life even around?<p>

<b>@02:47 YogiP:</b> The applications of VR are really expansive. Here we see used to detect learning (which is incredible in its own right), but I've also heard of it being used to teach empathy. I wonder if this lab has done any work in that realm.
