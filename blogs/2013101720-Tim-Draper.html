<a href="http://www.dfj.com/team/teamdetail.php?TimDraper-10149">Tim Draper</a> has been many things: viral marketing pioneer, venture capitalist, author and now "hero trainer."  Draper is the founder of groundbreaking entrepreneurship training program, <a href="http://draperuniversity.com/">Draper University of Heroes</a>.  Additionally, Draper was voted number fifty-two on a list of the one-hundred most influential Harvard Alumni, and number seven on the Forbes Midas List.  Draper provided initial funding for Hotmail, Skype and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu">Baidu</a> and is the Founder and Managing Director of the <a href="http://www.dfj.com/">Draper Fisher Jurvetson venture capital fund</a> and creator of the first international network for early-stage venture capital, <a href="http://www.dfj.com/team/peopleNetwork.php">DFJ Global network</a> (offices in over thirty cities worldwide).  Draper is also the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Game-Partnership-Capitalists-Entrepreneurs/dp/023010486X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281436681&sr=1-4">"The Startup Game: Inside the Partnership between Venture Capitalists and Entrepreneurs."</a> and is affectionately known in Silicon Valley and beyond, as "<a href="http://theriskmaster.blogspot.com/">The Riskmaster</a>."  Draper holds a BS in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and an MBA From Harvard Business School.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I had a great education: Andover, Stanford electrical engineering, Harvard Business School. But something was missing.  They were great at teaching reading and listening, but none of these schools taught "doing" and "surviving" and "failing." The "A" grade meant you didnâ€™t make any mistakes, but really I learned a lot more if I was allowed to make some mistakes.  So, I started <a href="http://draperuniversity.com/">Draper University of Heroes</a> to allow students to try new things and fail at them until they realized that success is more typically reached when failure is an acceptable outcome.




<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> My current work includes Venture Capital and starting a new school for entrepreneurs (heroes). I think my network is the most valuable thing I have achieved.  It has allowed me to bring in some amazing people who can teach about how they lived their amazing lives.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I believe that several of my techniques will change the learning landscape.<br>

<b>1)</b>  Ability to allow failure.<br>
<b>2)</b>  Team orientation. Grades based on team success and failure. Points for spectacular failure and for great success.<br>
<b>3)</b>  First hand knowledge. My speakers are people who do what they are teaching for a living.<br>
<b>4)</b>  Immersive. The students bond so that they learn as much from each other as from speakers.<br>
<b>5)</b>  Survival training. The students learn "downside" and what they are capable of, and how they have very few limits.<br>
<b>6)</b>  Public speaking. Students get in front of the class over and over again.  Comfort in front of a group or a camera helps people succeed. <br>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> The internet. I think video will get better and better and the great teachers will rise to the top.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am working on Draper University of Heroes and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DraperHeroCity">Hero City</a>, the incubator that runs alongside the school. We are also doing a <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130710005992/en/Draper-University-Launches-Online-School-Aspiring-Entrepreneurs">Draper University online school</a>.
