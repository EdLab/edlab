<p>Karim Abouelnaga is the Founder and CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1WQ3thV">Practice Makes Perfect</a>, an intergenerational program that matches struggling elementary and middle school students with high-achieving middle and high school students—with the supervision of college interns and expert teachers—for an intensive academic summer program. Karim experienced the struggle to succeed in under-resourced urban public schools, though he was lucky enough to benefit from nonprofits that provided him with great mentors. After he received over $300,000 in scholarships for his college education, he is now working to make the college education experience he received possible for other economically disadvantaged children. To date, Practice Makes Perfect has worked with over 500 students in New York City and DC, and has plans for expanding to other neighborhoods across the United States. Karim is a <a href="https://www.globalshapers.org/">Global Shaper</a>, an <a href="http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellowship">Echoing Green Fellow</a>, and part of Forbes' 30 under 30 in Education. He graduated in 2013 from Cornell University with a degree in Hotel Administration. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b></p>
<p>I was a product of some of NYC's most struggling public schools. It wasn't until I attended college and studied the achievement gap that I learned about the inequities that plagued the educational experience my friends and I had. The insight I gleaned from the research and the reflection on my personal experience compelled me to act and come up with a solution that would improve our public education system. I was fortunate enough to attend and graduate from Cornell University. The elite education I was afforded provided me with the context and the wherewithal I needed to execute my vision of redesigning summer school. More importantly, my education provided me with the knowledge I needed to bridge the gaps in our education reform system between the educated elite who drive policy and the working poor that are impacted by that policy. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people teach and learn?</b></p>
<p>I'm hoping Practice Makes Perfect's work will continue to shift educational paradigms. We're pushing the bounds of what effective mentorship looks like and the impact it can have. We have re-imagined what an enriching learning experience could look like over the summer for children who have to be in school and need remedial support. We have redefined individual perceptions on the amount of resources that exist in the forms of human capital in some of our poorest neighborhoods. My hope is that we will continue to push the boundaries around what people believe others are capable of, regardless of their race or socioeconomic class. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b></p>
<p>I am a bit biased, but I believe we are reaching a tipping point in educational progress—if we don't reform our summer school efforts, we will continue to compromise students' educational prospects. The way technology is integrated into the learning process and the role of the teacher will have a huge impact on learning. It is also safe to say that curriculum and assessments, the way they are taught and administered, will have an impact on learning as well. The field still needs to innovate in those areas. We are also starting to see an organized effort, which is starting to take shape in cities like NYC, toward getting waivers for new language learners and children with special education needs. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b></p>
<p>We recently announced a commitment <a href="http://bit.ly/1EhrJDO">to raise $5 million</a> to build the infrastructure to take our organization nationally. Practice Makes Perfect is an evidence-based, full-service summer school provider for K-8 schools. We have a unique near-peer learning model that has the potential to eliminate the summer learning loss and solve our nation's summer school crisis.  </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b></p>
<p>I'm on Twitter (<a href="http://bit.ly/1KnqGof">@KarimAbouelnaga</a>), and you can follow my organization's work at <a href="http://bit.ly/1Unj6t6">@PMPUSA</a>. I would also recommend that you feature <a href="http://bit.ly/1LNMDgs">@Kinvolved</a>, a parent engagement tech tool that we use in our programs. </p>
