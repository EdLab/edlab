<p>Sculptures always tell a story, but thanks to technology, a piece of art in Dublin, California is able to do so with the voices of its story's main characters. A 150-foot-long bronze sculpture in this city pays homage to a spring that was responsible for sustaining the Native American tribe indigenous to Dublin as well as the settlers who established Dublin. The sculpture also pays homage to language; it is embedded with the harmonic pattern of voices across generations speaking the local Native American language lost and then rediscovered through a series of 1910 audio recordings.</p>

<p>This piece of art uniquely combines old technology (audio recordings) with new technology (each piece was created using 3D printing) to produce a sculpture that invites interaction and kinesthetic learning. Beyond bringing together old and new innovative techniques, the piece encourages awareness of Native American history in Dublin and teaches the importance of both language and nature in shaping identity.</p>

<p>How are technology and art becoming more intertwined, and what are the effects of this on both fields? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48255">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:14 Anna Curry:</b> Art is about creative expression of ideas and digital technology has created new tools and mediums to express those ideas. The interaction will change both fields in some way. Whether it's for better or worse probably depends on your perspective. I think that this use is incredibly interesting and beautiful.</p>

<p><b>@02:56 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> Technology and language are intensely intertwined. This story makes me think of how the <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48734">Icelandic government is working</a> to preserve their native language by adding words that signify technological terms. Technology might be able to save a language, but languages also need to incorporate technological terminology in order to remain relevant.</p>
