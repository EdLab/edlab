<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="http://tes.sagepub.com/content/36/4/286.abstract ">The Effects of E-Mentoring on Beginning Teacher Competencies and Perceptions</a> (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica H. Hunt, Selma Powell, Mary E. Little, & Alyson Mike</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Teacher Education and Special Education: The Journal of the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children</p>
<p><b>Research Question:</b>  Can e-mentoring help novice teachers succeed?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The researchers sought to understand whether teachers felt better prepared when they participated in e-mentoring. They administered surveys and conducted focus groups with 22 public and private school special education teachers who were in their first three years of teaching and volunteered for the study..</p>

<p>The e-mentoring program consisted of inquiries, dilemmas, and exceptionality discussions. Inquiries involved the mentor and mentee asking and answering questions to improve practice. Dilemmas were scenarios posed to improve problem solving. Exceptionality discussions were online experiences to help teachers gain greater understanding about disability categories at different age levels.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Teachers who participated in e-mentoring felt better prepared. Learning in a virtual community, as opposed to face-to-face, was not a deterrent, and teachers enjoyed connecting with other special education teachers.  The authors did note that despite the positive improvements, e-mentoring had no effect on teacher knowledge; their understanding of the facts related to being a special education teacher did not increase significantly. The authors concluded that teacher knowledge comes with time and experience and with carefully curated information to meet the needs of each teacher. </p>

<p>Teachers in the study suggested ways to improve e-mentoring, for example, by organizing e-cohorts of teachers working with similar types and age groups of students. The authors concluded that to make e-mentoring more effective it needs to be further tailored to the school, teacher, and the specific needs of the students. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> While the study focuses on the effects of e-mentoring for special education teachers, this type of support could have a positive impact on all beginning teachers. The authors particularly cite the difficulty in translating theoretical concepts learned in pre-service preparation to the classroom. Further research could investigate more streamlined ways to provide new teachers not only with guidance, but also with knowledge and practical support.</p>
