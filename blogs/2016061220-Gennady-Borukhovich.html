<p>Gennady Borukhovich is the founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of <a href="http://bit.ly/1PnFDJN">FarFaria</a>, a children's storybook web and mobile app. He previously served in technology leadership positions at McGraw Hill, Disney, and Lockheed Martin. He was also the organizer of the New York Extreme Programming & Agile Meetup. Borukhovich holds a bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rutgers University. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>I’ve been a slow reader my entire life. I often have to re-read the same passage many times and become distracted easily. On the flip side, I always did well in Math and Science. I sometimes struggled in those subjects as some concepts required reading the text to grasp. As a result, FarFaria is so important to me because it allows me to help children avoid some of the struggles I had growing up. With FarFaria, children are reading five times the national average; that is tremendous! More reading equals better reading.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Netflix and Spotify have changed video and audio consumption, allowing us an easy way to binge watch/listen to content. FarFaria will change children’s book consumption. Children binge reading is great for their learning and creativity. It is much better than binge watching Netflix. With FarFaria, when a family subscribes, they gain unfettered access to our entire library of over 1000 books. Children don’t have to ask their parents to make a buy decision when they want to read a new book. They can choose to read the same favorite book 1000 times or read 1000 different books. They can build their own creativity by traveling from genre to genre with no limitations. I hope that more educational material becomes this easy to access. In a world where boundaries are broken down by the internet everyday, I believe this model has a significant place in the future.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Our society has never had access to so much information so quickly and easily. In the recent past, most information was accessed through search (Google) or feeds (Facebook/Twitter). The problem is that not all information is created equal. We need to find immersive ways to present and interact with different types of information. I am excited about Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (AR) as they have incredibly useful sets of applications from gaming to learning how to operate on a patient. I am slightly more excited about AR because it allows us to overlay structured information onto the real world. Imagine a field trip to the site of a Revolutionary War battle. A student can pick up their smartphone, point it to a field and watch a recreation of a battle take place. Or imagine an electrical engineering student working on a special circuit board. They can point a phone’s camera to it to see voltage and current levels at each node or connection. All this information is available today, we just can’t interact with it in ways that are more immersive yet.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I’m currently focused on getting FarFaria into the hands of more children. We’ve proven that FarFaria can make a massive impact on a child’s life by improving their reading capability and knowledge. We want to positively impact as many children around the world as we can.</p>
