<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/debryc/">Deborah Chang</a> is an educator and an entrepreneur. Her ambition is to help people work with purpose—at the nexus of what they love, what they're good at, what the world needs, and what will be financially sustainable. She does this by taking down systemic barriers to education innovation. Her current projects include: Co-Founder, Nexus Works · Community Organizer, <a href="http://www.nycedu.us/">#NYCEDU</a>· Community Leader, Startup Weekend Education NYC · Education Curator, and <a href="https://www.startupdigest.com/digests/education">Startup Digest</a>. </p>
 
<p><b>You write a great series called "Tales of a Serial Entrepreneur." How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience lead to and shape this identity? </b><br>
I am an educator first and an entrepreneur second. My role as an entrepreneur just happens to be where I’m most effective in positively impacting education. </p>

<p>I did not create my identity. Instead, I uncovered it by constantly taking on new challenges, reflecting on my experiences, and refining my core beliefs. Both positive experiences, like leading a team at Startup Weekend Education, and difficult experiences, like being fired from my first job out of teaching, pointed me to education entrepreneurship as the field in which I would be working with purpose—at the nexus of what I love, what I’m good at, what the world needs, and what’s financially sustainable. </p>
 
<p><b>What are you most excited about right now with #NYCEDU and Nexus Works? What might be next for you?</b><br>
At Nexus Works, we are laser focused on taking down systemic barriers to education innovation. What I’m most excited about is the fact that we work only with people who (1) love teachers and students, (2) have a truly transformative vision of the future of education, and (3) are eager to iterate based on feedback. This means that we’re always working with a community of people who are passionate about education, on the bleeding edge of innovation, and hungry to learn. </p>

<p>#NYCEDU is a project that takes down systemic barriers to education innovation by building bridges between different stakeholders in New York City education. Our vision for #NYCEDU is of people coming together for collective impact, New York City as the education capital of the world. </p>
 
<p><b>Can you briefly explain what you identify as systemic barriers to innovation in education, and what your theory of change is for breaking them down? </b><br>
We know that students are different: they all learn in their own way at their own pace and have their own unique values, personalities, and goals in life. Yet, this type of learning is not available to the vast majority of students in the United States. Why? The answers to that question are the systemic barriers to education innovation. </p>

<p>Current barriers we are actively tackling include:
<ul>
<li>Racism and sexism,</li>
<li>High-stakes end of the year testing, and </li>
<li>Lack of trust between different education stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<p>Our theory of change at Nexus Works is that we can only take down these systemic barriers by building products and services with scalable impact. Scalable impact comes from technology, policy change, and community building. We need all three in order to make lasting change. To see how we’re doing this, please follow me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/debryc/">LinkedIn</a> and sign up for the <a href="http://bit.ly/nycedunews">#NYCEDU newsletter</a>. </p>
 
<p><b>What advice would you give someone hoping to enter the ed tech/innovation space?</b><br>
<p>Enter the space because you love the problem, not the solution. Love your users—educators, parents, students, school and district leaders, learners. Look for uncommon wisdom. There is something to be learned from everyone.</p>
 
</p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter? Who are three people you recommend we feature in New Learning Times?</b><br>
<p>I recommend the following:</p>

<p><ul><li>Daniel Scibienski (<a href="https://twitter.com/danielscib">@danielscib</a>) is one of the most thoughtful innovators, educators, and community organizers I know. He’s been instrumental in organizing #EdCampNJ, for example, and has been a strong partner of work at #NYCEDU.</li>
<li>Preeti Birla has coached over one hundred early stage education startups over her tenure as Director of Community, Outreach, and Partnerships at Innovate NYC Schools (<a href="https://twitter.com/innovatenycedu">@innovatenycedu</a>) and has launched several high profile events that have become blueprints for best-in-class ways for entrepreneurs to hear directly from educators in order to build products that truly meet educator needs. Take a look at #SharkTankEDU to see just a snapshot of her work.</li>
<li>Gordon Smith is the founder of Codesters (<a href="https://twitter.com/icodeinschool">@icodeinschool)</a>), an engaging way to teach and learn computer programming that’s project-based, integrated into the curriculum, and leverages current classroom teachers as the key to providing computer science education for all students.</li>
</ul>
