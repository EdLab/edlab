            The New York City Public Schools contain a robust and varied <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/community/facilities/PublicArt/default.htm">art collection</a> grown from decades of development with the sensibilities of students in mind. Attention has classically been paid to the aesthetics of public schools beginning with the early Superintendents of School Buildings, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Naughton">James W. Naughton</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._B._J._Snyder">C. B. J. Snyder</a>. 

<a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/community/facilities/PublicArt/Architecture/19thCentury/FormerBoysHS.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/th_FormerBoysHighSchoolGeneral1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" align="left" hspace="5"></a> Naughton and Snyder are responsible for much of the lovely architecture and design in the older NYC school buildings. In an <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/graphics/audio/paps/Interview_with_Leanord_Lopate.mp3">interview</a> with Leonard Lopate on WNYC, Michelle Cohen, the founding director of Public Art for Public Schools, states that school art was originally produced and maintained for “the school as a civic monument and community center.” Unfortunately, new demands for space and budget concerns led to the neglect and removal of several pieces until a council was created in 1982 around school art preservation and curation. 1982 also saw the creation of <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcla/html/panyc/panyc.shtml">Percent for Art</a>, a law that allocates 1% of new building construction funds towards publicly accessible art. 

The latest piece in Lindsey Christ's <a href="http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/143850/the-classroom-collection--part-4--restorations-revive-interest-in-schools--neglected-artworks">Classroom Collection</a> series on NY1 covers the continuing efforts to identify and preserve the art in these public schools, including a 15-year restoration project of a mural depicting the history of the textile industry. I appreciate both art and historical conservation. I know we need to model stewardship for our young people, but I'm not sure about allocating resources towards a project of this size. Chime in! Is public art in schools curriculum cake or delicious aesthetic frosting?
