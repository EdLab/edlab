          <p>
            Are mobile technologies something to be despised in classrooms or should they be welcomed with open arms? Regardless of the opinions many may have of these tools, the fact remains that many professors frown at the sight of them in their classrooms. They are seen as distractions that only hinder a student's progress in education.<a href="http://thejournal.com/Articles/2013/03/04/Communicating.aspx?Page=1"> Norris and Soloway's article</a> argues otherwise. The impact that mobile techs such as iPhones and Androids have on students can be very beneficial. With a mobile device, a student can take control of their own learning. These devices provide students with immediate access to the internet, where they can get a deeper understanding of what they are learning and allows them to be able to collaborate and work together and share ideas. 

For instance, as a student, there have been many instances when I have no idea what my professor is talking about. This is mainly because of my unfamiliarity with some of the words they are using, among other things and I often resort to my dictionary app on my iPhone to look up what he is saying. Mobile devices have come to my rescue many times in class and professors should be persuaded to allow it in class as it may be beneficial to other students as well. When it is utilized properly, they can be a very helpful tool in a student's academic development.
