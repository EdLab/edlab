            One measure of sustainable development for countries is on how each country plan, build and mange their cities. The City We Need is a document by the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47274&Cr=climate+change&Cr1=#.Uxa_P2JdW68">UN Human Settlements Programme</a> and which provides a foundation of how a city in the 21st century should look. The document tackles various problems such as climate and affordable housing by outlining the vision of a city for the 21st century. Moreover, the document also aims to draw attention to major global development challenges such as climate change and poverty. To address these issues, there needs to be a rethinking on what urbanization is by shifting from old principles to new ones. According to the document, 80% of the world's economical growth and wealth is generated in urban centers. This means that a more socially inclusive city, that is more efficient, better organized and resilient is needed to care for a growing population.

The number of people moving into urban centers around the world is growing massively; more and more people around the world find the need to move from their small towns to find work and fortune in big cities. This mass movement usually generates big economic difficulties especially in sanitation, housing, transportation and communication. Global climate issues and employment is also a major problem in urban centers. Thus, in order to provide sustainable growth for the future, officials need to plan, build and manage a city that is efficient, organized and resilient.
