            One of the challenging issues in today’s world is educating refugees. There are numerous circumstances such as: language, religion, and culture differences that make this task difficult.  Recent reports by UNICEF illustrate that approximately 13 million children in the Middle East and North African countries are not attending school. For instance, the ongoing conflict in Syria has destroyed several school building. As a result, many children are forced to stay home. According to this <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/30/technology-smartphones-could-educate-refugees.html">piece</a> from the CNBC website, less than one third of 700,000 Syrian students who have fled to Turkey in the last four years are able to attend school. Statistically, this number is extremely low, and it shows how these refugees are struggling to obtain education in foreign countries. 

Aliim, a non-profit organization has launched a smartphone-based educational program to help solve this issue.  The organization has been able to raise $75,000 to finance this program, which will permit 250 Syrian refugees to learn through an Android smartphone.  By the way, the rapid growth of technology in today’s world is proving to be extremely important, as it is helping to solve many world problems.  There is not a definite explanation of how this program works. However, there is an app on the smartphone, which helps Aliim to track student’s progress. Additionally, this app provides mentors the ability to contact students remotely to help them with problems. So far, this program has proven to be successful. Thus, other organizations are also on track to create similar program to educate refugees across the globe.
