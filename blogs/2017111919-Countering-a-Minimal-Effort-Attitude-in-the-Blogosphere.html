<p>In a four-year study, researchers created an engaging, motivating, and learning-centered environment to counter a ‘minimal-effort’ student attitude, characterized by frequent questions from students about what exactly they needed to do, or know, in order to pass the test. They found that web-based learning triggers motivation to learn autonomously (by choice rather than self-regulation) and that public exposure and the complexity of a collaborative web-based task provides immense purpose for team effort.<p>
 
<p>Researchers used Self-Determination Theory (that autonomous motivation requires a perceived sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness) as a framework for developing a learning environment. They centered their study on an introductory cell biology course offered once a year to 35 university students in France, around 19 years old, who were preparing for advanced studies in agricultural and food sciences, biotechnology, molecular biology, cognitive sciences or the environmental sciences. The learning environment was divided in two equal parts; structured (interactive) lectures and a collaborative science writing project in the format of a blog. Students self-selected into teams of three to five and collectively chose a subject for their blog articles. Two restrictions applied to the blog: the subject had to be connected with the course material and the instructors had to be convinced that they could conveniently deal with the subject.</p>
 
<p>In an unexpected finding, students consistently expressed the importance of relatedness: the teamwork was comforting, because they could share their workload, skills and responsibilities, and empowering, because they could successfully manage the heavy cognitive load, cover more ground, and create a higher quality product.</p>
 
<p>Researchers argue the findings add a new perspective to motivation theory (to satisfy one's need to achieve), in particular the importance of the quality of team functioning, and that autonomous motivation does not come from simply putting students together, it requires the creation and maintenance of cooperative and productive teams.</p>
