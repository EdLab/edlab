          <p>
            Hello! I’m Antonia, and I'm a new Services Associate at the Teachers College.

<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2014/01/1510882_10202892543864604_1809710016_n.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-19842" style="border: 5px solid white" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2014/01/1510882_10202892543864604_1809710016_n.jpg" alt="" width="396" height="396" /></a>

<strong>Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</strong>

No, I got my MSIS at the University of Texas at Austin, with emphases in research, outreach services, and archival work.

<strong>Where’s your hometown?</strong>

Baltimore, Maryland. John Waters is my hometown hero (and soulmate).

<strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>

A writer and illustrator, and an astronomer. After I went to astronomy camp, I became totally obsessed with Carl Sagan and decided that I would carry on his legacy and discover the little green men. It could still happen.

<span style="font-weight: bold">What was your first job?</span>

Raking blueberries when I was eleven. That is back-breaking work! I only lasted two days. And I think I made about 40 cents.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>What has been your worst job?</strong>

Oh, there have been a few bad ones. Probably the worst was being a dishwasher at a phony bistro. The owner wore a clip-on rat-tail, and made fun of my (admittedly dreadful—it was the late ‘90s) highlights.

<strong>What has been your best job?</strong>

That’s hard to narrow down too, but I think it was at the Sequoyah National Research Center in Little Rock. I got to archive a collection that included thousands of pages of appeal records from the U.S. vs. Loud Hawk case. The case itself is so interesting, I recommend looking it up. It surrounds the FBI and some of the founding members of the AIM movement: Dennis Banks, Leonard Peltier, and Anna Mae Aquash. Kenneth Stern, the appeals attorney who originally provided the records, wrote a <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8061-2587-9">book</a> about it.

<strong>What do you remember about your first day of school?</strong>
<div>

One of my teachers looked like Shari Lewis.

<strong>Your favorite meal:</strong>

Pretty much any fresh seafood excepting squid and shrimp...with mashed potatoes.

<strong>Are you a morning or night person?:</strong>

<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-19837" style="color: #0000ee" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2014/01/kozy-shack-original-rice-93220-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="114" />Morning person. Like <a href="http://dailyinfographic.com/famous-writers-sleep-habits-and-literary-productivity-infographic-2">V<span style="text-decoration: underline">-Woolf</span>.</a>

</div>
<div>

<strong> </strong>

<span style="font-weight: bold">A delicious dessert:</span>

Rice pudding. I think maybe I wrote that because I’m eating it right now.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:</span>

</div>
<div>

<em>St. Elmo’s Fire</em> by Brian Eno.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2014/01/SDuEGwj1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-19844 aligncenter" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2014/01/SDuEGwj1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
...or <em>Girlfriend</em> by The Modern Lovers. I love those guys.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2014/01/Jonathan-Richman_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19845" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2014/01/Jonathan-Richman_1.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="358" /></a></p>
<span style="font-weight: bold">A country you’d like to visit:</span>

Every country! But Indonesia’s first on the list.

<strong>A book you strongly recommend?</strong>

<em>The Branch Will Not Break </em>by James Wright, and <em>Anna Karenina</em>.

<strong>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)?</strong>

I went to an Orioles-Yankees game last Fall and had a lot of fun.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>TOP THREE….</strong>

<strong> </strong><strong>Best places to read?</strong>
<ol>
	<li>On a train.</li>
	<li>In bed.</li>
	<li>Really anywhere if my cat is asleep in my lap.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Complete the Sentence</strong>

<em>The strangest thing I’ve ever done is… </em>hmm. That's tough, I've done a lot of things that might be considered strange. I recently went on an unintentional <em>Twilight</em> tour in the Pacific Northwest. Although I suppose I'm not absolutely confident about the lack of intentionality. The subconscious is a complex and mysterious creature. Not unlike...a thousand year old sparkly vampire.

<em>The most fascinating person I’ve ever met is</em>… Dame Darcy, comics extraordinaire. I’ve been a fan of her work for years. And my favorite college professor, Tricia Rose. But generally I think most people are pretty fascinating.
