          <p>
            A couple of seminars ago, I believe it was Skye who struggled to even utter the name of the "Discussion Overlay Webapp (DOW)", let alone describe what it does. This is a project that we at EdLab's Development & Research are working on to support discussions and social networking around videos (e.g. for classes, professional learning communities, or other distance-learning applications). Let me explain breifly what it does and then solicit you all for some help. Given the description below, we REALLY NEED HELP COMING UP WITH A NAME. So, please do suggest any names that might be appropriate and catchy for such an application.

In short, DOW is meant to be a tool that helps users organize and conduct discussions around video. Here is a typical way the application might be used:

- A teacher creates a discussion group around a video that she has uploaded or found existing on the DOW website (imagine finding some video on YouTube that you want to discuss with others). 

- The teacher then invites her friends, colleagues or classes to join the discussion on the video. She can do this by creating a special social group around those different circle of people (students, friends, colleagues, etc.). 

- All the people in the discussion group then watch the video at their leisure (or simultaneously if they want) and post comments/ideas/questions/feedback. Everyone else in the social group can see the comments posted by others while they watch. 

- Once everyone has watched the video, the comments can be archived, searched and referenced. The teacher can collect all the comments in to one document, with links back to the appropriate location in the video. 

Ultimately, the commenting scheme will be something similar to what is found here: http://omnisio.com/v/FvM91SVdjhG/the-rise-of-us-social-media-at-work. The new features will be a focus on organizing comments and discussions and giving different facilities that allow people to archive comments and hold discussions around different social/professional groups. 

Hopefully, the idea is now a bit clearer ... stay tuned for a more detailed document. In the meantime, does anyone have a nice name to replace our really cryptic one right now :) ?
