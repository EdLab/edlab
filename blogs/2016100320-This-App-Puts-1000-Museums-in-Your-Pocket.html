<p>With <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-arts-culture/id1050970557?mt=8">Google’s Arts and Culture app</a>, you can have artwork from over 1,000 museums in your pocket. Users can take virtual tours of museums, explore art movements, and discover information on thousands of paintings and other pieces of art. Whether you want to explore a museum down the road or one across the world, Google’s Arts and Culture app makes that possible, and it’s honestly pretty exciting.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Google’s Arts and Culture app contains an enormous amount of artwork that you can search for by artist, medium, art movement, historical events and figures, and places. When you click on an artist’s profile, it shows you a biography, a collection of their work with facts about each piece, and a notable quote that changes daily. My favorite feature was being able to peruse an artist’s oeuvre by both color and timeline. With this, I could browse all of Van Gogh’s paintings that contained a certain shade of blue and discover how his artistic style changed from his first year of painting to his last. In addition, from my desk in NYC, I could step into the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam and take a virtual tour. This aspect could be particularly useful for anyone interested in museum curating who doesn’t have a budget to visit places around the world.</p>
 
<p>The app also includes three other exciting features. One is its collection of VR videos of museum tours. With Google’s cardboard headset in hand, users can virtually tour museums and receive an audio tour along the way. The second is the app’s collection of digital exhibits. This includes written and audio information on specific topics, such as meteorites, with artifacts collected from various museums. The third exciting feature, called Art Recognizer, is the perfect companion for a museum-goer. When users point their devices at a painting, the app recognizes it and relays information about that piece back to the user. Unfortunately, this feature is currently only available at three museums worldwide, including the National Museum of Art in DC. At least they are headed in the right direction. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The collection available on the app is far from comprehensive. In fact, some of the most celebrated artists’ works are not represented, most likely due to partnership limitations. For instance, although the app provides a bio for Picasso and Rothko, it does not contain any of their artwork, and only one Jackson Pollock painting is to be found. I was also unable to visit the museum I love most in the world (the Louvre) or any of the artwork in it, including the Mona Lisa. This is certainly a limitation for anyone seeking information on a particular artist, museum, or painting that the app does not include.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While browsing this app, I honestly learned much about art history, museums, and my favorite artists. The amount of information is so plentiful that I feel like I could open the app every day for a year and still learn new things at the end. Due to its partnering limitations, Google’s Arts and Culture app may not yet be the perfect guide to the entire art world, but it is certainly still a must-have for museum lovers. As one myself, I am definitely going to keep this app on my phone.</p>
