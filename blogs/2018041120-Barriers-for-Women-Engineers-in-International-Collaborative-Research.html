<p>International collaboration in research is becoming more important to academia. Global cooperation promotes the transfer of knowledge and ideas, as research with multiple authors from around the world is  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10961-009-9131-5">
widely disseminated</a>. Yet because women are underrepresented in many academic fields, they face unique barriers in this kind of cooperative research. With this in mind, a team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology has attempted to understand the barriers related to international collaborations faced by women in engineering fields. </p>  

<p>The team conducted a survey during three international summits for female engineers, in 2009, 2011, and 2012. The questions dealt with barriers in international collaborations and related obstacles, both institutionally and individually. The researchers built a sample of 609 respondents mostly from the US and Europe but also including respondents from other parts of the world.</p>   

<p>In general, most of the professionals in the survey had experienced at least one international collaboration whereas, unsurprisingly, the students surveyed tended not to have any prior experience of this type. Funding was the most cited barrier to global collaboration while communication was the least cited barrier. Interestingly, family issues was one of least cited barriers in this survey. A complete ranking includes:</p>   

<ol>
  <li>Funding</li>
  <li>Finding Partners</li>
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Time</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Communiction</li>
</ol>  

<p>The researchers also found clear regional patterns in their data. Women working in the US were the least likely to be interested in international collaborations, those from outside Europe and the US tended to have slightly more interest, and European women showed the most interest in these kinds of collaborations. Students from these regions followed a similar pattern.  </p>  

<p>The women in the sample were generally more likely to say that international research collaboration was more important to other women at their institutions. The respondents also believed that personal or family barriers were potentially greater obstacles for other women at their institutions, but less so for themselves. </p> 

<p>The scholars believe that this research sheds light on how women work within this increasingly important trend in academia. They hope to continue this exploration with an expanded global sample including more respondents from around the world. The researchers would also like to add men to the survey in order to examine gender differences. </p>
