          <p>
            I was browsing Forbes' site when I came across this, <a href=http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2012/09/29/obama-blocks-chinas-second-richest-man-from-owning-wind-farm-near-secret-navy-base/">article</a> about President Obama's rejection of a Chinese company owning and operating a wind farm near a Naval Weapons Boardman, Ore. According to the article, China's second richest man, Lian Wengen completed the purchase of a wind farm in which he was planning on expanding his business to the door of the United States. But once again, national security became an issue as a Chinese company installation near a secret military base could serve as point of espionage by the Chinese government.
 
Not only the project was blocked, but the President also ordered the Chinese company to remove any kind of construction already made on the site, which led Mr. Wengen to sue the American government.  The question I have is do we really know if whether the company was to be used by the Chinese government, taking in consideration their location near a Naval base full of drones and other equipment, or was the company only trying to make more profit by expending their door near a naval base. What do you think? Is the issue of national security going to prevent other foreign companies from maybe investing or expanding their business in America?
