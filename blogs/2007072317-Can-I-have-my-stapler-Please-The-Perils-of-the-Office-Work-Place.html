            There's nothing quite like the adrenaline-packed, hard laboring, sweaty, dirty, gritty, action packed <b>desk job</b>. Not exactly quite like strapping on bright red nut-huggers over a tight spandex blue body suit and flying off to save the world, but it's up there. 

Sure, a good deal of us may be behind cubicles or desks all day, and a “hard day's work” doesn't exactly mean struggling to work that <a href=http://www.seomoz.org/img/articles/Office%20Space.jpg> stupid fax machine</a> and watching your muscles atrophy while your belly develops into Santa's paunch. But, but, but, this doesn't mean that we're not in grave danger and at risk in our sheltered little workplace. 

Yes, there are perils to working in the office as well. You are in danger every single second you are sitting here reading this. (<i>Run for your life?</i>)

Naturally, I'm exaggerating our peril a wee tad. It's not everyday your <a href=http://www.squizzle.com/_sed43/15380.jpg>Dell laptop bursts into flames</a>, nor is that <a href=http://us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/twentieth_century_fox/office_space/stephen_root/officespace1.jpg>creepy coworker</a> of yours going to go berserk and set your office on fire. But, there are a few things one needs to be cautious about, such as: 

<b>Paper Cuts</b>
Ah yes, the deadly paper cut. Shuffling through your paper work, or lifting boxes or rifling through the filing cabinet — you feel a sharp sting and lift your hand to see a deceptively thin hairline red swell along your index finger. Only to be consumed in pain later at your desk when you really need to start typing up that report you had to submit to your boss half an hour ago. Pain so bone numbing, you grit your teeth and flex your hands, while suppressing the insane urge to scratch at it. The best remedy is Neosporin … ASAP. And pray that it isn't in a completely inconvenient location, like say, between your fingers. 

<b>Afternoon Slump</b>
You don't get it. It's like your body deliberately, subversively, subconsciously <i>wants</i> you to look bad in front of your supervisors. You ate lightly, avoiding meats like turkey and chicken, drained two <i>dopios</i> to stave off drowsiness, and are trying to do everything, anything, to keep from falling asleep. The Afternoon Slump, (or 3 o clock Slump) as some call it, is a creeping pandemic that is affecting offices throughout the nation. Though there is no scientific cure for this, there is still hope. Some alternatives include: the Ninja Nap, the I'm-Awake Nap, I'm-Studying-My-Computer-Screen Nap, I'm-reading-the-report-in-front-of-me-with-pen-in-hand nap, and various others. If your boss questions you, just reply that you're researching a scientific cure for the Afternoon Slump. 

<b>Staplers</b>
Staplers are the one of the most versatile dangers in the office. When properly used, they are instruments of great help, attaching documents, papers, random objects when you're bored, helping to keep things nice and tidy on your desk. As fast and efficient your stapler may be, mind where you place your fingers; when going too fast and just punching away, you might accidentally slip … and punch <b>through</b>. It's happened before, and I know that you guys all know someone who knows someone who's done it. And just to be on the safe side, when aforementioned creepy coworker asks for his stapler back, even if it's not his … just hand it over. 

<b>Wires</b>
This isn't a problem for those light of foot, agile, or small of girth. But for those of us who aren't, it can be quite difficult. When trying to carefully maneuver yourself across the maze of desks and cubicles to get to the bathroom — the perfidious computer wire lashes out, catches your ankle, and trips you. You manage to grab onto a neighboring desk in time, but can't make it unscathed — you have to hobble away with a nice long scrape down your leg and a smarting shin. Wires. Don't let their inanimate appearance fool you; they lie in wait in coiled tangles along the office floor and just happen to place themselves in the way of a fumbling foot. Wires. Those sleek, cold, calculating death traps that haunt the unsuspecting office drone. Stay alert and remain on the look-out!

<b>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</b>
This is actually a serious problem that will affect the majority of us and generations to come. <a href=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/carpal_tunnel/detail_carpal_tunnel.htm>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</a>, to sum it up and water it down a bit, is a condition where the median nerve (which runs along the forearm and into the hand) is squeezed, compressed, or pinched at the wrist (keyboards, mouses, anyone?), resulting in pain, tingling, numbness, or atrophy in the hands, wrists and arms. There are preventive measures to delay, prevent, the onset of Carpe, and there are various treatments for those who have it, such as <a href=http://www.yourcarpaltunnel.com/carpal%20tunnel%20support.jpg>braces</a>, drugs, exercises, and even surgery. For those who want to take no chances, there are corrective office supplies such as the <a href=http://www.systemaxdev.com/productmedia/htmlimages/cten/Mice/66412-big.jpg>ergonomic mouse</a>, which looks <a href=http://irongamer.net/blogfiles/2006/3mouse/newmouse1.jpg>difficult</a> as all hell to maneuver and use, but it's still good for your wrists. 

Now then, you have been forewarned, go forth and conquer!! Or, stay at home and cower in fear at the bad, bad, world out there.
