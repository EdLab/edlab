          <p>
            While so much of the news out of New Orleans of late has been of incompetence and inadequacy — the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1645312,00.html?imw=Y">toxic FEMA trailers</a>, the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/story?id=3379974&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312">melting ice</a>, the <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf?/base/news-20/117367751715220.xml&coll=1">soaring murder rate</a> -- it is so refreshing to come upon that occasional story of the individual who has turned the aftermath of Katrina into an artistic triumph.  In this case, it is artist <a href="http://www.takashihorisaki.com">Takashi Horisaki</a>, who was born in Japan but spent his first three years in the U.S. as an art student at Loyola University in New Orleans.


Now living in New York, Horisaki found a unique way to preserve Katrina's painful aftermath before the destroyed homes of the Lower Ninth Ward have all been demolished or rebuilt.  He somehow came upon the idea of making a latex mold of the remains of the prototypically <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fej/346882893/">shotgun-style house</a> at 1941 Caffin Avenue.  Strangely mimicking the <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conMediaFile.8000">“death masks”</a> used to preserve the faces of the famous in days past, Horisaki -- with painstaking effort and at great expense -- transported the latex mask of 1941 Caffin to the <a href="http://www.socratessculpturepark.org"> Socrates Sculpture Park</a> in Long Island City.  There, the latex skin was stretched over a newly-constructed frame to recreate the house–this time, set against the New York City skyline.  The finished product, entitled <i>Social Dress New Orleans — 730 Days After</i>, <a href=http://www.nola.com/frontpage/t-p/index.ssf?/base/news-8/1185775414295930.xml&coll=>opened July 29</a> and will be on display through October 28. 


“He's capturing our heart and soul and the emptiness in there by taking the skin of the house,” Mary Len Costa of the Arts Council of New Orleans told the <i>Washington Post</i> in a recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/08/AR2007070801019.html?nav=rss_print/style">profile</a> of Horisaki's work.  “It'd be hard for him to take the skin of a person, so he's taken the protective area that we all go to, the second skin, the home.” 


On a <a href="http://socialdress-neworleans.blogspot.com">blog</a> documenting the progress of <i>Social Dress New Orleans</i>, Horisaki describes it as “a project to raise awareness about the situation in New Orleans.”  By bringing a piece of the Lower Ninth Ward to New York, his project can expose thousands of people miles away to the physical reality of Katrina. For students in the area, this would make a wonderful field trip on a sunny fall day. (If you can't make it to Long Island City, a <a href=http://nymag.com/listings/art/social-dress-new-orleans/>slideshow</a> of the exhibit is well worth taking a look at.) Even more importantly, the juxtaposition of this crumbling home against the most magnificent skyline in the nation makes a powerful statement about the meaning of Katrina to our nation's identity and rephrases the question of what kind of country are we in a provocative and inspiring way.


Please share your thoughts about <i>Social Dress New Orleans — 730 Days After</i>, particularly if you have the opportunity to visit the exhibit personally (directions to the Socrates Sculpture Park are available at the park's <a href="http://www.socratessculpturepark.org/Directions/directions.htm">website</a>).  If you visit with students, please send us pictures and student reaction.
