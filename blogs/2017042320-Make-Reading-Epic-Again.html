<p><a href="https://www.getepic.com/">Epic!</a> is an eBook subscription service with over 20,000 books for children 12 and under. This mobile technology syncs across devices so kids can read on the go. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>While other eBook services for kids certainly exist, Epic! has lots of notable names in children’s publishing in their library. Aside from big name appeal, the service provides several other features that make the $4.99/month subscription fee seem worth the cost. Features include audio read-alouds accompanying books, progress tracking, digital badges to motivate young readers, and personalized recommendations. The extensive library allows kids to select from a wide range of books that connect to their evolving interests. The monthly fee is also waived for educators who have access to devices in the classroom. This could be an interesting tool to organize classroom reading challenges or track individual student reading progress. Though the large list of titles may be overwhelming for kids selecting books, the platform curates books for users based on their reading levels and interests.</p>

<p>The layers of gamification in this app add an element of fun that could encourage kids to engage in more productive screen time. As Epic! describes on its site, children are already excited about using tablets, so capitalizing on their interest in technology to help them develop literacy skills allows them to couple learning with their existing interests. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While this app could be beneficial for families or classrooms, not all kids have ready access to a mobile device. In addition to requiring a device, the monthly fee is the greatest disadvantage to this service. Though the classroom version of the platform is free, for students to continue reading at home they would have to subscribe to the service or be able to take devices out of the classroom. This platform could be more accessible if there were other subscription models that provided families more payment options.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While the subscription service is a cost burden that not all families can bear, the cost still provides a lot of value in terms of features and functionality. Studies on screen time have not yet concluded how long or what types of activities are best for children to engage with on mobile devices. However, reading is a more positive screen-based experience than other game options that don’t have an easily recognizable educational advantage.</p>
