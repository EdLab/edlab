<strong>Author</strong>: Marc Prensky, Foreword by Stephen Heppell

<strong>Publisher</strong>: Thousand   Oaks, CA: <a href="http://www.corwin.com">Corwin</a>, c. 2010

<strong>Check it out</strong>: <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=teaching+digital+natives&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">LB1027.23.P74 2010</a>

<strong><a href="http://www.corwin.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book233944">From the publisher</a></strong>: Students today are growing up in a digital world. These "digital natives" learn in new and different ways, so educators need new approaches to make learning both real and relevant for today’s students.

Marc Prensky, who first coined the terms "digital natives" and "digital immigrants," presents an intuitive yet highly innovative and field-tested partnership model that promotes 21st-century student learning through technology. Partnership pedagogy is a framework in which:
<ul>
	<li>Digitally      literate students specialize in content finding, analysis, and      presentation via multiple media</li>
	<li>Teachers      specialize in guiding student learning, providing questions and context,      designing instruction, and assessing quality</li>
	<li>Administrators      support, organize, and facilitate the process schoolwide</li>
	<li>Technology      becomes a tool that students use for learning essential skills and      "getting things done"</li>
</ul>
With numerous strategies, how-to's, partnering tips, and examples, <strong><em>Teaching Digital Natives </em></strong>is a visionary yet practical book for preparing students to live and work in today’s globalized and digitalized world.
