          <p>
            A <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140311100604.htm">recently conducted study by researchers</a> at several UK universities found that increasing obesity rate in adolescent girls corresponds to their low academic attainment levels throughout their teenage years. The outcome of the study demonstrates that girls who were considered obese according to their body mass index at the age of 11 displayed lower academic ratings at ages 11, 13 and 16 in comparison to those deemed not obese. When the same study was conducted with boys, associations between obesity and academic attainment were inconclusive. Researchers also took into account what they believed were potentially distorting factors such as mental health, IQ, and age of the initial menstrual cycle, among others. These factors were found to be inconclusive, as they did not affect the relationship between obesity and academic attainment.

I find this study to be rather interesting. I agree that there may be factors that affect the academic attainment of obese females. However, I am rather skeptical about how obesity in boys does not affect them in any way. Why is obesity really a negative factor in the academic attainment of adolescents?  There is a correlation that shows girls who are obese perform more poorly than their more healthy peers. But is that really the case? I believe that it is not the fact that they are obese that decreases their academic potential, it is the fact that as teens, the thought of what others think of you prevails. If you are obese, teasing and bullying and becoming a social outcast to your peers can also contribute to low academic achievement.
