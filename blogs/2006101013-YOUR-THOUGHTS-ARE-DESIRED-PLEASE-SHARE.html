          <p>
            While brainstorming future PK outreach and marketing strategies, I began to think about PK as a "brand" and Phil as its "mascot" (Pilsbury has the doughboy, we have the ever-emotional Phil).  Therefore, I cracked open the Harvard Business Review to look for articles on brand management.  

In their article, "Customer-Centered Brand Management," Rust, et. al (Sept. 2004) write:

Most managers today agree with the notion they should focus on growing the lifetime value of their customer relationships...Listen to them talk and you may hear customer, customer, customer.  But watch them act, and you'll see the truth: It's all about the brand.  Brand management still trumps customer management in most large [and small] companies, and that focus is increasingly incompatible with growth...

So, how do we focus and ACT on the idea that in order to grow PK, we must focus on the lifetime value of our customer relationships?  (i.e., It is not enough for our customers to visit PK once.  We want them to visit the site again and again).  Nike won me over 10 years ago with its narrow stylish running shoes and sleek ads (<a href="http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/">Nike Ad</a>, click stories, click Paula). I suspect I'll still be buying the same brand when I'm 75! So, how do we do the same with PK?  I emplore you all to think and respond... (Keep reading!)

WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU RETURN TO PK TOMORROW?  NEXT WEEK? NEXT SEMESTER? NEXT YEAR? IN 5 YEARS? IN 10 YEARS, etc?

My answers are:

Tomorrow: If Anthony posted more photos, I'd check them out.

Next Week: Next week I have to begin writing an education finance paper.  If Prof. Tsang had articles posted on the topic in PK, I'd read them!

Next Semester: Hopefully I will graduate before then, but I would certainly check PK out if Karen posted her research paper on Indonesia.

Next Year: Hui Soo posts his first paper written by Dr. Chae!  I'm there to read it!

In Five Years: I get an invite to check out PK 2.0 (new look, new mascot, same great content + more... free access for alumni + $5/year for the PK Gold edition)

In Ten Years: The complete Hank Levin Resource Allocation lectures are in PK.  I'd certainly watch a video or two out of nostalgia and to see what insights Prof. Levin's latest lectures share. 

NOW IT'S YOUR TURN...
