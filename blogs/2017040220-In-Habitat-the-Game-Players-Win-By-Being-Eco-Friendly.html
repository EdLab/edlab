<p>What better way is there to learn about the environment than by taking care of an adorable, digital polar bear? Geared toward young children, <a href="http://www.habitatthegame.com">Habitat the Game</a> teaches players how to be eco-friendly through activities that help keep their endangered animal alive and pampered.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Habitat strikes a nice balance between learning and gaming. Upon starting the game, players name their polar bear and visit its habitat in Glacier Park. To care for their endangered pal, players can feed it, groom it, and even adorn its environment with furniture, all by collecting points from activities and games.</p>
 
<p>The activities in Habitat ask players to complete tasks in real life. These include actions such as switching off unused lights, reducing shower length, and turning off the tap water while brushing their teeth. When players log these actions in the game, they receive points that can then be used to care for their bear. In addition, players can use the app to explore real animal habitats in their area. If they visit these habitats in real life, players receive digital pins that they can trade with others in the game.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although the habitat pins add an interesting dimension to the game, this section of the app is not intuitive. The habitats are marked on the map, but without descriptions, meaning players have no idea which animals are located at each location. Also, while the real life activities suggested in Habitat are easy and informative, the app also includes games, which are less educationally valuable and more interface finicky. The controls in the game tended to be more frustrating than intuitive, which could be particularly challenging for young children.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The best part of Habitat the Game is taking care of a personal polar bear (I named mine Sodapop) that you can watch prance around an Arctic environment. Although some of the features in the app are less valuable than others, many of its activities still share information on why it is important to preserve the world’s resources. By playing this game, children will learn some of the actions they can take in their daily lives to become more eco-friendly. After all, who wouldn’t take a minute-shorter shower each day to protect their own endangered Sodapop?</p>
