<b>Title:</b> Scaffolding Informal Learning in Science Museums: How Much Is Too Much? (2013)
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Susan A. Yoon, Karen Elinich, Joyce Wang, Jaqueline B. Van Schooneveld, & Emma Anderson
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.21079/abstract">Science Education</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Field trips to science museums are rare and brief events in a standard science curriculum, but the vast resources these museums offer should encourage efforts to use studentsâ€™ time there as efficiently as possible. In particular, exploring a science museum involves students in a great deal more informal and ad-hoc learning than the more structured environment of a school classroom. By bringing learning scaffolds into the experience, teachers can ensure that they are making the most of the opportunity. 
<p>
For this study, the authors recruited 307 students from 9 local middle schools, and arranged for every class to visit a nearby science museum and interact with an exhibit device called "Be the Path," which demonstrates electrical principles in a hands-on manner. The study authors developed 5 different possible combinations of learning scaffolds, including digital augmentation, questionnaires for students to fill out and group exercises, to be used by the students at the exhibit, and then drew data from videotaped student interactions, surveys, interviews, and response sheets to see how students given these different conditions (or in the control group, devoid of learning scaffolds) responded to and learned from the exhibit.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Several conclusions can be drawn from their results. First, it appeared that the addition of learning scaffolds tended, with one exception to diminish informal learning behavior. The exception was in requiring students to collaborate in small groups, which tended to reverse the dampening effects of the other learning scaffolds. On the other hand, the use of these learning scaffolds tended to result in greater student knowledge retention at the end of the exercise. 
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
As the authors point out, their findings seem to point to a tension between supporting student learning and preserving the informal interest and excitement that can make a visit to the science museum so attractive to students. However, their suggestive results also offer potential solutions, worth investigating. Further studies should help clarify and cement our understanding of how to implement learning scaffolds within the context of small-group collaboration in such a way as to increase student learning without sacrificing student engagement.
