<strong><a href="http://store.tcpress.com/0807751898.shtml">From The Publisher:</a></strong>

Were I younger and more vigorous, I would go on the road again just to promote this book. . . . [It] presents an entirely new idea of how children learn naturally and how videotech can serve and be used for a new approach to education. . . . America has always excelled in creativity and to lose that gift may be far more devastating than testing poorly.  The journey calls for the creative inclusion of technology, and this book shows how to get there.”
—From the Foreword by <strong>Joseph Chilton Pearce</strong>, author of <em>Crack in the Cosmic Egg </em>and<em> Magical Child</em><em>
</em>
“Changing old ways of thinking about education is the most difficult obstacle to creating the schools needed for this century. Renate and Geoffrey Caine have written an excellent guide to meet this urgent need, blending research from neuroscience with valuable insights from their direct work with teachers and students.”
—<strong>Milton Chen</strong>, Senior Fellow, The George Lucas Educational Foundation, author of <em>Education Nation</em><em>
</em>
“Renate and Geoffrey Caine bring recent excitement about situated cognition and the perception-action cycle to the educational setting in this new book, a culmination of their decades of work linking brain research to the classroom.”
—<strong>Lynn Nadel</strong>, Regents Professor, Department of Psychology, University of Arizona

“Finally someone is making the connection between use of technology,  our new understanding of brain science, and their combined influence on  children.”
—Sharon N. Delgado, Reading Specialist Baltimore County Public Schools, Baltimore, Maryland

Why do video games fascinate kids so much that they will spend  hours pursuing a difficult skill? Why don’t they apply this kind of  intensity to their schoolwork? These questions are answered by the  authors who pioneered brain/mind learning with the publication of <em>Making Connections: Teaching and the Human Brain</em>. In their new book, <em>Natural Learning for a Connected </em>World,  Caine and Caine build a bridge to the future of education with a  dynamic model of teaching that works for all grade levels and all  cultural and ethnic groups. The authors’ education model, the Guided  Experience Approach, is based on the scientific foundation of learning  as a totally natural, continuous interaction between perception and  action. This important book provides a practical, step-by-step  description and successful examples from practice so that we can finally  provide the learning environments essential for our children to thrive  in the knowledge age.
