            **KEEP PRIVATE**

Tonight Megha and I went to NYC Startup Weekend at Alley NYC, where over 200 people gathered in order to think up new  ed tech ideas. The 54-hour event began with a pitching session, in which 51 people pitched their idea for the next big ed tech startup.  The rules for pitches were that they had to be 30 seconds or less and folks were encouraged to say their name, the problem they wished to address, how their idea would address said problem and who they needed on their team to turn their idea into reality. (Each team would have to have an educators, developer, and designer. Out of the 51 pitches, I would say 5 seemed like decent ideas with potential to provide something of value to the world. 


 If I am honest, the lack of thought that went into most of the ideas  left me feeling disillusioned with this whole trend of hackathon-startup style events. One of the most interesting elements of tonight's event was the opportunity to experience/hear  an excellent pitch (concise, can sum up the idea in about 3 words, overall strong public speaking presentation, and expertise) versus a poorly-presented one (stuttering, at the end not sure what the person is suggesting). Two, I  think the event helped link up like-minded people who share similar interests, 
 
But overall, I left feeling  slightly depressed and rather  concerned regarding the future of our learning landscape. I thought if we were to hold an event like this, what would it look like and what kind of supports could we offer to improve the integrity of the ed tech start up world?  What kind of questions do we need to encourage players in the field to ask as they engage in ed tech ideas? Who do  these ideas ultimately end up helping? And where are the students in all of this? Shouldn't they be involved since most of the ideas were geared toward them?
