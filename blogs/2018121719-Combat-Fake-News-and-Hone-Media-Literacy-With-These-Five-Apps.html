<p>Fake news is intimidating, frightening, and quite frankly lurking behind our screens with each site we visit. Thankfully, we’re not on our own in fighting the good fight against pernicious lies and misleading articles. This list of apps documents a handful of efforts to help us become more media literate, more news savvy, and less likely to believe all that we read.</p>

<p>1. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5128/combat-fake-news-with-daily-news-quizzes-from"> Newsmeister</a>
<br>Offering daily three-minute quizzes on global news, Newsmeister tests users’ abilities to detect what what’s true from what’s not as quickly as possible. While anyone can play, Newsmeister includes features specifically for students and teachers where classes can compete against each other on their news knowledge throughout the year. </p>

<p>2. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5178/learn-how-to-spot-fake-news-by-creating-it"> Fake It to Make It</a>
<br>In Fake It to Make It, players take on the role of a fake news creator to get insider knowledge on how misinformation starts and spreads. Learning how easy article faking can be highlights what readers should be wary of in their own news consumption, especially regarding click-worthy links shared on social media.</p>

<p>3. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5647/fakey"> Fakey</a>
<br>Build media literacy with Fakey by skimming through real news articles and deciding which to share and which to fact check. Fakey aims to build up a skill we practice nearly everyday: scrolling through social media feeds and determining which sources are reliable and which simply stir up misinformation. </p>

<p>4. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5362/get-your-daily-news-in-2-minute-video-clips"> Circa News<a>
<br>Media literacy doesn’t limit itself to text anymore; instead, video has skyrocketed as a news production tool, and Circa News has embraced this change. With the Circa News app, you can peruse a database of daily news videos produced in-house, touted as unbiased, and geared toward millennials.</p>

<p>5. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5410/because-honestly-we-just-dont-have-time-for-a"> Sip Stories</a>
<br>Sip Stories specializes in succinct, tech-related news recaps that take less than a minute to consume. In fact, the stories are collections of tweets, quotes, images, and summaries that can fit into the smallest breaks throughout your day, keeping you informed in the most efficient way. </p>
