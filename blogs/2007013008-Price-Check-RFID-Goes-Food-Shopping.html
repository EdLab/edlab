            Liberated from the RFID Tribe List:

Tech-filled shopping cart ready to roll

Plano maker's buggy locates items, offers specials, scans as you go

January 28, 2007

By Cheryl Hall 

PLANO, TEXAS - Global positioning, radio frequency identification, voice
recognition and high-resolution, full-motion video on a shopping cart? 

Plano-based Media Cart Holdings Inc. has developed a smart cart using
technologies that it believes will change the way shoppers shop, advertisers
advertise and retailers build loyalty. 

RFID chips - spaced every couple of feet on fixtures and shelves - will
enable advertisers to pop their products on the screen as the shopper
approaches them. They can use this just-in-time advertising to build brand
awareness, advertise specials and offer coupons. 

But Steve Carpenter, Media Cart president and chief executive, swears this
isn't just another irritating advertising intrusion into our already
media-slammed lives.

"Shoppers want to be in control," says Mr. Carpenter. "They want information
when they want it and where they want it. Retailers and manufacturers have
to transform the way they interact with consumers. This does that."

So what does it do?

You can download your shopping list from home or at the store and the cart
will put the items in aisle order on an in-store map.

"Then you simply follow the yellow brick road," Mr. Carpenter says.

Don't know where the Del Monte green beans are? Enter green beans or Del
Monte on the keypad or push a voice-activation button and ask for it. It'll
show you the shortest path to the item.

Looking for high-fiber, low-carb products? The display will locate those
products throughout the store.

You can get instant price checks or find out the unit cost.

If you want, you can scan and bag your purchases as you pick them. The
system keeps track of the price and weight of each item. At checkout, you
roll the cart onto a scale sans purse and child. If the weights match,
you're outta there.

Mr. Carpenter, who was part of the founding management team of Affiliated
Computer Services Inc., joined Media Cart as its first employee on June 1,
2005. Three months later, the company presented a working prototype to a
major packaged-goods manufacturer and asked, "If we build this, will you
come?"

The response was an enthusiastic yes, says Mr. Carpenter.

Next month, carts will roll into two pilot stores of a major East Coast
chain. Other soon-to-start tests are slated for a store in a neighboring
state of Texas and two stores of a West Coast chain. Mr. Carpenter hopes to
have a test store in the Dallas area by September.

He won't reveal anything more about these chains until they make their
announcements but says we'll recognize the names.

Most of America's leading manufacturers of consumer-packaged goods are
participating in the pilots.

The in-store media buyer for one of these brands (who isn't allowed to speak
on the record) says he's looking forward to seeing if shoppers "cotton to
it."

"I see a lot of stuff -- in-store TV at the deli counter. People don't go to
the supermarket to watch TV and be entertained," says the 20-year veteran of
the media-buying war. "This starts with the right premise: 'What can this
cart do to help me, the consumer?' "

To make sure it's on the consumer's wavelength, Media Cart built a
6,000-square-foot mock grocery store, replete with Tide, Pepsi, Crisco,
Miller beer and a slew of other well-known nonperishables, along with
lacquer-coated bakery goods and realistic fake meats, fruits and veggies.

Nearly 400 focus shoppers have navigated the aisles, tested the technology
and voiced their opinions.

They've given a thumbs-up to the out-of-the-way video screen perched at the
nose of the cart and the PDA-size control panel with a bar code scanner on
the handle. Moms like the fact that the child seat isn't usurped by
technology.

Older shoppers, who tend to come in husband-wife tag teams, like to check
unit prices and the basket totals.

Everybody seems to like the silence. The only time the cart becomes audible
is when it beeps softly to verify a successful scan.

The company thought it had a simple-stupid system until two weeks ago, when
it brought in 150 shoppers as a dress rehearsal to its pilot launches.

Shoppers were intimidated by too many options. So Media Cart has temporarily
turned off more advanced functions until the market is ready for them.

The carts have been "ruggedized" for grocery combat zones, says Mr.
Carpenter. "The plastics, the seals and the frames of the video display are
all designed for high impact, moisture and temperature extremes."

(Its engineering team used to build mobile computing devices for military
tanks, submarines and first-responder vehicles.)

An advanced version will have a GPS homing device -- kind of a LoJack for
grocery carts.

"They phone home if they leave the parking lot," says Mr. Carpenter. "Then
we can send someone to pick them up."

The retailers pay about $150 for a basic cart. Media Cart installs,
maintains and owns the technology. Advertisers pay a "click fee" only when
their ads are shown on the screen.

Mr. Carpenter knows the company has to get its costs down to make this
equation work. He's confident it can. "We're under $1,000 [a unit] now, but
that will come down exponentially as the technology becomes smaller, cheaper
and better."

Dave Sommer, managing partner of MEC Retail in New York, a unit of the
mammoth WPP Group media-buying firm, helps many of the biggest brands on
earth determine their in-store marketing strategies.

Thus far, Mr. Sommer is favorably impressed with Media Cart. He likes the
ability to target specific customers and reach them just as they are about
to pick up that box of cereal. And he likes being able to track how the
consumer responds to the ads in real-time.

But more important, he thinks customers will actually use the cart's
smartness.

"Whenever in-store media vendors come see me, I ask them, 'What is your
value to the shopper?' If they can't answer that, I figure people are going
to immediately tune the message out."

Peter Hoyt, executive director of In-Store Marketing Institute, agrees.

"They debuted the product at our trade show in Chicago in September, and it
was the hit of the show. This is a media vehicle that the market's looking
for. Their execution appears to be brilliant."
