<p><b>Title:</b> Unpacking MOOC Scholarly Discourse: A Review of Nascent MOOC Scholarship (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maureen Ebben & Julien S. Murphy</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439884.2013.878352">Learning, Media & Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How has the development of MOOCs and the scholarly discourse around them changed over time?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The authors investigated the present landscape of MOOC scholarship by chronologically analyzing 25 related empirical studies published from 2002 to 2013 in nine databases. All of the studies were published in peer-reviewed international journals. Specifically, the authors inductively examined the learning theories, assumptions, methods, findings, and future directions in each study to understand the changes in MOOCs over time.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Two key phases of MOOC scholarship were identified: (1) the development of Connectivism as a learning theory and its associated technological experimentation and innovation before 2011/2012; and (2) the rise of learning analytics, assessment, and critical discourse during 2012-2013. The first phase emphasizes human agency, user participation, and creativity through a dynamic network of connections via online technologies; the principles of Connectivism were utilized in general for the development of curricular environments and learning technologies for MOOCs.</p>

<p>The second phase features two types of MOOCs: cMOOCs, based on Connectivist pedagogical designs focusing on freely accessing and sharing knowledge, and xMOOCs, based on cognitive behavioral designs with limited "openness" for accessing knowledge; it further included a trend toward the establishment of differentiation among MOOCs in regard to pedagogical underpinnings, the use of learning analytics, and the advancement of assessments that position MOOCs as legitimate pathways of education. In addition, there was a rise of a critical discourse that MOOCs might become a tool to further "academic capitalism," which emphasizes the disciplines that serve the dominant economic order.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The findings of the review are important for both the education and technology communities to understand the teaching, learning, design, and development aspects of MOOC now and in the future. For education developers and researchers, the agenda today is to meet the massive needs for large-scale data mining, exploitation of digital traces of online participants, and learning analytics and assessment. For educators, the challenge lies in how to provide fluid, differentiated pedagogical designs that might address different learning needs through multiple ways of knowledge access and sharing.</p>
