<p><b>Title: </b> Searching for the Perfect Fit: The Interaction of Community Type and Profile Design in Online Communities (2014)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ulrike Cress, Eva Schwämmlein, Katrin Wodzicki, & Joachim Kimmerle</p>
<p><b>Source: </b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214003422">Computers in Human Behavior</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How does the interplay between community and individual profile affect the members of a group, and the group as a whole, in online communities?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The study focuses on two types of online communities—common-bond, characterized by interpersonal interaction, and common-identity, characterized by collective interaction—and two kinds of member profiles. Predefined profile fields lead to the creation of different types of profiles: in this case, on-topic profiles, which focus on the group identity, and off-topic profiles, which focus more on the individual member.  The researchers explored how different types of member profiles lead to fit or lack of fit within online communities, and how profile types affect the overall cohesiveness and focus of an online community. Experiment one examined the suitability of profiles in common-bond and common-identity communities. Using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment">2x2 factorial design</a>, participants were directed to either a common-bond or common-identity group and subsequently guided to create either an on-topic or off-topic profile. Experiment two used the same method to investigate the influence of profiles on audience orientation.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results demonstrate that members of common-bond and common-identity groups have different self-presentation preferences: in common-bond groups, members were more or less equally satisfied with both on-topic and off-topic profiles. In contrast, off-topic profiles are perceived as inappropriate and diminish the orientation towards the group in common-identity communities, likely because the profile focus is on the individual rather than the group. On an individual level, off-topic profiles reduce the perception of group acceptance; on the whole, they reduce all group members’ reflection about what is important to know for the group.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward: </b>The results indicated that regardless of community type, people perceive profiles to be important and useful in forming impressions. In groups formed around a common-identity, on-topic profiles are important for maintaining the group identity and contributing to the collective goals of the group. These findings may be useful when forming online learning communities, as learners may be more engaged in the community goals when prompted to create on-topic profiles. It may also be useful to study other self-presentation variables, or how different kinds of profiles might affect other activities, such as forming interpersonal bonds. Future research is needed to study the effects that contributing to collective goals versus establishing close relationships have on fostering learner engagement in an online environment.</p>
