            <b>Online Student News: Forums, Interaction, and "Learning 2.0"</b> 

Since it seems like I spend the first 30 minutes of each morning browsing (thanks for the definition last night, Jeff) through the daily news, I decided to take a look at news that's presented specifically for students.  I am pleasantly surprised by the sophisticated yet interactive nature of 3 youth news sites that I found: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/studentnews/">CNN Student News</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/?scp=1&sq=NYTimes%20kids&st=cse">NYTimes Learning Network</a>, and <a href="http://www.studentnewsnet.com/index.php">Student News Net</a>.

Some of the features that I found were blogs, learning activities (for teachers), quizzes, news transcripts, test prep, and presentation of the news in a more summarized and attention-grabbing way.  What makes these sites (intended for students, teachers, and parents) unique is that they present a combination of the "standard" news yet give equal attention to things that might especially interest youth, such as NASA's latest mission and a "word of the day".  My preference is for Student News Net, sponsored by Encyclopedia Britannica.  It allows students to take online notes, learn basics pertaining to the news-such as how hurricanes form, and contains a picture and video gallery.  

The catch?  It's only free for 7 days (CNN and NYTimes sites are always free), which I suspect is an issue I would run into with more searching for youth news sites.  Furthermore, these sites have existed for years, but never seem to gain much momentum (in my experience).  How can these sites <i>actually</i> be utilized in classrooms and at home?  Perhaps this is something to consider integrating into a regular lesson plan or provide news links in online learning communities, to stimulate discussion topics decided upon by the students themselves.  As for the effort to make all 21st century students active participants in their learning, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/issues_in_depth/10TechIdeas.html">this</a> article describe 10 ways to further that effort.
