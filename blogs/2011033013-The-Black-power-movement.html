            <strong>Title</strong>: The Black power movement : rethinking the civil rights-Black power era

<strong>Author</strong> :  Peniel E. Joseph (Ed)

<strong>Publisher</strong>: New York : Routledge

<strong>Call number:</strong> <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=the+black+power+movement">E185.61 .B6 2006</a>
<a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/c?SEARCH=BF637.F67+F65+2009&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit"><strong> </strong></a>

<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

Peniel Joseph has compiled a wonderful collection of essays pertaining  to the Black Power Movement (BPM) and how the BPM was much more than a  struggle by mostly male leaders at a national level.  Instead, this  collection argues, it was a coalition of people that joined together to  press for Black Power.

Most of the essays pertain exclusively to the Black Power Movement,  but there are plenty of tantalizing sidebars that tie well into the BPM,  such as an essay regarding Kwanzaa, and (my personal favorite) an essay  entitled "Rainbow Radicalism".  Rainbow Radicalism focuses on how the  BPM affected other ethnic groups, such as the Chicano/as in the  Southwest, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and even Southern Whites.

Overall, this collection is a spectacular grouping and is well worth  reading, whether simply for self-edification or as part of an  educational exercise.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in the  history of Civil Rights America or African-American history.
