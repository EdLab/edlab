<b>Title:</b> Designing for Productive Failure (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Manu Kapur and Katerine Bielaczyc
</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Educators across contexts have attempted to provide the right amount of instructional support to move learning forward when teaching novices new skills and information. The traditional approach has been to offer structured guidance early on to ensure success in mastering new skills, knowledge and information. But recently a body of research has tossed this pedagogical presumption on its head. ‘Productive failure’ is the idea that there is value in initially holding off on instructional support. Even if it means initial floundering and performance failure, in the long run, this pedagogical approach could lead to deeper learning.   
 
<p>
To explore instructional strategies geared toward <a href=" http://www.isls.org/icls2012/downloads/K2Kapur.pdf"> productive failure </a>  the authors of <i>Designing for Productive Failure </i> developed a teaching approach aimed at providing just the right scaffolding for problem-solving experiences that might lead to short-term performance failure, but more profound long-term learning outcomes. They then tested their productive failure design, which was focused on mathematical problem solving, by doing a comparative experiment in 3 Singapore schools. In all 3 schools, one group of 7th grade mathematics students was assigned to the productive failure approach, while another group experienced direct instruction. In the productive failure condition, students collaboratively solved complex math problems without any initial instructional support from the teacher. In the direct instruction group, the teacher provided careful instructional support and feedback from the start. 

</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Although the productive failure students collaboratively came up with a bunch of suggested methods for solving the complex math problems they were assigned, they were ultimately unsuccessful in their initial problem-solving performance. The direct instruction students on the other hand were able to find answers to the math problems. With that said, productive failure students substantially outperformed direct instruction students in the long run on the post-test when it came to solving complex problems. The findings were roughly the same in all three schools despite different levels of prior math performance among students. 
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The findings of this study suggest that holding off on instructional support potentially leads to temporary poor performance, but more complex learning, in the long run. The authors believed that their pedagogical design, which fostered specific learning processes, was a key factor to this outcome. Among other features, their design entailed creating a problem-solving context that built upon prior knowledge and resources of the learners, and that challenged but did not frustrate learners. Educators across contexts could incorporate productive failure design features into their teaching practices when aiming for long-term deeper understanding and learning. 
<p>
Building on this study, the authors advocate doing future research on instructional support that potentially leads to "productive success."  Developing instructional support with the dual aim of short-term performance success and long-term deeper learning seems like a winning learning direction.
