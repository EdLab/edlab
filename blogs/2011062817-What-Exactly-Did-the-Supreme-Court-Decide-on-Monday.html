          <p>
            I think there has been some misconceptions and miscommunications about what happened when the Supreme Court of the United States of America struck down a California law "banning the sale of video games to children." I think these misconceptions are formed largely due to the fact that this law gained more publicity AFTER this ruling was passed. I will try to explain exactly what happened in bullet points.

<li><b>What the California Law stated:</b></li>
The California Law made it <b>criminally illegal</b> to sell violent video games, defined as 'those “in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being” in a way that was “patently offensive,” appealed to minors' “deviant or morbid interests” and lacked “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value”' (Source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/us/28scotus.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=california%20video%20game&st=cse">NYTimes</a>), to minors under 18.

<li><b>Why this was significant</b></li>
This law set video games apart from movies, music, books, and other forms of media protected by the First Amendment in that it made it criminally illegal to sell violent video games to children. Although this may not be well-known, there are <b>NO</b> legal restrictions in showing rated R movies to minors (Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Effects_of_ratings">Wikipedia</a>), although almost all theaters have their own policies to disallow that.  Similarly, video games rated M by ESRB are not legally restricted in terms of sale, but most stores enforce it through their own policies.

<li><b>What the Supreme Court Decided</b></li>
What the Supreme Court decided was that video games should not be treated in a way that differs from movies and musics, other forms of expressions covered by the First Amendment. In essence, <b>the court affirmed that video games are protected under the First Amendment.</b>

I hope this clears up the decision for everyone. This said, do you still think or not think that the Supreme Court made the correct decision? What effects do you think this will have in the educational gaming sector?
