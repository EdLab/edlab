<p>Miriam Altman is Chief Executive Officer of <a href="https://kinvolved.com">Kinvolved</a> and is responsible for the overall success of the company. Under Miriam’s leadership, Kinvolved has been featured in the <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/technology/an-app-helps-teachers-track-student-attendance.html?emc=edit_tnt_20160123&nlid=12429854&tntemail0=y&_r=0&referer=">New York Times</a> and several <a href="https://kinvolved.com/press">other national press outlets</a>, and has won the University of Pennsylvania Fels Institute Policy Challenge, New York University Venture Challenge, Robin Hood College Success Prize, Milken-Penn Graduate School of Education (GSE) Competition Grand Prize, and Teach For America Social Innovation Award. Miriam is also co-chair of EdTechWomen’s NYC chapter, and mentors female entrepreneurs through the Social Innovation Initiative and Women’s LaunchPad at Brown University. She holds an MPA from the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, from which she received the Jo Ivey Boufford Award for Innovative Solutions to Public Service Challenges. She also holds an MA, Ed., from Lehman College and a BA with Honors from Brown University. She and her co-founder were named on Forbes 30 Under 30 most influential leaders in education, and Miriam was named one of the 30 Women SaaS Founders to Know in NYC, both in 2015.</p>

<p><b>How have your educational and professional experiences shaped your work with Kinvolved? </b><br>
I graduated in 2008 from Brown University, and then I became a teacher. I’m obviously biased, but I think that teaching is one of the most entrepreneurial professions that exists. I always say that in my current work the hardest day at Kinvolved is definitely not as hard as some of the easier days being a teacher. Exposure to the absenteeism problem was something that happened when I was teaching. One of the first things I noticed when I was in the classroom was that attendance was really inconsistent. I had kids that were missing school for weeks at a time and kids that just weren’t coming to first period at all. I had 5 kids out of 30 show up on time to class in the morning very frequently, which was a problem across my school. We say at Kinvolved that attendance is foundational to students’ success. Of course, if you’re not there then you’re not going to gain anything from the opportunity to be in school. That was the problem I went into graduate school thinking about. In graduate school, I co-founded Kinvolved.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope Kinvolved will impact education in America?</b><br>
We want to be a piece of that really important and challenging puzzle that is facing our country, which is to ensure that we’re increasing our high school graduation rates. I read a research study recently that showed for the first time in history, more U.S. citizens have a college degree than don’t. But there’s still a big divide in the socioeconomic status of people who have college degrees versus those with just a high school degree or those who don’t have high school degrees at all, and certainly there is a racial divide as well. While it’s really great that more people are graduating from college, what we are trying to do specifically is increase the opportunities to graduate from high school and then work with others who are working on college graduation—especially in urban, high-need communities. Making sure kids show up is the first step to giving them opportunities to be successful. Increasing graduation rates is a primary focus, but more specific to our issue is to help increase the national consciousness around the importance of attendance and just how dire a challenge absenteeism is across our country. There are not only negative social implications when kids don’t attend school, but also economic challenges and effects. And so I think even though we’re a small company, we’ve been part of the raising of awareness of the importance of these issues.</p>
 
<p><b>What are the challenges Kinvolved faces as it continues to grow? </b><br>
I think that trying to change ingrained behavior, assumptions, and attitudes is really not easy. Some of the limitations of working within the education system, for better or worse, come from the fact that if you’re going to develop a business in this sector, you need to work with policymakers and try to affect policy priorities that align with the goals of your organization or business. You need to go through procurement processes that are incredibly slow and costly to work through. It’s extremely difficult to just learn how to get paid. You might end up not getting paid for several months even if you become an approved vendor. And that’s just one example of some of the difficulties in working in the sector. But knowing how challenging it is and how many people and organizations don’t have the stamina to do it, for every milestone you’re able to make as a company and every story you hear from schools about how this is affecting their students and their families and their communities at large, it’s all the more meaningful. Pushing social and behavioral change is not simple.</p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Kinvolved is definitely my main focus, and it requires a lot of attention and TLC to keep growing. Our goal in the immediate future is to double the number of schools we’re working with both inside and outside of New York. In addition, we have a second product called the Campus Kit, which is part of a randomized control trial through a competition that we are finalists for called the Robin Hood Foundation College Success Prize. We’re working on ways to figure out, with limited capacity, how to integrate some of the Campus Kit’s functionality into our K-12 products and/or how to bring that product to the higher education market, specifically community colleges. After making sure kids graduate from high school, the next step is making sure there’s more equal access and ability to stay in college, too.</p>
 
<p>Outside of Kinvolved, I am a co-chair for EdTech Women NYC, which is a truly important initiative to me. I think that female leadership is really important, especially in the education sector. In our sector, even though the perception is that it’s a female dominated industry, the reality is that the highest volume of people involved in the sector is female, however leadership is inversely male dominated. If you think about schools, the last statistic that I saw was that 75% of all teachers are female and 75% of leaders are male; 25% of teachers are male and 25% of school and district leaders are female.</p>
 
<p>I’m also a mentor for the Women’s LaunchPad at Brown University, for student social entrepreneurs at the Swearer Center at Brown and NYU, and for fellow Teach For America alumni. </p>
 
</p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I’m honestly really bad at using Twitter, but there are a couple of people in the industry that I think are really interesting, and who I’m looking to as great examples, especially at this point in our nation’s consciousness. One was the president of Brown when I was a student. Her name is Ruth Simmons, and I think she has an incredible story. She was a first generation college student and the first African American woman who was the president of an Ivy League university. Similarly, there is a woman named Chastity Lord (<a href="https://twitter.com/chastitylord">@chastitylord</a>) who has a similar story but in a different context. She’s the Chief External Officer for Achievement First charter schools and the founder of national Proof Point day, which is raising awareness for kids who are first generation college students, much like the group 1vyG (<a href="https://twitter.com/Team1vyG">@Team1vyG</a>)—a network of first generation college kids trying to raise awareness of those students. I also think that Serena Williams (<a href="https://twitter.com/serenawilliams">@serenawilliams</a>) has used her star power to bring attention to and take a critical stand on important issues, like equal pay and racial bias.</p>
