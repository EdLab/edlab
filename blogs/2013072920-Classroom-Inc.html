<p><a href="http://classroominc.org/">Classroom, Inc.</a> is a game site that simulates real world careers in exciting fields. Aimed at struggling middle and high school students, the site lets participants experience interesting workspaces, collaborate on team projects, and make decisions in industries like finance, medicine, and media production. There is also an accompanying curriculum that helps teachers apply skills learned in game to national tests. Classroom, Inc. is well-connected and got its start as part of a collaboration between <a href="http://classroominc.org/about-us">Morgan Stanley employees and Teachers College researchers</a>. The games are free to schools and the nonprofit company is primarily funded through <a href="http://www.newyorklife.com/about/nyl-foundation-grants-400000-classroom-inc">corporate sponsorship</a> and <a href="http://www.classroominc.org/sites/classroominc.org/files/docs/annualreport.final_.pdf">private gifts</a>. 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The site is old for edtech (circa 1991), financially stable, and <a href="http://classroominc.org/results/classroom-inc-student-achievement-2011-2012">well-researched</a>. This is usually not a winning recipe for good gaming, but Classroom, Inc.’s simulations seem engaging and relevant. The graphics are not mind-blowing, but the tasks are so brisk and the plot so engaging that this comes off as charmingly retro rather than distractingly old-fashioned. Classroom’s coziness with real industry means the simulations use real company names and projects, which adds realism that might help engage users. External research has shown that Classroom, Inc. simulations can help prevent and even reverse <a href="http://classroominc.org/sites/classroominc.org/files/pdfs/Metis%20Four%20Year%20Summer%20Summary.pdf">summer learning loss</a> in reading and math.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Outdated graphics and still-shot action may not appeal to some users, though the success of games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a> seems to indicate that looks are not everything, even for younger gamers.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57589409-38/dont-graduate-if-you-dont-have-the-latest-tech-skills/">learning gap</a> between traditional education and 21st century workplace skills has been a rallying issue for edtech. Internships have <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/The-IT-Apprentice-How-technology-internships-bring-niche-skills-to-industry">been suggested</a> as a way for students to gain job skills, but Classroom, Inc. has the ability to put experiential learning simulations in the hands of students for whom real world internships may be out of reach.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Classroom, Inc.’s games have an old-school feel and a new school mission.</p>
