<i>We created +acumen to give people a meaningful way to "add Acumen" to their lives. Our online leadership courses are an exciting new way to dig deeper into Acumen’s work and develop your own toolkit for change. Take what you learn at +acumen and apply it in your own way.  Innovation could come from anyone, and we believe that the world truly needs you to lead.</i> (<a href="http://plusacumen.org/">+acumen site</a>)

<b>"Patient" Learning</b><br>
<a href="http://acumen.org/">Acumen Fund</a> and their "patient capital" and "moral imagination" model of funding social innovation was founded over twelve years ago by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Novogratz">Jacqueline Novogratz</a>. A relatively new way that the group is helping to spread the word about their work and foster a global network of committed social entrepreneurs, is through their free <a href="http://plusacumen.org/">+acumen</a> courses.  These courses take a "hybrid" approach, combining online elements with in-person team meetings.  These in-person meetings are self-selected and can be informally organized or held in conjunction with facilitators from Global +acumen chapters.  These global +acumen groups hold events, mobilize via social media and work to extend the Acumen mission to grow and support the network of committed social entrepreneurs and innovators throughout the world. 
<p>
Current +acumen courses center on a wide range of broad topics focused on social innovation from "<a href="http://plusacumen.org/courses/storytelling-for-change/">Storytelling for Change</a>," to "<a href="http://plusacumen.org/courses/hcd-for-social-innovation/">Human-centered Design for Social Innovation</a>."  These courses are held over the course of 5-6 weeks, organized as modules and conducted with partners such as <a href="https://www.ideo.org/">IDEO</a>.  Participants are given weekly assignments via email and are asked to submit group responses and to meet at regular intervals with their self-selected teams.  Participants are also encouraged to access a wide variety of material shared by +acumen course facilitators via email.  These email-based course materials include readings, online videos and lab prep/discussion prompts that are then completed individually before the weekly in-person discussions.  Groups are asked to rotate leadership and leaders submit online feedback forms to help +acumen track and assess the group’s progress and experience. 
<p>
<b>Hybrid, Real-world Learning</b><br>
Beyond a unique "hybrid" model that is centered on in-person as well as, online learning elements, the +acumen leadership program is a fresh perspective in the learning landscape. Grounded in the belief that, "Words are mere bubbles of water, deeds are drops of gold, " this emphasis on the transfer of learning to the real-world is evident throughout the +acumen program and course materials, with practical examples and a constant emphasis on encouraging the application of new skills and knowledge.
