<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>Beginning with my passion for playing Pacman, I wanted to make my own computer game. That is why I initially decided to pursue computer science. From studying science in secondary school and then computer science in university, I fell in love with coding and problem solving. For me technology was a way to leapfrog infrastructure gaps, become economically independent, and solve problems in my community. Working in the technology space has allowed me to develop my coding skills in different environments and conditions. It has also helped me to develop valuable networks and prepared me for the entrepreneurial journey.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I came from a system which is based on rote memorization. I had a life-changing story. In senior secondary school I was awarded the best student award for all first year students. I was doing well in science, won an intellectual competition, and was awarded a year exchange program in Norway. In Norway I took a physics class, and during our first exam we were given a problem and a formula book as a reference point. I was so confused. I was used to working out problems that I had memorized answers to without understanding. I could not apply what I was learning. That was when I knew there was a big problem in the educational system in Ghana. I could draw an advanced electrical system on paper but could not connect simple wires to light a bulb. When I came back I would ask a lot of questions in class, but I was told I was holding the class back from completing the syllabus. 1+1 was 2. I didn't have to understand it, just know the answer to pass exams. It is this type of learning landscape that we are working to change. Learning is the pursuit of knowledge. A process that involves innovation, creativity, and failure and it never ends. We want our girls to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills to not accept the status quo, but to work to improve things. We want them to use technology as a tool to bring social change and change Africa's story of war, poverty, and disease. There is great power in unlocking a child's potential to seek and learn new things, to be hands-on, and to not be afraid of failure.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think we see technology playing a huge role with online learning and self learning. You can now learn so many things from the comfort of your home on the Internet or discover how to do things from YouTube videos. I also see learning being more hands-on with a practical and not theoretical approach. I also see learning not being restricted to the brick and mortar classroom but more of an experience involving different stakeholders.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>We have developed an innovative curriculum that teaches any child, especially girls with little or no computer background, how to code. We have also introduced human centered design to our curriculum, which allows our mentees to learn more problem solving and design effective solutions. We have impacted 2065 girls in five regions in Ghana. We will be taking our program to the other regions to impact more girls. We will also put our curriculum online. This year we have partnered with an organization in Burkina Faso that translated our curriculum into French. We started GirlTech with our partners Tuares in Burkina Faso. We are also working with women studying STEM in university to serve as mentors and will start coding clubs in different schools in the country. We will also work with a small group of girls that will build viable marketable technology.</p>
