            One of the goals of <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2838">Critter</a> and other web-driven pedagogical tools is to facilitate online learning environments. I've been looking at some research on quantitative studies that attempt to measure the relative effectiveness of online courses and face-to-face courses. <a href="http://dmc.umn.edu/spotlight/tel-effectiveness.shtml">A lot of these studies report</a> "no significant difference" between online learning and face-to-face, but this conclusion has a lot more nuance to it because the results of online learning show much more variability in effectiveness. This suggests there is potential for online learning to improve educational outcomes, but the results are highly dependent on the form that any distance-based educational program takes. 

One interesting conclusion that is directly relevant to Critter is that "asynchronous" learning environments seem to improve outcomes more than synchronized distance learning environments. Critter falls in to the "asynchronous" category because you can watch videos whenever you want and communicate with others on your own time (everyone doesn't have to be logged in at the same time, as in a chatroom). Here is an excerpt from the University of Minnesota Digital Media Center that addresses this issue:

<i>" Bernard's rigorous meta-analysis of 232 comparison studies conducted from 1985-2002 provides a partial answer to this question. He distinguishes between synchronous DE (courses in which the distance and face-to-face sections are simultaneous, for instance via instructional television, or ITV), and asynchronous DE (for example, internet-based courses). Bernard then notes that ADE on average produced better student learning outcomes than face-to-face, while SDE typically produced worse outcomes (Bernard, 408). The effects in both cases were relatively small, but they were statistically significant.

Hiltz (2001) confirms Bernard's findings. Her rather less rigorous analysis examines nineteen studies of courses that included both face-to-face sections and ADE sections which used “asynchronous learning networks”. Hiltz found that when learning outcomes were measured subjectively, via student perceptions of various sorts, there was overall no significant difference between the face-to-face and ADE sections, but when they were measured objectively, by means of course grades, final exam grades, etc., the preponderance of studies found greater learning in the ADE sections (Hiltz 2001, 4).
