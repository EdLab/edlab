<p> <a href="https://cel.ly/">Cel.ly</a> is a Portland-based startup offering a revolutionary app that could be a game changer in education. It allows users to create and control their own social networks (called a cell) that operate across smartphones, browsers, email, and text messages. The platform allows users to toggle modes of communication like alerts, curated chats, and open chats; connecting people in small and large groups makes it perfect for use cases ranging from parent-teacher conferences to social movements.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> Cel.ly is a flexible app with multiple functionalities. Teachers can deliver feedback, assignment reminders, and polls to students. Conversations can be easily organized into different cells to reduce the strain of assembling mass texts. It's equipped with adjustable settings, allowing moderators to filter comments before posting to everyone. It also has a crowdfunding option called "just-in-time funding," which allows educators to solicit financial support for last-minute needs like special equipment and project materials. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most unexpected and intriguing feature for an education product is the app's ability to support building social movements. Activists can send messages to event organizers or an entire organization quickly from their phone. In fact, Cel.ly was used during the <a href="http://occupywallst.org/">Occupy Movement</a> as a tool to alert participants of changes to protest itineraries.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately for Cel.ly, the market for messaging and networking apps is fairly crowded. Educators may have other messaging apps that are strictly educational and that more easily integrate into dashboards and learning management systems. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Ultimately this is a platform that is dedicated to uniting networks and making communication easier, whether it be a group of protestors or a group of students. Cel.ly's flexible settings make it ideal for educational contexts. It would benefit from even more features designed to meet teacher needs in the classroom and integrate with existing edtech products. </p>
