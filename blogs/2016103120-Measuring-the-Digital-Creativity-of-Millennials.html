<p>Creativity is a topic of great interest to educators and social scientists, but because it is difficult to measure and quantify, it can be hard to study. One popular method for measuring creativity involves asking subjects to self-report their activities in areas such as visual art, music, dance, and invention. Unfortunately, these surveys leave out many of the digital mediums favored by young people. It’s easy to agree that painting a picture is creative, but what about making a blog post or an online meme? </p>
 
<p>Researchers in this study sought to expand the scope of creativity research by developing a questionnaire to measure creative digital activity in high schoolers. The questionnaire was administered to 230 students from a private high school who were asked to indicate how frequently they had engaged in 30 digital activities including writing a blog post, making a digital mash up of a song, building a fan website, and creating a Facebook group. For comparative purposes, subjects also completed a set of additional surveys that are commonly used to measure creativity. Once the results were in, a statistical analysis was conducted to determine how reliably the results matched up with expected outcomes.</p>
 
<p>The authors of the study found that the adolescents surveyed were engaged in numerous digital creative activities, and the results consistently corresponded to and mapped onto other existing measures of creativity. For example, self-reported traits like "openness to experiences" and "unconventionality," which are linked to creativity elsewhere, also correlated with digital creativity. Thus, the study provides preliminary support that questionnaire is a reliable measure of creativity in the digital domain. </p>
 
<p>What is the takeaway? Researchers who ignore the digital arena are missing out on learning about many of the ways that young people create, innovate, and express themselves. Hopefully, new measurement tools like this questionnaire can help expand our understanding of what it means to be creative. </p>
