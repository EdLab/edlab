<b>Title:</b> Automatic Identification of Conceptual Metaphors With Limited Knowledge
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Lisa Gandy, Nadji Allan, Mark Atallah, Ophir Frieder, et al.
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/papers/aaai-metaphors.pdf">The Twenty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Natural language processing, the practice of developing automated computer algorithms to interpret and process our human languages, faces immense challenges.  A natural (i.e., the product of historical accretion, not, like FORTRAN, an artificial creation meant to be logical and internally consistent) language is, by any rational standard, a mess. The enormous gap between connotation and denotation that opens up even in relatively anodyne statements makes any simple mathematical analysis of their meanings impossible.
<p>
The authors of this paper have hit on a fairly elegant (if, at this point, still preliminary) method for identifying metaphorical statements.  First, the program, working off of Turney’s work, identifies possible metaphorical expressions by looking for statements that link abstract to concrete concepts, generally a characteristic of metaphorical language. Once these potential metaphorical words are identified, the system then looks for non-metaphorical words being used in a similar way.  For instance, if the phrase is "open government," the system might link "government" to "door," given that "door" is often used in a similar way, but in a concrete, non-ambiguous fashion. When the system finds a close correlation between these usages, across a variety of more concrete phrases (e.g. "open door," "open arms," "open house," etc.), it would then feel confident labeling the original phrase (i.e., "open government) a metaphor.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
To test the program, the study had a group of research assistants go through a text and label all the metaphors they found, and then check how many the program managed to identify. Generally speaking, it did pretty well, although it had some trouble with Type 3 adjective-noun metaphors.  Then they had a group of students look at conceptual metaphors generated by the system, to see whether they looked like metaphors to native language speakers.  Here, too, the system had well above a 50% success rate. 
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The program still needs a lot of work before it can be relied upon to consistently pick out and correctly interpret metaphors, but it seems a promising start. We aren’t yet at a point where, for instance, linguistically complex student essays can be automatically parsed by a computer program, but there does seem to be a clear path from here to there.  As for the broader social implications, well, that’s a different paper.
