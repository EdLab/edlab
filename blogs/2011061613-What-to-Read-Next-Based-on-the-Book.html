            <em><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.southboroughlib.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/books-into-movies.bmp" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></em>In the spirit of promoting nonacademic summer reading material, I thought I'd start a series of blog posts: <em>What to Read Next?</em> I call this first list Based on the Book. It features movies that are, you guessed it, based on a book or short story. As an added bonus (I think) all of the movie adaptations listed here in theatres now.

In full disclosure, I have not necessarily read the books or seen the movies in this list. You may also be surprised at the possible, ahem, literary quality of what is on this list. Years ago, librarians were trained to "grow" their readers by recommending and promoting what they considered to be suitable texts (read: the Western cannon.) I am not that kind of librarian.<img class="alignright" src="http://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Katniss-Everdeen-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg" alt="" width="117" height="150" />

<img class="alignleft" src="http://infomgmt.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/cover.jpg" alt="" width="119" height="182" />I am an avid reader and part of what keeps me always ready for the next book is that I read across genres. When I get bored with <a href="http://www.noraroberts.com/books/chasingfire.html">Nora Roberts'</a> happy endings, I ready myself for some of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Sedaris/e/B000AQ3YUW">David Sedaris's</a> self-effacing antics, or maybe (gasp) a compelling story of the undead by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=vampires&amp;x=0&amp;y=0#/ref=sr_kk_1?rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3Avampire+books&amp;keywords=vampire+books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307561561">any plethora of contemporary authors</a>. And then, to who knows where? Back in time to learn about the mysterious <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/books/05lacks.html?_r=1">Henrietta Lacks</a> and her all -important  <a href="http://www.virology.ws/2009/02/09/the-amazing-hela-cells-of-henrietta-lacks/">HeLa cells</a>? To Japan to endure the pain of alienation with  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/search?query=Haruki+Murakami">Haruki Murakami? </a> Maybe to a futuristic dystopia plagued with poverty and <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/">Hunger Games?</a>

I (as many others) read based on the kind of <a href="http://www.nancypearl.com/">mood </a>I'm in, not on a <img class="alignright" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NSDMCWJSL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="143" height="143" />preconceived idea of what I like or don't like.  My favorite cheap thrill: old pulpy noir.  Most raised eyebrows on the subway when I read: Westerns.  Albeit, white girls from NYC are not representative of who typically reads Westerns but hey, I like to keep things interesting.  <a href="http://www.womenwritingthewest.org/">Women Writing the West,</a> definitely interesting.

<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.movingimage.us/images/calendar/media/Persepolis-8-fromPhotofest_lowres-detail-main.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="93" />Regarding movies... I love those too. I mean LOVE. ALL movies, even <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">rottentomatoes' </a>most rotten. Especially the ones that go straight to <img class="alignright" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vHz8gtUl0T8/TTTg_O-sIUI/AAAAAAAACUQ/AB8KID7p35w/s1600/Read-True-Grit-online.jpg" alt="" width="135" height="201" />DVD.  I belong to at least three museums for the <a href="http://www.movingimage.us/">free member screenings</a>.  I update my <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> que daily and I've been known to wake up early to squeeze in a movie in before work.  Thank you Video On Demand, for bringing joy to my morning exercises!  I have never walked out of a movie and and I actually can't remember ever turning one off before it ended. The only I have ever truly disliked is <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/102367/why_forrest_gump_ranks_amongst_the.html">Forrest Gump</a>...I'll spare you my diatribe.
