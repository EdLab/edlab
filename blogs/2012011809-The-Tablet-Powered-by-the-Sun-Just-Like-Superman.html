In recent news, <a href="http://one.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)</a> just came out with a new XO 3.0 tablet at the <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">Consumer Electronic Show</a>. This is an interesting laptop that was designed for students in developing countries and it's priced at $100 per tablet, but is sold only in bulk to countries. Even so, for a $100 tablet, it has some very interesting features, such as multiple ways to give it power. The tablet has a solar panel cover that provides the tablet with power. This is the main method of charging the battery, but can also be powered by a hand crank, a waterwheel, or a bicycle, all of which is separately purchased. This tablet is a great way to provide students, in developing countries, a great tool for education.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> This piece of technology can potentially help more students around the world learn about STEM topics. A very financially sound tablet cannot only benefit those in developing countries, but for students right here in America. At $100 per tablet, maybe there can be one tablet per student right here at home. Most believe that every student has access to a laptop or tablet already, but this is false, especially when it comes to rural and inner city public schools. But every student having a laptop wouldn't completely improve education. Teachers would need to be trained in how to utilize the tool in their curriculum. It would be a great start though, to better educate our students here at home. Let's better educate everyone, everywhere.
