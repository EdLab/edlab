          <p>
            Ching-fu and I have been brainstorming about designing a lightweight, nevertheless powerful, online qualitative research tool.  Why? Because we became tired of jumping back and forth between MS Excel and various web pages.

We tried <a href="http://www.qsrinternational.com/">Nvivo,</a> which is a fantastic software if you have multiple coders and multimedia files but it was too heavy-duty for our project purposes and it took a long time before we actually 'broke into' using it to our advantage.  We tried<a href="http://www.diigo.com"> Diigo</a> - an online social bookmarking, highlighting and note-sharing tool - which is an excellent online data collection tool but didn't support the types of coding and data analysis functions we hoped for.  While we realize the world isn't perfect, we caught ourselves saying too many but's!  So here we are: below is a brief rationale behind our thinking and a graph that attempts to show where we see various tools out there stand.  We included tools that aren't intended for qualitative research but users could still use them for different segments of their analysis process. Keep in mind, this is just an initial shot out for feedback and ideas :)
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>

Qualitative research method is used to describe and understand a social phenomenon and allow study participants to speak for themselves. Qualitative research approaches are naturalistic, emergent and evolving, interpretive, use multiple interactive methods to collect data and emphasize on the context (Rossman &amp; Rallis, 2003, cited in Rossman 2006). Popular data collecting methods in qualitative research include field observations, interviews, focus groups and document analysis. These data are usually analyzed first through open-coding, a process that “fractures the data and allows one to identity some categories, their properties, and dimensional locations” (Strass &amp; Corbin, 1990, p.97). Then axial coding process is followed by reconnecting and interrelating categories and subcategories in order to reach a deeper understanding of the social phenomenon. Qualitative researchers ultimately code their data for variables that can then be subjected to quantitative analyses but there are also many researchers who do not base their conclusions on statistical interpretation.

<strong>PURPOSE</strong>

Currently, the data analysis could be performed manually by researchers or through commercial qualitative research software such as Nvivo and Atlas.ti. However, both approaches fail to meet the needs of small-scale qualitative research projects: manually coding process is laborious while the available software is not accessible for most lower-level graduate students who are researchers-in-training and in need of a user-friendly lightweight tool. Considering that conducting research through online content analysis is a growing area in education research, a web-based tool could potentially increase the efficiency of data collection and analysis. Therefore, developing a new online qualitative research tool that is accessible to all qualitative researchers and which also support webpage content analysis is needed.
