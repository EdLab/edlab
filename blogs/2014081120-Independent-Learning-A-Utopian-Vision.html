<p><b>Title:</b> Informal Learning on YouTube: Exploring Digital Literacy in Independent Online Learning (2014)</p>

<p><b>Author:</b> Elaine Tan</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439884.2013.783594#.U7_8ShZqqgs">Learning, Media & Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do students use YouTube to support their informal independent learning in relation to an ongoing college course?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The author explored how a group of 24 students used YouTube as their independent informal learning experiences in relation to a university-level social science course. In the course, students were provided a selection of YouTube videos as supplementary materials. In the study, students were divided to three separate groups for qualitative interviews. They were directed to group discussions on how they used YouTube for independent learning, how they evaluated their video searches, and how (if applicable) they might share their video resources with peers.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors discovered a distinct variation in students’ YouTube usage between those who tended to consume video content based on peer recommendations and those who were critical video reviewers. The authors uncovered a range of strategies for how students generated their own criteria for critically exploring videos informally and independently, from being able to "just feel" a reliable video, to consciously identifying trusted sources, to paying attention to academic language and multiple perspectives. </p>

<p>In addition, although students were seeking to augment their learning in the classroom by conducting and sharing YouTube searches across multiple digital platforms, they exhibited a strong preference and placed a greater value upon the traditional face-to-face interactions.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> This qualitative study is important for understanding use patterns that students might present in YouTube-based independent learning. For educators, it raises issues about how to combine formal learning experiences and informal independent learning activities and how to utilize students’ learning interactions outside the classroom. It further poses a challenge to content providers and developers by highlighting the need for a video recommendation system that would take account of both content relevance and academic quality.<p>
