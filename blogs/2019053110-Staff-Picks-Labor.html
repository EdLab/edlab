            May 1 marks International Workers' Day, chosen in memory of the <a href="https://library.tc.columbia.edu/search?category=everything&amp;query=haymarket%20affair" target="_blank">Haymarket Affair</a>: a general strike petitioning for the eight hour day set in 1886, the ensuing police violence, and other workers' rallies that followed. With teachers of all levels going on strike around the nation and the world in a fight for fair treatment, this month comes as a reminder of what workers have won and what they have at stake in the future. The idea for this collection began when I came across a children's book about the Los Angeles janitor strike during my first year or so as a services associate. I then learned that a childhood friend's mother and TC alumna, <a href="http://tc.summon.serialssolutions.com.tc.idm.oclc.org/#!/search?ho=t&amp;l=en&amp;q=(AuthorCombined:(lois%20weiner))" target="_blank">Dr. Lois Weiner</a>, has published extensively on unions in education. As an educator and a graduate student myself, it felt important to bring these books front and center while we continue to push for fairness in all fields.

<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2019/05/staff-picks-labor.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-33215"><img class="size-medium wp-image-33215 alignleft" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/staff-picks-labor-300x225.jpg" alt="staff picks labor" width="300" height="225" /></a>

Teachers College has a long history with work and how it is done. From its "<a href="https://pk.tc.columbia.edu/item/Grace-Dodge-Hall:-The-Household-Arts-Building-83638" target="_blank">domestic arts</a>" program to its student organizers, who published newspapers like the <a href="https://pk.tc.columbia.edu/search/?limit=30&amp;p=1&amp;q=%22Educational%20Vanguard%22&amp;targets=tags" target="_blank">Education Vanguard</a> and <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/js5122/staff-picks-april-2018-from-the-classroom-to-the-streets-50-years-of-school-based-activism" target="_blank">stood up for their right to organize</a> on campus, there can be no mistaking the connections between education and the concept of labor as a whole. This has proven true time and time again, as evidenced by this <a href="https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/teacherbeat/teacher-strikes/" target="_blank">list of strikes</a> provided by Education Week.

There are massive movements in higher education spearheaded by adjuncts and graduate workers; CUNY's <a href="https://7korstrike.org/why-7k-or-strike/why-7k/" target="_blank">7k or Strike</a> movement is still pressing on, and Columbia's own graduate student workers' union (GCW-UAW) has been in the bargaining stages since February, according to their <a href="https://columbiagradunion.org/category/bargaining-blog/" target="_blank">Bargaining Blog</a>. Of course, recent movements extend beyond education. In April, Stop &amp; Shop Workers went on strike, while long-time Key Food employees were locked out by their employers. Rideshare drivers also staged a strike earlier this month. It just goes to show how many people it takes to make society run smoothly day to day, and how the people who do this also bear the brunt of inequality.

Below, I have included a list of resources available through the Gottesman Libraries that help us paint a clearer picture of labor history. Many of these resources focus primarily on the United States, but encompasses many lines of undervalued work. If there are perspectives that are missing from our catalog, you can <a href="https://library.tc.columbia.edu/p/request-materials" target="_blank">make a request</a> for new material to be purchased or borrowed via interlibrary loan.
