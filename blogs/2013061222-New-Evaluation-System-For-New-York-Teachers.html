            One of the important things concerning most school districts across the country is the performance of teachers. When I was in high school, some parents would blamed teachers for their children's bad performance in school. For instance, a parent will make the claim that his or her child's teacher can't teach (especially if the teacher is a foreigner) or doesn't understand the materials he or she is teaching. The New York State Board of Education doesn't use parents complains to determine whether a teacher is performing well or not, rather they provide an evaluation sheet for every student to evaluate his or her teacher. Giving students the ability to evaluate their teachers is very important because the students are the ones observing the teachers and learning from them. 

Under a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/nyregion/new-evaluation-system-for-new-york-teachers.html?ref=education&_r=0">new  evaluation system</a> for New York City teachers, 50-60 percent of a teacher's evaluation would be based on students observations or a video recording. Additionally, 20-25 percent of the evaluation would be based on state-approved measures of students' growth of every teacher's rating score, and 15-20 percent would be based on measures established by schools. It is great that the percentage of student's evaluation is much higher that other forms of evaluation because it is the students' voice that needs to be heard. And given that students have other adjectives to describe a teacher's performance other than "satisfactory" and "unsatisfactory" will help schools and the Board of Education determine which rating students associate with a particular teacher. 

From there, the onus falls on the schools to take the necessary action. These are the new ratings that a student can associate his or her teacher with: <b>highly effective, effective, developing, and ineffective</b>. Although this allow teachers to be easily fired, the commissioner insists that "New York is not going to fire its way to education success."
