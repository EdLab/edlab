<a href="http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/d_school/designthinking.html?L=1">The School of Design Thinking at the Hasso-Plattner-Institute</a> (HPI) at the University of Potsdam began in the winter of 2007/2008. Modeled after the d.school at Stanford, it is the first school dedicated to design thinking in Germany. The program offerings at HPI Design School include a basic track and an advanced track, each lasting a full semester. Classes are offered twice a week and all work is done in teams of four or five. One of the exciting elements of HPI is the curriculum. While the method of learning is through collaborative design thinking work, the content is newly designed each semester. Along with the regular staff who teach design methodology, each semester has a rotating selection of professors and teachers from throughout Germany who teach design thinking. The HPI website describes the method as combining "approaches found in design and ethnography with technology and business skills." </p>

<p><b>Transforming Space to Transform Learning</b><br>
The founders of the Potsdam d.School, strongly believe that physical space is an important part of design and collaboration. Different working environments support both physical mobility and adaptability and also multidisciplinary approaches to research. All of the furniture at the Potsdam d.School was designed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.system180.com/english/system180/index.html">System 180</a>, a German company located in Berlin. In keeping with their belief that  "design thinking is the glue that holds different types of disciplines together and makes the project successful," HPI collaborates with many other companies and organizations from a wide range of disciplines. Though the school is rather new, graduates of HPI have already made an impact in several industries. For example <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1718">Dark Horse</a> has been doing significant work around the world using design thinking; all the co-founders graduated from the HPI program.</p>
