<p><a href="http://www.claco.com/">Claco</a> is a learning network site that allows their user base of educators to share learning resources online with other Claco users. This creates a social network of educators sharing learning materials. Users are able to upload learning resources like web links, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> videos, and documents to their online portfolio, which is visible to other Claco users. Keyword tags can be added to the resources for more effective curation and discovery by other users. Users can organize resources by subject, grade level, or other criteria in their portfolio; these collections are called binders. Users share by "snapping" a newly discovered resource to one of their own binders. Easily organizing online resources saves time for educators and helps to organize and rank the resources that are available on Claco.</p>

<p>Claco has a very interesting history. The founder of the site, self-taught programmer Eric Simons, skipped college to make his idea of sharing web resources a reality. For two years, his fledgling site was called ClassConnect. After months of hard work developing his site at <a href=" http://www.imaginek12.com/index.html"> Imagine K12</a> and sleeping on <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-32973_3-57440513-296/meet-the-tireless-entrepreneur-who-squatted-at-aol//">AOL’s couches</a> Simons gathered up enough VC funding to launch a new and improved version of his site. The sleeker new site earned the abbreviated name Claco.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Claco’s strengths lie in the ease of discovery and speed of saving and sharing resources. Claco makes it easy to share materials through the site and through external social networks. Snapping resources found on other portfolios is quick and does not require a download, but the option to download is available. After users have snapped the resources to their portfolio they can share with it other instructors and students. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Claco is still in beta, so users must request access and wait a week to two weeks for access. The site is still looking for passionate educators who can help share quality resources and ensure that the site is robust right from launch. Currently, the newness of the site limits the amount of learning resource content that is available for browsing and sharing in the network. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Claco allows educators to work with their peers and allies on a huge scale to help one another make sense of the vast wilderness of online educational resources. The web is home to an incredible amount of learning content. Modern educators need help sorting through the chaff and finding the ideal resource for their classroom. Collaborating with other educators makes everyone more likely to find new, fresh content that they might not have discovered on their own. As the site grows, Claco should build upon their discovery feature by making recommendations for their users based on their sharing and snapping activity. The site could also match up users who look for similar classroom resources to promote networking and recommendations. Claco can provide a platform for educators to get the exact resources they need and discover new ones with other educators.
</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Claco is a community of educators who love to share online learning content.</p>
