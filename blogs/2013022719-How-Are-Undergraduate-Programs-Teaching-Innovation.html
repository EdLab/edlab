<b>Title:</b> Teaching Students to be Innovators: Examining Competencies and Approaches Across Disciplines <p>

<b>Authors:</b> Nathalie Duval-Couetil & Michael Dyrenfurth 
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> Considering the central role that higher education plays in fostering the skills and knowledge of tomorrow’s work force, there is a growing trend among university programs to foster innovation so that graduates will have the capacity to create new ideas and products once out of school. Despite this burgeoning pedagogical movement, little research exists on postsecondary education geared toward innovation. To fill this gap, Duval-Couetil and Dyrenfurth studied undergraduate programs across the United States that offered an academic credential focused on innovation. The purpose of their study was to understand the overarching objectives of these programs, the degree to which they focus on innovation process versus outcomes, and the extent to which they embraced experiential learning in their curriculum.
<p>
To find programs that fit the parameters of their study, the authors searched online for programs that included the word "innovation." They excluded programs with the word "entrepreneurship" because they believed such programs emphasize innovation outcomes as opposed to the process of innovation. (Innovation process was defined as inputs related to creativity and product development while innovation outcomes were understood as the consequences of innovation.) Their search resulted in three bachelor degree programs, three minors and two certificate programs.
<p> 

<b>Findings:</b>

The authors found that innovation programs varied substantially in terms of length and scope. The bachelor degree programs primarily focused on the innovation process, such as product development and prototyping. The minor and certificate programs were more evenly balanced in terms of innovation process versus innovation outcomes. 

The bachelor degree programs embraced experiential learning through design projects and/or projects with external industry partners, and they tended to comprehensively incorporate innovation throughout their existing courses. This finding contrasted substantially with the elective certificate and minor programs, which tended to embrace optional or "add-on" courses for students.
 <p>
Using a word analysis application called<a href=" http://www.wordle.net/ "> Wordle</a>, the authors discovered that the terms most frequently used to describe the purpose of the innovation-oriented programs included global, creativity and technology. The authors were surprised at the relatively infrequent use of technical terms that could offer insight into hands-on skills that students would obtain through the program. The verdict is still out on whether these programs are missing opportunities to entice students through the use of more precise language, or whether their more general descriptions appealed to a wider student body across disciplines.  

<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>


Considering the growing need to constantly innovate in today’s economy, this timely study offers a starting point to understand and evaluate programs that offer innovation-focused academic credentials. Additional research is necessary to inform future efforts on how to effectively teach innovation across disciplines. Future research might explore the advantages of integrating innovation into already established programs versus offering add-on courses to complement existing curricula.  Studies might also document the learning experiences of students in programs that emphasize innovation, particularly those that emphasize process versus outcomes. Finally, investigators might inquire if employers find graduates from innovation-oriented programs more creative.
