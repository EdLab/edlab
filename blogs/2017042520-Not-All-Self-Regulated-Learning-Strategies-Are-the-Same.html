<p>From traditional learning to blended learning to online learning, it’s no surprise that students use different learning strategies in different educational environments. It’s not clear, however, how those strategies compare among settings. A new study investigated the differences in self-regulated learning between a blended higher education class (one that incorporates both online and face-to-face components) and one fully online.</p>
 
<p>Self-regulated learning refers to the strategies students employ to succeed in a class. These can include methods such as time management, seeking peer help, and summarizing texts. To complete this study, over 600 undergraduate students in either online or blended learning classes were surveyed.</p>
 
<p>The researchers noted several differences in self-regulated learning techniques between blended and fully online learning classes. For one, they found that students in fully online courses employed self-regulated learning strategies far more than those in blended learning. This is likely because greater freedom in an online course necessitates more student-created strategies to succeed.</p>
 
<p>The study also highlighted which strategies were most commonly implemented in each environment. In both groups, students were most likely to use elaboration, time management, and effort regulation. All self-regulated learning strategies were more frequently used in online learning environments except for peer learning and help seeking, which were used more in blended learning classes. This is likely because students in fully online classes tend to feel less of a sense of community than students in face-to-face settings.</p>
 
<p>As more college classes are moving to blended learning or fully online models, it’s important to understand the methods students use to succeed in each context. By knowing the self-regulated learning strategies students are more likely to use in a given setting, course designers can better construct classes that meet the needs of students specific to the learning environment.</p>
