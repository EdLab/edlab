<p>The development of robots and artificial intelligence is divisive, leaving many people excited about the prospects of human-robot interactions and many others afraid for humanity’s future. Robotic engineer <a href="http://www.geminoid.jp/en/index.html">Hiroshi Ishiguro</a> believes the best way to bridge this divide is to create social, artificially intelligent robots that look exactly like humans. One of his recent projects is a social robot named Erica, which was featured on a recent episode of <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/year-million/">National Geographic’s Year Million series</a>. Ishiguro’s goal in creating Erica was to blur the line between humans and humanoid androids.</p>

<p>As social robots become more prominent fixtures in our lives (such as in <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3675/how-user-created-social-robots-are-finding-work-at-the-library">libraries</a>, <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4340/this-robot-breaks-down-social-barriers-for-children-with-autism">special needs classrooms</a>, and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3833/one-hospitals-newest-staff-member-is-a-robot">hospitals</a>), some engineers and designers believe that they need to become more humanlike in order to seamlessly integrate into humanity. Yet others worry that creating robots that look <i>too human</i> will land these bots into the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/04/why-we-dont-trust-robots">Uncanny Valley</a>, where robots with too many human characteristics suddenly become incredibly creepy. Still others believe that if robots become too human, we might trust them to a fault and wind up in situations like those depicted in <i><a href="http://www.herthemovie.com/#/home">Her</a></i> and <i><a href="hhttp://exmachina-movie.com">Ex Machina</a></i>. Regardless of your view, as robots are given more human characteristics, it might cause us to reexamine what it means to be human.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on humanlike robots? Should we be aiming for complete human-robot integration, or is there such a thing as robots that are too human? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/37367/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:00 RuthS:</b> There is a phenomenon known as Uncanny Valley Theory that designers should be cautious of when creating robots that look too human. The idea is that we like robots/tech to have human characteristics, but only to a certain extent. When they get too human, we are repulsed by them. As amazing as this robot is, I feel like it's pushing into the Uncanny Valley territory.</p>

<p><b>@01:23 dinosossi2:</b> There's really not a way for robots to copy the utter complexity of human beings, no matter how sophisticated they become.</p>
