            I think we can all agree that the United States education system is more focus on the performance of students through test taking. In other words, students in the U.S are judged according to their test performances. This ideology is somewhat good and at the same time very discouraging. This concept is good because the scores is a reflection on what students have learned throughout the school year. Moreover, it allows the school to distinguish between students who are prepared for the next level and those who are not. Conversely, judging students by their test performance can become discouraging because a student might feel that he or she is not intelligent if they fail or don't perform well on the test. However, there can be other factors that may have led to a student's poor performance on the test, and this is something that a lot of people fail to take into consideration.

In this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/nyregion/under-new-standards-students-see-sharp-decline-in-test-scores.html?_r=0">article</a>, education officials reported that the number of New York students who passed both the state math and reading exams this year dropped drastically. Officials believe the reason behind the students' bad performances is because the exam was aligned with a more difficult set of standards known as the Common Core. As a result, officials have concluded that students are not well prepared for questions or problems that requires deep analysis and creative problem solving over short answers and memorization. 

I agree because I believe a lot of students struggle with this portion of learning, including myself. The astonishing part about this news is the numbers. Statistically, students who passed this year's English tests were around 26 percent while last year 47 percent of city students passed the English tests because it was easier. In the math portion, 30 percent of students passed this year and 60 percent passed last year, a huge 30 percent difference. When we shift our focus to race or color, the gap between the achievement of Blacks and Hispanics compared to that of Whites and Asians persisted in the sense that White and Asian students did better than Black and Hispanic students. The question now becomes, what can officials  do to make sure that the passing rates for the English and Math state exam increases as the years go by, especially now that the exams has become a little tougher.
