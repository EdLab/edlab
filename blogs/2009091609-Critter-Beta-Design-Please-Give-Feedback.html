          <p>
            Hi Everyone,

Zhou, Jeannie and I  have just completed a preliminary design of the next version of Critter that we hope to implement this semester. This design is based on all of the great feedback that we got from everyone over the summer, as well as our own research on the technical/functional details of different enhancements. Here are some highlights of the changes we have made so far:

- The tool is intended to integrate better with the outside world. In particular, it is designed to work with existing social networks, rather than trying to be a social network on its own. In that respect, we envision Critter being an embeddable social application (similar in this respect to YouTube), rather than a social platform that stands on its own.

- We have really focused on the discussion analytics paradigm and hope to extend this further. The idea is that lots of people discussing videos provides a valuable knowledge base that we can use to identify useful parts of a video or to search a large library of content. We are trying to integrate tools that help users harness this collective knowledge.

- We've tried to improve the commenting process with many features such as threaded comments, a new UI for posting comments, and comments where you ask other discussants questions.

In our summer seminar, we had identified many potential classes of users, including people annotating videos for ethnographic purposes and classroom teachers using them for instruction. Our focus is specifically on distance learning, enhanced classroom instruction and professional community audiences. Nevertheless, we hope the features and design are flexible to support user "misuse" of the tool in novel ways (borrowing an idea from our last seminar).

Before we jump in to coding, we though this was a good checkpoint to get people's feedback one more time. Please read through the attached document when you have a few minutes, focusing especially on part 2 that describes the functional design of Critter. Be as critical as possible. In addition to general comments, please help us to answer some of the following questions:

- Is the use of the overall tool coherent and clear?
- Does the tool provide the features needed to make a powerful learning experience, especially in distance learning, video-supported in-class instruction, and communities of practice?
- Are we missing something that is really really important?
- Do we have some features that you feel are unnecessary or overkill?

We look forward to hearing from you.
