          <p>
            As a U.S citizen, you have the right to vote if qualified.  Many years ago, minorities, mostly African Americans didn't have the privilege of deciding their leaders. However through different movements led by great leaders, the 15th amendment to the US Constitution prohibited the government from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude.‚Äù The 15thamendment was part of the reconstruction amendments following the Civil War.

Next year, I would also have the privilege to enjoy this right after I turn 18. It is a very important step I'll be taking because I would be more involved in the political life of my nation. In order for me to make a more informed decision as a voter, I have to watch the presidential debates,find ways to relate to the different programs and ideas each candidate is proposing and how I will be eventually affected by this. 

I see voting as a responsibility because one cannot be ignorant about the political happenings in their country so it is important to partake in such activities because the end result affects us all. Every vote counts so therefore my vote will change someone's life one way or the other. The winner of an election might be a major factor in whether a citizen gets a good job in the future. My job is to make the right decision based on what would be best for me and the country as a whole.
