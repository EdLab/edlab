<b>Title:</b> The Double-Edged Effects of Explanation Prompts (2011)<p>
<b>Author(s):</b>Kirsten Berthold, Heidi Röder, Daniel Knörzer, Wolfgang Kessler, & Alexander Renkl</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Sometimes hints and well-timed explanations are necessary in learning, but this is not always clear as learning tasks become more complex. When working with a complicated and murky subject, additional information in the form of explanation prompts can overload cognitive capacity and confuse instead of foster learning. This study examines the effects of prompts on the murkiest of all subjects: tax law. In this experiment, 40 subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received explanation prompts while learning from a tax law e-module; the other received no prompts. The groups were tested for conceptual knowledge with 4 essay questions and for procedural knowledge with 4 scenarios. The results of these tests were then coded by 2 tax law specialists for accuracy. 
</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results show that explanation prompts are a double-edged sword. The answers given by the prompts group were more detailed and elaborate than the control group. They were also more factually accurate, but the prompts group performed much more slowly than the control group due to a greater number of calculations performed in the process of solving each question. The prompts group was also hindered when it came to the procedural questions, because the explanation prompts were less helpful with, and perhaps distracted from, applied knowledge.
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The results of this study are important for the design of online instructional courses. Explanation prompts and other guided answering strategies can be helpful when information depends on factual accuracy, but can be overwhelming when the information becomes more complex and focuses on procedures. The study also calls into question whether we should be testing fact-based information at all. Sure, the experiment showed a clear computer-assisted advantage in producing fact-based answers. But when teaching for a computer-assisted future, shouldn’t we always assume this advantage and instead focus teaching efforts on interpretation and procedure-oriented skills that can be translated into real-world practice?
