<p><a href="https://dataskeptic.com/podcast">Data Skeptic</a> is a weekly podcast that introduces high-level concepts in data science and features interviews with researchers. While the organization’s main output is the podcast, they also offer articles explaining data, statistical methods, and a range of new technologies.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The podcast dives deep into the technical aspects of concepts like machine learning and  artificial intelligence. Often, the hosts bring on researchers, scholars, or other experts to talk about their work involving complex data science. These conversations tend to be in-depth and quite technical. I especially enjoyed the episode with a <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/zillow-zestimate">data scientist from Zillow</a> talking about how the real estate tech company "Zestimates" the market.</p>   

<p>Intently listening to episodes provides knowledge of some of the most advanced concepts in tech and research, such as <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/zillow-zestimate">quantum computing</a>, a topic that I’ve been trying to <a href="
https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5025/what-is-quantum-computing">wrap my head around</a>. Since the episodes are so technical, the host sometimes provides short intros to topics before the conversations begin. These segments help the listener stay on the same page as the speakers.</p>

<p>Kyle Polich hosts the main podcast episodes in which he interviews other data scientists. He and his wife, Linh Da Tran, co-host the mini-episodes. I actually prefer these mini-episodes. Linh Da is not a data scientist, so Kyle explains difficult concepts to her in ways that I can understand. She also asks questions that I am also thinking about during technical conversations that are over my head.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Data Skeptic’s in-depth coverage of difficult topics is both its strength and weakness. The main podcast is explicitly geared for people who have some background in statistics. While I am fairly conversant in basic statistical methods, even I found some of the concepts discussed on the podcast challenging to comprehend. </p>

<p>My favorite thing about podcasts is that they don’t call for the strict focus of audiobooks. With a podcast, I can swing in and out of the conversation. But, because of the dense and technical nature of the topics, Data Skeptic is more akin to an audiobook. If I don’t pay careful attention to the conversation, I immediately get lost.</p>    

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you already have a background in data, stats, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, then Data Skeptic will be a great resource for you. You will love the depth of the conversations and the fact that the content is not dumbed down. However, for novices or others with limited experience in these areas, Data Skeptic’s podcasts might be too tedious to fully enjoy.</p>
