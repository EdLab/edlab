<b>Description:</b>
This article describes the reorganization of the University of Northern Colorado Libraries and the unit tasked with rethinking processes surrounding e-resource delivery. Much like our library, the University of Northern Colorado moved from a specific e-resources unit to a large-scale concentrated effort by all technical services staff during times of increased demand. The solution they developed, much like DocDel, was meant to organize electronic holdings, allow for e-order forms, and facilitate the accessibility of these orders. 

The technical services unit also developed a system in Access to organize the regular troubleshooting of e-journal access. The database lists all subscribed e-journals and leads a technician through the process of checking the resource and reporting that it has performed as expected or identifying issues in access. Error reports were immediately forwarded to the appropriate librarian for troubleshooting. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
This article describes another library that used homebuilt (albeit less elegant) systems to organize e-resource workflows. Of particular interest to me was the Access form for serials troubleshooting. This is a process that is fairly unorganized at our library and is soon to lose all regular staff. This is a particular problem as the University of Northern Colorado reported that their first full-scale check, even with their developed system, took 72-180 hours total. 

At this point, we're relying primarily on student-reported errors, which are admittedly fallible. Though our journals do not fail often, the troubleshooting process can be lengthy and it's worth it to catch errors as soon as possible. Perhaps a future iteration of DocDel could contain a “report errors” bar for staff users. I think reporting this while fulfilling for DocDel might be the best way to catch errors in our most-used resources during their most-used times while only marginally increasing work loads for staff.
