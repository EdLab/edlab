            <a href="http://daniel.fallman.org">Professor Daniel Fallman</a> is giving a talk tomorrow called "Designing Interactions Beyond Desktop and Mobile." He's done some neat work in HCI, and it should have some good ideas (particularly around methodology) for our work. Details and abstract are below.

<b>When:</b> 1:30pm, Wednesday, July 9, 2014

<b>Where:</b> 620 Schapiro CEPSR, Columbia University

<b>Host:</b> Columbia Vision and Graphics Center

<b>Abstract</b>
The next great frontier in Interaction Design and Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI) is the move beyond the screens of our laptops,
tablets, and mobile phones out into the environment; that is, to blend
interaction, information, and data with the activities and experiences
that users have "in the wild".  Over the last decade, my research group
has been involved in a large number of such projects in areas as diverse
as highly automated manufacturing and process industries; extreme sports
environments including downhill mountain biking and climbing; as well as
various kinds of public installations and interactive experiences.

In this seminar, I will present a number of these projects and discuss
them in relation to current HCI research, focusing primarily on issues
such as involvement, engagement, and user experience. I will also
discuss four perspectives that we believe are important in conducting
this kind exploratory research: first, a methodological approach for
dealing and coping with the complexities of what I call 'third wave
HCI"; second, the role of strong concepts as a driving force behind our
work; third, a purpose-based model intended to shed light on how we can
think about and discuss the quality of our activities and resulting
designs; and fourth, an ideal-driven, theoretical stance as an example
of how a high-level, guiding design principle can be established.

<b>Bio</b>

Daniel Fallman, Ph.D., is a Full Professor of HCI in the Department of
Informatics at Umea University, Sweden, and Chairman of the Senior
Research Group at Interactive Institute Swedish ICT in Stockholm,
Sweden. Fallman has more than 10 years experience in building up and
leading high-performing creative teams in between academia and industry,
combining deep technology skills with design thinking, methods, and
skills. His own research interests are in the confluence of Computer
Science, HCI, and Design and include new interaction technologies and
interaction styles; sketching techniques for interaction designers;
heavy phenomenological concepts such as embodiment, involvement, and
meaning; and digital innovation and entrepreneurship. He has published
over 60 academic articles in leading international journals and
conferences. In 2010, Fallman was named one of 18 Future Research
Leaders in Sweden by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.
