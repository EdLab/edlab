<strong>Title:</strong> The Teacher and the World: A Study of Cosmopolitanism as Education

<strong>Author: </strong>David T. Hansen

<strong>Publisher: </strong>Routledge

<strong>Call Number: LC 191. H2595 2001</strong>

Teachers the world over are seeking creative ways to respond to the  problems and possibilities generated by globalization. Many of them work  with children and youth from increasingly varied backgrounds, with  diverse needs and capabilities. Others work with homogeneous populations  and yet are aware that their students will encounter many cultural  changes in their lifetimes. All struggle with the contemporary  conditions of teaching: endless top-down measures to manipulate what  they do, rapid economic turns and inequality in supportive resources  that affect their lives and those of their students, a torrent of media  stimuli that distract educational focus, and growth as well as shifts in  population.

In <em>The Teacher and the World</em>,  David Hansen provides teachers with a way to reconstruct their  philosophies of education in light of these conditions. He describes an  orientation toward education that can help them to address both the  challenges and opportunities thrown their way by a globalized world.  Hansen builds his approach around cosmopolitanism, an ancient idea with  an ever-present and ever-beautiful meaning for educators. The idea  pivots around educating for what the author calls reflective openness to  new people and new ideas, and reflective loyalty toward local values,  interests, and commitments.

The book shows how this  orientation applies to teachers at all levels of the system, from  primary through university. Hansen deploys many examples to illustrate  how its core value, a balance of reflective openness to the new and  reflective loyalty to the known, can be cultivated while teaching  different subjects in different kinds of settings. The author draws  widely on the work of educators, scholars in the humanities and social  sciences, novelists, artists, travellers and others from both the  present and past, as well as from around the world. These diverse  figures illuminate the promise in a cosmopolitan outlook on education in  our time.

In this pioneering book, Hansen has provided  teachers, heads of school, teacher educators, researchers, and  policy-makers a generative way to respond creatively to the pressure and  the promise of a globalizing world.
