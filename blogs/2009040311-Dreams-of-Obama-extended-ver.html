            Following up on <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2349>George's post about Barack Obama resources</a>, this post is a showcase of how evri widget's “search less; understand more” concept could help. My motivation for keep mentioning ‘learning a new subject through making sensible connections' is reported very well in an EdWeek article, <a href=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/03/26/26quality.h28.html><i>Hunting the Internet for Quality Content</i></a>.   
  
Back to Obama: currently, evri allows business partners and individual bloggers to embed <a href= http://www.evri.com/partners-and-bloggers.html>the widget in three different formats</a>: single subject, sidebar recommendations, and popover recommendations.
  
In order to try it out, we first need content and below I copied George's post from Jan. 21: 

<blockquote>In the midst of the hoopla surrounding Obama's inauguration, PBS' Frontline premiered its biographical documentary of Obama, titled Dreams of Obama. The documentary highlights Obama's meteoric rise from community organizer to Illinois State Senator to the Presidency. Drawing largely from Obama's first autobiography, Dreams From My Father, Dreams of Obama starts with Obama's coming out party as a political star at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, where he delivered the keynote address,The Audacity of Hope, which served as the title of his second autobiography. 

The film follows Obama's early political career through interviews and insights from the people who have come to form the core of his advisors, e.g. chief strategist David Axelrod. The most interesting aspect of the documentary was the behind the scenes look at the key moments in Obama's campaign for the White House: his initial hesitation about running for the presidency, how to deal with the racist comments of his pastor, Reverend Wright and how the economic downtown last fall changed the face of his race against Senator John McCain. 

It offers a different perspective from the Obama that has been dominating the news the past few days: his personal struggle to reconcile his diverse racial background, learning to serve as a conciliatory between two opposing views during his years at Harvard Law, and using his momentum from the Democratic Convention as a stepping stone to the US Senate and subsequently to the Presidency. 

EdLab's research and development is working on a resource about Obama and many of the themes his name inspires. The themes in the documentary are yet another avenue the EdLab can consider in drawing up the resource. </blockquote>
