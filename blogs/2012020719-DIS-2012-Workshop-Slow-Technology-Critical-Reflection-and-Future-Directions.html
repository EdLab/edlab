            <strong>DIS 2012 Workshop: Slow Technology: Critical Reflection and Future Directions</strong> (June 12, 2012, Newcastle, UK)

Website: <a href="http://www.willodom.com/slowtechnology/">http://www.willodom.com/slowtechnology/</a>

Deadline for workshop submissions: March 20, 2012

In their seminal article on Slow Technology, Hallnäs and Redström (2001)  argue that the increasing availability of technology in environments  outside of the workplace requires interaction design practice to be  expanded from creating tools to make people's lives more efficient to  "creating technology that surrounds us and therefore is part of our  activities for long periods of time." These authors outline a design  agenda aimed at inverting values of efficient performance and  emphasizing creating technologies that support moments of reflection,  mental rest, slowness and solitude. Over a decade later, these issues  remain areas of inquiry in the HCI and design communities, and there has  recently been a resurgence of work in this area. The core goal of this  one-day workshop is to critically reflect on the work that has emerged  since Slow Technology was originally proposed to forge understanding of  the challenges, limitations and opportunities characterizing the  contemporary design space.

March 20, 2012: submissions due
April 16, 2012: accepted submissions notified
June 12, 2012: workshop held in Newcastle, UK

WORKSHOP SUBMISSIONS
We invite participants to submit a short written position paper as well  as a depiction of an artifact perceived to be constitutive of Slow  Technology. The written portion consists of a short 1-2 page submission  formatted using the ACM DIS 2012 template that responds to the statement  "Slow Technology is…" This introductory statement is intended to  provoke the author(s) to take a specific position on the Slow Technology  agenda and offer their conceptualization of what Slow Technology is.  This workshop paper could (but is not required to) use the author(s) own  philosophical, theoretical, empirical, or design/craft-based work to  support their position.

The artifact submission is intended to be something that the authors  deem constitutive of Slow Technology. These could include a personal  object (e.g., personal reflection on a family heirloom), experiential  accounts of "slow practices" (e.g., use of cooking tools for elaborate  meal preparation), analysis of design research artifacts that  incorporate the theme of "slowness" (e.g., an artifact built by the  author), or existing artistic works that can offer commentary and  inspiration that explores slowness (e.g. a painting or documentation of a  performance piece). The artifact may be depicted pictorially.
We encourage submissions from diverse backgrounds including (but not  limited to): art and design, the humanities, the social sciences, the  information sciences, and industrial engineering. Industry and  non-profit organizations are similarly encouraged. Submissions will be  selected based on originality, quality, and potential to generate  discussion. Both completed and in-progress work is welcome.

THEMES
Some themes for submissions include:

**Consumption of objects and technologies**
There exist a range of work in the HCI and design communities exploring  how emotional attachment to technologies might extend their longevity  and increase their value. How are existing frameworks of emotional  attachment used in designing for longer term interactions with  technologies? What are the limitations to this approach? How does design  promote reflection on or address current trends of planned  obsolescence, both business models and social expectations? And, how  might more systemic or service-oriented approaches complement a move  towards designing for developing enduring attachment?

**Legacy and consideration of multiple generations**
As technologies and systems are interacted with over relatively long  periods of time, questions of how they will be passed down to future  generations are becoming increasingly important. In what ways can both  digital data and interactive products be designed with notions of  sentimentality and persistence across multiple generations in mind? To  what extent should interaction designers take into account the  responsibility of supporting the lives of future generations into their  practice? What are the practical, ethical, and/or moral issues of doing  so?

**Slowness and reflection**
Slow technologies can aim to invert values of efficiency in the service  of supporting experiences of pause, contemplation, and reflection.  Considered in contrast to efficiency and productivity, what role might  "slowness" through design play in contexts including the home, the  neighborhood, and the workplace? What kinds of interaction mechanisms  and functionalities characterize Slow Technologies? In what ways do they  compare or contrast to contemporary consumer technologies?

**Infrastructural, engineering and technical concerns**
Designing material technologies that can support slowness both raises  questions and requires solutions regarding distinct technical  challenges. What kinds of new hardware and software will be required for  technologies to persist over longer periods of time? How is the  durability of information and materials handled effectively and  appropriately over time? To what extent can digital data and hardware be  designed to endure over time?

**Theoretical &amp; ethnographic accounts of slowness**
Case studies and theoretical accounts of existing people and practices  can help inform the various strands of slow design. For example, how can  rich accounts of durable / non-durable practices (e.g., passing down  heirlooms; purging basements of unwanted clutter) inform slow technology  design practice?
