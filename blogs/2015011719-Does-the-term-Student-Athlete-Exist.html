          <p>
            Fans form an integral part of high school and college athletics. Most fans are probably even more passionate than some of the athletes. A <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/12/us/ncaa-athletic-academic-balance-monmouth-poll/" target = "blank"> recent poll</a> found that fans are beginning to feel there is no need to use the term "student-athlete". They argue that schools do not provide athletes with a decent education. College athletes try to balance their academics with sports but end up leaning more towards the sports. This is largely due to dreams of going professional. However, fewer than 2% of college athletes are likely to make it to the pros. Others also believe it is the duty of the NCAA to implement policies that will monitor the academic progress of student athletes and ensure that schools recognize the need to balance academics with sports.
<p>
I believe a student's passion to play sports should be balanced with acquiring a proper education. Statistics have shown that making it to the pros is very unlikely. It is therefore necessary for college athletes to focus on academics. If a college athlete balances academics and sports and eventually makes it to the pros, the degree that was obtained in college might come in very handy after retirement.
