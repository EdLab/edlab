<p><a href="http://brainfeed.org/">Brainfeed</a> is an app that provides 2,000+ educational videos to inform and entertain kids ages seven and up. The video library covers a wide variety of topics, from earth science and astronomy to music and language. All videos are child-friendly and under ten minutes long. A limited number of videos are available for free and access to the entire library costs $1.99 a month.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>There is a lot of concern as of late about the lack of regulation of <a href="https://qz.com/1500662/the-world-of-kids-on-youtube-is-wild-weird-and-almost-entirely-unregulated/">kids youtube</a>, from inappropriate or even predatory content and comments, to uncontrolled advertising. Brainfeed, therefore, is a great library for parents who are looking for video platforms with guaranteed age-appropriate content. Especially because all content is explicitly educational, Brainfeed offers the additional benefit of being a source of learning as well as entertainment.</p>

<p>The platform is easy to navigate; all content is organized by category (such as science, language, and social studies) and then by subcategory (such as chemistry, famous authors, and geography). The videos themselves are taken from popular and high-quality producers, such as TedX and National Geographic, so Brainfeed’s content is of good value despite not being on a mainstream platform.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While I liked the videos I watched on Brainfeed, I can’t see it ever competing with YouTube, primarily because of its limited scope. It’s not the sort of library of videos you go to if you’re interested in learning something specific. For instance, while you can generally scroll through many videos of mammals, the search function turns up nothing if you type in the word "sloth." Without any series of strictly entertaining shows to follow, Brainfeed’s educational offerings really need to be more expansive to satisfy users long-term.</p>

<p>Though this is small, I found it odd that there are no dates associated with the videos. For adults wishing to gauge relevance for their kids, or for older kids who might be more interested in the timeline of discoveries, dates might be a nice addition.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If purchased with the intention of giving children free-reign on a video platform that has the capacity to teach them about the world around them, Brainfeed is a great choice. However, due to its limitations, it is unlikely to satisfy the interests of voracious young consumers of non-fiction videos as well as those less interested in perusing strictly non-fiction content.</p>
