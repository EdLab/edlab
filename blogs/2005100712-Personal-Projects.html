            i started thinking over some pet project ideas and i realized i didn't have a great sense of what we do and don't do.  so i thought i'd spill out some of the thoughts running through my head when i was at work and see what comes of it :) i'm hoping something here will encourage interest from others.
Please let me know what you think!!!

Electronic Education and Moral Education
how will electronic schools and online classes create/instill/enforce norms and values? (will they create new ones or new patterns of norms?) in the whole durkheimian scheme of things, how can electronic schools promote moral education?  if a model of electronic schools without classrooms and typical social settings creates new problems, how can we address this?  are there solutions from the new social networking ideas?

New Textbooks
There is an interesting program called SAGrader designed by a sociology professor to grade his students papers.  Can we combine this with say Wikipedia and other sources via dynamic scripting and information aggregation to have a general sociology text?  i see this as a text that presents the user with base information but allows the student to guide the book into which specific topics the student finds interesting.  The book could then dynamically collect information on those topics to (1) present to the student (2) dynamically create rubrics for essay grading on those topics by the 'text' (3) what else could it do?  could the text tie into a social network to promote discussion and group learning?  Do we need/How can we tie in experts to ensure quality of information?

Since we were just talking about it...
Here are what I believe to be some of the interesting components specific to electronic education and electronic education tools. What else comes up?  What are some potential questions regarding methodology?:
(1) tests can adjust to the test-taker (brigham young university was one of the first to do this for language - maybe in general - and their software is still pretty good)
(2) easy to add contex to readings and the like.  by binding the internet and intelligent programs to a reading list, a computer may be able to effectively suggest related readings that add context to a piece (maybe even by just crawling edu sites and looking for professors suggested contextual readings).
(3) nonlinearity compared to traditional books/tests/etc.
(4) in electronic testing situations the pace of the exam can be controlled.  i can - and probably would - force short pauses between questions to slow the pace or something....
(5) an electronic test can interact as it goes.  electronic exams can explain after each test question "you were wrong, this is the correct answer, this is the hole you likely fell in..."

To me the last point begs a research question.  How does the manner and rate of evaluation response affect student approach.  The typical school approach has had a down period between testing and receiving test results.  What happens when that time period is shortened? What happens when the time period is collapsed altogether in the case of immediate response?  Does it increase the affect of testing on our perception of ability/skill/knowledge?  Does it create an artificial inflation?

New Standards
For the new archive, what else can we add that promotes sharing of information.  We've already decided to include xml documentation so that anyone can download all the file/tag/etc information in one easy format.  RSS feeds will further this so that any other site that wishes to reference our knowledge will be able to easily do so (essentially though an xml protocol).  If we believe in GLATas (I still use the name of my favorite cow) can we use the archive to promote and set standards for better sharing or knowledge or at least knowledge structure and reference in that case that copyrights prevent the former?  What other standards do we want to see in educational knowledge sharing?  Can we develop standards that allowed individuals to more easily share their knowledge in multiple locations without pasting and copying all day?  Would the standard instead just allow aggregators to be more effective in joining the info for a single user?

Portfolios
I really like the portfolio idea that everyone has been talking about.  There's probably a lot of ways to think about the creative side. Maybe instead of a static menu system the interface is a documentary style movie which responds to user clicks so that you can choose which topics to view in depth and which not to.  But really I like to leave this side of things to those who know what they're doing :) Two small ideas we could pursue from here though are:
(1) Pushing the archive to be more than creatively stored creative content.  Can we make the archive work for the members, actively promoting their work?  Northeastern in Boston is (from what I hear at least) taking a similar approach in that they are developing a strong focus on internships/jobs by extending the number of years it takes to get a diploma.  I guess the idea is that you still get 4 years of education but now you are guarenteed at least a year of professional experience in positions which the university uses its leverage to aquire.  How off topic this idea is depends on what we view the goals of education to be I guess, but given the increase of web hirings can we find a good way to utilize this archive and maybe even automate the promotion of work process?  Maybe the argument is that the job market is a knowledge base and why ask each student to reinvent the wheel when we can streamline some of the process.
(2) Can we make digital art more accessible to all people?  What if all you needed was a computer and the internet (no extra software or digital cameras) to create new media and share it with the community?  Brian and I talked a bit about the possibilities for (limited) online video editing.  Could this be taken farther to make this field accessible to a larger group?  Could this be integrated with social networking software to create a digital artist guild?

Dynamic Classification of Academic Articles (How Can I be Notified when an Article from an Outside Field is Relevant?)
the same issue we discussed a little while ago: can we use LSA and grouping methods to have computer driven dynamic tagging and classification?  can we make a computer do what people on del.icio.us do for academic classification and browsal?
