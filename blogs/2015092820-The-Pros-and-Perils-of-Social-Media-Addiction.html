<p>Just how wired are teens? <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/">A recent Pew study reports</a> that 92% of teens go online daily including 24% who are online "almost constantly." Given that teens are among Facebook’s 1 billion users and Snapchat’s 4 billion, and that many will eventually attend college, this raises questions regarding this use of technology. For example, peer habits and socioeconomic status can impact both the type of social media use as well as its degree. A new study concerning predictors of smartphone and Facebook use teases out the ways one group—African American young adults—engages with technology and social media. According to the study, 71% of African-Americans own smartphones, a rate greater than the general population. Their consumption of social media is also higher.</p>

<p>The study focused on possible predictors of social media overuse on smartphones and Facebook. The sample included 304 African American students enrolled at a large historically black college. The research examined demographic and personality traits of the participants. The study further investigated how this overuse may impact college academic performance. Results were based on addiction surveys that collected data on demographics, smartphone ownership, volume of communication, GPA, and personality traits. </p>

<p>In terms of smartphones, age and gender are key predictors of overuse. For example, younger students and females spent much more time on their mobile devices than other study participants. In contrast, gender was not a significant predictor of Facebook usage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the data demonstrates that a noticeable minority of participants overused both types of technology as compared to their peers. More specifically, 10% of respondents showed high levels of Facebook addiction while 11% showed similar patterns of addiction to smartphones. </p>

<p>From the personality and psychological traits canvassed, social interaction anxiety was a key indicator of heavy technology use. Other factors—such as agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion and neuroticism—were less indicative.</p>

<p>In terms of technology use in academic settings, participants frequently multitasked with social media and mobile phones in class. However, this multitasking did not appear to impact their academic performance. This contrasts with another study involving African American and Hispanic teens regarding <a href="http://jbs.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/16/0021934713519819.full.pdf"> Facebook use and math achievement</a>. Perhaps in a digital world, multitasking skills increasingly overlap with academic ones. </p>

<p>This study suggests that educators at all levels need to be vigilant about student technology overuse. Although personality and psychological traits such as social interaction anxiety could prove useful in predicting who could have a higher incidence rate of addiction, accessing this type of data may be problematic because it is not normally collected. Even if it was, disclosure laws would limit the scope of its application, and profiling students based on these traits could have discriminatory implications. Although the physical behavior of users can tip off their smartphone habits, those with more acute social skills may know to mask their behavior, making discovery of addiction problematic. Perhaps the solution is to provide students with information in a supportive, non-judgmental manner that will allow them to self-identify social media addictive tendencies on their own terms.</p>
