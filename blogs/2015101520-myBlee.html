<p>The <a href="http://www.myblee.info/us/">myBlee</a> suite of applications focuses on helping kids (ages 5 to 12) learn math through customized activities for both home and school use. Developed by teachers, myBlee offers a single solution with multiple paths to support personalized classroom learning. On the other end, students can create individual accounts tailored to their age group, and then they can start exploring what the myBlee Math app has to offer. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>There are a variety of math topics to try. Some include measuring length or volume and mass; other activities involve using tables and graphs. The interface is easy to use, plus there are simple but engaging visuals and interactive elements, such as working out math problems on digital "scrap paper" and a friendly lion named Albert who appears in the activities for younger children. These elements draw kids in and keep them interested in using the app. Kids of all ages can win badges and trophies, while their parents can track their progress and choose whether or not they would like the activities to align with Common Core standards. myBlee Math comes with a bonus K-6 app where kids can explore subjects such as English, history, or physics. </p>

<p><b>Cons: </b></p>

<p>There are pricey subscription plans for these apps—$9.99 per month or $74.99 per year. Although you’re able to use many of the features of myBlee Math for free, the history and physics activities are locked in the free version of the K-6 app. Also, the voice that narrates all the activities is very robotic sounding; some words are even pronounced incorrectly. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway: </b></p>

<p>Overall, the features of myBlee Math make this a valuable learning tool that parents and children can share together. There is a good deal of basic math experience to gain in the free version, and it’s a good way to try out myBlee before paying for other subject activities. Best of all, kids don’t have to do the activities in any specific order, so they’re able to work at a pace that feels comfortable to them. </p>
