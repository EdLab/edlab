<p>The University of Wisconsin offers a service learning class that prepares students to lead their own coding club in the local community. The class teaches them how to explain concepts clearly and succinctly as well as develop the interpersonal skills needed for classroom management. In the after school club, they lead a group of elementary school students as they create animations and games using the Scratch programming language. Some students have been so inspired by the experience that they started coding clubs in their own home towns.</p>

<p>The hope is that when young kids meet and interact with college students in STEM fields, they will be inspired to pursue a similar path. Itâ€™s clear that many of the students enjoyed the experience and appreciate the effort put in by their club leaders.</p>

<p>How would a class like this foster the professional development of college students? What impact do you think the coding club has on elementary school students? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47955">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:13 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> I think this experience would really benefit computer science students. The college students not only have to know how to code, they need to know how to teach clearly and simply, foresee questions, and push the young kids to achieve their potential. Whether or not they teach in the future, this seems like a great experience!</p>

<p><b>@02:49 Sara Hardman:</b> The kids are learning how to code, but in addition, they see themselves in the college students a bit, and because of that they're inspired to think about their own futures.</p>
