          <p>
            My father recently informed me during one of our conversations about how he heard a <a href= http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/nyregion/70-students-at-stuyvesant-to-retake-exams-after-cheating-case.html?_r=1&hp>story</a> on the radio about a group of high school students in a New York area school used their smartphones to cheat on a state exam. With this in mind, I was curious to read and learn more about the story as I found it interesting and relevant to the EdLab. To my surprise, the school was Stuyvesant High School in lower Manhattan, one of the country's most prestigious public schools. The situation apparently came to light after one of the students had their phone confiscated and in the process school officials discovered he had messages and pictures with answers to the test that he had shared through text messages.
 
There are several items up for debate in terms of the punishment for the students caught cheating such as whether they should retake the courses. What is even more surprising is the fact that this is not the first time this has occurred as Stuyvesant has been having this same problem for some years, which leaves you thinking whether students have been really learning. The advancement of technology has made it easier for students to cheat these days and this, coupled with the idea that it serves as a distraction on school grounds, is one of the main reasons why the NYC's Department of Education does not allow cellphones in schools.
 
Is technology the sole reason for this trend among students and what are some possible solutions?
