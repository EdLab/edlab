That is what 2nd grader Tyler Rodriguez said after his teacher asked her students how many had never been inside a car. Ever. 

Students entering P.S. 142 are not only behind in academic basics but also lack basic experiences: being read to regularly, having conversations, even knowing what it is like to ride in a car. The new childrens books that arrive for the new school year assumes shared prior knowledge from the young students that they've never been exposed to, like knowing what a zoo is, what a doctor's office look like, or what can be found on a beach. Therefore, the principal and early childhood specialist of the school realized that the students <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/nyregion/for-poorer-students-an-attempt-to-let-new-experiences-guide-learning.html?ref=education">required an education beyond the classroom.</a>

That is when classes started having field trips to their local auto-repair shop, the street sidewalks to look at Muni-Meters, and parking garages. These hardly seem like field trips, but more like "running errands with dad" for a middle-class child. However, to a lot of the students at P.S. 142, these seemingly ordinary places are fascinating and offer an invaluable learning opportunity. After these field trips, teachers provide follow-up activities to make sure the trip was an authentic learning experience. For instance, she gave them Muni-Meter math problems, allowing students to resolve problems as a group and develop their verbal skills. 

This Lower East Side School found a way to provide its students with rich and authentic life experiences without breaking the bank. This is a simple and effective example of education 3.0  - bringing the real world into the classroom and vice versa. In an increasingly digital age, it's important to remember that there are life experiences that cannot be replaced with avatars on computer screens.
