            Along with the Apple Tablet, this week (Friday?) will also mark the launch of the experimental "website theme" at the core of Pressible.org (<i>What will it be? What will it look like? How much will it cost?</i>). See the presentation outline below (submitted to <a href="http://net.educause.edu/e10">Educause's 2010 conference</a>) for a peek into our progress (and to put an end to some of the rampant speculation):

<b>Title: Designing an Online Publishing Tool to be Social, Simple, Data-driven, and Open

Panel Discussion Participants: Project Manager, Lead Designer, Software Architect, Project Evangelist</b>

<b>Abstract:</b>

This presentation details the conception, development, launch, and life of Pressible.org, a customized installation of WordpressMU at Teachers College, Columbia University. This Library-based online publishing tool is designed to meet the emerging needs of the College community.

<b>Presentation Outline</b>

<b>1. Statement of the problem or issue:</b>

This session will discuss and demonstrate a new online publishing service based at Teachers College, Columbia University. Pressible.org is designed to address several needs:  1) enhancing a school's capacity to create and launch new websites that support self-directed learning, 2) developing a platform for blog-like websites with an emergent organizational scheme, and 3) creating a network of websites that systematically enhances the web presence of each individual website. 

<b>2. Description of activity, project, or solution:</b>

The panel will discuss how the strains on a small project team in a service-oriented environment (the Library), combined with the rich material circulating through a major institution, informed our decisions and design process. The following publishing goals informed the project from inception:

1) Leverage the institutional brand to support self-directed learning: The team assessed existing publishing tools available to the College and determined that there was little support for rapid development and deployment of new websites. Though there are many resources beyond the university, the team pursued a community-centric approach, and posed the question: “Can a College community benefit from harnessing individual publishing efforts, and vice versa?” This led the team to see students' blog-like publishing efforts as central to their learning outcomes, and position the project as a Library-based service.

2) Refine the architecture of blogs to suit more diverse needs: The team used four websites as a model for designing a new Wordpress Theme. Each website was run by a different campus-based group and had similar publishing objectives — a blog was central to the content-creation strategy of each site, but there was additional emphasis on emergent themes and topics. The team's goal was to create a publishing solution that deployed websites that addressed these needs, and enhanced Wordpress's existing blog framework to achieve this.

3) Using machine learning to enhance each website's content: Part of the team's goal was also to create a network of sites that cycled relevant content from one site to another — and saw this as a key to developing a new learning platform. As Pressible.org was refined, additional features were added to the websites that used data to determine the best content to share across the network. This data also serves as the basis to determine the most effective publishers on the network, and create “compendium” websites that aggregate content.

The following technical elements of the project will also be discussed:

1) Iterative design process: The team planned for successive beta releases over a sixth month period to learn from user testing. This allowed for a more fluid project plan that took shape during the first four months of the project. Using Wordpress allowed the team to dedicate limited resources to developing the desired functionality without reproducing a publishing platform from scratch.

2) Data-driven development: The team created systems to track usage of Pressible.org, and was able to refine the project's goals in line with real-world outcomes.

3) Building for growth: Using WordpressMU and cloud-based services allowed the team to plan for massive growth over the first year of the project, without adding to the overall cost.

4) Open access: The team launched the Pressible.org with no limitations on who could sign up to create websites. This allows for more diverse user testing, and is meant to open up the network to more diverse content, which can be leveraged to increase the visibility of the institution's content.

<b>3. Outcomes:</b>

Pressible.org released its beta version in January 2010. Over the next nine months, we will conduct outreach efforts to Teachers College and Columbia University communities (as well as external communities) to create websites on Pressible.org. We will evaluate the platform's performance and capabilities through site analytics, user-feedback forms, and a detailed record of site performance and maintenance requests. We will also be documenting the design and development process as we respond to the various needs that arise from the platform's use within the institutional context.

<b>4. Importance or relevance to other institutions?</b>

Pressible is an easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, low-cost solution to a variety of online publishing needs. It is an example of a simple, effective, and innovative solution to what might otherwise be a costly undertaking.

<b>Suggested Audience — Who should attend this presentation?</b>

IT Officers, Directors, Managers, and frontline practitioners with an interest in online publishing and open-source networked solutions.
