            I took a class about user experience fundamentals for web design from lynda.com during the weekend. There are great lessons related to UX, UI for web also for the mobile. 

Here are some notes from the lesson. 

<b>Understanding how people browse the web</b>
In order to design a site that people enjoy using, you need to know what motivates them.  When people use the web, they're almost always doing so to find information. That means when most people come to the site, they're doing so with a particular goal in mind. They probably also got to you from a search engine or by following a link rather than by knowing your direct URL. Typically, many more visitors are referred by search engines or links than coming to the site directly. 

<b>Check out the stats for your site.</b>
You can site stats to find out what people's goals were and that helps you clarify what is that visitors want from your site. It's important that you help them quickly reach that goal. 

<b>It's all about information.</b>
It's important that the first page they see allows them to know whether they are on track to get the information they need. Each page has to say what the site is about and give visitors an understanding of how the information is laid out. You can accomplish this by having a clear site tagline and by making sure your navigation is descriptive, either of the items that people can find on the site or of the tasks that they can perform. Each page should also clearly show what it's about, using a descriptive page heading and if relevant, informative pictures and summary text.
So by making sure that your site help people quickly orient themselves and work out whether you have the information they want, you make their lives easier. That makes them happier and therefore more willing to use your site in the future.

<b>What causes people to leave sites?</b>
The biggest issues are the things that stop visitors from finding the information they are looking for. It's amazing how many sites hide the information that visitors want to find.

The hiding happens in several ways.
<ol>
<li>Using nonsensical or technical product names in navigation.
<li>Using puns or teases in your link text, so the visitors don't know what they will get if they click through.
<li>Hide information by using technical jargon instead of plain language. 
<li>Another big turn off that users report is overly distracting advertising.
</ol>
