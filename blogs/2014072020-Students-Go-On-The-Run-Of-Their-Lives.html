Ever wish school could be more like the Amazing Race? <p>

Impossible2Possible (i2P) is making it happen. As founder Ray Zahab explains in the video above, i2P "inspires, educates, and empowers young people all over the globe" using adventure as a vehicle. Zahab is no stranger to adventure, as he and two friends can be seen running the entire length of the Sahara Desert (from Senegal to the Red Sea) in the aptly named documentary, "Running the Sahara." During his run, Zahab learned about the water crisis in Northern Africa, which inspired him to create i2P, an organization that would similarly allow young people to learn as they ran. <p>

"Youth ambassadors", aged 17-21, are selected each year for a life-changing trip to a location characterized by its harsh climate and learning potential.  Since 2009, youth ambassadors have traveled to the Canadian Arctic, the Amazon, the salt flats of Bolivia, and a dino-riffic bastion in the mountains of Utah. Each trip has a particular educational slant (e.g., biodiversity, healthcare, earth science). Even if you can’t run a marathon a day, there is still a way to experience extreme adventure learning. Classes can join the explorers (from the comfort of their climate-controlled classrooms) through live video conferences, video blogs, and interactive modules found on the organization’s website. <p>

In an experiential learning situation, would you rather be the one doing the exploring or the one watching it unfold? Does i2P sound exhausting or exhilarating (or both)? Leave your thoughts in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/14906">on Vialogues.</a> <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:42 Clark:</b> It looks like the program encourages being active, which is a good quality in a leader!<p>

<b>@01:51 Clark:</b> A marathon a DAY?!<p>

<b>@01:34 Carla:</b> The importance of preparation! Having them learn the material before embarking on their journey is a great way to connect students to "need to know" info. I'd bet that that sort of situation leads to better retention.
