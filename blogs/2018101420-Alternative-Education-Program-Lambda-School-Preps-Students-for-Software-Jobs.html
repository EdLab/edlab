<p><i>"Our mission is to find untapped or underutilized talent, and train that talent for the most in-demand jobs in the world."

<p><b>Immersive Programs and Bootcamps</b></p>

<p><a href="https://lambdaschool.com">Lambda School</a> offers 30-week immersive programs in web development, computer science, and machine learning. With nine hours of lectures and coding practice each weekday, these immersive programs look truly intense. And while classes are entirely online, Lambda School differs from other similar coding programs, because none of the content is prerecorded. Students synchronously participate in a virtual classroom, where instructors teach classes in real time via webcam, and learners can ask questions to their instructors and peers via Slack.</p>
 
<p>In addition to the 30-week, full-time program, Lambda School offers part-time yearlong programs, as well as mini bootcamps. Recently, they began offering completely free introductory courses on their site so that potential learners can preview the school's style before committing. Although these intro courses were conducted in real time, they are also archived so that learners can watch them at any time.</p>

<p><b>New Tuition Model</b></p>
 
<p>Lambda School is one of several alternative education programs that require students to pay for tuition only after they graduate and land a high-paying job. Up front, students pay nothing, and continue to pay nothing until they start earning over $50,000 annually. For the first two years at this level, students pay 17% of their income to Lambda School, although this amount is capped at $30,000. This payment model offers students relatively more stability, especially those who cannot afford to pay for education up front. It also means that Lambda School is literally invested in the success of their students, meaning that instructors and leaders really care about students’ careers post program completion.</p>

<p><b>Rapid Growth</b></p>
 
<p>Lambda School has been <a href="https://medium.com/lambda-school-blog/upcoming-changes-at-lambda-school-344395da8726">growing rapidly this past year</a>. Starting with a team of two instructors, the company now has 13 listed on their site, not including TAs or other staff. They’ve expanded their course offerings, and plan to continue growing their free introductory courses in particular. Also, whereas now their courses are one-size-fits-all, they want to roll out a mastery-based program, where students move forward at a personalized pace after completing projects to show mastery of topics. Lambda School has a lot of ideas and a lot of hope, and as long as their students continue to succeed, they’ll likely keep expanding and demonstrating the potential of alternative education programs.</p>
