<strong><a href="http://www.solution-tree.com/Public/Media.aspx?ShowDetail=true&amp;ProductID=BKF373" target="_blank">From the publisher:</a></strong> Literacy 2.0 is where traditional literacy and technological literacy meet. Students in the 21st century still need to develop the reading and writing skills that were the aim of literacy 1.0 instruction, but they must go beyond those skills and learn how to use technology for communicating and collaborating in new ways.

Benefit from the authors’ extensive experience in secondary literacy 2.0 classrooms. Discover precisely what students need to be taught to become proficient in the literacies associated with information and communication technologies. The book begins with a general instructional model and then delivers the specific teaching skills related to acquiring, producing, and sharing information. These skills include using search engines efficiently, evaluating information found on websites, avoiding plagiarism, communicating with a wide audience, working collaboratively, and creating multimedia products. In a highly accessible style, the authors detail how to use the many tools and technologies they discuss and give numerous practical suggestions for classroom applications.
