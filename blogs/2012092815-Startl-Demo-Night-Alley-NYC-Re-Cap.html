This particular demo night was unique in that <a href="http://startl.org/">Startl</a>, the hosts were re-entering the edtech demo night world after a five month hiatus. 

The event was comprised of standard 5-10 minute demos with a few minutes for audience Q&A after each one.  

The following companies demo'd: 

<a href="http://citia.com/">Citia</a>
<a href="http://www.decisiondesk.com/">DecisionDesk</a>
<a href="http://www.theskimm.com/">The Skimm</a>
<a href="http://wwww.torsh.co">Torsh (EdLab Seminar/Tech Talk Alum!)</a>
<a href="http://thefutureproject.org/index.html">Future Project</a>

The stand-out applications/concepts for me were Decision Desk and Future Project. 

Decision Desk is a unique, proprietary portfolio-based admissions automation platform.  As more and more programs move to a "portfolio" or "project"-based applications system this seems like an idea and platform to watch.  

Future project was refreshingly focused on both project-based learning and creating a documentation framework for mentorship.  Google recently partnered with the project to "adopt" a local school.  Not overly tech-heavy, but a potentially life-changing program.

Courtney Williams from Torsh gets major points for recovering from a technology fail!  He was graceful and clearly won-over the crowd!  One audience member noted, "happens to everyone!"  It does & is all in the recovery!  

<b>Additional Notes:</b> 
People in attendance were definitely disappointed by the pizza & soda.  Feedback I over-heard was that they would prefer alcohol and no food. 



Excited to see the Seen in NY for NLT that will hopefully come-out of the video team's valiant filming efforts!  The environment can be a bit hectic!  Way to go & persevere Diana & Jennifer! 

The opportunity to "stand-up" and make an announcement at the end of the evening was a great idea and positive way to engage the edtech community. 

Finally, great idea re: timed demos... clap the demo'er offstage once their time is up, regardless of whether or not they are finished.  Positive way to "keep time!" 

The group...
