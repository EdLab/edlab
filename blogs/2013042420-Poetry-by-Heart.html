<p><a href="http://www.poetrybyheart.org.uk/">Poetry by Heart</a> is a government initiative that hopes to revive poem memorization in English schools. A similar notion to the <a href="http://poetryoutloud.org/about">Poetry Out Loud</a> competitions in the US, Poetry by Heart is launching in the 2013 season with a DIY contest aimed at 15 to 18-year-olds. The endeavor is supported by a lush website which features audio, images, videos, and an archive of eligible poems.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>To bring poetry to teens, the first step is to bring it to their social spaces. Poetry by Heart seems devoted to this notion, with a sufficient and quippy showing on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/poetrybyheart2013">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/poetrybyheart">Twitter</a>. The site has also wisely partnered with the <a href="http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/home.do">Poetry Archive</a> which is a contemporary resource with lots of media and newer poets. The Poetry by Heart site itself is also carefully done, trendy, and easy to navigate.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite the meticulous attention to web marketing, the mission of the program is staunchly traditional and it is difficult to say whether the contest is financially or culturally sustainable. Humanities blogger <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/lies/2013/01/poetry-by-heart-is-it-smart/">Chloe Veltman</a> suggests that government funding for these programs is often impermanent and, much more than the choral singing initiative she offers as an example (which would not work on YouTube), an in-person recitation contest seems outrageously decadent. The promise of a forthcoming p-book anthology is not helping either.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Memorization has been shown to have <a href="http://www.bestcollegesonline.com/blog/2012/07/23/in-praise-of-memorization-10-proven-brain-benefits/">cognitive benefits</a> and can be a source of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/books/review/Holt-t.html?_r=0">emotional satisfaction</a>, but in an age of constant mobile reference, the skill seems less necessary. Poetry by Heart suggests that there is still intrinsic value to both memorization and poetry but for these ideas to make a significant impact, the initiative will need to pivot towards a model that will encourage its teenage participants to integrate these skills into their very digital lives.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Poetry by Heart is nostalgic, but not uninviting.</p>
