          <p>
            I'm attending a Venture Capital in Education conference in New York City. Its aim is to bring together new ventures in the education space with the finance and corporate development communities to spur growth and innovation in education. Here are some highlights form the first session, a conversation between journalist and Parsons New School faculty member Bruce Nussbaum and Ideo CEO Tim Brown. 

Bruce Nussbaum: big forces of "de-massing" that have impacted other industries are now beginning to drive the innovation in the education sector. In many cases, it is the students who are leading the charge to change the sector. 

Bruce Nussbaum: Ed sector slow to change because of some inherent inertial forces (tenure, policy, etc.), but also innovation in any industry often happens suddenly and very quickly. Comparison to innovation in healthcare and how that may relate well to the ed sector 

Tim Brown: One example of healthcare innovations that may apply to education: electronic medical records that will eventually drive completely new healthcare models are something that may apply to education as well. Call to the world: please reinvent the resume, it is a useless tool for evaluating talent. 

Tim Brown: Innovation happening under the surface with new platforms and tools --> eventually will catalyze rapid change in the sector. Analogy to Internet explosion in 1990's: companies developing the infrastructure for web sites (e.g. Cisco) were the ones that did the best.  Signs of innovation: platforms and tools being developed and disseminated that will allow others to innovate. 

Bruce Nussbaum: Facebook-inspired education delivery system is where we have to go (shout out to EdLab's Teaching and Learning Network :)). 

Tim Brown: Do we always need institutions in the future to create educational communities?

Tim Brown: Unsupportable cost models in both healthcare and education --> necessitates innovation and disaggregation in the sectors. 

Bruce Nussbaum: Should we only focus on cost-saving potential of technologies -- there may be better ways to reduce costs (e.g. 3-year college). Must also focus on fundamentally new education patterns. 

** Reference to Clayton Christenson book that may have lessons to apply in education. 


Tim Brown: Technology doesn't always gives you reduced cost, but it often gives you "unexpected value". Can't just think of technology as a cost-saving tool, must think in terms of the new value it can provide to education. 

Bruce Nussbaum: iPhone 4's big new innovation is the video conferencing. iPad critique among some younger designers: limited content creation abilities. 

Tim Brown: Education's purpose changes from education a "workforce" to producing knowledge workers to using education to improve innovation output. Education as enlightenment as growth -- individual purposes of learning.
