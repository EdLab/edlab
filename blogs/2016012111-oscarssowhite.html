<p>In the aftermath of a brutally violent year that led to #blacklivesmatter, it’s an ominous sign when one of the most damning Twitter hashtags of the new year is #oscarssowhite. In what has unfortunately seemed to become an acceptable amount of collateral damage since the inception of the Academy Awards in 1929, artists of color are once again largely sidelined from the film industry’s most prestigious awards night in 2016.<br /></p>

<p>In some ways, this absence of real change in awards is puzzling. Hollywood has alternatively been praised or damned for the exact same reason—it’s a bastion of unabashed liberal values. Your perspective on this long prevailing political stance, of course, depends on the orientation of your political sympathies. This widely acknowledged left-leaning orientation of film’s elite tastemakers begs an obvious question—why has there been such a consistent exclusion of talented artists of color at the Academy Awards?<br /></p>

<p>The exclusionary economic structure of high-end filmmaking business has a lot to do with this systemic problem that excludes members of minority groups. In contrast, independent filmmaking has thankfully become cheaper and more inclusive than ever before, making feature films remain a prohibitively expensive enterprise. There are a number of factors that keep the price tag of mainstream filmmaking astronomically high. For example, pre-production costs to acquire source material, like licensing novels and developing screenplays, can require years of gestation and often, unfortunately, are never shot. As a result, these sunken costs are never really recovered. Production costs can include highly paid A-list actors who command tens of millions of dollars for remuneration, prestigious directors who are paid high rates, as well as expensive crews shooting in exotic foreign locations that can last for months. Depending on the film, editing can also require extensive special effects in addition to the typical costs of post-production. And finally, there is also the need to publicize films in international markets to drum up interest, recoup costs, and, hopefully, create a profit. As a result, DIY filmmakers and shoestring productions have a hard time competing with their well-financed brethren. The traditional players normally win this expensive game and, as you guessed it, diversity loses.</p>

<p>On a similar note, the prevailing mode of industry lobbying that is necessary to have films truly “considered” by the Academy also costs money. This includes sending filmmakers to prestigious festivals around the world, buying full-page ads in Variety and other equally prestigious industry media to tout a film’s merits, as well as the paying the other substantial costs associated with giving your production the requisite glamorous sheen necessary to meet Hollywood’s standards for its highest award. They don’t call it Tinseltown for nothing.</p>

<p>And given that major film studios need to make a profit in an increasingly competitive global market place, they normally focus their Oscars push on just those very few films they think could possibly win to the exclusion of their whole stable of properties that may be excellent films but not traditional Oscar fare. And given that the membership of the Academy is normally older and whiter than America’s current population, these lucky films are often selected by executives who have a feel for the type of film that would most likely appeal to the static, highly predictable demographic of those who will ultimately choose the award winners. This includes lush period pieces, and more traditional dramatic material with the most high profile talent who have already made it to the top of the industry. In short, the films that major studios push will normally star, and by made by, people who look, sound, and act like the overwhelming majority of members of the Academy of Motion Pictures. As such, well-received movies like Creed, Straight Outta Compton and their ilk, as well as the talent that made them, are unfortunately outside of the Academy’s typical tastes in movies.</p>

<p>One of the easiest, and least contentious, ways to fix this dilemma would be to increase the number of nominees in each Academy Award category. Similar to the way the slate of Best Picture nominees was expanded a few years ago, increasing this number could alleviate the Oscar problem in the short term without antagonizing critics or diminishing the work of artists of color. In contrast, creating new categories that would exclusively celebrate artists of color, or mandating minority representation in various categories, would automatically guarantee their inclusion but also unfortunately marginalize fantastic work by these talented artists. Instead, by increasing the number of nominees in each category, Academy Award members would have a better opportunity to include work that is unfortunately outside their more normal, more circumscribed, aesthetic tastes without burdening them by forcing them to include this different work within their typical narrow palette of films they normally consider. In short, increasing the number of nominees is more suggestive than prescriptive in nature, as would unfortunately be the case if a new category celebrating the work of artists of colors was introduced or some kind of quota was implemented. Although, this change may not result in its desired impact, it does not mandate inclusion. In short, this suggestion is a simple way of promoting Academy diversity without being prohibitive in its effect.</p>

<p>The Academy membership, film production studios, and the entire industry that supports them are slowly changing and becoming more representative of society at large. When will the valuable work of artists of color be fully celebrated? Unfortunately, regardless of the measures that are chosen—no matter how well-intentioned—it will not be soon enough.</p>
