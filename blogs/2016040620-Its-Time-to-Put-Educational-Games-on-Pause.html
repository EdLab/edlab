<p>Interest in educational videogames has rapidly increased. Unfortunately, the research that attempts to make sense of this gaming surge has not kept pace with this frenetic growth. Many questions are left unanswered: Which games are popular? What are the user bases? Perhaps most importantly—does game playing improve academic performance? </p>
 
<p>A study examined the relationship between a popular education gaming site and academic success. The researcher compared national educational assessment data with sociodemographic statistics to unpack the relationship between interest in PrimaryGames.com and student academic performance. This site includes over 1,000 games for pre-K–4th grade students in math, reading, science, and social studies. </p>

<p>The study found that disadvantaged youth demonstrated great interest in the site. These enthusiasts came from geographic regions with a high percentage of low-income families and a large proportion of adults without bachelor’s degrees. The study found that although disadvantaged youth may be more interested in this gaming site, personal interest was a negative predictor of academic performance. Toggling a joystick may improve your game, but not necessarily your grades.</p>
 
<p>This study is important because this explosion in gaming is disproportionate to the number of studies conducted on this emerging phenomenon—if we’re using this technology in the classroom, we might as well find out if it’s effective. Although including game-based education in schools may initially seem like an attractive option because of strong student interest, instructors need to be careful in their implementation. Students may be excited about gaming, but that excitement doesn't necessarily translate to academic performance. It may also have particularly negative consequences for disadvantaged children, as per this study. </p>
