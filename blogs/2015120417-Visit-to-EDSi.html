Jack Hyland (co-chair of the TC Board of Trustees), Gary, and I were invited to the Education Design Studio, Inc (EDSi) at the University of Pennsylvania. EDSi is a "hybrid incubator and seed fund designed to tackle some of educationâ€™s most difficult problems." 

We had a chance to tour their facilities and meet with the current <a href="http://www.e-designstudio.com/fellows/">EDSi Fellows</a>. The Fellows were onsite preparing for a Demo Day. 

The incubator model was something we explored seven years ago. Ultimately, we decided we did not want to compete with other incubators in NYC and instead focus on how we might support educational entrepreneurs (e.g., Seminars, <a href="https://vialogues.com/search/general/?query=edtech+take">EdTech Takes</a>, Demo Night, ResearchBroker, Ednode). That being said, EDSi has interesting aspects: 

- Although UPenn does have equity in EDSi, they are a separate for-profit. 

- They have investors who each have equity in EDSi. 

- EDSi can decide to fund any (or none) of their fellows in exchange for equity in the Fellow's startups. 

- EDSi has a very small team, 2.5 FTE but they also rely on many volunteers. 

Seven years ago there was not much in the way of education school incubators. As they grow in popularity (along with data analytics degree programs, and entrepreneurship certificate programs) how can these incubators differentiate themselves? Should they be expected to an alternate revenue stream? What role should they play in advancing the existing programs at the University?
