<p>While the advent of 3D printing has led to important advancements in many fields, this technology has found particularly intriguing uses in paleontology. From the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/about/press-center/the-titanosaur">American Museum of Natural History</a> to the movie <a href="https://3dprint.com/237258/a-look-into-some-movies-that-have-used-3d-printed-props/">Jurassic World</a>, 3D-printed dinosaur bones have come to play an important role in research, education, and entertainment. have been utilizing 3D printing of dinosaur bones. Southwest Adventist Universityâ€™s Dinosaur Museum and Research Center has been involved not just in 3D printing facsimiles of their 20,000 bones, but in creating a digital archive of this growing collection. Even more impressive is the fact that this collection is available for members of the public to download.</p>

<p>This digital archive holds an expanse of data that can help researchers at the Center as well as other professional and amateur researchers located elsewhere who might not have access to any original bones. The center hopes that their resource will contribute to the work of citizen scientists everywhere.</p> 

<p>How might 3D printing technology be changing the way in which biologists and biology students learn? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48254">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:11 Carmen Cortez Morales:</b> 3D printing has become a powerful tool for information sharing. How can other fields mimic this model to help facilitate learning, play and innovation?</p>

<p><b>@00:55 Betsy Harrington:</b> It's amazing that anyone with a 3D printer can print these dinosaur bones! I hope high schools and colleges take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

<p><b>@02:05 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> The ability to see something a physical object in 3D offers students an unparalleled perspective. Imagine having a 3D printed replica dinosaur skeleton in an elementary school science classroom. The possibilities for hands-on learning that could happen with such a structure are immense. Having replica models would reinforce that what students study in science in actually real.</p>
