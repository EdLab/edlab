<p><i>"By looking at the presentation of natural history, the museum demonstrates principles fundamental to scientific inquiry, principles such as the commonality of knowledge and the unavoidability of the unknown."</i> (<a href="http://thenaturalhistorymuseum.org/about/">About The Natural History Museum</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Learning from Museums</b></p>
 
<p>There’s so much to see every time you go into a museum. There are passages pasted on the wall, artifacts, and images. But what do you make of the things you don’t see? What are the stories told by the <i>presence</i> of a museum? Who crafts the lessons, stories, and messages conveyed through the interior design, architecture, and even background music? Museum anthropologists from the mobile <a href="http://thenaturalhistorymuseum.org/">Natural History Museum</a> are on a mission to educate the public on the meanings behind the messaging.</p>
 
<p><b>Lifting the Veil</b></p>
 
<p>The Natural History Museum (NHM) was founded in 2014. It travels from place to place recreating other museums using both physical materials and holographic images to educate visitors about their local institutions. Though most people think they know what a museum is about, you might find yourself discovering new information you never thought to consider. For example, on a holographic trip through their recreation of the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences, NHM anthropologists note how the museum’s Energy Hall has been projected to focus solely on oil and gas, so other natural or renewable energy sources seem ignored.</p>
 
<p>The traveling anthropologists also claim that funders to the museum have effectively skewed what should be a general energy lesson into an advertisement for oil and gas companies. As you stroll through other parts of the recreation, you can hear a childlike song with the words, "It's oil, it makes the modern world go round. It's oil, a hidden treasure deep underground." The anthropologists bring this to the attention of the observers so they can understand the direct and indirect messaging passing to adults and children.</p>
 
<p><b>The Takeaway</b></p>
 
<p>The NMH recreations are full of these insights, hoping to make museum visitors more critical of the messages they consume. These anthropologists believe that cultural institutions should do more than showcase the past. They think museums should also be obligated to give lessons from the past, pointing to mistakes humans made as political agents in agreement with society’s leaders, and how we can change that in the future.</p>
