<p><i>"We exist to ensure that impactful hands-on learning can happen anywhere."</i> (<a href="https://betaboxlabs.com/about/">About Betabox, Inc.</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>STEM Field Trips That Come to You</b></p>

<p>Betabox was started by an engineer and two scientists who noticed that very few schools and universities had access to rapid prototyping equipment. Convinced that one hands-on prototyping experience can be enough to ignite a lifelong passion, the Betabox team decided to create mobile field trips that could bring the latest technology to students all over the country in an affordable way. Betabox is a traveling lab that sets up in school parking lots. Educators sign up for experiences that range from creating phone chargers to making 3D-printed rockets, and classes visit the Betabox throughout the day to engage in hands-on guided lessons. The Betabox team makes sure that each student goes home with a product from the experience so that parents and teachers can see for themselves the value of hands-on learning. Betabox ultimately hopes to inspire schools to incorporate more experiential learning into their curricula.</p>

<p><b>Professional Development and Partners</b></p>
 
<p>To make their stay-at-home field trips affordable for all schools, Betabox partners with organizations that support their mission to expand access to hands-on learning. They also offer companies the opportunity to host workforce training sessions in their labs. Additionally, Betabox sets up shop on university campuses for classroom learning or recruiting events, and travels to schools for professional development workshops to help educators learn how to effectively incorporate more experiential learning into their schools.</p>
 
<p>To date, Betabox has served over 100,000 students and hopes to reach many more with their mobile tech labs.</p>
