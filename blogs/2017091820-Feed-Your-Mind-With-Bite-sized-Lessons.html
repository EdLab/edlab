<p>Nothing goes as well with a cup of morning coffee as a bite-sized lesson delivered to your email. Or at least, thatâ€™s the hope of <a href="http://gohighbrow.com">Highbrow</a>, an innovative learning system that parses out daily 5-minute lessons on a variety of topics. Highbrow currently has over 140 courses and 300,000 learners. Its goal is to feed the information-hungry and lessen the knowledge gap.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Highbrow has an incredible range of class topics, from art to technology to productivity. While a good number of classes are informative or instructional, many focus on living a better life and improving wellbeing. These include courses such as <i>How to Manufacture the Greatest Sleep of Your Life</i> and <i>How to Overcome Procrastination</i>. Each class is delivered in 5-minute lessons via email every morning for 10 days. In general, the emails are largely text-based, with the instructor disseminating information, and also include notable quotes as well as a book recommendation.</p>
 
<p>I tried two courses: <i>Philosophical Ideas that Everyone Should Know</i> and <i>How to Change Any Habit to Make it Stick</i>. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of each. In 5-minute articles, the content does not dive deep, yet in both of these courses, I thought that the (often complicated) information was well explained, albeit simplified. Another cool aspect of Highbrow is that anyone can create a class and earn extra money from it. Of course, there is an extensive application process, but if you can make it through that, you can have your own content sent out to learners every morning.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>As mentioned before, because the platform is designed to deliver 5-minute chunks of information, the content is generally not thorough. It is a great platform for introductory learning that you can further pursue via your own research, but those who are particularly information-hungry might not feel satisfied with just the short blurb. In addition, while some courses are free, most require a subscription. Fees range from $7 a month to $48 annually.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I genuinely enjoyed my experience with Highbrow and think it would be particularly ideal in combination with my morning cup of coffee. While the 5 minutes for each class are certainly not enough to explore a topic extensively, each email is interesting enough to keep the curious happy.</p>
