          <p>
            Shortly after posting my last blog (8/17) on a ceremony to honor the children who died after the levees broke, I came across an article by Marilyn Elias in <i>USA Today</i> that reminds us all that the damage done to children by Katrina is still very much alive and kicking.

<a href= http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-16-katrina-kids_N.htm>“Trauma Shapes Katrina's Kids,”</a> which appeared on August 16, prominently features New Orleans pediatrician Corey Hebert.  You may recall that Hebert was one of the doctors interviewed in <i>When the Levees Broke</i>, warning of the dire mental health consequences many Katrina survivors would likely face down the road.  (See Act III, Chapter 6, “Despair, Depression, Anxiety.”)

In the <i>USA Today</i> article, Hebert is quoted as saying that in pre-Katrina days about 5% of the children in his practice exhibited mental health problems, but the figure is now 50%.

The article also reiterates some of the findings of an important study conducted by Columbia's <a href=http://www.mailman.hs.columbia.edu/>Mailman School of Public Health</a> in April, 2006, entitled <a href=http://www.ncdp.mailman.columbia.edu/files/On%20the%20Edge%20L-CAFH%20Final%20Report_Columbia%20University.pdf>“On the Edge: Children and Families Displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita Face a Looming Medical and Mental Health Crisis.”</a> That report warned of a second crisis for hurricane survivors in which “incipient mental health issues will overwhelm patients and providers.”  It noted that nearly half the parents surveyed in the study indicated that “at least one child in their household had emotional or behavioral difficulties that he or she didn't have before the hurricane, such as feeling sad or depressed, being nervous or afraid, or having problems sleeping or getting along with others.”

The <i>USA</i> Today piece suggests the crisis is here.  Children with mental health issues before Katrina face a severe shortage of services.  Children with no mental health problems before the storm are finding it equally difficult to get help.  In an accompanying article entitled <a href= http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-16-neworleans-doctor_N.htm?csp=34>“Gulf Coast Kids of Every Class Affected by Katrina,”</a> Hebert notes the 14-year-old who had been an excellent student before Katrina who was now “disheveled” and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.  Another of his patients, a 15-year-old who moved back into a rebuilt home in the suburbs, suddenly began exhibiting behavior problems at school.  It was quickly learned that the child felt so lonely and abandoned that he had been cutting himself with a razor blade. 

None of this should be news to those who have followed the Katrina story from the beginning.  Spike Lee devoted a significant chunk of <i>When the Levees Broke</i> to this looming mental health crisis.  Who can forget the tortured face of Will Chittenden reciting the litany of medications he has taken to combat the stress of life in New Orleans post-Katrina?

The question is whether the New Orleans health care system, already severely depleted by Katrina, can cope with the onslaught of mental health issues -- particularly among children.  

“We have to take care of these kids somehow,” Hebert concludes in the <i>USA Today</i> piece. “We have to get them treatment and put the community back together.”
