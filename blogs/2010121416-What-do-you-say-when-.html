<strong>From the publisher:</strong>

Do you remember a time when you used the right words at the right moment, and they made all the difference? With the aim of helping you repeat that experience every day, this book provides hundreds of examples of what we call “Best Practice Language” (BPL), a research-based technique designed to help teachers use words to improve student behavior – in the classroom and beyond.

In their years of working at the K-12 levels, educators Hal Holloman and Peggy H. Yates have identified the exact phrases and key words you can use to handle: recurring disruptions, inappropriate outbursts, and students’ low self-confidence, among other classroom realities. BPL will enable you to:
<ul>
	<li>Set your expectations clearly      on the first day of school</li>
	<li>Prevent and resolve conflicts      between students</li>
	<li>Create a safe haven for shy,      apprehensive students</li>
	<li>Establish meaningful      relationships with students built on trust</li>
	<li>Help students foster a      respect for themselves, their peers, and for adults</li>
	<li>Maintain a positive classroom      environment that encourages personal responsibility</li>
</ul>
Whether you're a new teacher, a veteran teacher, a pre-service teacher, or school administrator, the tools in this book will help you use words effectively, in ways that resonate with students and provide them with clear and promising direction.

<strong> About the authors:</strong>

With experience in elementary, middle, and high schools as a teacher, coach, assistant principal, and principal, <strong>Hal Holloman</strong> loves school and currently serves as an associate professor of Educational Leadership at East Carolina  University. He teaches in the principal preparation program at ECU and provides coaching support for new school leaders throughout eastern North   Carolina. His research focuses on developing leadership capacity among all members of the school community and uncovering the “Best Practice Language” within organizations. Hal believes that revisiting our Language of Practice will uncover a “goldmine of qualitative data” that can improve teaching and learning conditions in our schools. He lives in Greenville, North   Carolina with his wife, Blair, and their 4 children, Luke, Zeke, Jessie, and Maggie.

<strong>Peggy Yates</strong> has over 30 years of experience in the field of education including positions as an elementary and middle school teacher, district-level curriculum director, and higher education administrator. Currently, she is an Assistant Professor at East Carolina  University where she teaches elementary education methods courses in classroom management, curriculum and early literacy. Her passion lies in the field of classroom management and the use of "Best Practice Language"—language that resonates with students’ hearts and produces improved student behavior in the classroom and beyond.

She believes that when educators intentionally combine the pursuit of teaching the minds of their students with the intentional quest of reaching the hearts of their students with the use of "Best Practice Language," relationships between teachers and students strengthen, teaching and learning advance, and student behavior improves.
