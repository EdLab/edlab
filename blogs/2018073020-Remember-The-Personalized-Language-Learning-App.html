<p><a href="https://rmmbr.io/">Remember: Language Flashcards</a> is a language learning app that gives you the ability to choose what specific words you'd like to learn by creating your own personal dictionary. Through flashcards and games, users are able to increase their vocabulary in a foreign language or learn one they’ve never studied, with over 25 language options to choose from.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Remember has a great compilation of premade flashcard sets, ranging from anatomy to Game of Thrones vocabulary. You can choose card sets to learn from Remember’s library or you can create your own personal card sets based on your needs and interests. What is nice about these card sets is that the app keeps a running tally of your success with each word throughout various games and exercises in order to determine whether or not you actually know the words after days of use.</p>

<p>If you buy a Remember pro subscription, in addition to personalized flashcard decks, you can practice with a variety of activities that build upon speaking, listening, writing, and reading abilities in the target language. Voice recognition software and realistic pronunciation help guide you more naturally through the language learning process.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are a few technical components of Remember that could be improved. For instance, while you can use the flashcards to practice defining words correctly in the target language, there is no reverse function that prompts you to recall the word in the target language through clues in your native language. Additionally, flashcards rely on self-assessment, which means there is no good way to keep yourself accountable since you cannot mark words you incorrectly identified.</p>
 
<p>While the initial trial of Remember is free, for full use of its features, the app requires a monthly subscription fee of $6.99 or a yearly subscription fee of $22. I’m not sure what Remember has to offer that less expensive competing language learning apps don’t, except perhaps the more personalized aspect of learning. This, at least to me, isn’t worth the extra money.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Ultimately, while Remember: Language Flashcards is a good language learning tool, its selling point as a personalized learning program just isn’t enough to outweigh competition from cheaper apps.</p>
