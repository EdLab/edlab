            Unknown to most people, New York City's public schools <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/education/09lunches.html?pagewanted=1&ref=education">require some students to pay for their school lunch.</a>The average costs for lunch in New York City public schools is $1.50 and nearly 75% of students qualify for free lunch or a reduced lunch at 25 cents. In order to qualify for a free lunch, a student's family income must be $28,665 or below. The figure for reduced-price lunches is $40,793. The city has lost almost $42 million in unpaid lunch fees since 2004 and at the current rate, the city is estimated to lose $8 million by the end of this academic year. The problem is a growing concern nationwide as 34% of school districts have reported an increase in the number of unpaid fees for school lunches over the past year. 

School officials have often neglected or simply failed to collect the fees from parents in the past, they are now taking a staunch stance about collecting lunch fees in an effort to close their budget pitfalls. New York City's Board of Ed's solution is simple: they plan to take the owed money from the budget of those schools that fail to collect lunch fees from students. Some principals note the economic downturn is one of the primary reasons why some parents are unable to pay the fees while others point out that some students, who may qualify for free lunch, just don't return their eligibility forms.
