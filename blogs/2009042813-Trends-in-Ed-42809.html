            <b>Adding Smell to “Serious” Games</b>

<i>Dear stimulating visuals and sound effects, you may step down from the pedestal now that <a href=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/article6162217.ece>smell has been introduced to game design</a>. Thanks. - Arianna</i>  

Professor Bob Stone at Birmingham University School of Engineering in UK is working to develop technology that blends realistic smell effects with game play.  Players, for example, will smell the odors of campfire and gunpowder to experience the life of pioneers on the Oregon Trail. 

So far, Stone and his team have developed software that teach submariners to operate rescue craft and soldiers to identify improvised explosive devices among other many other military-themed exercises.  

The SDS — Scent Delivery System — is one of the add-ons that his team adopted to make military training games more realistic.  SDS100 is available at $25 from an educational supplies company in California.  I couldn't help but to attach their list of over 100 interesting scent options ranging from ‘cat urine' and ‘race car exhaust' to ‘cut grass' and ‘hot dog.'

<b>Excerpts from <u>Live Chat: Evaluating Games as Instructional Tools</u></b> 

Fresh off the screen. I participated in a chat hosted by EducationWeek.com since the topic is related to today's Trends in Ed.  Based on the questions posed by participants, my understanding is that many were in-service teachers. Let's hear about what teachers think.

<b>Do you have a strategy for measuring the effect of games for learning? Can this be derived from "normal" assessments? How do we convince administration and parents as to effectiveness?</b>

Richard Van Eck:  Assessment is one of the biggest concerns people have about DGBL.... First, we have to understand that assessment already happens in games as part of what they do. The key is that it happens in a way that looks different than "typical" assessment.... Some of this is because of WHAT is being assessed. As I said before, games might be best used for problem-solving, collaborative pattern matching, etc. Assessment of these things are NOT easily done by paper and pencil test; you have to actually WATCH people performing these activities, and use rubrics and other tools for assessment.... But another reason it looks different is that we tend to have learner interaction in a typical class as mostly attention checks, spending most of our time on content acquisition (also called "info-dumping"). Assessment tends to happen at the END of long periods of this info-dumping. In games, however, EVERYTHING you learn (by interacting with the game) is IMMEDIATELY assessed. You cannot progress in the game UNLESS you demonstrate mastery of what you just learned; that is how you advance (level-up) in a game.


<b>When you reference games are you talking about commercially available games that children might be familiar with or teacher-developed games?</b>

Richard Van Eck:  There is a difference but assessment is the same in both kinds of DGBL, EXCEPT when we are talking about games like Jeopardy to teach concepts and verbal information (i.e., not problem-solving). So if a teacher develops a game to teach that does address problem-solving etc., it should handle assessment in much the same way that commercial games do. In addition, you CAN assess your content outside of the game (commercial or teacher-developed); you just have to be aware of the ways that higher order learning (assuming that is what you are trying to address) is actually measured in the real world. Multiple-choice is not likely to be successful, but project-based and problem-based learning assessment is.
