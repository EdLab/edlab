<p>Barnett Berry is the founder and CEO of the Center for Teaching Quality (CTQ), a nonprofit dedicated to an equitable public education for all students. In 2003, CTQ launched a virtual network of teacher leaders. Berry was previously a classroom teacher and think tank analyst, among other roles. He is the author of two books, <a href="http://www.teachingquality.org/about/teaching-2030">TEACHING 2030</a> and <a href="http://www.teachingquality.org/teacherpreneurs">Teacherpreneurs: Innovative Teachers Who Lead But Don't Leave</a>. </p>  

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role at Center for Teaching Quality (CTQ)?</b><br>
<p>I founded CTQ in the late 1990s as a think tank to advance teaching as a results-oriented profession. A few years later, as the teaching quality wars began to really heat up (see Jeff Archer’s 2002 piece in <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2002/04/03/29teachquality.h21.html">Education Week</a>), I distinctly remember how few opportunities teachers had to have their ideas heard, much less embraced, by school reformers, union leaders, and policymakers. We needed to do something about it. In 2003, we created the nation’s first virtual community of teachers so their pedagogical and policy expertise could be elevated and made more visible. Now, with my business partner Ann Byrd, CTQ has emerged as an <i>action tank</i> with a laser focus on supporting teachers to lead a wide variety of reforms focused on deeper learning for all students, and in doing so, helping them measure their impact and tell their stories. </p> 

<p><b>How do you hope your work at CTQ will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I believe the teacher leadership landscape is changing. Even just a few years ago, school districts, state agencies, and unions had very little, if any, focus on teacher leadership. This is no longer the case. More reform organizations, which previously focused mostly on fixing teachers, are now developing their own approaches so more of those who teach can also lead. These are good signs, but we have a long way to go. Imagine what could happen if some large proportion of the $18 billion spent annually on professional development is controlled by teachers who lead their own learning and take responsibility for their colleagues improving their practices and in spurring equitable outcomes for kids! </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>It seems that calls for more individualized and competency-based student learning have lately grown in volume. Granted, as far back as 1916, John Dewey’s <i>Democracy and Education</i> argued for what many school reformers are now clamoring for in 2016. But some things are new. First, we have more research on why and how students benefit from more engaged, personalized, and deeper learning. At the same time, the behaviorist and skill and drill pedagogies, and its policy consequences like test and punish accountability, are losing some favor. Yes, technologies will spur anytime and anywhere learning, but the evidence is that internet-based teaching and learning requires more skilled teachers, not fewer. I could see that by 2020, there will be sizable consensus among policy leaders, reformers, and educators that the path to engaged, personalized, and deeper learning for all students cannot be traveled without teachers leading the way. </p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at CTQ, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>First of all, I cannot separate my work from our collective efforts at CTQ. But here is what’s up: I really look forward to a big idea we are developing with several education economists to use our new suite of tools to measure more carefully how teachers spread their influence to their colleagues, under what conditions it happens, and what it all means as it relates to positive outcomes for students. As a field, we have a good idea about the conditions under which teachers can lead, but not enough evidence about the effects of teacher leadership and how teachers, administrators, and policymakers put this knowledge to best use. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I have too many choices. But I must point to three teacher leaders of the CTQ Collaboratory: <a href="https://twitter.com/Larryferlazzo">Larry Ferlazzo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AkaMsCrowley">Brianna Crowley</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/JJCuthy">Jessica Cuthbertson</a>. All three are experts in using social media to spread powerful pedagogical and policy ideas from the classroom and are helping more of their colleagues do so as well. I am thrilled that Brianna and Jessica are now full-time staffers with CTQ but also regret that their respective school systems could not fully capitalize on their bold brand of teacher leadership. One day teachers will not have to leave the classroom to lead school reforms.</p>
