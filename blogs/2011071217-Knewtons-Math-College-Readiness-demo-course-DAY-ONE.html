            I feel burnt out already. My stomach's all in knots. I'm suffering from tinges of irritation, perturbation, and shame. After a solid 3 hours, I'm not sure I can go on.

No, I'm not training for a marathon. (As if! You clearly don't know me at all.)

I've been trying my hand at <a href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton's</a> Math College Readiness online course, which several schools across the country are now using to get their incoming college freshman up to snuff on their math skills. The good people of Knewton have graciously given me access to a demo account, so I can experience their adaptive learning platform firsthand.  And then write about it...
<!--break-->
So far, I've been doing math problem after math problem… after math problem. They keep saying, “Show us what you know”! It's been a couple hours, and I honestly don't know how much I really know, and I don't know how much <i>they</i> know about what I know. I am (more or less) blindly doing what I'm told: watch this video. Do these questions. Now watch THIS video. Now do THESE questions. According to My Dashboard, I've earned one badge and 1,200 out of a total 8,180 points. What does mean? Well, apparently I've “mastered” the “Getting started” bit (the online course equivalent to being able to spell your own name) and I'm about 1/7 of the way to completing this entire course.

I don't really get the flow of this course yet. Why have I completed so little of “The number system,” which sounds like a pretty basic unit, yet so much of “Equations & expressions” and “Geometry”? Is there a reason I haven't tackled “Ratios & proportions” yet?  In other words, I guess I'm wondering: has the course become “adaptive” yet? 

Maybe I need to rewatch the original Knewton intro video, because if I'm getting a little frustrated (me! The epitome of all that is patient and kind and mild-mannered!) doing (what feels like) 100 consecutive math problems without answers or analysis or some kind of feedback, others may be too.

Of course, this frustration may have something to do with that fact that I had to seriously rack my brain for several minutes (before finally cheating and googling it) to remember the equation for the area of a circle. Or because I spent 10 minutes on a complicated long division problem and STILL couldn't get the right answer (it was multiple choice). This is rough. This is stuff I haven't touched in at least seven years, but my pride is still hurting.

Thoughts & questions so far:

- Does Knewton recommend sticking to their suggested course sequence? I feel hesitant to jump around because I just don't know whether I will learn less effectively. Does Knewton know best? 

- If I'm struggling with a question like the aforementioned long division problem (something I thought wouldn't be a problem), would Knewton rather I to click “I don't know” and move forward, or work through it? 

- Ugh. Geometry is the worst.

Onward, ho!
