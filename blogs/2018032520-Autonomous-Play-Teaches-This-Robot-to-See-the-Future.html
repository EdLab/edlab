<p>While it’s cute to watch babies playing, it’s also key to understanding their development; through interacting with toys, babies learn about how their bodies move and how to manipulate objects. Researchers at UC Berkeley decided to see if this same style of learning could be replicated in a robot, leading to the creation of Vestri </p>

<p>Vestri is programmed to learn through autonomous play, exploring how different behaviors will affect the world around it. Without prior knowledge of physics, its environment, or the objects it will interact with, Vestri uses "visual foresight" to predict what its cameras will see if it performs a particular sequence of actions. In the future, this new learning technology could help more complex robots–like self-driving cars and robotic home assistants–anticipate future events and respond more intelligently.</p>

<p>What are some other practical applications of this technology? What else can robots learn from early childhood development? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41800">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@0:58 Buster Wainwright:</b> I think this is very clever and wish I could imagine Vestri tidying up my house but my head's getting done in imagining all this artificial intelligence taking over my life. I feel that one day I'll come home and be locked out because the Vestri collaborated with all the other AI and they collectively agreed that their lives would be better without me!</p>

<p><b>@1:08 Sara Hardman:</b> I find it strange to apply cognitive functions to robots, such as when the narrator described the robot as "imagining" what it was going to do next. I feel like this personifies the robots too much. Is there a better way to describe what the robots are doing while still making it understandable?</p>

<p><b>@1:13 Ryan Allen:</b> Pretty incredible that this machine can already "imagine" something, similar to how humans might do it. We are on the cusp of some truly unfathomable technological breakthroughs where science fiction will start to become science reality.</p>
