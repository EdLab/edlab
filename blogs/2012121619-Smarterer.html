Smarterer allows its users to take exams that test their knowledge on wide variety of subjects and show off their scores to friends, family and potential employers. Smartererâ€™s subjects include such continuing education favorites as marketing, finance, design, software development, administration, and sales. Smarterer also includes subjects that are usually included in K-12 education like math and grammar. Users take tests to determine their mastery of a subject, and their score is plotted on a chart from 0 to 800. They are then placed into learning tiers based on this score: beginner (<300), familiar (300-449), proficient (450-699), expert (700-779), and master (780+). This mastery level is easy to share with friends and potential employers through social media and links. Smarterer believes that users who keep retaking tests to improve their score might improve their knowledge of the subject with every test they take.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b> Much like the GRE exam, the test questions on Smarterer are adaptive. If a user answers questions correctly, the next question will be more difficult and if a user answers questions incorrectly, the next question will be easier. The questions themselves are crowdsourced from users of the site. Smarterer automatically determines the difficulty of a question based on the numbers of correct or incorrect answers from other users. An advantage of this is that it provides the users with plenty of questions to answer and few repeated questions. Users can review the questions they have just answered after completing a test to see which concepts still need work.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b> The questions on Smarterer are crowdsourced from users, which might mean that some questions might not be well-designed. There is an option to flag these questions, but encountering a poorly formatted question is a bit alarming and calls into question the goals and credibility of the site.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b> Smarterer is helping to revolutionize credentialing through its badging system. Users can test on Smarterer and display their knowledge of specific systems like Microsoft Excel, Google Analytics, and HTML 5. The idea of a skill testing website is not new, but unlike many similar <a href="https://www.proveit.com/default.htm">sites</a>, Smarterer is totally free to use. The $1.25 million in funding from True Ventures and Google Ventures may have something to do with the current payment model. Smarterer is also unique in its easy social sharing. Smarterer uses the concept of badges to inspire lifelong learning and skill building much like the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges">Mozilla Open Badges project</a>.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b> Smarterer tests and shows off what you know.</p>
