          <p>
            Bowdoin College in Brunswick, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/us/colleges-and-evangelicals-collide-on-bias-policy.html?ref=todayspaper&_r=0">Maine has become on of the first in what appears to be a trend of universities pushing out conservative religion</a>. It will no longer recognize the Bowdoin Christian Fellowship as an official club, which will result in the loss of funding and it's worship space. This decision comes as a result of the club's violation of the school's anti-discrimination policies. The club allows anyone to join, including homosexual and non-Christian students, but it won't allow just anyone to become the leader. The Fellowship has a requirement for eligibility to be the leader: the candidate must believe in some basic tenets of Evangelical faith and if unmarried, must abstain from sexual activity. Such a requirement was deemed exclusive by Bowdoin and the 40 year old religious group now finds itself excluded from the Bowdoin community. Many other universities such as the Cal State system are taking similar action against evangelical religious groups. Other schools such as the University of Texas system are allowing religious groups to remain as exceptions to the anti-discrimination policies.

Are schools like Bowdoin going too far and excluding conservative religions? Or are the evangelical Christian groups being too stubborn in refusing to adhere to policies on leadership selection? It is likely that leaders of the group would still adhere to the previous requirements given the nature of the groups. Should the club just follow the policies officially and have a sort of de facto standard for its leaders? Are the fellowships worried that the colleges may be biased against conservative groups and accuse the groups of discrimination for electing only Christian leaders? Is it just a matter of pride? This is becoming an increasingly political issue and as such, may lead to unfair results regardless of the policies the schools choose to take on.
