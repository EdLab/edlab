<a href="http://www.duckduckmoosedesign.com/">Duck Duck Moose</a> is a children's publisher that produce apps that support early learning and development around music, math and literacy in ways that are playful and engaging for children. Most renowned for their first iPhone app <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTe_DGqSh3E">Wheels on a Bus</a></i>, they have since created iPad versions of some of their apps and more nursery-rhyme inspired apps suitable for preschool children. 

<b>Pros:</b>
I seriously give a big thumbs up to the co-founder and designer of Duck Duck Moose, <a href="http://www.niccigabriel.com/">Nicci Gabriel</a>, because the overall design and interface of their apps are clear, simple, and aesthetically pleasing (There are too many kid apps out there that look like they've been made by a 5-year-old). What's wonderful is that not only do they care about the app experience for the child, but also for the parent. When you watch a Pixar movie, there are subtle elements in the film that children won't understand, but the parents will get a nice chuckle out of? It's the same way. For example, in their <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdHGBVcaFlM">Old McDonald</a></i> app, you get to a scene with the cows and one of them is holding a cup of coffee and reading "The Moo Yorker". 

<b>Cons:</b>
It's not a con really, but the apps range somewhere between $.99~$1.99, so they're not free. However, for a high-quality app, I feel like that is a very reasonable price. Also, most of the apps teach early literacy skills and sensory development. There was only one app for math and none for science. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Amid the thousands of apps out there, we are all trying our best to find new ways to spend our money wisely and choose apps that will not be a 30 second novelty, but provide parents and children with good developmental experiences and fun over a decent period of time. What I love about Duck Duck Moose is that they have not tried to churn out the apps and go for quantity, but have focused on developing a small batch of high quality apps.
