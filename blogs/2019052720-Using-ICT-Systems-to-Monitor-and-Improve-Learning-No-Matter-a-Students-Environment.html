<p>While teachers may be able to monitor what kind of learning students are doing in class, as soon as students go home, educators are left in the dark. While homework can provide a window into out-of-class learning, any outside help, cheating, or struggling is invisible. A group of Serbian researchers recently decided to address this problem by designing and testing educational software that could help both students and teachers better evaluate learning and monitor learning behavior across different environments.</p>

<p>In their study, the researchers were particularly interested in how information and communications technology (ICT) could provide middle school teachers with more information about their students’ mathematical thinking and knowledge levels. The researchers developed an ICT platform called eZbirka that could highlight concepts that students struggled with while strengthening the connection between learning at school and at home. Over the course of two months, 200 participants ages 11 to 14 in eight different math classes utilized eZbirka to complete their homework. Since eZbirka generated a unique set of homework questions for each student, copying classmates was prevented. Researchers gathered performance data from eZbirka, gave students questionnaires to complete, and surveyed 80 teachers about their teaching practices and their experience with eZbirka. </p>
 
<p>Results of the study revealed that students were motivated to use the ICT program because they found that it gave them more opportunities to practice with automatic feedback, meaning they could learn from mistakes and improve more quickly. It also increased student completion of homework and better enabled teachers to identify and track student needs so that class time could be spent tackling mathematical concepts that were less understood.</p>

<p>Not only was eZbirka successful in addressing the problem the researchers set out to solve, but students found homework on eZbirka to be more interesting. Overall, the experience made them more confident and motivated them to improve their math skills. Teachers also expressed positive attitudes about the program; not only did they feel their students were more engaged in math because of eZbirka, but after the test period, all of the teachers surveyed continued using eZbirka in their classrooms. This study shows the great potential of online platforms to monitor, improve, and inspire student learning both in and out of the classroom.</p>
