          <p>
            This week, I found myself listening to a <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/harper-high-school-part-one">set of episodes of "This American Life,"</a> a radio show and podcast telling stories about various aspects of American life, about a school in one of the more dangerous areas of Chicago. The show interviewed several people attending or working at the school and quickly painted a picture of the violence and gang culture pervasive throughout the area. The best way I can present the gravity of the situation is to say that the map can be used as an accurate tool to tell which gang a particular kid may belong to. If a kid lives on a certain block, almost without exception, that kid will belong to the gang whose "turf" that block belongs in. It isn't a matter of joining or not joining the gang. Once a kid is deemed tall or old enough, he/she must join, or risk getting shot at or jumped. The staff at Harper High, the school looked at in this report, openly acknowledge the fact that almost all of their students are gang members and try to accommodate them to face the troubles of this reality. To put some numbers behind this, the year before this report took place, 29 students of Harper High were shot at. 8 students were killed. These numbers are not an anomaly. Had they been, perhaps we'd have heard about it on national news. Perhaps if the weapons used were semi-automatic rifles and not hand-guns we'd have heard about it on national news. Regardless, the sad reality remains.

The school mainly tries to provide some sense of relief to students. It offers safety within the premises of the school and counseling for those traumatized. The school principal went to great lengths to ensure a school dance would happen. She had to call in extra police officers to monitor the grounds and had to plead many staff members to risk their own safety to act as security, all for the sake of giving the students at least one event that seemed normal. What I found most striking of all was the dilemma many of the educators and counselors found themselves facing: in the face of conditions so bad that their efforts would likely have little to no impact in the end, what did their teaching really mean? This place which is arguably in the most need of education is also a place where education seems to be useless. How can those educators help end this? Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country and the violence persists, so the problem that must be dealt with first is clearly a cultural one. Education should be able to have an impact. It should be able to give these students hope of getting out of the cycle of violence. It should be able to empower them and enable them to stop living in fear. 

I encourage everyone to listen to the two episodes of "This American Life" on Harper High. Perhaps an edtech innovation or new teaching philosophy could be crucial to the advancement of education for these students.
