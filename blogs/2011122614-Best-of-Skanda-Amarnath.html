<i>For Skanda's best of, I chose his post “Economics and Education: The Lack of Direct Pre-Professional Paths.” Â Economics and Education is a series he brought to the blog, and it's very enjoyable to seem him bring his economics competence to bear on educational issues. Â Furthermore, and as this post demonstrates, he does it all in a tough, no-nonsense style that gets right to the heart of the matter. Â I challenge you to read the post and not be immediately convinced.</i>

<b>Economics & Education: The Lack of Direct Pre-Professional Paths</b>
Whenever there is a discussion about the state of undergraduate education, there are two strands of thought that inevitably are drawn out:
1) College isn't for everybody
2) Undergraduate education equals economic opportunity.
These two points are at odds yet the better question to ask is who ought to attend college? We want undergraduate education to provide students with the opportunity to explore themselves and yet we also see it as the key to career opportunities and advancement. At first glance, these do not seem to be mutually exclusive goals, and perhaps they are not. However, the former, the ability to explore oneself, is a luxury consumption good, albeit possibly a noble one, while the latter is clearly an investment. If you come from a lower to middle-income family, you will more likely view undergraduate education as a means to a better economic outcome. Those of upper-middle to upper-income families can probably afford to explore various intellectual pursuits with the knowledge that their future holds some minimum financial security. Yet there is little divergence among undergraduate institutions in catering to those on a more pre-professional path and those in it purely for the intellectual journey.
My point can best be seen in the contrast between engineering schools and liberal arts colleges. Engineering schools cater to those interested in contributing to the workplace at some point their careers. Engineering students almost certainly have developed some concrete skills when they eventually graduate. On the other hand, liberal arts colleges maintain a more open-ended mission. Both have their advantages for the appropriate sets of students.
However, pre-med, pre-law, and pre-business (finance and consulting) are also pre-professional paths. Yet all three paths require an undergraduate education that has very little direct application in their respective workplaces. That does not mean what they learn is not valuable in life, but the skills they acquire are not directly translatable to their future careers, and thus should not qualify as human capital investment.
From my experience at Columbia, it is clear that while a slight majority are uncertain of their future career as incoming freshmen, there are still plenty of students who certainly know that they want to become doctors, lawyers, or bankers. I am sure that if these students were surveyed, they would say they value their undergraduate experiences greatly. However, if their parents were surveyed about the prospect of their kids taking only the requisite courses but spending half the money and time, I'm sure many would find it attractive. Such an option would exclude most from the benefits of a rich, open liberal arts education, but it would also cost far less as well.
If we look at other developed countries, the pre-medical path involves just 1-2 years of coursework. The same is true for the pre-law path in many countries. Yet no such path exists in the United States. Inevitably, this leads to crowding out for lower-income students who aspire to be doctors and lawyers. I am not saying students should not be allowed to apply to medical or law school after an undergraduate liberal arts education. I am simply suggesting more choice is necessary if we want to distinguish between human capital investment and open-ended intellectual exploration.
