<p><a href="http://www.arcademics.com/">Arcademic Skill Builders</a> is a website and mobile app with 61 games—both single and multiplayer—that exercises students’ math, spelling, and geography skills. Geared toward grades K-8, Arcademics approaches online learning through arcade-style games in an attempt to engage students even when they are working on repetitive math problems. The games are primarily presented using colorful graphics and animal characters, including multiplication problems with penguins and subject-verb agreement with giraffes. Arcademics Plus, a premium version of the program, is also available for a 30-day free trial and then for $100 per year for a 20-student classroom, or $5 per student per year.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Arcademics’ wide variety of games provides a comprehensive offering of opportunities to practice different skills, particularly ones that might be boring or tedious for students if done through problems on paper. Single and multiplayer games provide a variety of interaction patterns in the classroom, including a chance for students to play against one another. The games usually have a timed component, which introduces an element of competition and excitement while still ensuring that students have ample time to work through the problems. If the students get a question wrong, they are still given more time to try again. At the end of the game, the students can see which questions they answered incorrectly and compare them to the correct answers.</p>

<p>Each game is accompanied by a brief content description so teachers and students know what skills are being practiced. The website enables the user to sort games by subject (shapes, decimals, spelling) and grade level (1 through 6, although the website is presented as suitable for K-8). Students can even pick different difficulty modes for each game. Arcademics Plus also provides data reports on student performance, as well as video lessons to supplement student learning. One additional benefit that comes with the paid version is that 3% of the proceeds goes to the Boys & Girls Club of America.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although there are many games offered, most of them are permutations of the same general model. For example, the Canoe Penguins, Canoe Puppies, Dirt Bike Proportions, and Division Derby games are all based off of the concept of answering questions by clicking the correct answer in order to move forward and beat the competition. Though the variety of characters help keep similar games interesting, it would be helpful to have a wider array of objectives and formats in the types of games Arcademics offers to generate more interest and remain engaging.</p>

<p>The multiplayer games have both public and private options, though the public games do not see quite enough traffic to ensure that students will always be able to find an open game. However, students are able to play against bots if there are not enough human players available. Finally, although the games on Arcademics can be used without payment, Arcademics Plus, which could benefit both teachers and school administrators alike, may exceed a school’s available budget at $5 a student. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Repetitive exercises, no matter what the subject, can be dull for students, and Arcademics provides a means for students to practice those skills without having to do pages of practice problems or stacks of flashcards. However, keep in mind that any educational tool that seeks to achieve fluency via repetition is going to run the risk of monotony, and there are only so many ways to present practice problems to students, regardless of how many animal characters you introduce.</p>
