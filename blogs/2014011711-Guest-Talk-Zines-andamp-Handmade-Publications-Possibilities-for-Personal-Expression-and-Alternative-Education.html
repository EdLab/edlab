            Guest Talk: <em>Zines &amp; Handmade Publications: Possibilities for Personal Expression and Alternative Education</em>, with Anne Hays &amp; Discussants,

<strong>Tuesday, 1/28, 4-5:30pm: </strong>here in the library at<strong> Russell 306</strong>

<strong><a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2014/01/ZINESsmall.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19827" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2014/01/ZINESsmall.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a>

A  zine, or fanzine, is a self-published work of original or appropriated  texts and images usually produced today by a photocopier and circulated  to less than 1,000 readers -- sometimes to as few as 100. Motivated by  the desire for self-expression and not for profit, a zine tends to be  counter culture, probing topics outside the mainstream: fanfiction,  politics, art and design, personal journal, single topic obsession, sex  and gender. Its origins date back to Thomas Paine who published <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/commonsense00147gut">Common Sense: Addressed to the Inhabitants of America</a></em> --a pamphlet published on January 9, 1776 that urged colonists to declare and fight for independence.

Given their appeal and impact, can zines work well in educational  spheres? And just how do intentionally paper publications fit into the  digital landscape of libraries? <a href="http://zines.barnard.edu/zine-libraries#iow">Zine libraries</a> are found locally, across the nation, and in other countries, and  teaching with zines may offer rich alternatives to more traditional  methods.

Our panel will present some interesting perspectives and focus on the  role of DIY publications in creating space for personal voice and  personal expression, and as an extension in education, including the  traditional classroom, non-traditional classroom, library, and other  community spaces.

<strong>Anne Hays</strong> is the founding editor of the literary and arts journal <a href="http://www.storyscapejournal.com/"><em>Storyscape</em></a>, and runs a brand new zine distro called <a href="http://sleepingcreatures.com/"><em>Sleeping Creatures</em></a>. She writes a zine called <em>Alex</em>, and her short stories and essays have been published in <em>Ms. Magazine</em>, <em>Brooklyn Rail</em>, <em>Lumina</em>, <em>PANK</em>, and <em>Drunken Boat</em>, among others.

<strong>Jenna Freedman</strong> is a <a href="http://zines.barnard.edu/">zine librarian</a> and <a href="http://lowereastsidelibrarian.info/zines">librarian zinester</a>. She is the Associate Director of Communications at the <a href="http://library.barnard.edu/">Barnard Library</a> in NYC. She has published articles on zine librarianship and presented  around the United States and in France on that topic as well as on other  themes of library activism.

<strong>Julia Lipscomb</strong> has been publishing zines since high school. After  graduating from Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington with a BA in  English Literature &amp; Writing in 2010, she moved to Seattle and  served many roles at the <a href="http://www.theveraproject.org">Vera Project</a> and <a href="http://hugohouse.org/content/zapp">Zine Archive &amp; Publishing Project</a> (ZAPP). Not only did Julia publish more zines in the Seattle arts  community, she also developed a passion for outreach and teaching others  how to make zines. She tabled for ZAPP at Portland Zine Symposium for 4  years and taught zine classes at Richard Hugo House and Rain City Rock  Camp for Girls. In addition to her passion for zines, Julia worked as an  English tutor for 3 years and she is a proud City Year alumni.  Currently, Julia is pursuing a Masters of Professional Studies in Arts  &amp; Cultural Management at Pratt Institute. Here to stay in New York,  she volunteers at <a href="http://www.abcnorio.org">ABC No Rio</a> in the zine library and leads fundraising efforts at the Silent Barn in Brooklyn.

<strong>Maya Pindyck</strong> is a poet and visual artist living in Brooklyn, NY. Her collection of poems, <em>Friend Among Stones</em>, received the Many Voices Project Award form New Rivers Press, and her chapbook,<em> Locket, Master</em>,  won a Poetry Society of America Chapbook Fellowship. Her written and  visual works have recently appeared or are forthcoming in <em>Memorious</em>, <em>Prairie Schooner</em>, <em>esque</em>, <em>The Feminist Wire</em> and Printed Matter. Maya is a doctoral student in English Education at Teachers College.
