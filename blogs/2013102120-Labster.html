<p><a href="http://www.labster.com/">Labster</a> is a 3-D virtual laboratory for learning about  scientific tools and technology. These scientific tools may not be available to students physically in science lab classes. Labster enables students to carry out tests and experiments virtually using the technology that scientists use in real life situations. Scenarios include a CSI case, an animal genetics case, an enzyme kinetics experiment, and a fermentation case. Students are guided through the scenario and encouraged to use the tools available to them to solve problems. There is plenty of freedom for users who want to explore the equipment and chemicals, though they would need to follow instructions to move on in the scenario.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The 3-D environment draws users into the scenario in the manner of a good simulation game. The scientific tools look very realistic and teach users how to identify the equipment in real life. Users can view statistics from all scenarios and analyze their quiz scores, progress on each scenario, and a leader board with scores from other students. According to <a href="http://www.labster.com/labster-is-67-percent-better/">a forthcoming study</a> conducted in Demark, Labster might be more effective than lecture-style teaching in the subject of biotechnology. Students who played games on Labster for 45 minutes performed significantly better on a multiple choice exam than students who listened to a 45 minute lecture on the same content. This retention bump was also observed in a post-test conducted several weeks later.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The platform could benefit from amassing a large and diverse library of scenarios so teachers could more effectively integrate them into the curriculum. The library might grow to cover more science sub-subjects like chemistry, biology, physics, and zoology.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Labster can provide students with a hands on experience of scientific tools even if schools cannot afford to provide actual machines or laboratories. Providing several real life scenarios can be more engaging for students compared to other science learning tools. The gamification element of completing a goal with only the tools that are available to them may make students more motivated to work through the entire scenario. Labster can also give users an impression of scientific and technical careers. The currently available scenarios are working well, but Labsterâ€™s potential growth could include customizable scenarios and truly innovative content.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Labster lets you virtually solve CSI cases while learning science.</p>
