            <a href="http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/tlemieux/papers/RD_JEL.pdf">Lee, David S. Lemieux, Thomas. "Regression Discontinuity Designs in Economics", Journal of Economic Literature 48 (2), June 2010, 281-355.</a>

Regression Discontinuity (RD) Designs? Economics? Yes. While the subject hardly sounds related to education, RD statistical designs are being found in more educational studies. Before investigating Lee and Lemieux's paper on RD, it is incredibly important to understand what RD designs test for and how they fit with educational matters so perfectly.

Suppose you have a class of 40 fourth graders and they take a test at the end of the year and are ranked. 25 students pass the cutoff and are judged proficient; they stay in the same math program for the following year. The lowest 15 are placed in a separate remedial program. Given that past academic performance predicts future academic performance, the best in fourth grade would likely be among the best in fifth grade and so on and so forth. So assuming that the remedial program was in reality as effective as the regular program, <b>the regression of performance in fifth grade over performance in fourth grade</b> should be as follows (all of these were sketched in paint if you couldn't notice):

<img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;ik=98e6e4baff&amp;view=att&amp;th=1319b88f191c81a7&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=f_gqzkmlu80&amp;zw">
Suppose the remedial program was found to be more effective than the regular program and have a significantly positive effect:

<img style="-webkit-user-select: none; " src="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;ik=98e6e4baff&amp;view=att&amp;th=1319b88f191c81a7&amp;attid=0.2&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=f_gqzkmlun1&amp;zw" width="433" height="331">
If the remedial turned out to be much worse than the regular program, the regressions would look some thing like:

<img style="-webkit-user-select: none" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;ik=98e6e4baff&amp;view=att&amp;th=1319b88f191c81a7&amp;attid=0.3&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=f_gqzkmt6r2&amp;zw">

<b>Description:</b>
In education, cutoffs are often used for determining treatments and interventions. As a result of the popularization of RD in the past two decades, RD is one of the most common methods for rigorously analyzing achievement data.
In Lee and Lemieux's take on how to appropriately use an RD design, the first point they make revolves around comparing those performance of those that fall just above the cutoff against the performance of those that fall just below the cutoff. What makes RD so powerful for education is that it relies on fewer assumptions, which is especially helpful in complex educational settings.
In their analysis, one of their key findings is the danger in allowing individuals to choose whether they receive the treatment (thus creating self-selection bias) if they can alter their behavior to choose which side of the cutoff they would like to be on. It is important that populations on both sides of the cutoff are still comparable to one another. However, if individuals cannot reliably choose whether they receive the treatment, RD remains robust at the cutoff because it creates the equivalent of a randomized experiment at the cutoff.
Another point of importance is the idea that the discontinuity should be more apparent as the set of observations are limited to those that are closest to the cutoff.

Ultimately, RD design revolves around 'seeing is believing'. It is very much possible to fudge statistics to make them seem impressive but not so when presenting whole data sets in the form of two regressions that might or might not be connected.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
RD designs represent the cutting edge of statistical analysis for the social sciences and particularly so for questions in education. When working with any sort of pedagogical approach, curriculum, or other educational program, there is a strong likelihood that it will be based on research rooted in RD design in the coming years.
