            <b>Philosophy >> Design >> Implementation >> Practice</b>

Last Friday, Erin, Frederik, Ting, and I visited <a href= http://www.stphilipsacademy.org/Home.aspx>St. Philip's Academy</a>, an independent school in Newark, NJ.  Established in 1988, SPA began with 10 first-grade children in a house donated by Trinity & St. Philip's Episcopal Cathedral.  After outgrowning its space, SPA moved in 2007 to a 67,000 sq. ft. <a href= http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222>LEED</a> silver certified building which was completed by remodeling a former chocolate factory.  

The school now welcomes about 340 students (grades K-8) from the Newark area.  With a faculty/student ratio of 1:7, the tuition is about half of what it costs to attend most independent schools in New Jersey and all students receive significant amount of financial aid, with 65% of those students receiving additional aid.  About 90% of the graduates move on to attend boarding schools or independent/parochial day high schools. 

In a four-part series, we will report what we learned and share our reflections, and we'd like to take this opportunity to thank Ralph (Gensler & SPA), Charity (SPA), and Aziza (SPA) again for welcoming EdLab to the school. <i>(Note: Ralph's school redesign project and his team at <a href= http://www.gensler.com/>Gensler</a> was featured in <a href= http://aftered.tv/index.php?q=node/351>School Redesign Season Two</a>)</i> 

<b>********************</b>

“It's like an oasis for our students.”  That's how one development officer described its EcoSPACES, a rooftop garden at SPA.  While there were no students to ask how they view and observe how they use the space, I couldn't argue otherwise.  After taking a tour of the school, I saw SPA as a special place where a well-rounded — and more importantly, well-grounded — education is its top priority.  In addition to the school's unique green rooftop, the dining hall also presented an interesting intersection of pedagogy, space, and curriculum. 

<b><u>EcoSPACES</u></b> is a comprehensive initiative that supports environmental and nutrition education. The rooftop garden called PSE&G Outdoor Learning Center sits at the top of the school's gym. The amount of produces grown at the garden is not enough to feed everyone at school, but whatever gets harvested go straight to the kitchen and any waste gets composted in-house and reused at the garden.  EcoSpaces club, a student club consisting of 6th through 8th graders is in charge of managing the garden during the school year.  Considering that I didn't see much green while on a car ride between the Newark train station to the school, this garden indeed seems to provide an oasis but it isn't just a haven for enjoyment - it requires hands-on work, responsibility, and communal ownership.

<b><u>Dining Space</u></b> at SPA was different from traditional school cafeterias: the focus is on the communal practice of healthy eating rather than efficiency (i.e. how to expedite the process of come-eat-n-go).  The dining space consists of round tables and separated ‘quarters.'  It's a family-style dining experience in which there is a table head and students are assigned to various roles such as picking up a set of utensils for the rest of schoolmates.  We were told that there have been instances when students, based on what they learn and practice at school, encourage their family members at home to eat healthier.

Besides the eco-conscious, health & wellness program that's blended throughout the pedagogy, space, and curriculum, one thing that sticks out the most is that the educational philosophy of SPA is quite adamant towards <i>not</i> taking students out of their social and cultural context (of growing up in a range of rough environments).  Rather, the goal is to bring in personally relevant and effective learning experience to each individual, so that the students themselves can become agents of change and improvement.  Sounds ideal, and that's good because without such vision the space we visited last Friday would not have been built nor filled in with students.
