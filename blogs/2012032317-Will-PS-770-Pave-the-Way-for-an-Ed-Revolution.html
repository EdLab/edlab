<b>Possibly, maybe...</b>
According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/opinion/brooks-the-relationship-school.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_20120323">this New York Times Op-Ed piece</a> from David Brooks on <a href="http://thenewamericanacademy.org/"> The New American Academy</a>, the answer just might be a resounding... possibly.  Why is this charter-like public school with a largely poor, minority population located in Brooklyn's Crown Heights so unique and as Brooks declares one of many promising "reform models?"  The answer may lie in fact that the school operates according to Brooks, "more like a postindustrial workshop, or even an extended family compound."  

While this last statement from Brooks may sound like a bunch of new-age jargon, the thinking behind the school, is grounded in practices, some of which were developed at the <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/">Harvard Graduate School of Education</a> and all of which were instituted to help eliminate what the founder and principal, <a href="http://thenewamericanacademy.org/meet-our-staff/apprentice-teachers/">Shimon Waronker</a>(himself a Harvard Ed & Teachers College alum), view as a relic of an outdated, 18th-century Prussian model developed to keep factory workers docile and subservient.    

<b>What exactly are some of the "best practices" that are unique to The New American Academy?</b> 
They include, a 4/60 student/teacher ratio, a "career ladder" for teachers that mimics that of a law-firm  or vocational trade more than a traditional school, moving teachers through levels of mastery (Apprentice, Associate, Partner & Master) with correspondent pay ranges from $50K-120K.  Additionally, the curriculum seems to rely heavily on peer-to-peer and team-based collaborative learning in open-plan spaces and is based on 6-year "loops" that allow students to go from K-6th grade with the same group of teachers and students.  

This last practice seems "revolution-worthy" enough and all but eliminates lost time spent getting-to-know each other at the beginning of a school year.  Whether or not you agree with Waronker, the the secret to the future of education may just lie is creating schools that more closely emulate a modern world that is open, networked and collaborative and not a tidy factory floor.
