          <p>
            A college student from 5 or 10 years ago might be very surprised to see how much of the nitty-gritty of coursework has been transferred online. One such program is <a href="https://www.webassign.net/">WebAssign</a>, an online homework and grading tool.
<!--break-->

The instructor sets up an account, creates a class, and then uploads homework. After students are given the class code they can log in and will immediately see the calendar of assignments, all of which can be completed entirely online and usually piecemeal (you can submit one problem at a time). 

<b>Pros:</b>
The variety of useful tools provided is the real seller for this program. If you use a common textbook, WebAssign will probably have a whole suite of homework assignments ready-made. Additionally, you can bring in questions other professors have created or upload your own.

There are a variety of other add-on options and tweaks:  You can set how many attempts students get in submitting answers; you can upload explanatory videos; you can set up a message forum or direct chats with the students, etc. There's also an option to do testing through the system, which I haven't seen and doubt is widely used, although they do a few things to try to make it secure.

<b>Cons:</b>
The most salient problem with the program is on the student end, specifically with answer entry. WebAssign can be fairly finicky about the format in which it accepts an answer (e.g. how many significant figures), and this creates an uncertainty in the student over whether the issue is with their process or with the program (most of the time the answer is the former, but the uncertainty itself can be very frustrating).

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
It's very possible that the value of technology in education will come mostly from technology clearing up the clutter around educational moments, rather than itself being involved in education. Although I sympathize with the vision of a renovated educational system for the modern world, it might be better to see what we can do at the margins, first.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
<a href=”http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6488”>Aplia</a>, reviewed a few months ago on the blog, was a similar program developed for economics courses. WebAssign is more flexible, but with the kludginess that seems to follow flexibility. In any event I think college students today should be very grateful for programs such as these, which minimize the busywork that can often seem to dominate what should be a time for learning.
