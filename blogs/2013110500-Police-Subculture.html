          <p>
            I took my Criminal Justice midterm last week. As I had no idea what the essay question was going to be, I studied everything that had been covered throughout the semester thus far. One of the two essay questions was about police subculture, and whether such a thing even exists? If it does, how does it affect how officers do their jobs? 

There is already an existence of the so-called “blue curtain” and the “blue wall of silence” so I do believe a subculture does in fact affect how cops do their job. The blue curtain is a code of silence among police officers where officers refuse to testify against corrupt officers, creating a veil of secrecy around police actions. The blue wall of silence is the secrecy of police officers who lie or look the other way to protect other police officers. Both are very similar but still have different meaning. 

For example, let's say one cop is a "good cop" and his partner is a "bad cop." The good cop will most likely become a bad cop because he rather protect one of his own than the one been hurt. Breaking any one of these can hurt an officer in many ways, as he can get suspended, criticized by other cops, and lose the loyalty of other officers. 

Here is an <a href="http://www.thecrimereport.org/news/inside-criminal-justice/2012-05-cracking-the-blue-wall-of-silence">article</a> on an officer who broke the blue wall of silence. 

What are your thoughts? Should police subculture exist? Should it effect how officers do their job?
