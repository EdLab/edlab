            It seems as though Americans are hated by every nation in the world. We are lazy, rude, loud, and stubborn; I imagine that if America was hypothetically a single human being he/she would be the most arrogant, egotistical, stereotypical jock who manages to graduate high school on a whim. Let's face it we are the know it all, in your face, “I'm right you're wrong” bully. America with the educational equivalence of a Neanderthal (compare to other countries), pushes its force on the world by “recruiting” individuals from other countries to handle the deeds. This is because Americans are not investing as much into their future as they should be. Sure with more students enrolling in colleges each year we assume that, that in it self is enough to secure great jobs and the future of our society. However it seems ironic that those who are and were educated lack the aspiration to become an educator themselves. I mean sure who can blame them? Let's see… What do most teachers complain about? Oh yes, How about the obscene amount of money a person receives for putting up with some one else's snot nosed children, or how about the great fame and acclaim that comes from being an educator? It wasn't long ago when I could state that “educators become professors, teachers etc. for the love of it.” 
<P>
Now however it seems that things have drastically changed. So I'm sure that most of you know that the country has been<a href=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/education/ny-liteac125252675jun12,0,4187546.story>short on teachers</a> in the last few years, due to the retirement of baby boomers who have been educators especially in the fields of science, mathematics, and history. The retirement of these baby boomers has led to a failure for us to ensure that children in secondary and elementary schools are receiving the <a href=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4049/is_200304/ai_n9198758>education</a> needed by qualified teachers. Such problems are greatly affecting larger cities in New York and California. <a href=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2007/06/08/41apcaliftech_web.h26.html>California</a> is trying to resolve this problem by encouraging engineers and highly qualified professionals to leave their high paying jobs and assume a role in education. 
<P>
My personal opinion on this matter is as follows:
1.	Although there is a shortage we should not be pushing people into a profession that requires much more than knowledge. Becoming an educator takes more than knowing the material, it is one thing to be an educated person and it is another thing to be able to understand how a child's mind works and to explain to them the concept of let's say the vibration of atoms or imaginary numbers.
2.	Another is that we are cheapening the worth of teachers because we are forcing those who are not qualified into positions that require skill and talent. Especially by forcing people into jobs which they did not wish to pursue in the first place.
3.	And lastly we should be giving those more incentive to become educators if there indeed is such a shortage. So that such problems do not occur and risk the future education of our nation's youth.
