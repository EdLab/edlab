          <p>
             New York is one of a host of states all across the nation who will be receiving federal money to cure some of its educational budget woes. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/nyregion/25nyrace.html?_r=1&ref=education">The Department of Education has just granted the state $700 million in aid</a> for state education. This should come as a sort of victory for students and school boards all over New York. The money was awarded to New York mainly because they were one of the winners in the federal Race to the Top competition. Some of the money would be use to create new teacher evaluation forms as long as that they can reach an agreement with local school officials. <p>
 
The Race to the Top award is awarded to those states that have proven to the federal government they are capable of improving their schools in addition to other extra requirements such as adopting national educational standards. So in an effort to win some of the grant money, New York State Board Of Education increased the number of charter schools, also a key feature of President Obama's educational goals. It will also help teachers receive their certificates faster through programs such as Teach for American. The grant will also allow the state to keep records of student performance from kindergarten to college.
