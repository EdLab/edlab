<p>Older adults are an often forgotten or ignored population when it comes to education, and especially when it comes to technology education. Yet this population’s lack of proficiency when it comes to technology is not due to disinterest; about three-quarters of internet users ages 65 and up report that they <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/barriers-to-adoption-and-attitudes-towards-technology/"> go online daily</a>. While organizations have sought to provide older adults with more opportunities to increase their digital literacy through face-to-face classes and workshops, a group of researchers in Mexico wondered if information and communication technology (ICT) courses online wouldn’t make more sense.</p>

<p>To test the waters for such classes, these researchers decided to test the effectiveness of a blended learning course on digital literacy for older adults. Researchers gathered 98 participants ages 60 and above, and while 61 of the participants participated in face-to-face workshops, 37 participated in blended workshops. Both courses included three lessons (Introduction to ICT, Computer Programs, and Getting to Know the Internet) with 16 topics in total. While face-to-face workshops featured a tutor with a digital presentation and support material, the blended courses included multimedia learning activities, guides, learning materials, and other resources on an online platform. The researchers measured digital literacy in participants in a pre-test and a post-test, and included a questionnaire for participants to report on the perceived ease of use and usefulness of their course, their attitudes toward it, and their intended use of the information learned in it.</p> 

<p>Findings revealed that though digital literacy increased in both groups, the increase was greater for those who participated in the blended workshops. Furthermore, participants in the blended workshop reported positive responses regarding ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use, demonstrating the success of the course in educating and inspiring learners about the importance of digital literacy skills.</p>
 
<p>Not only are older adults capable of learning through online platforms, if they are motivated, they can come to truly value being literate in ICT. Digital technology use may come more easily to younger generations, but that doesn’t mean senior citizens shouldn’t have access to it too.</p>
