Forward Tutoring is a web tutoring platform that allows struggling students to "pay" for private peer or near-peer digital tutoring with community service. The site was founded by seven high school students (now all college freshmen) who funded development through business competition awards including the <a href="http://www.dellchallenge.org/projects/forward-tutoring">Dell Social Innovation Challenge</a>. Forward Tutoring hopes to make tutoring accessible to students, rewarding for tutors, and game-changing for nonprofits seeking volunteers. The site launched in early February and is currently coordinating its first round of students and tutors.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The system is built around mutually beneficial transactions and compensates tutors with credentialing, scholarships, and prizes. The tutors are carefully chosen for communication and academic prowess based on a subject mastery test and mock tutoring sessions. Students receive question credits for each hour of volunteer service they complete and are able to pose questions to subject-specific tutors. Volunteer organizations get connected with driven students and volunteer opportunities seem a little thin on the ground at launch time, so it may be especially beneficial for the beta nonprofits. All volunteer commitments, questions, and credits are organized on a tidy student dashboard.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because Forward Tutoring is newly launched, it’s nearly impossible to find volunteer opportunities on the site. They have minimized the impact of this by awarding each beta sign-up 10 free question credits, but stocking the event calendar with some recurring events would go a long way towards making the site appear well-used.  Another strategy for building community would be to offer students an anonymized log of past tutor question answers to minimize redundancy. To minimize freeloaders, this archive could be something that users unlock after their first or fifth volunteer credit hour.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Forward Tutoring is a great example of an innovative idea that has the potential to change the way students seek and receive help from peers. It’s a little more structured than a simple peer-to-peer question network like <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/90">OpenStudy</a> which might prevent system abuse. Forward Tutoring’s greatest challenge might be returning a consistent "product" on all sides with so many difficult-to-control variables. The barrier to entry on the site is high for both students and tutors, Forward Tutoring may need to further incentivize sign-ups in beta to get the community rolling. Like <a href="http://www.grantoo.org/">Grantoo</a>, Forward Tutoring is one of a crop of emerging charitable non-profit edtech startups. It would be easy to chalk the idealism of the site up to the founders’ <a href="http://forwardtutoring.blogspot.com/">self-admitted naïveté</a> but the migration of learning to the web will likely be full of previously unexplored opportunities for connection. Forward Tutoring is experimenting with an innovative educational barter system, and it just might work.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Forward Tutoring is incentivizing learning and service.</p>
