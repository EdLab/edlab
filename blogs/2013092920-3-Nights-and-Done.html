<b>The Format</b><br>
<a href="http://3nightsdone.org/">3ND</a>, or "3 Nights and Done," is a non-profit organization that provides free online courses. What makes these 3ND courses distinctive is that you only need three days to complete a course and actually master the information.  How is that possible?  The 3ND team has condensed each course into one hour of educational material to be reviewed each night for three nights, making "learning fun for people of all ages." Founder and Princeton University professor <a href="http://www.3nightsdone.org/team/">Mung Chiang</a> created 3ND in 2012 with the hopes of providing free educational content for people to learn in a new, easy way, without having to spend a whole semester’s worth of time and money on a course.

<b>Learn Something New Over a Weekend</b><br>
We now know that learning can be done in three nights.  But we also know that it is almost impossible to learn Physics or the entire English language in a quick three nights.  So what kind of courses does 3ND offer? The options are not the typical classes you may see in a college course list, but rather practical subjects of general interest. For example, the group has a variety of courses, ranging from baseball to video streaming, and even venture finance.  In order to cover all the information in three nights, they usually divide the content into a topic a night or even one topic over two nights if it’s a lot of material.  Take a look at how 3ND split up the content for <a href="http://3nightsdone.org/course/5/info/">how satellites work</a> by night. Each night, people taking the course will watch one hour of video content and answer a series of multiple-choice questions to ensure their full understanding of the material.  They also have the ability to learn socially through 3ND’s discussion forum (See an example of the <a href="http://3nightsdone.org/forum/2/">discussion forum</a>), where learners  can ask questions and talk with others taking the course. People can have the opportunity of taking on a learning challenge without feeling overwhelmed with a longer college class.  3ND could be a great way for students and non-students alike to learn something new in just a weekend.
