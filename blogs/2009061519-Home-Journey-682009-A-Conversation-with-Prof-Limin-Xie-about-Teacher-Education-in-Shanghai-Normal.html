<b>Background Information:</b> <a href="http://www.ep-china.net/educators/people.asp?id=196&etype=%BD%CC%D3%FD%C0%ED%C2%DB%D7%A8%BC%D2"><b>Professor Limin Xie</b></a>, one of the most famous scholars in the field of education in China, is the Leading Professor in Curriculum & Teaching and Director of Institute of K-12 Subject Education at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Normal_University">Shanghai Normal University</a>. Before joining the academic field, Prof. Xie was teaching physics in a middle school in the northeast of China for eight years. Prof. Xie's research interests include teacher education, research methodology, scientific worldview in teaching, and teaching of physics.
	
Shanghai Normal University (SNU) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_Normal_University">East China Normal University (ECNU) </a>are the two key normal universities in East China and both of them are located in Shanghai. Compared with ECNU, SNU founded in 1954 is a more specialized teacher training university with a great variety of undergraduate and graduate teacher education programs, while ECNU is a more comprehensive school featured with both teacher training programs and non-teacher-training programs. 

T (Ting): Prof. Xie, as I know, SNU and ECNU are the most famous normal universities in east China. Since both of the two are located in Shanghai, could you introduce some information about the quota of local teachers prepared by the two schools?

L (Prof. Limin Xie): Today, about <b>70%</b> teachers teaching in the Shanghai area (including towns and counties) are from Shanghai Normal. This data has been decreasing since the 1990s. In early 1990s, the quota from Shanghai Normal was about <b>90%</b>, the promotion of teachers' income over the last decade as well as the recent financial crisis have attracted increasing graduates from non-Normal universities to enter the teaching career. [They could sit a teaching certificate exam to earn preliminary qualification.] One of the reasons for the high quota of teacher preparation by SNU is that most students at SNU are local residents while students studying at ECNU and other key universities are from all over China, thus, graduates of SNU tend to stay in Shanghai to teach while graduates of ECNU [probably due to the previous working restriction for non-local residents] are more likely to go back to teach in places all over the country. 

T: What are the main categories of the <b>undergraduate teacher education curricula</b>?

L: The undergraduate teacher-education courses are required in the following categories: (1) Politics; (2) Foreign Language (English); (3) Computer skills; (4) Educational Theories; (5) Psychology; and (6) Practicum. 

T: What is the structure of the undergraduate practicum? 

L: The practicum of student teaching lasts for a whole semester [which is about 4.5 months] which drives students into <b>three stages of experience and reflection: Observation and Reflection (jianxi), Teaching Practice and Reflection (shixi), and Research and Reflection (yanxi)</b>. Students usually visit their assigned schools once or twice a week, but during the 6-week teaching practice (the second stage), students are required to act as a full-time teacher, being there every day from 8 am to 4 pm [which is the regular school time in China] and responsible for all the assigned classes. The third stage of Research and Reflection requires students to complete <b>a final project</b> with a theme related to teaching and learning, through teaching and guided research experience. 

T: What is the format of students' reflection over the one-semester student teaching?

L: Besides the <b>written reflection</b>, students and their professors have <b>regular conferences</b>, where students report about their teaching experiences and also discuss about interesting cases they run into during teaching. 

T: How to <b>evaluate</b> students' practicum?

L: Our instructors and professors go to their assigned schools regularly to observe their student teaching classes and get frequent feedback from the host teachers and principals. 

T: What is the teacher-student ratio during the three stages you mentioned?

L: We don't have a specific statistics for the general ratio over the three stages. But for the last stage of Research and Reflection during which students need to complete their final project, <b>the ratio is 1:1</b>. 

T: 1:1? Does that mean each student will have one professor to guide the final project?

L: Yes. The college students here even get more priority than our graduate students. Our teacher-student ratio for graduate students' thesis guidance is about <b>1: 2/3</b>. 

T: This is amazing!

L: Yes, we have put a lot of resources and energy especially in our college-level teacher education programs. 

T: Prof. Xie, thanks for the details of the undergraduate program. Could you further talk about the graduate-level pre-service and in-service programs at SNU?

L: Sure. Before our further conversation regarding SNU, I want to give you some background information about the teacher training programs in general in Shanghai. Before the formal establishment of graduate-level programs in SNU and ECNU, teachers got required training regularly after starting their teaching jobs, organized by <b>the Teachers Institute of Continuing Education</b>, a branch under the local educational bureau. Beginning from the mid-1990s, local normal universities and the government start to have collaboration. The Teachers Institute of Continuing Education will serve non-degree training while the normal universities offer graduate education. Teachers from the institute will offer insights in students' practicum or practice-based teaching courses at normal universities. The pre-service and in-service programs share a lot of common features including courses. The difference between the two types is mainly about the requirement of final thesis and research. 

T: So, what are the main structure and features of the in-service program at SNU?

L: The in-service program at SNU is a part-time program, with the consideration of the busy schedule of our graduate students who at the same time are full-time teachers. Compared with ECNU which requires students to attend their full-time program over the first year, we offer students intensive courses over summer and holidays to better cater to students' schedule. The degree we grant for this program is Master of Education. 

The key words for our in-service program are: <b>practice, theory, and research</b>. Our goal is to prepare our in-service students to bring practice to research and also connect practice and research to theories. In the process, students will learn more about research-based teaching and learning and how to do research in their daily life, as well as eventually bring the research experience to their own classrooms. 

T: Are there any <b>evaluation standards</b> for the in-service program? 

L: We evaluate our students according to their (1) academic grades (including local or national certificates for English fluency and computer skills); (2) observation of their teaching; and (3) <b>publications</b>. 

T: What are the philosophy/perspectives/goals behind the teacher-education program at SNU? 

L: Our philosophy is closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism"> <b>Confucius Values</b></a>: All teachers should be students' model, morally and academically. Thus, Teachers should improve and set high standards for themselves in their moral values and subject knowledge. 

Our goal is to further cultivate our teachers in four aspects of teaching: <b>(1) Proactiveness; (2) Self-consciousness; (3) Connection to Research; and (4) Joys of Teaching and Learning</b>. The last one is  related to students taught in their classrooms who can receive their teaching in a joyful way.

[Ting's note: TC's teacher-education programs are based on <b>Curricular, Critical, and Social Justice Perspectives</b>.]

T: Thank you for your great introduction, Prof. Xie!

L: I look forward to our possible collaboration with the EdLab regarding teacher education, academic exchange, or development/exchange of learning tools in the near future. Please keep me posted.
