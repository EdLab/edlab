            <a href="http://freading.com/pages/top_downloads" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/th_FreadingOF.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" ></a>

<a href="http://freading.com/index">Freading</a> is a fusion of demand driven acquisitions and pay per view models that, until recently, have only been used for electronic journal access. Considering the recent <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6845">friction</a> over more traditional e-book lending models like Overdrive, this type of lending might start to gain traction with publishers. Freading was started by the company behind Freegal, a niche music lending program that operated on a similar pay for use model. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The interface is clean and functional, though not anything revolutionary. The books are arranged across the page in shelf-style with little numbers in the upper left-hand corners. It's a bit unclear if these numbers refer to number of downloads, or “grades” on Freading's pay scale. The pay scale grades are currently based on best-seller status and number of weeks from publication and range from $2 to $0.50 per check out. Charges for libraries are invoiced monthly and require a monetary pledge but no hosting fee. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The selection of books is a little thin on the ground right now. Most titles are from Workman Publishing/Algonquin. It's a very strong publisher, with a lot of series and titles already purchased by public libraries, but it would be nice to have a bit more variety. The search bar is also a bit arresting, I can't decide if I like it or not. Instead of a real search bar, it's a writeable drop-down window so users can fill in as many or few fields as they like and create a mini advanced search. It's surprising, not necessarily a con. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Overdrive's recent scandals have shaken up public and school libraries alike. Freading is an interesting alternative that may be more palatable to publishers in the long run and is not necessarily more costly for libraries. Freading does not currently support Kindle, so when they begin talks with Amazon I'm sure we'll see the rugs shaken out on this new model. I think it has the potential to be a competitor with Overdrive. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Libraries need more purchasing models and options in electronic content. Bring it on.
