            <a href="http://jte.sagepub.com/content/60/1/86.full.pdf">Schlager, M., Farooq, U., Fusco, J., Schank, P., & Dwyer, N. (2009). Analyzing online social networking in professional learning communities: Cyber networks require cyber-research tools. Journal of Technology Education, 60(1), 86-100.</a>

The researchers in this study were chiefly concerned with measuring the value of social networks, particularly as it relates to teacher collaboration and development. While the authors remain critical of existing research methods for discovering the value of social networks in a professional setting, they do propose a 'research agenda' for developing better tools for rigorously analyzing their value.

<b>Description:</b> The researchers provide ample evidence of the growing trend toward greater networking between professionals in education and the rise in online teacher communities. Moreover, they highlight evidence that the role teacher networks play in school and professional development interventions. On the other hand, much of the evidence for the value of online teacher networks comes from highly localized and limited studies that are qualitative in nature. One of the key insights in their review of quantitative analyses of social networks is the idea of social capital, which is based on how easy it is to acquire necessary resources within the network. In fact, they point to the need for weak ties to be prevalent in a high social capital community since it allows for teachers to access resources more directly, including relevant experts.

One of the limitations the researchers suggest their new research agenda ought to tackle is the value of indirect transmission of knowledge. For instance, network members might be able to grasp knowledge written from and to two separate parties. Thus, measuring direct participation in the network is not an adequate way of measuring social capital. While they mention some other specific limitations, their overarching criticism deals with the inability to trace all interaction, including indirect communication and learning, within the network on a large enough scale. Otherwise, with such narrow samples and narrow definitions of interaction on social networks, there will be no way of quantifying the value of social networks in a professional setting.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This was a dense and challenging paper to go through but there were some key takeaways as far as the value of social networks. From the evidence presented, it was clear to me that teacher networks provide real value in helping those teachers that might be in need of assistance from experts. Moreover, there are some soft technological barriers that prevent researchers from fully understanding the value and cost of social networks, thus making most "research" on social networks a touch exaggerated. The biggest way to increase the social capital within a network, from what I could see, was in the dissemination of specialized knowledge quickly and throughout the network.
