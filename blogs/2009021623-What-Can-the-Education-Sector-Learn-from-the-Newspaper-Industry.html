            Check out the Charlie Rose video below titled "Future of Newspapers." Interviewees include Walter Isaacson of "Time," Robert Thomson of "Wall Street Journal" and Mort Zuckerman of "The New York Daily News."

In addition to the discussion on subscription-based revenues (as opposed to advertising-based revenues) and micropayments--both of which I think TCR is doing to some extent--I found the conversation about Google's impact to be quite relevant to various projects we have going on at EdLab and the College. 

Wall Street Journal managing editor Robert Thomson, talking about the impact of the Web on the newspaper industry says: 

<i>"... Google devalues everything it touches. Google is great for Google, but it's terrible for content providers, because it divides that content quantitatively rather than qualitatively. And if you are going to get people to pay for content, you have to encourage them to make qualitative decisions about that content."</i>

The comment is provocative but I think applicable to the education sector as well. As more and more information/education content becomes available on the Web, and accreditation mechanisms become cheaper, what impact will it have on places Teachers College? More importantly, what steps do higher education institutions need to take to create more value around their core product? 

For a transcript of the video click <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&aid=158432">here</a>.

And for a glimpse into how things might shake down in the newspaper industry, check out <a href=" http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2009/02/misreading_news.php">this post by Nicholas Carr</a> (be forewarned, it ain't pretty). Here's an excerpt:

<i>"What I'm laying out here isn't a pretty scenario. It means lots of lost jobs - good ones - and lots of failed businesses. The blood will run in the streets, as the chipmakers say when production capacity gets way ahead of demand in their industry. It may not even be good news in the long run. We'll likely end up with a handful of mega-journalistic-entities, probably spanning both text and video, and hence fewer choices. This is what happens on the commercial web: power and money consolidate. But we'll probably also end up with a supply of good reporting and solid news, and we'll probably pay for it."</i>
