          <p>
            I recently fielded a phone call from a faculty member who was trying to reach "Jean" at the Services Desk.  Since there's nobody on the services staff of that name, I asked that the call be forwarded to me to try to disentangle.  It turned out that the professor had been chatting online with one of the Ask-A-Librarian staff members, who was unable to answer his question but who had recommended that he call the Desk for further help.

The professor's query turned out to be rather complex, though on the face of it it seemed relatively straightforward.  He wanted to determine the committee members for a doctoral dissertation completed at Teachers College in 1931.  The author, as it turned out, was later a very influential psychologist (Carl Rogers, one of TC's most distinguished alumni), and the faculty member (Barry Farber) an expert on this person and editor of a collection of essays on Rogers's psychotherapeutic work.

There is a record for Rogers's dissertation, titled <em>Measuring Personality Adjustment in Children Nine to Thirteen Years of Age</em>, in Digital Dissertations, but (not unusually for the date of completion) no full text available online.  There are two records for the dissertation in EDUCAT, both with TCANA  : CLOSED STACK designations, but with two different LC call numbers.  The second  record has the call number BF335 .R6 1931; the first, LB5 .C5 no. 458.  The second record indicates publication by Teachers College, Columbia University; the first record indicates publication by Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University. The first record provides a link to the digital version of the work, which resides in PocketKnowledge; the second provides no link to full text.

As it turns out, the reason for the difference in call number is that the BF335 .R6 1931 classification reflects the subject and date of the dissertation, while the LB5 .C5 no. 458 classification indicates that the work is number 458 in the series titled "Contributions to Education" which was made up in part of TC dissertations and theses that were "commercially" published by Teachers College.

I provided Professor Farber with directions for access the PocketKnowledge digital document; however, what we found there was, instead of a straightforward list of Rogers's committee members, the mention of a number of persons, recognizable TC faculty members and others, in the Acknowledgments of the book.  Rogers writes, "Stimulating suggestions and help have come from Dr. Goodwin Watson, Dr. Leta Hollingworth, and Professor Harrison Elliott, as well as from other members of the Teachers College faculty.  Their friendly criticisms and encouragement have been most valuable."  While it seems quite likely that the three named professors constituted Rogers's dissertation committee, this is not self-evident, and their relative positions  (chairperson, committee members), if they were in fact the persons in question, not at all obvious.
