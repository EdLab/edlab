            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58572505@N04/5888708549/" title="turntable.fm-s by CuriousBrooklyn, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5272/5888708549_32a42bce45_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="turntable.fm-s"></a>

In the spirit of our recent partnership with the <a href="http://www.rockandrollforever.org/">Rock & Roll Forever Foundation, </a> and inspired by <a href=" http://publicyte.com/build-a-turntable-fm-for-education/">this blog post</a> on Publicyte.com, I will attempt to build a case both for and against using <a href="http://turntable.fm/lobby">Turntable.fm</a> in the classroom. 

At first glance, with its cute avatars and glitzy font, Turntable.fm comes-across  as simply another glorified, social music-sharing gimmick du jour.  However, after a cursory exploration and quick spin on the virtual turntables, I felt surprisingly engaged and despite a plethora of musical "rooms" to choose from, not overwhelmed.   What would ordinarily seem like too much "choice," with the right UI and levels of customization, allows you to become both a participant and curator of your musical experience. 

<b>How does Turntable.fm accomplish these mighty tasks and how might this relate to education?</b>
<b>1) Membership.</b> Turntable.fm is invite-only (unless you have a friend on Facebook who is a "Turntabler" which auto-generates an invite), thereby increasing virality & the "peer-review" effect of wanting to impress your friends.  This is also a great feature for a teacher who is then able to invite a class to share a session.   

<b>2) Game dynamics.</b>  DJ's are rewarded with points for playing songs others like, or in a classroom scenario, are highly relevant to a class or lesson.  DJ's are also  demoted for playing songs that no-one likes or for misconduct.

<b>3) Patience.</b>  The fact that DJ's must take turns and share the spotlight is another unique feature and potential "way-in" for the classroom.  This creates a tech-enabled "share-a-song" take on the classic "show & tell" model.  

<b>4) Privacy.</b> "Rooms" for listing to DJ's musical sets can be made private or public providing yet another selling-point for the classroom teacher who many want to keep a 60's era classic rock jam session private. 

<b>What is the dark side of Turntable.fm for the classroom?</b>
NPR offers the following caveat on their blog, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/06/30/137492684/turntable-fm-a-roomful-of-fun ">All Songs Considered</a>, "Of all the music-based social media on the web, Turntable.fm is built around arguably the most useful new idea.  It's also the biggest time-suck I've come across in a long time."  There is the rub, while incredibly collaborative, Turntable.fm also has the potential to be a huge waste of time.  Monitoring & assessing the amount of meaningful time that students spend together in a DJ session may be one of the  major road-blocks to adoption in the classroom.    

<b>In Conclusion...</b>
Music has always been a central feature in young people's lives OUTSIDE the classroom & Turntable.fm just may help to create a more meaningful, connected, virtual learning environment IN the classroom.  Imagine a scenario in which each student gets a chance to play DJ, selecting a song for the class that is most appropriate to a lesson's historic time period, piece of literature or even a connection to a geographical region of study, thereby creating powerfully relevant musical context with which to frame learning.  Like the social media backchannel, will social music find a place in the classroom?
