            <div><span>How can data be visualized to aid learning? Come check out our newest exhibition on the 3rd floor of the Gottesman Library open January 23 - May 31, 2012.

<em>Data visualization + Learning</em> features five pieces by the Library’s design team. They are visual explorations of data related to educational research and practice:  usage patterns of physical and online space in an academic library, conceptual frameworks of mental disorders and school finance reform litigation, and mapping of scholarly references and online publishing networks. These are examples of data about education turned into learning tools.

<strong>1. The Evolution of the Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</strong>
This visualization was created by library staff member Amelia Grohman as her senior thesis project in Communication Design at Parsons The New School for Design. She mapped the changes in the classification system used in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, from its first edition in 1952 to its upcoming 2013 edition. Editions are color-coded and the trajectories of groups of disorders are marked by vectors.

</span></div>
<div><span><strong>2. School Finance &amp; Courts</strong>
This visualization illustrates the introduction to an article by Bruce Baker and Kevin Welner published in Teachers College Record in 2011. Key events of school finance reform litigation history were placed on a timeline, and Baker and Welner’s analysis compliments the timeline in the form of commentary text bubbles. </span></div>

<strong> </strong>

</span></div>
<div><strong>3. A Year in the Library</strong></div>
<div><span>This visualization was created in 2009 based on library visitation data compiled over the course of 2008. Instruments installed throughout the Gottesman Libraries track the number of visitors to various library locations and wirelessly transmit the data to a server. It is visualized through a series of charts and graphs. </span></div>
<div><span><a href="http://dar.pressible.org/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-23-at-3.27.19-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-490 alignnone" src="http://dar.pressible.org/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-23-at-3.27.19-PM.png" alt="" width="519" height="431" /></a>

</span></div>
<div><strong>4. Teachers College Record Special Edition: Education, Crisis, and the Human Condition: Arendt after 50 Years</strong></div>
<div><span>This visualization was created in 2009 based on content published in a special edition of Teachers College Record, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Hannah Arendt’s The Human Condition (1958). It color-codes each author published in the TCR issue along with authors they reference in their own article. Each is placed on a world map depending on where they were when their piece was published.</span></div>
<div><span><a href="http://dar.pressible.org/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-23-at-3.44.22-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-497 alignnone" src="http://dar.pressible.org/files/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-23-at-3.44.22-PM.png" alt="" width="815" height="507" /></a>
</span></div>
<div><span><strong>5. Visualizing Pressible</strong>
This visualization was created by Jer Thorp, artist-in-residence at EdLab in the summer of 2010. Working with data from Pressible, a network of blog sites published by TC students, faculty, and staff, Thorp examined the growth of the Pressible ‘ecosystem’ over one year and created an animation showing that growth span. Each individual cluster represents a blog in the Pressible system, and colored dots are posts appearing in real time.</span></div>
