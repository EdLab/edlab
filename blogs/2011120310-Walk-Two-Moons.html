<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

After her mother leaves home suddenly, Sal and her  grandparents take a car trip retracing her mother's route. Along the  way, Sal recounts the story of her friend Phoebe, whose mother also  left.<strong> </strong>

As Sal entertains her grandparents with Phoebe's outrageous story,  her own story begins to unfold — the story of a thirteen-year-old girl  whose only wish is to be reunited with her missing mother.

In her own award-winning style, Sharon Creech intricately weaves  together two tales, one funny, one bittersweet, to create a  heartwarming, compelling, and utterly moving story of love, loss, and  the complexity of human emotion.

<strong>Literary Awards: </strong><em> </em> <a href="http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberymedal">Newbery Medal</a> (1995); Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Book Award Nominee (1997); W.H. Smith's Mind-Boggling Books Award (1996).

<strong><em>Though</em></strong> <em><strong>I remember this book</strong></em> had a fantastic ending, it has left a lasting impression on me for two other reasons: first, because it taught me how to spell the name "Phoebe." Secondly, because of the following (abbreviated) passage:

"Mr. Birkway gave us a fifteen-second exercise. As fast as we could, without thinking, we were to draw something. He would tell us what we were to draw when everyone was ready. 'Remember,' he said. '<em>Don't think. </em>Just draw. Fifteen seconds. Ready? Draw your <em>soul</em>.' ... The first thing I noticed was that every single person had drawn a central shape--a heart, circle, square, or triangle. I thought that was unusual. I mean, no one drew a bus or a spaceship or a cow--they all drew these same shapes. Next, I  noticed that inside each figure was a distinct design. At first, it seemed that every one was different. There was a cross, a dark scribble, an eye, a mouth, a window."

This section blew my 5th grade mind. And unlike in the book, in which students only had 15 seconds to draw their souls, I have been contemplating it for almost 15 years and still wonder what I would draw. The older I get, the more complicated the task seems to be. Perhaps because I have been thinking about it.

Ideas of what you might draw?
