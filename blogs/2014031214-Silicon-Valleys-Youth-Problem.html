          <p>
            If you're looking for a great "longread", I highly recommend <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html" target="_blank">this excellent New York Times Magazine article</a> (which I have to thank Louis for sending to me) about Silicon Valley start-ups and engineers, with some strong connections to education. It raises an interesting issue &mdash; we talk about the STEM shortage all the time, but even if hypothetically we solved that problem by getting more people to study STEM subjects in school, then the next problem is where these STEM-educated graduates (particularly in computer science) choose to work. A great quote from the article:

<blockquote>This summer in San Francisco, I'm living with three roommates, also students doing tech internships in the valley, two at Google and one at the news aggregator Flipboard. For better or worse, these are the kinds of companies that seem to be winning the recruiting race, and if the traditional lament at Ivy League schools has been that the best talent goes to Wall Street, a newer one is taking shape: Why do these smart, quantitatively trained engineers, who could help cure cancer or fix healthcare.gov, want to work for a sexting app?</blockquote>

I also liked this quote, which sounds like it was describing a certain <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/3224">person in the lab</a>:

<blockquote>...it followed what was for decades the highway that connected academia to industry: Grad students researched technology, powerful advisers brokered deals, students dropped out to parlay their technologies into proprietary solutions, everyone reaped the profits. That implicit guarantee of academia's place in entrepreneurship has since disappeared. Graduate students still drop out, but to start bike-sharing apps and become data scientists.</blockquote>

The trends this article describes highlight a lot of the reasons why I personally can't see myself working at a start-up or moving to the tech monoculture of the Bay Area anytime soon.
