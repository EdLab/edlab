<p><i>"The use of a smart city platform for exploring, visualizing, and downloading location-based open data will drive innovation. Researchers, citizens, and entrepreneurs can use this data to develop and test apps, inform urban planning, and, ultimately, make systems work better for citizens." </i> (<a href="https://urbanova.org/faq/">Urbanova</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Experimental City</b></p>

<p>University researchers, technology developers, energy companies, and urban planners are all thinking about how to build safer, healthier, and smarter cities. The problem is, they often work in isolation and lack the resources to test their innovations on a large scale. In 2014, energy, education, construction, and technology experts decided to come together and build a living prototype of a smart city. The partnership is called <a href="https://urbanova.org">Urbanova</a>, and it has created a living laboratory of the 770-acre University District in Spokane, Washington.</p> 

<p>The University District is comprised of academic and mixed-use buildings, residential neighborhoods, and undeveloped land. Its diversity and lack of development make it an ideal place to run experiments to  cultivate a safe, sustainable, and economically strong city. The projects respond to the existing needs of the district’s residents and receive their feedback in real-time. The living prototypes implemented in the University District both improve an underdeveloped area and generate data that can be used by researchers and citizens around the world who seek to implement smart city solutions.</p>

<p><b>Integration and Collaboration</b></p>

<p>Urbanova’s projects explore innovative solutions that involve integration and communication between institutions and industries. Their Smart and Connected Streetlight Pilot, for example, utilizes a sensor network that adjusts lighting conditions to save energy and promote safety. At the same time, the lights measure air quality and capture data about noise level, motion, temperature, and humidity. The Energy Economy Pilot currently studies how solar and battery energy can be integrated across buildings to create energy-efficient networks. Urbanova’s research and development grant supports interdisciplinary and inter-institutional study of how interaction with natural and built environments affects health.</p>

 <p>Urbanova’s interdisciplinary and experimental approach appears to be transforming an underdeveloped district into a living model of what’s possible. Spokane received the IDC Smart City North America Award for Sustainable Infrastructure in 2018, indicating that, so far, the experiment is going well.</p>
