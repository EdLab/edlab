            A few recent trends in the PC world have made it convincing that PC is losing prominence and support and is ceding to the tablet. In the entire PC manufacture world, Apple did not get the volumes in the Mac as compared to PC manufacturers like HP and Dell. Such were things until something disruptive happened: the tablet was born with the iPad. 

It is clear from all market data that the iPad and tablets are cutting into PC sale volumes. In the past few years, PC/Netbook shipments have fallen by about 4.2% with the only silver lining being a bullish sales of MacBooks and Lenovo in the US. Compare all this doom and gloom with the tablet market. Apple's profit margins on the iPad is rumored to be at 42%. 

Hardware manufacturers are moving their concentration from PC to tablets since the wide range in specs for the tablets means that they can get much higher profit margins.

"Wintel"(Windows+Intel) was making most of the money in the PC manufacture chain but they are now also changing their strategy. Intel has announced a partnership with Google to make chips optimized for the Android. Microsoft's considering the big picture: partner with Nokia to get the hardware edge, reveal "Metro" UI as default UI for Windows 8, make Windows 8 work on ARM, remove Plug-ins from Windows 10 "Metro Browser" and make the programming for Metro as HTML+JavaScript in preference over .NET.
