<p>Produced by the World Wildlife Fund, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/explore-wwf-free-rivers-a-new-augmented-reality-app">Free Rivers</a> is an interactive storytelling experience that teaches users about how wildlife, people, and landscapes depend on healthy, free-flowing rivers. In this free AR app, users explore a river’s surrounding landscape in an environment inspired by real places, changing weather patterns, dams, and sustainable energy to understand a free-river’s role in an ecosystem.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Considering how many factors affect rivers and how many forms of life are affected by their existence, Free Rivers does a good job of addressing all of an ecosystem’s complexities. The AR map that you interact with can be manipulated in size and perspective, allowing you to see a river’s connection to both farmers and their crops, dolphins, and places of worship.</p>

<p>Though there is a storyline to follow, you can move at your own pace, exploring the ecosystem and all of the detail the designers have included. When you happen upon a person, animal, or structure with an icon above them, you can tap to learn about how they are affected by the river.</p>
 
<p>Additionally, having the ability to visualize cause and effect in this environment, like damming a river, is very effective in stressing the importance of sustainable development.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The AR in Free Rivers is fine, but not overwhelmingly impressive. Though the river water moves convincingly, all humans and animals, save one lone hawk soaring over the scene, are completely static, and hover slightly above the ground. Sometimes the map wiggled or resized itself unprompted, which was frustrating.</p>
 
<p>I liked the interactive story in this app, but I found myself wishing I’d first found all of the icons of individuals affected by the river. These were promoted as a sort of post-story feature, but I think the story makes more sense if you first understand why the free-flowing river is so important to this particular ecosystem.</p>

<p>Finally, the experience really only takes about 10 minutes, so I think the app could benefit from adding more information or expanding activities already present, like a longer, more excitingly gamified raft ride down the river.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While WWF Free Rivers is still a bit limited in its design, as a free resource, it could definitely be used as a fun supplementary teaching tool in elementary or middle school science classrooms.</p>
