          <p>
            As a result of the weak economy, most state governments have had to make many budget cuts, including schools, Medicaid and other social programs. Schools have been feeling perhaps the worse of the cuts as teacher cuts, school supplies and extracurricular activities. According to this article from Time, a high school in <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/07/everythings-bigger-in-texas-especially-this-60-million-high-school-football-stadium/?hpt=hp_t3">Texas has built a $60 million dollar football stadium</a>. High school soccer is a religion in Texas and was forever immortalized in the movie, Friday Night Lights.
 
Allen High School, one of the top 10 football teams in Texas' highly competitive high school football league, rebuilt their stadium to include additional capacity in order to sell more tickets and will use the venue to host other sporting events such as wrestling and indoor golf. Though several people have expressed concerns about the budget of the stadium considering the current economic climate for schools, I think this might be a good idea for several struggling schools as another revenue stream.  It will potentially make schools less dependent on government for revenue and balance their budget even if there are cuts.
 
Do you think this is a good direction for schools to generate revenue?
