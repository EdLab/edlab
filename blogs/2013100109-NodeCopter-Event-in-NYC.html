            Nodecopter is organizing an event in NYC on Oct 11-13. Interested people can see the email below and it would be a great opportunity to do hacking around drones which will be the topic of todays D&R.

Excerpt:

We're excited to announce that we'll host a NodeCopter event at the first ever <a href="https://droneconference.org/speakers/">Drones & Aerial Robotics Conference (DARC)</a> which will take place at New York University on October 11-13 in New York City.

DARC is a unique event which will bring together entrepreneurs, engineers, fighter pilots, citizen journalists, and more to tackle the important questions that drones raise for civil society. By contextualizing diverse perspectives into a bigger picture, DARC is approaching the subject of drones in a completely new way. The speaker list includes influential roboticists and CEOs, along with some of the best and brightest academic and legal minds on the subject. It's a packed three-day program, all aimed towards breaking down the big questions and generating constructive output.

There will also be a technical show on Friday night (Oct 11th) at AfterDARC. It will have both short-form live and video demonstrations, featuring work from startups, researchers, and the DIY/hobbyist sector. Alums from both the ETH Zurich Measurement and Control Lab and U Penn's GRASP Lab are scheduled to give live demos, in addition to others.
We'll also present there and demo some of the best NodeCopter hacks so far. We'd be happy to meet you there!

The third day of the conference (Sunday, Oct 13th) is the conference hack day.
On Sunday we will host a NodeCopter hackathon at ITP New York City that Parrot is sponsoring. We're giving away at least 3 Parrot AR drones to the top three hacks.

Please register for the conference <a href="https://droneconference.org/register/">here</a>. Our NodeCopter friends can use the 30% off code: DARCFRIEND30
Then, please do not forget to also register for the NodeCopter hackathon <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/8293334587">here</a>. We will have around 15 drones so there are only 45 seats - first come first served. We will also have free food and drinks for everybody.

If you have further questions, please find all relevant information on the <a href="http://nodecopter.com/2013/new-york/oct-13">event page</a> on nodecopter.com or email us at core@nodecopter.com.

If you're interested in volunteering to help us, volunteers get free admission to all events as well as a t-shirt.
Please email us or the DARC organizers at contact@droneconference.org if you're interested.


Looking forward to seeing you all there!
