<a href="https://goalbookapp.com/">Goalbook</a> is a management system for special education teachers to keep track of the progress of each student in an individualized education plan (IEP), student study team, or intervention plan. The system helps special educators effectively manage their students and collaborate with their coworkers and allies (i.e. teachers, therapists, administrators, parents) to reach educational goals.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Goalbook has a special focus on the goals set for individual students who are involved in IEP programs. This focus streamlines the implementation and management of the IEP program. The management tools are aimed at collaborating parents, teachers and specialists who want to help students achieve their unique goals, similar to a social network that connects people together with a specific educational purpose. The interface provides a clear visualization of objectives each individual student needs to achieve. Teachers can add goals or revise existing goals based on studentsâ€™ progress. The combination of social networking and data collection is a recipe for individualized educational achievement. Goalbook also brings special education to the mainstream. Teachers who use Goalbook can link the goals set for their students to the Common Core standards. In this way, students with IEPs will also learn what their peers learn in regular classes, with an adaptive approach that best fits their needs.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are some restrictions on functions for teachers who want to use a free personal account on Goalbook. Teachers are restricted from management tasks like  deleting a student from their class, which can create some inconvenience.  Goalbook should add flexibility for teachers who do not or cannot use their paid <i>Plus</i> or <i>SPED Modules</i> plans. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Goalbook represents a new generation of tools that are the nuts and bolts of change in special education. It is hard and inefficient for special education teachers to keep track of all students with their individual needs. Goalbook uses technology that improves the efficiency of managing large amounts of student data. Addressing inefficiencies in individualized education plans and connecting student teachers and allies is an essential development for special education. Goalbook is advancing the digital reform of special education practice and management.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Goalbook is an effective tool in collecting and analyzing data for boosting individualized and adaptive learning.</p>
