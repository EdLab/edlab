<b>Note: "Favorited" has been officially coined for use in this post.</b>

I know the lab has explored <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">GoodReads</a> at length in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3158">posts</a> as early as 2009, however, this ever popular, online "book club" should be mined for future EdNode & Pundit sharing and sorting features.  

I have explored GoodReads for about 6 months, and the social book sharing platform has an intuitive interface for sorting & managing large data sets in this case, books, friends & groups.  This ability to act as curator of your own literary collection is handled in a fresh, modern way through simple UI and UX design.  Additionally, the ability to invite friends to "peek" at what you are reading and view your "collection" feels collaborative and not invasive through a well-integrated, email-based message system. 

<b>How does this relate specifically to Pundit/EdNode development?</b>
The ability to store and share "favorites" is a feature we are exploring for Pundit release v 1.0.  GoodReads manages to make this feature seem fresh by sorting your "stored/favorited" books into the following categories: 1) Have read 2) Currenly Reading 3) Want to Read in the future.   We could explore tagging like this to take the Pundit favorites section even further in future releases.  We could adapt these categories as follows in reference to courses: 1) Have taken 2) Currently Enrolled 3) Want to take. 

Another compelling feature of  GoodReads is that much like Amazon or Netflix, a GoodReads algorithm will suggest books to logged-in users based on genres and authors that you have in your existent lists.  We are using a similar algorithm for Pundit to link with your EdNode profile & pull data to make course recommendations.  Perhaps we can mine the idea of suggestions based on instructors from favorite courses or authors of readings you have favorited? 

GoodReads allows users to invite friends to see what books they are reading.  This simple act of sharing books in which you have invested time and money, on a dedicated system, still feels fresh many years after the site's beginning.  I think one of the main reasons for this is that the site is a one-stop-shop for management, sorting and sharing of a personally curated collection.  In a similar way Pundit/EdNode proposes to provide sites where you can manage, sort and share your curated courses, interests and profile information and gain insight from like-minded individuals who share the common bond of a love of learning.
