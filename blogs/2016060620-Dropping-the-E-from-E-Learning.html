<p>At one point in the not-so-distant past, it was the norm to specify that a game you were playing was an online game, or that the map you were using was Google Maps and not a fold-up one from AAA. Nowadays, people tend to just assume that the tool you’re using is an online one. This is the basis of the argument in this research article from Portugal. Even though the term <i>e-learning</i> is still used widely today, the authors suggest that as technology and electronic devices become more ubiquitous, the <i>e</i> used to denote an electronic version of a tool or resource will disappear entirely from the term.</p>
 
<p>The authors point out that information and communication technologies (ICT) are becoming more common in schools, even to the point of being somewhat invisible to the typical student. They analyze a diffusion curve that shows the adoption process of a new technology. The curve includes five categories of adopters based on timing: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. They argue that when the last stage occurs, the technology is no longer considered "technology;" instead, it becomes an invisible part of everyday life.</p>
 
<p>The researchers also point out data that shows the increasing number of households with internet access and the number of computers found in schools. They suggest that these resources are now as invisible and commonplace as books. They draw the parallel that because we do not say <i>book-learning</i>, we will likely drop the use of <i>e-learning</i> as well. The effects of this change, they add, may include an imperfect implementation of online learning due to its invisibility, or by contrast, an increased sense of familiarity with digital tools that make teaching and learning easier and more manageable.</p>
