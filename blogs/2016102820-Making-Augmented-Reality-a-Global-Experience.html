<p><i>"We have always had the vision of turning the world into an interactive learning environment. We want our app to be capable of recognizing everything in the world, and then once it has done that recognition, to surface contextual content to students."</i> (<a href="https://blippar.com/en/">Colin Elliot- Kelly Head of Education at Blippar</a>) </p>
 
<p><b> What is Blippar? </b></p>
 
<p><a href=" https://blippar.com/en/">Blippar</a> is only two years old, but with a user base of over 12,000 people and 60,000 more educators itching to be a part, its ambitious mission and goals are likely to be met. The augmented reality platform is seeking to turn the world into a learning space. By partnering with users and content producers, Blippar identifies objects and people in the world around you. Simply open the app, hover your camera over an object, and Blipparâ€™s sensors kick in identifying everything about the object, from news to history. </p>
 
<p><b>The Road Ahead </b></p>
 
<p>Such a new company is bound to face some challenges ahead, like the ability to scale in a way that can accommodate those 60,000 users waiting to join, in addition to others who will follow. However, in interviews the founder has noted that their engineering team is up to the task as they anticipate millions to join the platform. They have also made a point to reduce as many barriers to entry as possible, so the product is free for the user, while it sustains itself financially from commercial content producers. </p>
 
<p><b>Beyond Education, Beyond the West </b></p>
 
<p> Though the app is about a lot more than education (there are marketing and other commercial uses for the product as well), they have already partnered with several schools and museums from London to New York City, and are now piloting in different regions of Africa and India. They say their goal is to be in the pockets of a million students to bring them learning experiences they might have never embarked on without AR.  </p>
