<p><a href=" http://www.corestandards.org">The Common Core State Standards</a> come with new requirements for responding to 21st Century learners who are familiar users of digital media. When helping classroom teachers make the transition from traditional to new teaching practices, it's informative to consider examples of how traditionally-prepared classroom teachers made the leap into incorporating digital media. How might a teacher meaningfully integrate technology in a manner that would be beneficial to student learning? A recent ethnographic study examined how a fifth-grade classroom teacher embarked on a mission to integrate technology into her classroom via digital storytelling.</p>

<p>The classroom literacy curriculum of the study included reading and writing workshops, literature circles, reader theatre, and the use of graphic organizers for comprehension and vocabulary development. With a newly received technology grant, the classroom teacher was able to equip her classroom with a SMART Board, document projector, laptops, flip cameras, and other technological devices. Before the study, she did not integrate any digital practices into her classroom teaching.</p>

<p>The study specifically investigated an ongoing unit on literacy elements, sequencing, and summarizing through students’ shared reading of Elisa Carbone’s <a href=" http://www.elisacarbone.com/books/Blood_on_the_River.html"><i>Blood on the River: James Town, 1607</i></a>. The teacher first provided a series of mini lessons on skills or strategies that students needed for comprehending the story.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the unit, students explored the features of local dialects as well as historical events presented in the novel. The teacher then organized students for literature circles and assigned roles in reader theaters accordingly to ensure that each student had a firm understanding of the plot. She further led the class to identify 24 main events from the novel and pulled names from a hat to randomly assign each student to work on one event. Each student was asked to illustrate his/her assigned event and contribute to whole-class discussion on sequencing.</p>

<p>The individual illustration activity was followed by mini lessons on summarizing and creating dialogues for a chosen scene. The teacher guided students to choose 11 of their illustrations that would represent the story for an audience who had never read the novel. Students through whole-class discussions made a collaborative decision that they wanted to retell the novel by creating a movie. Students used the illustrations as prompts for featuring the main events and creating relevant character dialogues. They proactively took ownership of every aspect of the digital storytelling project, including writing the script, designing and preparing needed props, staging scenes, and making casting decisions. Meanwhile, the teacher decided that her role was to offer timely suggestions and encourage students to think critically about the decisions they made.</p>

<p>Students recorded individual digital stories to represent the 11 selected scenes from the novel and ultimately streamed them together via iMovie. They also used the software to record their voiceover narrations and edit their video recordings uploaded from flip cameras. As reported by the authors, students completed the filming of their own performances of each scene in just one day. After that, individual students worked with the teacher to edit the movie and added some finishing touches. Their final movie can be viewed on <a href=" http://www.schooltube.com/video/5414a077fc418e78db30/Blood%20on%20the%20River">SchoolTube</a>. </p>

<p>The study serves as a fascinating example for the instructional integration of digital storytelling in elementary classrooms. Although it does not provide the details of the technical challenges the teacher and her students might have encountered, it highlights a successful experiment of a teacher combining elements of a standard literacy curriculum customized by giving students ownership over responding to the novel and exploring new media. In the unit, students actually co-constructed and co-enacted the curriculum with the teacher; differentiated options were available for students to design, narrate, perform, and collaborate on various oral, written, audio-visual, and kinesthetic texts.</p>

<p>The study provides a meaningful case about what it means to be literate, what counts as literacy, and how literacy can be taught in today’s multimodal, digital world. The blending of traditional and new literacy practices via digital storytelling allows students to fluidly design a highly creative end product, which helps to revitalize the common practice of classroom literacy teaching while leveraging and expanding students’ traditional and digital literacy competencies in differentiated ways.</p>
