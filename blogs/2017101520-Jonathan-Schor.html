Jonathan Schor is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.playcodemonkey.com/">CodeMonkey</a>, an online game that teaches both fundamentals and advanced topics in computer programming. In addition to his work at CodeMonkey, Schor works with children and youth in various non-profit education ventures focused on social mobility through project-based learning.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at CodeMonkey?</b><br>
<p>In the early ‘90s, when I was nine years-old, I went to a summer coding camp and started coding with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a>, MIT’s first programming language for children. That summer was when my life-long romance with programming languages began. During this time, my initial inspiration for creating my own coding courses for children emerged, and 10 years later, my inspiration turned into reality. My several years worth of experience developing enterprise software, and later building and managing teams of software developers, allowed me to gain deep insights on what it really takes to become an employable coder. The educational projects I ran, in parallel to my software engineering career, revolved around project based learning (PBL) with underprivileged youth. These projects made me witness over and and over again what a tremendous game-changer a platform like CodeMonkey can be in enabling upward social mobility for children and teens.</p>
<p><b>What has been the response from individuals who have used CodeMonkey?</b><br>
<p>Anyone who has ever used CodeMonkey has fallen in love with it immediately. On CodeMonkey, children type text-based coding in a real world programming language from the get-go. I think that’s the key differentiator from all the drag and drop block puzzles out there that solely teach programmatic thinking to young learners. We came up with special adaptive, big data-driven technologies that take away most of the frustrating technical difficulties pushing learners away from joyfully tinkering with real lines of code. The result is a highly-engaging keyboard gaming experience that makes players feel like mean hackers from day one.</p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The role the Internet plays in making information so readily accessible has led to society’s shift away from memorizing facts during the learning process. Automation decreases the demand for technical skills, so we should see classes focusing more on developing cognitive, emotional, and social skills. Last but not least, schools have to improve engagement in order to stay relevant. There are many ways to achieve that, but they all begin with allowing a more personalized learning experience.</p>
<p><b>In addition to CodeMonkey , what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>Nothing, CodeMonkey takes 100% of my time and attention. Oh wait, my wife just had our first baby girl! So I’m working on that now, too.</p>
