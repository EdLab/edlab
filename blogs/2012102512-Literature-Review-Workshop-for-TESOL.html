<strong>FINDING BOOKS
</strong>

<em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em> <em>(LCSH) </em>are the            official  subject terms prescribed by the Library of Congress for    the         cataloging  of books and are in use in essentially all    academic         libraries.  To find works pertaining to linguistic  foundations of Teaching English as a Second Language and    related  subjects,  it    may be useful to  use some of the   subject terms,    or   combinations  of   terms, listed below  when   searching the online      catalogs of  libraries at   Teachers College,    Columbia University,   and    other  institutions. To search by subject rather than by keyword, simply enter one of the below terms (or try your own) under "subject" under a basic or advanced search.
<ul>
	<li>Biculturalism</li>
	<li>Bilingualism</li>
	<li>Code switching (Linguistics)</li>
	<li>Cultural pluralism</li>
	<li>Education, Bilingual</li>
	<li>English language — Study and      teaching — Foreign speakers</li>
	<li>Language and languages —      Study and teaching</li>
	<li>Multicultural education</li>
	<li>Multiculturalism</li>
	<li>Multilingualism</li>
	<li>Second language acquisition</li>
	<li>Second language acquisition —      Cross-cultural studies</li>
	<li>Second language acquisition —      Social aspects</li>

<strong>Search Terms Within Databases</strong>

Searching by keyword will often quickly lead to productive results, however, it is useful to note that databases, like online book catalogs, also use subject headings (or descriptors). To search by subject you will need to locate the link to the database's "thesaurus" or "subjects." Once you're here, simply enter terms and click search to locate the official authorized term in the thesaurus. Note too that articles are linked by subject terms or descriptors within the article itself. These terms will appear as links, which you can use to find other "like" articles. Specific search methods vary by database.

<strong>Subject Terms to try in Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Acquisition of Second Language</li>
	<li>Second Language Learning</li>
	<li>English as a Second Language Teaching Methods</li>
	<li>Classroom Communication</li>
	<li>Language Maintenance</li>
	<li>Cross Cultural Communication</li>

<strong>Handbooks of Research</strong>

Handbooks of research are collections of articles on the most pressing issues in a given field, written by the top thinkers in the field. These collections intend to define the current thinking in the field at their time of publication. Published less often than journals, handbooks may be considered more definitive; essays in handbooks also explore broader topics than journal articles and tend to have extensive bibliographies (useful for literature reviews).

<strong>Citation Indexes</strong>

Citation Indexes are especially useful to researchers conducting a literature review because they provide a handy digital roadmap to cited articles. Depending on the resource, one can search for articles cited within a given work (backwards) as well as later articles building on that work (forwards). Citation searches help locate prominent works on a topic.
