<p>It is estimated that young people spend around 8.6 hours a day watching television, using smartphones and computers, and playing video games. According to the World Health Organization 81% of adolescents do not reach the minimum recommended daily amount of physical activity and, in recent years, motivation for physical activity has decreased while sedentarism has increased.<p>
 
<p>Spurred to find new ways to increase outdoor activity, researchers hypothesized that young people who play Pokémon GO could show higher levels of cognitive performance (mental factors responsible for the planning, intellectual organization, and behavior control) and emotional intelligence (well-being, self-control, emotionality, and sociability) than their non-playing peers.</p>
 
<p>The aim of Pokémon GO is to catch Pokémon; cartoon characters who are superimposed onto a physical world in real world surroundings, such as lobbies, streets, and historical sites through a smartphone. The augmented reality game uses the phone’s GPS signal to pinpoint a player’s location, and its camera and Google Maps to build the virtual world on the screen. Players are then guided to a ‘gym’, a real world venue like a church, park, or monument in their area, where they face-off with the Pokémon and battle against other players. In short, the virtual world becomes a giant playground.</p>
 
<p>In the study, 87 Spanish adolescents, between 12 and 15 years, played Pokémon GO while a control group of 103 remained indoors. Over eight weeks, participants played an average of 40 minutes a day. Their cognitive performance and emotional intelligence were measured in the second and third weeks of the trial using ad hoc tests and a questionnaire.<p>

<p>The results found that boys played more often for fun, and girls more often to combat boredom. Players also showed a higher level in selective attention, concentration, and sociability than those who did not play. Boys accumulated more points and reached a higher level than girls, and both boys and girls were more happy and motivated to go outside to play.<p> 

<p>Researchers recommend further studies to compare single and collaborative play, and to identify the pedagogical benefits with subjects like physical education.</p>
