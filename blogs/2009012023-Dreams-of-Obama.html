          <p>
            In the midst of the hoopla surrounding Obama's inauguration, PBS' Frontline premiered its biographical documentary of Obama, titled <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dreamsofobama/">Dreams of Obama</a>. The documentary highlights Obama's meteoric rise from community organizer to Illinois State Senator to the Presidency. Drawing largely from Obama's first autobiography, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreams_from_My_Father">Dreams From My Father</a>, Dreams of Obama starts with Obama's coming out party as a political star at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, where he delivered the keynote address,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audacity_of_Hope">The Audacity of Hope</a>, which served as the title of his second autobiography. 

The film follows Obama's early political career through interviews and insights from the people who have come to form the core of his advisors, e.g. chief strategist David Axelrod. The most interesting aspect of the documentary was the behind the scenes look at the key moments in Obama's campaign for the White House: his initial hesitation about running for the presidency, how to deal with the racist comments of his pastor, Reverend Wright and how the economic downtown last fall changed the face of his race against Senator John McCain. 

It offers a different perspective from the Obama that has been dominating the news the past few days: his personal struggle to reconcile his diverse racial background, learning to serve as a conciliatory between two opposing views during his years at Harvard Law, and using his momentum from the Democratic Convention as a stepping stone to the US Senate and subsequently to the Presidency. 

EdLab's Development and Research group are working on a resource about Obama and many of the themes his name inspires. The themes in the documentary are yet another avenue the EdLab can consider in drawing up the resource.
