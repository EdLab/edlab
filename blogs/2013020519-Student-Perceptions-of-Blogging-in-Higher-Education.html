<p><b>Title:</b> To Blog or Not to Blog: Student Perceptions of Blog Effectiveness for Learning in a College-Level Course <p>
<b>Authors:</b> Olivia Halica, Debra Lee, Trena Paulus, & Marsha Spence</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Blogging is a popular and appealing activity in higher education instructional environments because it encourages critical thought and has the potential to make student learning more transparent. Reading student blogs can help instructors assess understanding and refine lesson plans, and participating in a blogging community can help students feel connected. The impact of blogging on perceived learning is not well-understood and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751610000321">To Blog or Not to Blog: Student Perceptions of Blog Effectiveness for Learning in a College-Level Course</a> sought to examine blogging in a higher education lecture classroom for educational impact.</p>

<p>Students in a large lecture course were assigned to blog once weekly and participate in blog commenting with a small group of peers. The studentsâ€™ experience was examined in a survey about perceived learning and sense of community. The students were asked about knowledge development and sharing, enhanced understanding through writing, and interaction with other students in the course. </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results showed that sense of community and computer expertise of the kind inspired by classroom blogging were significant predictors of perceived learning. The survey data controlled for age, gender, and previous blogging experience, and revealed significant improvements in perceived learning when students were asked to blog for class. A majority of the students reported that blogging enhanced their learning and led them to think about course concepts outside the classroom. Students were less satisfied with the practice of peer commenting and engaging with their small group in an online space.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Blogging in class can improve perceived learning in the higher education classroom, but instructors using this strategy should be careful to provide a structure for online activity. The authors speculated that the dissatisfaction students felt with the peer commenting was due to a lack of instructor moderation. Blogs outside of the classroom have been havens for collaborative learning communities, so it seems like they could provide an opportunity for fruitful discussion under the right conditions.</p>
