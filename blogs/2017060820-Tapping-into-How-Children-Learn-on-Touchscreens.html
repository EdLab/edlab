<p>In recent years, touchscreen devices have become as prevalent in low socioeconomic status (SES) families as in high SES families, and children from all backgrounds are using similar educational apps starting at a young age. In light of this, it’s perhaps more important than ever to consider how different populations of children might learn differently from apps. Two studies examined the relationships among how children interact with a touchscreen tablet, their levels of self-regulation, and how many words they learn via the app.</p>

<p>The first study examined 2-year-olds tapping behaviors while interacting with the app in relation to their levels of self-regulation. Researchers created a word-learning app; during the instructions, children were told not to tap on the screen. The researchers found that the children who tested with the highest levels of self-regulation were also the children who tapped the least during the instructions. Additionally, they found that in general, boys tapped more than girls did, and older children enrolled in preschool tapped less than the 2-year-olds.</p>

<p>The second study examined how different groups of children aged 2-4 learned from the app in either low or high interaction settings. In the first group, the children were only able to watch the app. In the second group, the children were able to tap and drag words on the screen. Interestingly, the results were not uniform across the board. Boys tended to learn better while watching, and girls and low SES children learned better tapping and dragging words.</p>

<p>The researchers believe this discrepancy could be due to the fine line between interactivity that is educational and interactivity that is distracting. The authors suggest that young boys learn better when they are instructed not to touch the screen because they are more easily distracted from the learning goal when they tap and drag words. Conversely, girls and children from low SES backgrounds learned better while touching the screen, likely because the interactivity was able to effectively capture their attention without distracting them.</p>

<p>These studies offer insight into how children of different backgrounds interact and learn differently from touchscreens. Based on the results, the authors suggest that an app’s content is not the only important pedagogical feature; instead, how a child interacts with an app is equally as important. Because of this, the authors suggest that children would benefit from having apps that parents and educators can customize to meet their specific learning needs.</p>
