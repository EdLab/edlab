            <strong>This conference maybe of interest to those working on design pedagogy:
</strong>

WHAT: AIGA Design Educators Conference

WHERE: AIGA Honolulu

TITLE: Geographics: Design, Education, and the Transnational Terrain

WHEN: Thursday, December 13–Saturday, December 15, 2012

HOSTED BY: The East-West Center and the University of Hawai‘i at M¯anoa

Honolulu, Hawai‘i; USA
<p style="text-align: center">Call for Proposals</p>


<strong>Conference Description:</strong>

Many design educators in different parts of the world today are working in what may be called a transnational
context. The boundaries that define the field of higher education have become increasingly fluid,
and professors, students, programs, and curricula are moving back and forth between distant regions of
the world as never before. The design projects, research, and institutions that result retain a unique cultural
complexity because they promote meanings and values that often transcend the cultures and boundaries
of the nations within which they originate.

The conference Geographics: Design, Education, and the Transnational Terrain will provide international
design educators the opportunity to share examples of design projects and programs that have been
implemented within a transnational context, while allowing others to present theoretical or reflective
positions about what it means to design within a transnational context today. The conference will also be
open to presentations from practitioners who design within transnational contexts and who view design
as a strategic framework for intercultural collaboration and intersection. The conference will use the term
“transnational” to describe the ways in which designs moves through a wide range of contemporary and
historical geographic contexts, including the movement of design between multiple nations and other
geopolitical entities; the movement of design between peoples who define themselves as belonging to different
geopolitical entities, regardless of their location or national affiliation; and the movement of design
against the constraints of any particular national, international, or global geographic construct.

By examining the movement of design projects, ideas, and institutions throughout a wide variety of global
contexts, we hope to stimulate discussion about design education and how it engages some of the following
questions: How do graphic design practices and products take shape within a given transnational
context, and consequently give shape to it? How is this context revealed in the design products we make
as well as the ideas and values that fortify such products? How do graphic designers explore, support, and
reinforce notions of multi-national cultural identity that move beyond nationality and universality within
their contemporary practice? How are design educators working to establish new connections or to facilitate
existing connections between different global regions and peoples? How can design educators formulate
research objectives that better respond to their own transnational contexts—ones that respond to the
specificity of cultures and yet reach beyond the commodification of cultural difference?

<strong>Conference Audience</strong>

The conference Geographics: Design, Education, and the Transnational Terrain will bring together nationally
and internationally renowned design educators and practitioners as a community of individuals with
global interests. The conference will offer experienced educators the opportunity to share examples of
transnational projects and ideas that have worked well for them, and will allow interested educators to
learn about transnational design education from the ground up. While the conference will focus on the
ways in which the transnational experience has informed education and practice within the graphic design
discipline, we will also welcome compelling proposals that address aspects of transnational design more
generally (historically and/or theoretically).

<strong>Conference Format and Structure</strong>

The conference will take place over three days (Thursday through Saturday) and will consist of three
thematic strands. These strands will allow conference participants to address the ways in which design
projects, design ideas, and design institutions move within transnational contexts. Two renowned design
thinkers will launch each conference strand by presenting their ideas about the ways in which transnational
design operates today. These opening sessions will then be followed by consecutive paper sessions,
which will continue throughout the second and third days of the conference.

<strong>Theme 1: Design Projects</strong>

The “Design Projects” conference strand will allow design educators to present examples of transnational
project work in its many forms. This strand can include projects that have been created through direct
collaboration between people living in different regions; projects that have ended up transcending national
boundaries, regardless of their makers’ original intentions; projects created by a designer living in
one country or cultural region for people living in another; projects that have facilitated communication
between peoples of many different regions; and the discussion of international and transnational projects
throughout history.

Potential themes for this strand might include the design of cultural heritage exchanges, diplomatic materials,
ethnographic exhibitions, multinational design collaborations, the representation of cultural boundaries
or boundary transcendence, travel and tourism materials, student collaborations, transnational activism,
transnational branding and identity development, and transnational service projects.

<strong>Theme 2: Design Ideas</strong>

The “Design Ideas” conference strand will allow design educators to present theoretical or critical positions
that discuss the ways in which design ideas move across borders, either historically or within contemporary
global contexts.

Potential themes for this strand might include the discussion or critique of center vs. periphery theory,
changing geographic constructs, critical gender theory, critical race theory, cultural independence vs.
interdependence, design as cultural boundary, design as cultural imperialism, design as development,
dislocation/diaspora, globalization theory, indigenous perspectives, international corporations and capitalism,
historical geography, hybridity, multilingualism in design, the representation of place as a product of
the transnational experience, resistance to transnational enterprises, transculturation, and transnational
identity construction.

<strong>Theme 3: Design Institutions</strong>

The “Design Institutions” conference strand will allow design educators and administrators to exemplify or
criticize the ways in which a wide variety of design institutions have served or are serving as transnational
educational enterprises. Presentations within this strand can include the representation of specific programs,
schools, and organizations as well as the discussion of the ways in which such institutions operate.

Potential themes for this strand might include the representation or critique of “franchise” universities,
Fulbright and other teaching exchange programs, international colleges and universities, international design
organizations, the global institutionalization of the design profession, NGOs, study abroad programs,
transnational curricula, transnational design publishing, and transnational education advocacy.

<strong>Submitting A Conference Proposal</strong>

All proposals will be evaluated via a peer-review process. Proposals must be written in English and must
clearly describe the transnational context of your design project work, research, and/or institutional experience.
Each proposal must include the following:

• Your name, your institutional affiliation, and your contact information, including your telephone number,
your mailing address, and your e-mail address.

• The title of your paper or presentation, and the conference theme that it pertains to.

• A concise abstract of 250 words or less. Please do not include images at this stage of the proposal process.

• A concise, single-page CV.

• The above information must appear on two letter-size pages. Proposals that are longer than two pages
will not be accepted.

Each proposal should be submitted to Stuart McKee at the following e-mail address: sdmckee@usfca.edu.
Each proposal should be submitted as a PDF file, using last name, first initial, middle initial, and conference
title as the document titling format, as follows: “SmithAB.Geographics.pdf”.

<strong>Deadlines</strong>

Proposals must be received by end of day February 15, 2012. Notice of acceptance will be provided
to all proposal authors on or before March 15, 2012. Accepted authors will be required to submit full papers
with complete images by September 1, 2012.
