<b>Description:</b> <b><a href="http://gylo.com/">Get Ya Learn On</a></b> is a company that provides learning applications and games designed for visual learners who would need a supplement learning material other than the traditional textbooks. The application is created to be pedagogically effective and uses empirical research and innovative technologies to enhance learning and assessment. One of their products is an app called Statistics 1 and is available for $4.99 on the iPad, iPhone, and Android. The app contains lessons, simulation tools and calculators, quizzes, glossary, formulas, and flashcards all pertaining to the subject of statistics. The lessons cover the basics of statistics from the introductory lesson to student testing and an introduction to research methods of ANOVA and MANOVA. Get Ya Learn On also has other apps that are study guides for different topics like survey research, public relations, regression, SEM, and Moby Dick. This review will explore the Statistics 1 app in detail.

<b>Pros:</b> The Statistics 1 app has a solid lesson set for the basics of statistics. What interests me the most about the app is in the quiz section. When a user answers a question incorrectly, the app will have a message pop up giving the user the option of trying to answer again or review the material. The review material option is an interesting and unique option that allows the user to go back to the exact lesson the question was referring to. This option alone shows the user that the app was specially designed to ensure that the user learns the material.

<b>Cons:</b> Some users would not like to have the lesson and quiz section completely separate. If a user completely reads a lesson they would have to get out of the lesson section and go to the quiz section to test their knowledge. It would benefit users greatly if the lessons and quizzes were together, so if a user completes a lesson they'll have the option of taking the quiz right away. Although it would be good to still have the separate sections as well.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> Get Ya Learn On is a company that is trying to provide learning materials to visual learners through an app that might be seen by some as an interactive textbook. It does not seem like it is a full interactive textbook at first glance, although if Statistics 1 can merge their lessons, quizzes, and tools together in a seamless way then that might be an innovative sight to see and a solid interactive textbook to add to the library.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> While the Statistics 1 app is a pretty solid app for learning basic statistics, Get Ya Learn On's other apps seem small in comparison, mostly because they are glossary and flashcard apps for different subjects. It would be interesting to see full interactive textbook apps for the other subjects as well.
