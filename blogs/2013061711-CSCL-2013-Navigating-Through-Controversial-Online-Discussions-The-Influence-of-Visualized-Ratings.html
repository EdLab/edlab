            Through this study (similar concept with Vialogues, except not video dialogues, we don't have ratings), they found uni-polar and bi-polar reading patterns based on discussion ratings. 
 - making agreement ratings available leads to bipolar navigation, 
 - the availability of quality ratings leads to unipolar navigation,

Conclusion: <b>providing different types of visualized ratings have specific guiding effects for navigation.</b> 

This is a lab study. They asked students to rate everything in real life. Will you really rate every single discussion?

I have high hopes with our navigation-support viz in Vialogues. We really need to have the navigation support tailored to our goal (just overview? awareness?) How do we make our good discussions stand out with or without ratings?

Abstract: Awareness tools using visualized ratings of other people can help recipients to find their way in crowded information spaces. This article reports on a laboratory experiment that investigates how the design of an awareness tool impacts the navigation behavior of recipients within an online discussion forum. In the experiment, 127 participants read through a forum discussion for which posts were rated by average agreement and average quality. Depending on the experimental condition, posts were visualized along continua indicating average agreement ratings (absent vs. present) and/or average quality ratings (absent vs. present). It was hypothesized that an agreement visualization will increase the salience of both high- agreement and low-agreement posts, whereas a quality visualization will only increase the salience of high-quality posts. Measuring reading times for discussion posts, these hypotheses could be confirmed. However, neither recipients' attitude strength nor recall of discussion arguments was affected.
