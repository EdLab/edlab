          <p>
            Today is my mom’s birthday. My family wrote this last year in her memory.

Thanks for reading.

D.

<div><b>Eva Ann Sossi</b></div>
<div>Wife, mother, grandmother, accidental feminist, unofficial den mother, compulsive reader, joyful gardener. Born April 22 in Lednica, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), died April 12, 2015, in Kitchener, Ont.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/RZ-Eva-LooksAtCamera-SMALL-1.jpg" alt="RZ-Eva-LooksAtCamera-SMALL-1.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Eva Sossi’s family fled Czechoslovakia due to World War II and its aftermath. After a long ship ride, they settled in Blenheim, Ontario.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Baseball was Eva's calling. With wide shoulders and coiled stance, Eva swung the bat ferocious-ly. Her athleticism and easy-going demeanor attracted friends.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>However, Eva’s immigration caused problems. One boy called her a D.P.—Displaced Person. Eva is gentle but can anger when provoked. After his slight, she punched him in the face. That was the last time anyone called Eva from Czechoslovakia a D.P. Always forgiving, Eva befriended the boy.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>~</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Eva met Carlo Sossi in Sarnia, Ontario. Her instincts told her to run. Eva knew Carlo was trouble—the attraction was too strong.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>During courting, Eva became pregnant. Carlo wanted to ensure they could have kids before marriage. Carlo proposed. Eva waited. She wasn’t sure if he proposed because of the baby or for love. Being an unmarried pregnant woman in the old days was incredibly difficult. But Eva had to be sure Carlo loved her.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>They married after their first child was born.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>They remained married until Carlo’s untimely passing. Eva always kept a picture of Carlo in her wallet. She never remarried. Eva felt lucky to have one true love.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Eva was a caregiver. Seven children weren’t enough. Eva babysat her grandchildren, walking them to the playground and reading stories. Although childcare was demanding, Eva loved it. Compared to seven, caring for two grandkids was easy!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Eva loved reading, from politics to Danielle Steele. And she was outgoing. Her wide, innocent, inquisitive eyes were full of attention to the simplest parts of life. Eva was remarkable for her empathy and tranquility.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/RZ-Eva-DrinkingMilk-SMALL-2.jpg" alt="RZ-Eva-DrinkingMilk-SMALL-2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>After a lifetime of strength and independence, Eva passed with quiet grace.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>She had one request—to stay home with family.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Eva fought her failing body. She insisted on going to the restroom alone. Eva fed herself with her shaking left hand after her right stopped cooperating. When she was confined to a bed, we asked if she was okay. She said she was fine. Then she would silently wince from being bedridden. She didn’t want us to worry.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>~</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We often say older people live full lives.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>But Eva didn’t travel. College wasn’t an option. Eva didn’t work outside home very long.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>But her heart was full of love for her children and grandchildren, their spouses and friends. Eva selflessly reveled in our triumphs and hugged us when we hurt.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Our home was the unofficial gathering point for friends. Many condolences recall Eva’s warm hugs and welcome nature. Seven children and more grandchildren were not enough. Eva’s heart was too big.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Despite endless selflessness, Eva kept a special place in her heart for her spouse. It’s difficult to find solace, but knowing that Eva is finally with her husband Carlo, the love of her life, makes our pain bearable.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>You can put away the photo from your wallet Eva, Carlo is finally there with you.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Written by the Sossi family.</div>
