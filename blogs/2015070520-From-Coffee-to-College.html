Starbucks? Education? These two words might not seem to go together; however, in an historic and unprecedented endeavor, the coffee chain is now offering higher education opportunities to its employees. This a big deal for baristas who are left out of the college pipeline by the rising cost of tuition, and who aren't interested in online classes that lack accreditation and don’t lead to employment opportunities. </p>

<p>Through a partnership with Arizona State University, Starbucks offers its 140,000 employees full scholarships to enroll in online classes—for up to four years of academic work. In announcing this unique partnership, Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz stressed that the endeavor is strictly a social justice mission. Starbucks wants its employees to aspire to more ambitious careers than making orange mocha frappuccinos. By changing the very nature of how businesses should operate—by balancing profits and social justice goals—Starbucks may have stirred the interests of other for profit companies. </p>

<p>What are some of the potential drawbacks of this initiative? Can it be replicated by other industries? How will success be measured? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/22357">Join this compelling discussion on Vialogues. </a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>01:46 lassinebamba:</b> This is a great idea by Starbucks. It shows they care about the future of their employees. I wonder how else they can further expand the scholarship to include offline opportunities for students. </p>

<p><b>02:44 bizapp:</b> I think it is brilliant idea by Starbucks to offer its employees a chance at an education. This is twofold: it offers part time employees a chance at higher education and better employment opportunities. For full time employees, it could serve as professional development. </p>

<p><b>04:44 yaotse:</b> If college cost is significantly reduced, how much of an impact will it have on the country’s economy? </p>
