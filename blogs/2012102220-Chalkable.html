<p>Chalkable combines the features of a learning management system (LMS) with those of an app store. This application is uniquely convenient in that teachers can search and purchase apps through an in-LMS store and then seamlessly integrate those apps into their curriculum. Chalkable is not an ordinary app store; unlike iTunes and Google Play it focuses only on learning apps, which are organized by K-12 subjects and directed towards the educational community. The site includes logins for students, teachers, and administrators with parent and district logins coming soon. Each login provides a different set of tools targeted to the group’s function and privileges in Chalkable.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b>
The Chalkable app store lists web apps but not native apps so their apps will work across devices while users are logged into Chalkable. Teachers are able to easily integrate these web apps into their homework, tests, and projects on the Chalkable LMS. For example, a teacher could add an additional layer of student engagement by integrating a polling app into a quiz or a Khan Academy video in a project assignment. The site also provides data for teachers and administrators: teachers can see graphs of their students’ grades, while administrators can get a long view of students absent from school on any given day. This gives teachers the information they need to adjust their teaching methods for their students to increase learning. Administrators are able to set a budget for teachers to be able to purchase apps in the app store, which they can adjust in the admin login.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b>
The site is still in beta, which may explain the initial confusion of the LMS platform and the noticeable slowness when it comes to operating the interface. Chalkable has lots of options and features but lacks direction when creating assignments. The system would benefit from greater simplicity and direction.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Chalkable’s idea of combining an app store with a LMS is interesting because it encourages teachers to combine learning technologies with their curriculum to form more engaging assignments, tests, or projects. Homework can become more active if, for example, a math teacher assigns a math learning game for a remedial assignment if a student is not able to grasp a concept through conventional means. Filling their app store with web apps makes Chalkable much more flexible to use in the classroom. Students could bring their own device in lieu of using the same classroom set of computers or tablets. The app store provides recommendations and consumer reviews, which help users select which app will be most useful to them in a time of learning app overload. Adding custom app recommendations based on the subject and type of assignment or other criteria might serve to make Chalkable more powerful. The system is standalone when it comes to discovering the best learning apps for the classroom. Chalkable is off to a good start but the idea of an app store integrated with a LMS has greater potential.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b>
Chalkable helps educators weave learning apps into their curriculum.</p>
