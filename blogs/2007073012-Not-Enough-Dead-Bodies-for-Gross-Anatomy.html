            A worldwide problem is plaguing medical schools all over the globe and it's a morose one: there just aren't enough dead bodies to go around. 

This seems to be hitting many areas of the world.  Numerous articles have already been written describing the lack of bodies in medical schools in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4435184.stm">UK</a>. But this shortage has even reached <a href="http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i32/32a04503.htm">Kenya</a> and the United States. 

Years ago, the issue with dissecting human bodies had been that the experience itself was frightening for some students. Now, the problem has become the lack of bodies available for dissection and examination. Gross Anatomy is a <a href="http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070702/NEWS01/707020356">crucial</a> part of most, if not all, medical school curricula. For medical students, the course becomes a thoroughly revealing one once they overcome their initial fears. It gives students the chance to dissect a full human body and to learn about the intricacies and details first-hand. Skin, fat, muscles, blood vessels and nerves are typically examined and experts say that visual demonstration is not enough to provide students with sufficient knowledge of the human body. Familiarity with the feel of scalpel against flesh can only be obtained through this experience. 

If there is so much to be learned from hands-on dissection, what will be the long-term risks to forgoing this practice? Shouldn't future doctors be learning as much as they can about the human body?  Also, how are we to promote the donation of bodies to medical science? With the number of donated bodies steadily decreasing, how are the future doctors of the world going to experience what textbooks cannot teach? 

There seems to be no simple solution to this dilemma. It's not as if we can advertise on television or in newspapers that we need more people to donate their bodies. On the other hand, if no action is taken, students will eventually be studying limbs (or nothing at all) instead of full bodies. 

What is even more alarming is that medical students are not the only ones affected by this shortage. Donated bodies are also being used by surgeons for practicing and perfecting their techniques. There's a chance that five to ten years down the line, you or a loved one might have to undergo surgery. When that time comes, are you going to feel safe in the hands of your surgeon?
