<p><a href="https://teachable.com">Teachable</a> is a platform that allows educators to create, sell, and manage online courses. Pricing to use the service ranges from $39–$299 per month. Teachers keep profits from the courses they sell, while the company keeps a small transaction fee. With upgraded plans, Teachable keeps a smaller amount and provides more features.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The Teachable platform is fairly easy to use. Creating a course is akin to drag-and-drop website creation tools like Squarespace. Courses are incredibly customizable, with features such as quizzes, discussion forums, blogs, and video lectures. Creators can also choose from various fee structures: one-time purchase, installments, subscription, or free.</p> 

<p>Profits are directly transferred to a PayPal account and the service even offers a built-in tax filing tool. Creators have the option of bundling course offerings, too. </p>  

<p>Once teachers get started, managing courses and students should be no problem. The user interface is similar to other common educational management tools like Canvas or BlackBoard. Overall, the features really provide a sense of professionalization for educators trying to become entrepreneurs, and some of the <a href="https://learn.vrdev.school/?src=teachable-examples">sample</a> <a href="http://courses.sketchmaster.com/?src=teachable-examples?src=teachable-examples">courses</a>  from successful users are indistinguishable from offerings at universities or large MOOC providers.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Teachable seems ideal for educators with an already-established client base looking to expand. Conversely, teachers who are just starting out and don’t have many students might be hesitant to use the platform. Even with a professional and sleek design, I’m not sure Teachable’s pricing model works for those starting from zero.</p>

<p>While Teachable doesn’t require any coding, the website’s many features and customization options could be a bit overwhelming. Once properly oriented, everything is intuitive, but the sheer amount of options could scare some people away before they even begin.</p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Teachable is a nice gateway into the entrepreneur space for teachers. Educators who already have a network of potential clients will find this platform the most useful, while brand new entrepreneurs and luddites might consider the service too much of a challenge.</p>
