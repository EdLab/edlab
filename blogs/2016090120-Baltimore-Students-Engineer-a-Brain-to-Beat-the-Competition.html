<p>A group of middle school students tested their engineering and artistic skills in the annual <a href="http://www.kineticbaltimore.com">Kinetic Sculpture Race</a> in Baltimore this past spring. The race requires teams to build a custom, human-powered work of art and pilot it through a 15-mile course. For their submission, the students created a gigantic brain on wheels, complete with puppets representing common daydreams and insecurities found in middle school.</p>

<p>The students worked after school for eight months building their vehicle. Their goal was not to win, they said, but rather to express themselves creatively and overcome obstacles as a team. Their advisor, a science teacher at the school, said one of the main takeaways from competing in the race was the idea that kids can have fun learning engineering. "We need kids out there that can solve problems," he said. "This is a context for kids to learn the skills for solving challenging problems."</p>

<p>Although this video only <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/08/16/486091625/racing-the-middle-school-brain">covers one young team</a>, the race is open to people of all ages. What takeaway do you think competing in the race gives participants across the board? How do you think engineering and art compliment each other in this event and elsewhere?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:01 RuthS:</b> The students seem equally excited about the mechanical and artistic elements of this race. The requirements of the event demonstrate to the kids that people can be creative and technical at the same time; these are not either/or types of skills.</p>

<p><b>@02:15 Victoria57271:</b> It is great to see this project leave the classroom and engage with the community it is as hands on as activities get. With immediate propose for the students.</p>
