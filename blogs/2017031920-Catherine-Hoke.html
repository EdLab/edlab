<p>Driven by her hatred for injustice and love for the underdog, Catherine Hoke founded <a href="http://defyventures.org">Defy Ventures</a> in 2010 after being given her own second chance to lead. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3534/defy-ventures">Defy Ventures</a> is a nonprofit that "transforms the hustle" of people with criminal histories by providing entrepreneurship, employment, and character training as well as executive mentorship, startup funding, and business incubation. For her work, Catherine became an Ashoka Fellow (2013), and was recognized by Fast Company as one of the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3029526/most-creative-people-2014/catherine-hoke">100 Most Creative People in Business</a> (2014). She also received the MDC Partners Humanitarian Award and was named a <a href="http://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/10/transforming-the-incarcerated-into-entrepreneurs/">#MakeTechHuman Agent of Change</a> by WIRED and Nokia for being one of "17 Global Influencers Expanding Human Possibility Through Technology" (both in 2015). A three-time marathon runner, Catherine enjoys practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu and sewing in her spare time. She resides in New York City with her husband, Charles.</p>

<p><b>What inspired you to found Defy Ventures?</b><br>
My passion for justice, love for underdogs, and belief in human potential inspired me to start Defy. The vision for Defy is to build a nationally scalable program to end the cycle of incarceration in America. Defy Ventures is my second chance at giving second chances to those with criminal histories. And you can view <a href="http://library.fora.tv/2015/05/11/Second_Chances_MDC_Humanitarian_Award_Recipient
">this video</a> for more on that.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope Defy Ventures impacts participants and communities?</b><br>
I hope that Defy connects and transforms people, both for those with criminal histories we serve and for those we engage as volunteers and donors. I also hope Defy empowers people to build new legacies of success, leveraging entrepreneurship rather than perpetuating the cycle of violence and incarceration we see today. Finally, I hope Defy helps people become great parents, leaders, and role models in their communities.</p>
 
<p><b>What are the challenges your organization faces as it continues to grow?</b><br>
The greatest challenges are funding and talent. Fundraising is the biggest bottleneck for Defy, and finding the right people to add to our growing team is critical to ensure that we’re sustainable and retain our organizational culture as we expand. </p>

<p><b>What is the most valuable thing you’ve learned from your work with Defy Ventures?</b><br>
Choosing to love and choosing to forgive leads to life, while living in fear, regret, and shame is a downward spiral. We teach this at Defy to our Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs), but I think it’s an important lesson for all of us. </p>
