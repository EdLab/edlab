<a href="http://www.aviary.com/">Aviary</a> is primarily a free online photo editor that makes it easy to integrate photo editing tools into any web or mobile application. Aviary also offers a variety of other creation tools relating to design and audio in addition to photos.

<b>Pros:</b> Aviary's tools are all incredibly easy to use. The tools are simple and yet offer enough flexibility to offer real creative potential to the user. The photo editing tools are sharp and offer a level quality that almost any user should find more than acceptable. Much of these same features apply to their design and audio tools. I would even argue that their audio tools are nearly as good as Garageband or any other mainstream audio editor. Aviary has a very simple UI but offers a diverse suite of tools,thus allowing the user to maximize creative endeavor. Even though Aviary does not market itself primarily to kids, the technology is built to be kid and school friendly. All of their tools, even the ones that feel incomplete, are fun to use and hold a lot of promise. And the best part is that it is all free!

<b>Cons:</b> Their exist few examples or elaborate use-cases of applications on their website. It would be helpful if Aviary provided some concrete examples of how to implement their technologies in other applications and activities. Aviary has built some fantastic tools and products but there is little information as far as the uses of their products beyond direct application. It might be the case that they are hoping users will define how and where their tools will be used. That might be the appropriate course of action but they run the risk of abandoning users who enjoy using their products but hardly see an immediate reason to use the product on a frequent enough basis.

EdLab Relevance: There is great potential for applying Aviary's technologies in an educational setting. Aviary clearly has plans for entering the ed-space but how their tools will be utilized in the classroom is yet to be seen. 

Our Takeaway: The ability to merge technology and creativity in a seamless and meaningful way seems to be Aviary's primary strength.
