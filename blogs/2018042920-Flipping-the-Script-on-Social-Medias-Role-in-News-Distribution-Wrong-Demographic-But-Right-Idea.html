<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genies-clone-yourself/id606291833?mt=8">Genies</a>, with its aim of making Bitmoji obsolete, has users clone themselves by creating their own personal animated character, and then identify what kinds of news sources and topics they’d like to see. The app then presents users with 10-15 news stories daily that feature animated illustrations in which the user's genie and friends interact. Genies intends to make news more interesting and shareable by turning it into a social media app.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>There is no denying that this app is effective in making news entertaining. Although I wanted to hate it for being so self-indulgent and silly, I kept being pulled back in by cryptic updates that would flash across the screen of my phone. My coworkers and I enjoyed swapping stories and laughing over the playful and ridiculous animations our genies were thrown into; there’s no denying we had fun with it. For those who are convinced the news is boring, inaccessible, and difficult to relate to or understand, Genies definitely has the power to change some minds.</p>

<p>The news sources themselves are clearly marked, and a quick swipe allows you to read the story and directs you towards other recent, related articles on the source’s page. Additionally, the variety of sources is vast, giving the user easy access to many perspectives and publications through a single platform.</p>

<p>The animation itself is quite impressive. Genies clearly has high production value, which is one of the reasons I was drawn in so immediately. Each story is beautifully designed, and the ability to craft my genie into the perfect mini me certainly increased my investment in the app.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While it’s no secret that millennials consume most of their news via <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/millennials-news/">social media</a>, creating a social media site simply for news feels like it’s trying to fill a void that doesn’t exist. There is already abundant interest in news; the real issue at this point is the credibility of news sources. Genies has a platform with the ability to emphasize credibility, and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/genies/">CEO has stated</a> that the app taps more than 1 million sources and focuses on reputable sites. However, with the cartooning style and general pettiness of the app, it’s very hard to take seriously, and frankly isn’t likely to contribute to users’ media literacy.</p>

<p>As a millennial myself, though I admittedly enjoyed the app, I feel that Genies’ platform would be more effective if marketed towards a younger demographic. But with the fairly regular references to alcohol and general party culture, the content is clearly not made for 13-year-olds. However, with revision, Genies could open themselves up to a huge market of tweens and teens that could really use entertaining news exposure to involve them in current events.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While Genies feels like it has missed the mark regarding target audience, it is beautifully designed and is based on a valuable concept. Its long-term success will likely require a change in content and marketing.</p>
