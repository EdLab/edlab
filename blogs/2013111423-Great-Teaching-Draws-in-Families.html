            <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/11/06/11sheldon.h33.html">Good teachers</a> in the educational system recognize the importance of families and the impact families have on the success of a child's education. In order for more students to be successful academically it is necessary for educators to find different avenues to engage with families. This is important because studies have proven that parental involvement in a child education results to better outcomes. The process to involve families starts with teachers making effort to engage families or important adults in a child's community.  In a book called Organizing Schools for Improvement by Anthony Bryk and his colleagues; it shows that academic improvement requires much needed classroom attention. This is attention is that from the educators in the schools as well as combination with strong collaboration with the community and the families. In the Inner-city public school system there is lack of involvement from the community and families which is one of major reason behind low success rates in academics. 

Policy makers should focus more on involving parents and the community because they have a great amount of influence in a child's education. Instead, they focus more on standardize exams, curriculum or shutting down schools to improve student learning.  The impact parents and community will have on students is far greater than restructure of policies and curriculum that always result to the same outcome.
