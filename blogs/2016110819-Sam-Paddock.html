Sam Paddock is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.getsmarter.co.za/">GetSmarter</a>, a South African-based platform that offers certified online short courses from the world's leading universities. Paddock <a href="http://200ysa.mg.co.za/2013/sam-paddock/">was featured</a> as one of the 200 Young South Africans by Mail & Guardian. He was also featured on the front cover of Entrepreneurship Magazine in September 2015. He actively mentors individuals on his own time and through the University of Cape Town's Business Acumen for Artists programme and for the Allan Gray Orbis Foundation.

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your work now at GetSmarter?</b><br>
 <p>I studied for a Bachelor of Business Science degree at the University of Cape Town. In my final year, we were required to build an information system for a client. We chose to build a virtual campus and in so doing I fell in love with the idea of teaching and learning online.</p>

<p>I have been involved with online education, and other online businesses, ever since I finished university. An important contributing factor to my career at GetSmarter was the fact that it was born from a family business. I started working with my father, mother, and brother. In so doing, we instilled familial values into the way we worked and served our customers. This manifested itself in a relational approach to the way we served our students. Today we position ourselves with a high touch, people-mediated model of online education where we believe relationships lie at the center of effective learning.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at GetSmarter will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
 <p>I believe we are helping to legitimize online courses by showing the world what sort of model can produce really effective learning outcomes. We are also proving to our university collaborators that they can work in highly effective public/private partnerships to further their missions globally.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The change in pace and complexity of the workplace will result in a heightened need for lifelong learning. Online education will be seen as a legitimate mode of teaching and learning. Working professionals will look for just-in-time learning interventions from shorter learning programs. University brands will continue to have powerful signaling value, although the way these brands hold value will change. The credential will evolve into a more granular statement of verifiable competencies.</p>

<p><b>Apart from GetSmarter, what else are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
 <p>GetSmarter is my absolute focus. My wife is pregnant with twins so I'm about to assume a new role and have two long-term projects that I take very seriously!</p>
