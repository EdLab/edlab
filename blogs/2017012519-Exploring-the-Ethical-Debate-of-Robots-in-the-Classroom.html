<p>Research surrounding technology in the classroom tends to be focused on functionality, feedback, and achievement. However, researchers like Dr. Amanda Sharkey have begun taking on philosophical debates involving development. Looking to answer ethical questions regarding the implementation of social robots in the classroom, her research follows case studies of robot teachers around the world. Her studies serve as a warning for educators and developers regarding the real limits of robots as teachers. </p>
 
<p>Due to an English teacher shortage, one school in South Korea started testing a robot as a teacher. Though students were excited and ready to learn from the robot, certain limitations could not be ignored in the experiment. First, there were limits to the robot’s ability to manage classroom behavior. Several human assistants were needed to be sure that the students were quiet and attentive. Second, because of limited programming and learning capabilities, the robot was not able to respond adequately to requests from students that were not anticipated by the developers. Third, what Dr. Sharkey considered the most dangerous issue, was the possibility of students creating deceptive bonds with the robot. This means young students could believe that this robot was a conscious teacher or friend and confide in it personal information that could become problematic. </p>
 
<p>These types of <i>dangerous</i> bonds are depicted in films like "Her," where a man falls in love with an artificial intelligence robot. However, Dr. Sarkey’s research points to the social development complications that could be aggravated by having such robots as teachers, and she raises questions about protecting the most vulnerable in our society by introducing such technology with caution. Though overall her results support the use of robots as teacher assistants in some situations, she still approaches the concept with the caveat that more research is needed.</p>
