<p>Braille was created in 1849 and has been the primary literacy medium for the blind since that time, but with advancing technology, researchers are exploring new mediums to teach reading and writing to those who cannot see. This has led researchers in South Korea to explore how 3D printing could teach blind students how to write. </p>
 
<p>The study involved three kindergarten students from Seoul’s National School for the Blind who used 3D printed tools to learn to write the Hangul alphabet (South Korean alphabet). The students were given 24 3D printed templates of the Hangul alphabet. Each template had a debossed Hangul letter with the corresponding embossed braille version of the letter to help students decipher it. For three months students used the templates to help develop their writing skills.</p>
 
<p>In the end, students reported positive results from the ability to use the 3D printed tools while learning to write, commenting on how the thickness of the 3D printed templates (as opposed to flimsy paper) was useful. However, researchers noted that they did encounter design problems when students reported hesitancy to use the tools due to their sharp edges and had difficulty deciphering the braille script due to the large dot sizes.</p>  
 
<p>In the end, the students’ ability to write the Hangul alphabet with strength and clarity gives researchers hope that 3D printing and other technologies can change teaching and learning for those who are often left out of the joys of these innovations.</p>
