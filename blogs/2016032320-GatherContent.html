<p>We are awash with data. A <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm">much discussed 2013 study</a> found that 90% of the world’s data was created over the previous two years. Alphabet executive Eric Schmidt said that we now <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data//">create as much information every two days</a> as we did from the dawn of civilization to 2003. Graduate students, professors, administrators, and others in education have a lot of content to manage, and it only continues growing. How do you manage this surging mass of information? <a href="https://gathercontent.com/">GatherContent</a> is an online platform to help take control of your content production process. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> GatherContent allows users to plan and produce web content from a variety of locations in one spot. Its integrated dashboard allows users to manage content in a single place without searching. </p>

<p>The user interface for GatherContent is intuitive and lends itself towards transparency, which leads to productivity. You can map out your production schedule with an editorial calendar. Creating content is simplified through customizable templates so that it is easier for authors to include all necessary elements in a uniform style without any guesswork. The editing interface is consistent in look and performance to popular word processing programs—what you see is what you get, located where you want it. </p>

<p>Through its integrated workflow, GatherContent allows team members to write comments, set guidelines, and list assignments. The platform lets users know when content is due and who is responsible—nothing floats away in the internet ether. Also, if you need to export your work, you can send it directly to popular content management systems like WordPress or Drupal. GatherContent currently serves companies in advertising, consultancy, government, media, technology, and higher education. As such, this platform can help manage your production process regardless of content or industry. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>GatherContent can be pricey depending on your budget. It offers tiers starting at $66/month for a small team, $125/month for the most popular plan, and $216/month for major players. One-off, short-term, and small-scale student projects may choose a cheaper method to enhance workflows. Integrating this system may not be useful if you already have another method that has been fully adopted and is functional. </p>
 
<p>Even for larger teams, GatherContent may also be overkill. If your production team works within close proximity, you may be able to use free openware management systems like WordPress, Drupal, or Google Docs to meet your needs. Finally, you should take the temperature of your production team’s professional needs and content output. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>GatherContent is a great one-stop-shop for managing content production. By using this platform, you should more firmly handle your data and increase productivity. If you have a small scrappy start-up with some financial backing, the cheap Studio Plan may be the way to go. However, for regular students or small research teams, you may just want to continue using WordPress, Drupal, or Google Drive. </p>
