<p>A push for more flexible classrooms has led researchers to investigate how such adaptability affects student learning. One recent study conducted in England with over 3,700 students aged 5 to 11 years old in 153 classrooms across the country examined how flexible learning spaces affected student achievement. The results showed that there were many environmental factors that had a significant impact on academic performance, including light, temperature, and even the color of the classroom walls. But among all these factors, flexibility and the sense of class ownership it engenders among students accounted for 28% of academic progress, making it an important feature to consider in classroom design.</p>

<p>The researchers suggest that when a classroom is flexible, students feel a greater sense of ownership over the space and the learning that takes place within it. The furniture itself is not the important piece. Rather, it’s the pedagogy that accompanies flexible spaces that leads to increased student success. Teachers in flexible spaces can encourage participation in ways that give students responsibility over their own learning, which in turn leads to increased investment in their academic performance.</p>

<p>What does it mean for students to take ownership of their learning environment? How might teaching adapt to fit a flexible space? Answer these and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47873">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:33 Dallas Milanovich:</b> This sounds pretty crazy until you think about it—ownership gives a sense of security and commitment. Flexibility means it accommodates for different learning styles. These things together create larger motivation and efficiency in learning I think.</p>

<p><b>@01:19 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> I'm not sure what distinguishes a flexible classroom from a non-flexible one. Adjusting the classroom space can open new learning opportunities, for example by creating an open space to engage in presentations or performances. But when I was in school, we made this space by pushing the desks to the side and it seemed to work just fine. Does that mean we had a flexible classroom? </p>
