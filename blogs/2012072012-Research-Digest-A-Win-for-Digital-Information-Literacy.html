<a href="http://crl.acrl.org/content/73/4/366.full.pdf+html">Mery, Y., Newby, J., & Peng, K. (2012). Why one-shot information literacy sessions are not the future of instruction: A case for online credit courses. <i>College & Research Libraries, 73</i>(4), 366-377.</a> 

Long a staple of academic librarianship, the one-shot information literacy session has seen a radical change in scope with little evaluation of continuing effectiveness. This study examined test scores of students exposed to different kinds of information literacy training to determine if online instruction provided a suitable alternative to traditional in-person information literacy  instruction. The University of Arizona Libraries are facing common problems in academic libraries: increasing student enrollment and a shrinking library staff and budget. In response to these pressures, the library developed ORL, a one-credit information literacy course meant to replace the information literacy instruction traditionally provided by the library and required in many programs. 

There are clear monetary benefits for the library and institution in formalizing a service the library once offered for free and automating what was once a time-consuming process for staff but UA wanted to ensure that quality instruction was maintained during the transition. Students in several courses were separated into a control group, an ORL group that participated in the online course, and traditional group that received in person information literacy training. The groups were evaluated before and after on research strategy and selection, searching, evaluating, and documenting sources. The authors found no improvement from the control group, slight improvement in the group that received one session of traditional instruction, and significant improvement in the ORL group. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
These kinds of results have spooked librarians for years, but the bottom line is that online instruction is creating efficiencies for the way libraries are structured now. It's important to note that the superiority of ORL course could have been due to content gains, but was probably a combination of content and delivery. Engagement and active learning seem to be very important in information literacy and are often left out of one-shot lecture-style sessions. It's necessary to be careful with the shift but this kind of information literacy training, especially shared between libraries, could be a helpmeet for a future full of new responsibilities for librarians.
