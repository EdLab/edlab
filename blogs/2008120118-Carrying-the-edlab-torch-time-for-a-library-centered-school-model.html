          <p>
            Inspired by last week's "EdLab Program" brainstorming competition, I've been thinking further about the library metaphor...

Our group pitched an idea to create a short, intense, internship opportunity for "information science" students. I think we can go in a slightly different direction and appeal to a wider set of education-minded folks. Here's my thinking.

EdLab, as a library-of-the-future kind of enterprise, is situated at the center of some of our TC experiences. For some, this may be accidental, pragmatic, purposeful, or even planned (and highly orchestrated!?), but what if the rationale was deeper than any of these relationships suggest? What if it's about the best way to learn?

I would like to pursue a project to imagine/define/model "library-centered schools." Sounds kind of old, you say? In fact, a brief review of the literature shows very little theory or investigation in this area. Surprising!

For me, the idea of a library-centered school is an outgrowth of working in (and thinking about) the atelier environment. There are some distinctive features that often define our work in the lab, and I think there's room for thinking about student-centered learning experiences that draw on our work here. For example, I think we've been saying that production (including design-based processes?), publishing, and embedded research are all part of the future of libraries... so why not take this to the next level and try it out in schools of all kinds?

If you're intrigued, let me know and I'll include you in a workgroup for pushing this idea forward.
