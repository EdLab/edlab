<p><i>"We’re storytellers, humanitarians, wanderers, journalists, and technologists passionate about helping to craft positive change in the world through connecting people, ideas, and stories that take you inside the action so you become the story."</i> (<a href="http://ryot.huffingtonpost.com/about/">About RYOT</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Shaking Up the Media</b></p>
 
<p>As news outlets rebrand themselves to reach new digital audiences, many are adding 360 degree videos, augmented reality, virtual reality (VR), flip boards, and new apps as mediums to increase the impact of digital storytelling. However, <a href="http://ryot.huffingtonpost.com">Huffington Post’s RYOT</a> takes all of this a step further by transforming the medium and news consumption experience.</p>
 
<p><b>Democratizing Experiences</b></p>
 
<p>RYOT has created an interesting model for immersive news media. The company uses VR videos and graphics to take the viewers into the story, but they also go a step further by allowing audiences to become part of the story. This is done by ending each piece with actionable opportunities and letting viewers and readers know that the story doesn’t end when the video does. For example, after using VR to view the effects of a hurricane in Haiti, audiences then scroll down and see the <i>donate</i> button that prompts them to no longer be passive consumers, but to respond to the information, in turn making them a part of the story.</p>
  
<p>However, the RYOT model is open to criticism because some of the action prompts blur the line between journalism and activism. Where does the news end and advocacy begin? For example, in their report on the <a href="http://ryot.huffingtonpost.com/protect-the-sacred/">North Dakota Pipeline Protest</a>, they offer the audience the opportunity to continue engagement with the hashtag #StandWithStandingRock, clearly taking a side in a story with heated opposing views. However, despite this criticism, there is much to be learned from this model of immersive journalism that could change the way youth, and even adults, learn from the news.</p>
 
<p><b>Re-engaging Youth</b></p>
 
<p>I often hear millennial audiences voice their discontent over the onslaught of negative news stories that leave them feeling helpless. RYOT’s information model offers a space for response that goes beyond <i>likes</i> and <i>shares</i>. Its use of VR and 360 degree videos allows users to experience the stories in a deeper way. For a society that hears of death, destruction, and changes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it's time that the method of telling stories become more authentic and inclusive.</p>
