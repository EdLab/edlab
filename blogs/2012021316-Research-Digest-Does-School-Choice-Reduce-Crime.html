          <p>
            I've been seeing a lot of evaluations of educational programs and institutions that focus on a wider range of output measures than just test-score performances.  For instance, Education Next has a <a href="http://educationnext.org/does-school-choice-reduce-crime/">research article about the relationship between school choice and crime.</a>
<!--break-->
Description: Using data from Charlotte-Mecklenburg (a school district in North Carolina) matched with arrest records from the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Department, David Deming compared the outcomes of students who won lotteries under a school choice program to attend over-subscribed schools to those students who lost the lottery. The idea is to isolate the effect of going to the school you've chosen.  His (somewhat surprising) findings are that winning the school lottery has no effect on academic achievement, but has a strong effect on criminality, at least for high-risk students. “High-risk lottery winners” the author writes “experienced roughly a 50 percent reduction in the measures of criminal activity that weight crimes by their severity.”

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
40 years ago, economists Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, in their attack on the education system “Schooling in Capitalist America," argued that “schools prepare people for adult work roles, by socializing people to function well (and without complaint) in the hierarchical structure of the modern corporation or public office.” But if educational reforms are seen as effective not in increasing academic achievement but rather in influencing the social factors that Bowles and Gintis would summarize as “socializing people” (under which heading criminal activity would certainly be included), then our current school system is both <b>a.</b> possibly too focused on academic achievement, and <b>b</b>. in danger of being replaced by one more similar to their (slightly dystopic) vision. This may, ironically, turn out to be a good thing.
