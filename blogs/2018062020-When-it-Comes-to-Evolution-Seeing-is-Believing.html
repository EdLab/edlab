<p>Evolution is a difficult concept to teach, not only because it comes into conflict with many peoples’ religious beliefs, but because the process cannot be witnessed in a single human lifespan. Therefore, science teachers covering evolution in their curriculum often find it difficult to convince or foster a true understanding of the concept in their students. In search of an innovative solution to this issue, scientists created a research-based digital platform to help students see evolution in action, and researchers conducted a study to see the effectiveness of this unconventional platform.</p>
 
<p>In the digital platform, called <a href="https://avida-ed.msu.edu/">Avida-ED</a>, students are able to observe populations of digital organisms evolve based on different environmental factors. Avida is unique in that it does not represent a simulation of evolution, but instead allows instructors to incorporate authentic research experiences into the classroom, since outcomes are not predetermined.</p> 

<p>In order to test Avida-ED’s effectiveness, researchers worked with eleven instructors teaching ten courses at eight institutions across the United States. These courses represented a mix of upper- and lower-division biology courses in both small, private colleges and large research universities. Students were given a pre-Avida assessment, testing their knowledge of the origins of genetic variation and the basics of natural selection as well as their acceptance of these concepts as fact. After using the digital platform throughout the semester, students were then given a post-Avida test assessing the same topics.</p>
 
<p>In the upper-division courses studied, rates of knowledge and acceptance of evolution were already high in the pre-tests, so there were no significant changes for this population. However, both acceptance and content knowledge scores increased significantly in students using Avida in the lower-division courses sampled. While this study didn’t set out to prove that Avida was more effective than traditional methods of teaching evolution, it does show that Avida improved student acceptance of established scientific ideas due to increased learning taking place.</p>

<p>Engaging students in authentic, relevant applications of concepts learned in class is critical in all subjects. Avida-ED demonstrates this point particularly well, since it is through practice that students come to understand and accept fact as truth.</p>
