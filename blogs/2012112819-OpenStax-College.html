<i>It’s innovation in education. And the time is right. OpenStax College offers students free textbooks that meet scope and sequence requirements for most courses. These are peer-reviewed texts written by professional content developers. Adopt a book today for a turnkey classroom solution or modify it to suit your teaching approach. Free online and low-cost in print, OpenStax College books are built for today’s student budgets. (</i><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/">OpenStax College</a>)
<p>
<b>Open Sesame</b>
<p>
<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/">OpenStax College</a>, is a non-profit organization started and housed at Rice University, with the mission of creating low-cost, open-access textbooks.  Well on their way to their goal of creating 20 entry-level textbooks for over 1 million learners, OpenStax, currently offers introductory-level <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-physics">Physics</a> and <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/introduction-to-sociology">Sociology</a> texts as downloadable PDFs, ePub’s and low-cost printed copies.   Peer reviewed, free to download and cheap to print, Open-Stax texts feature multimedia, open editing, links to labs, and simulations, all customizable by both learners and faculty.  Even errors are crowdsourced, in wiki-style open "errata" pages for each text with a running list of reported mistakes for peer experts to review and update.  Accessible from almost anywhere on a smartphone or tablet, these open texts remove the barrier of cost AND inaccessibility.  Easily adaptable through Rice’s dedicated <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions Platform</a>, OpenStax is at the forefront of the open educational resources movement, as faculty are able to update, modify or improve existing sections of texts with ease.  Connexions also allows students to access OpenStax content as short, modifiable modules, which can be customized to suit their unique learning needs.  
<p>
<b>The Future is NOW</b>
<p> 
Whether it is through the support of new educational technology ventures, as is the case with <a href="http://www.macmillannewventures.com/">Macmillan New Ventures</a>, or investing in e-Publishing, as is the case for McGraw-Hill, big publishing companies are taking notice and trying to prevent being passed by nimbler, open platforms like Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/ibooks-author/">iBook Author</a>, <a href="http://www.ck12.org/">CK-12 Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">Flat World Knowledge</a>.   As is typical in other fields ranging from video to music, fringe movements and initiatives like Napster and illegal file sharing, can push more established content creators into new territories. As with the iTunes store, which grew out of consumer demand for digital music, perhaps groups like OpenStax and other players in the open textbook movement will help to make traditional academic publishing obsolete.  In many ways they already have, as Apple’s iBookstore features free and low-cost textbooks ranging from "Chemistry from the Ground Up" to "Life on Earth" by E.O. Wilson.  However, what sets the open textbook movement apart from the music industry’s earlier seismic shift, is cost.  Open textbooks are often free or nearly so, with the brunt of costs absorbed by foundation sponsors.  OpenStax, for example, is a nonprofit, funded by foundation grants from groups ranging from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to <a href="http://www.20mm.org/">TwentyMillion Minds</a>.  What is powerful about OpenStax, beyond the emphasis on low-cost and high accessibility, is that the project focuses on quality, peer-reviewed content and not simply large volumes of offerings.  Slow and steady, just might win the open content race and force the competition (in this case the traditional textbook) into early retirement.
