          <p>
            This year's frigid winter in New York is arguably the main reason why schools are not willing to allow kids to play outdoors.<a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/nyregion/a-casualty-of-a-frigid-new-york-winter-outdoor-school-recess.html?referrer=&_r=0"> Recess </a> has been viewed by many experts as a way of developing children both mentally and physically. Most schools are encouraged by the Department of Education to provide elementary school kids with at least 20 minutes of outdoor play activity. These conditions are very difficult to meet because most principals have indicated that the risk involved in kids playing outside especially on slippery floors causes great harm to the child and school as well. Several states have laid down rules on average temperatures that determine whether elementary school kids can play outdoors. Several organizations have advocated for the increase in the time kids spend on physical activities. To these organization, the kids can be indoors and still undergo outdoor activities.
<p>
The effects of recess on kids has proven to be beneficial. Physical and mental strength shape the development of a child. In order for kids to improve in their academic work, it is necessary for them to engage in some physical activities. As a student athlete, I believe both indoor and outdoor recess can help the potential athletes among these kids. The weather should not be a hinderance for recess but rather a reason to create more indoor spaces for kids to engage in physical activities.
