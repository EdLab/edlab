            Time management is becoming vital asset to have for everyone as our society continues to change and modernize at an alarming rate. People are increasingly becoming responsible from an overwhelming amount of tasks hence making possession of this skill an important asset.
 
It is a skill often associated with busy office workers but is applicable to high school students as well and when practiced efficiently, can be essential to the success of these students during their four years. Students have long over looked this skill but there is now an increase in the amount of students turning to this method on a regular basis as a way to manage their hectic schedules. This can be attributed to the huge emphasis that parents, teachers, coaches and society as a whole place on education and the pressure on students to enter college and beyond. As a result, students are now enrolling in more rigorous classes and par taking in a load of extracurricular activities while trying to balance a social life.  With a stress filled schedule, it becomes very easy to be disorganized or have constantly procrastinate. Students who often tend to go to sleep late as a result of procrastination or disorganization are deprived of rest during the day while school is in session, which can lead to undesired grades. As a rising junior (the most important year of a high school student), I was advised to manage to my time and so far it's working out pretty well. Here are some quick personal tips for current students on how to manage their time effectively:
 
1. Create a calendar/schedule of activities you'll be participating this school year for it helps having a visual view of duties.
 
2. Create a home time schedule for things such as homework time, internet time, study time etc.
 
3. Don't get involved or enroll in too many activities as it will lead you to prioritize and often times you'll be hesitant to let go of an activity.
 
4. Decrease your time spent on social networking sites as they can prove to be a huge source of distraction from school work.
 
5. Eliminate procrastination for it's an unhealthy habit sure to disrupt your plans.
