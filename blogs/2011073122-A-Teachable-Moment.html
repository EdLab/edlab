          <p>
            In this <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/07/27/bennett.winehouse.drugs/index.html?hpt=hp_c2">op-ed for CNN</a>, former US Secretary of Education William Bennett shared his views on why there is not a large scale public discourse on drug use in light of Amy Winehouse's death a few weekends ago.

Bennett essentially argues two major points: whether by awarding five Grammys (including song and record of the year) to Winehouse in 2008 for her song Rehab, in which she sings about her refusal to seek help for drug addiction, the music industry missed a golden opportunity to inform the public that refusal to seek help for an addiction is not something that should be celebrated. Second, Bennett yearned for a return to the 1980s where prominent, among others, was how the cocaine related death of highly touted basketball player Len Bias in 1986 (he was drafted 2nd overall in the NBA draft two days earlier by the Boston Celtics) put the spotlight firmly on drug use, especially among young people. 

Though it might've have been the right thing to do, I think it is not the job of the recording industry to regulate what artists write or sing about. It goes against the whole notion of been an artist. It prohibits creativity and without creativity, how can one be considered an artist? What artists choose to sing about is totally at their own discretion so by refusing to reward them solely on the argument they are sending the wrong message goes against everything we preach to our youth: work hard, be creative and you will get your just rewards.

His second argument about Len Bias was more compelling and spoke more to society's views towards drug use and addiction. I was first introduced to Len Bias when I read about his death and the subsequent political and social implications of his death in my 7th grade health class. It seemed the 1980s was when drug use captured the public's imagination and the death of Bias, a young, clean cut and perfectly healthy athlete, offered the perfect opportunity to effectively tackle drug use. The end result was a very public outcry such as first lady Nancy Reagan's “Just Say No” campaign. Couple that with tough sentencing laws for drugs possession and the public discourse on drugs eventually faded. 

Bennett's argument about how we can recapture the spirit of the 1980s as we deal with yet another young celebrity falling victim to drug use (he cites Heath Ledger, Brittany Murphy, and the aforementioned Winehouse as examples), seems timely but somehow I feel society as a whole have a different attitude towards drug use. Winehouse's death serves as yet another drug related celebrity death. In the current 24/7 news cycle where the mishaps of celebrities garner more attention than “real news”, the public has basically grown accustomed to such news and TV shows such as Intervention and Celebrity Rehab, despite their good intentions, only serve to make a spectacle of drug addiction.
