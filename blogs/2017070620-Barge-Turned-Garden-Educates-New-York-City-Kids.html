<p>No space in New York City for a garden? No problem. A floating food forest is making its way around the five boroughs, educating city kids about sustainable living along the way. Swale was founded in 2016 by Mary Mattingly as a mobile educational space to promote healthy living and social change. Once a barge used for hauling construction materials, the ship now houses over 300 types of plants on board, all of which are edible.</p>

<p>As it docks around the city, Swale offers educational programs and workshops for children. These include lessons on gardening, edible and medicinal plants, science-based workshops on water filtration, and land stewardship. It also allows visitors to harvest plants, fruits, and vegetables for free. Swale’s goal is to give people a space to learn about plants and water systems where they might not be able to have a similar hands-on experience in their own neighborhoods.</p>

<p>What kinds of learning experience would Swale offer that a typical gardening space might not? Do you think it will help children become more interested in sustainable living? Join the ongoing discussion  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/38336/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:50 Cinthia.Fabian:</b> The mobility of the space facilitates the sharing of the garden, of both its natural and educational wealth – and, as emphasized in the video, that's right in line with Swale's mission to help New Yorkers become more mindful of how food is a communal resource and therefore should be tended to cooperatively.</p>

<p><b>@00:50 RuthS:</b> The context of being on a barge turned into a garden brings creativity, innovation, and playfulness into the experience that you might not get at just any old plot of land. Even if these characteristics are subconscious, they will still affect a child's experience while on the boat and make it more magical.</p>
