<p>A few years ago, Malawi’s educational system accomplished a great feat when it opened its schools to all children in the country. There was only one problem: many schools didn’t yet have adequate resources to teach so many students. A typical classroom in Malawi has around 80 children, making it nearly impossible for the teacher to track the progress of each student.</p>

<p>To fix this, schools across Malawi have partnered with a U.K. charity to bring tablets and solar-powered projectors to their classrooms. Now students receive two sessions each week on their tablets, where they are taught lessons in math, English, and the local language. Not only do the students seem to learn more efficiently during their individual tablet sessions, their teachers are able to access students’ progress quickly and easily and tweak each child’s lessons accordingly.</p>

<p>This Vialogue demonstrates how technology can revolutionize schools that have few resources and make education more interactive, individualized, and accessible to students and teachers alike. What kinds of technology should be available in all classrooms around the world? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/29820/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:32 jennyshen:</b> A school's infrastructure has as much of an effect as materials/technology on students' opportunities to learn. Having a roof over their heads would allow them to hold sessions even if it were raining. I wonder whether there are efforts to bring infrastructure improvements to this school?</p>

<p><b>@01:43 Nantwi:</b> This concept seems promising as it resolves the language issue and keep students' attention, among others. However, is two hours really enough time to adequately measure student progress? It would be great to see the non profit responsible for the technology partner with the Malawian government to provide further opportunities for the students.</p>
