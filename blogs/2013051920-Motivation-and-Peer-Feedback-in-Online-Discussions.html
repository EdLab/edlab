<b>Title:</b> What do the Numbers Say? The Influence of Motivation and Peer Feedback on Students’ Behaviour in Online Discussions. <p>
<b>Authors: </b>Kui Xie <p>
<b>Study Design: </b>
The rise of online education has brought new challenges in analyzing and evaluating student behavior.  Many researchers have studied how students’ posting behavior influences their education and learning outcomes.  In this paper, Kui Xie examined a data set provided by a group of college students using the iDiscuss online discussion system.  This database logged a variety of student posting and non-posting behaviors, including login times and rates, what posts were read, and how students rated each others’ posts. This data was examined along with questionnaire responses on student confidence and motivation. <p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Unsurprisingly, the more non-posting activities a student engaged in, the more posting and classroom discussion he or she was likely to participate in.  That is to say, reading and evaluating other students writing is associated with producing writing of one’s own.  Motivation, confidence, and self-determination were also found to be traits associated with posting activity. Peer feedback was found to strongly encourage learning activities.  The more replies and evaluations a student received from his or her peers, the more likely he or she was to sustain or increase engagement, as born out either in posting or non-posting activities. In general, a dense web of reading, evaluating, and self-motivation was associated with posting behavior. <p>
<b>Moving Forward: </b> 
This paper draws our attention to the source of online learning interactions. It indicates areas we might focus on to improve the quantity and quality of discussions in online classes.  In particular, by implicitly and explicitly encouraging students to read and provide feedback on each other’s work, we can create classes with higher levels of confidence, motivation, and engagement, ultimately resulting in more active and in-depth discussions. Our understanding of online communities is still in its infancy, but there is no reason to think that in them we can’t recreate, or even improve upon, the dense social networks and emotional encouragement provided by traditional learning communities.  <p>
