<p>Exercise and video games don’t have to be different things. In fact, there’s a whole field of <i>exergames</i>: video games designed specifically to get people up and moving. One such game is Dance Dance Revolution, which 12-year old me can attest to as legitimate exercise. But as fun as exergames can be, do they actually improve physical fitness?</p>
 
<p>A recently conducted study examined the impact exergames have on the fitness level of young adults. The study included 117 participants, half of whom completed three rounds of exergames weekly for 12 consecutive weeks. The other half did not play any exergames during this time. Before and after the 12-week trial, the researchers assessed participants’ levels of physical fitness, measuring statistics such as resting heart rate, blood pressure, and flexibility. Participants played the exergame <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Shape-Fitness-Evolved-Xbox-360/dp/B002I0H9WM">Your Shape: Fitness Evolved</a>, a video game that has sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide, on the Xbox 360.</p>
 
<p>In the post-trial tests, the researchers found significant fitness differences between those who completed the exergames and those who didn’t. In particular, participants who played Your Shape: Fitness Evolved had lower diastolic blood pressure and body fat percentage, and improved performance in sit-up and step tests. These results were seen regardless of the participants’ initial fitness level.</p>
 
<p>Where previous research has shown that exergames can reduce social anxiety and improve energy expenditure, this study adds to the conversation by finding that exergames can also improve physical fitness levels when played consistently over time. This is promising research, but should be tested on a greater range of ages for a more comprehensive look at the benefits of exergames.</p>
