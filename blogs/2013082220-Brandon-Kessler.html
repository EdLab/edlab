Brandon Kessler is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://challengepost.com/">ChallengePost</a>, a New York City-based internet company that allows organizations to create truly unique and uniquely challenging competitions for software developers.  Participating groups have run the gamut from the <a href="http://challenge.gov/ ">White House</a> to <a href="http://hacklolla.com/">Lollapalooza</a>.  Kessler and his team believe that these "challenges" are a means of fostering innovation due to the fact that they provide, "exposure and rewards to software developers, are capital efficient, and they capture the public’s imagination."  Kessler should know about fostering creativity and capturing the attention of unique populations. Prior to founding ChallengePost, Kessler started an independent record label Messenger Records.  Fittingly, this award-winning label was an early adopter of web-based promotions and followed on the heels of the development of Kessler’s college radio promotion and street marketing company.  Kessler holds both undergraduate and MBA degrees from Columbia University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I went to Columbia for undergrad and started several companies in my dorm room in the music industry, the most notable being the record label Messenger Records which I ran full-time for 12 years. Undergrad for me was fun and interesting, though mostly an excuse to be in New York so I could work in the music industry and experience NY culture. 
<p>
But after Messenger Records, I wanted to start an internet company and needed to step back from having a small business to get some input. I went to Columbia Business school on the weekends as part of their Executive MBA program. The MBA was super helpful to me, and not just because of the great professors and the fact that I could put over 10 years of work experience to the test, but because I learned a ton from other students and made a lot of great connections which helped me start ChallengePost. My first employee who programmed our site was a classmate; my first investors came through some contacts I made in business school; and my initial plan was informed in several ways by what I had learned.
<p>
Did my MBA or undergraduate education teach me to be an entrepreneur? No. I think that just comes from having no choice in life but to start and run companies, or else I'd be a miserable wreck all day. But the MBA especially was beneficial after having a bunch of work experience where I could really learn from and challenge the professors and students.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> Running the record label, mostly as a one-person operation, required me to do most things myself. Publicity, radio promotion, legal work, production, manufacturing, working with artists and their psychology, getting artists out of jail for crazy stuff, distribution, setting up tours, Internet and grassroots promotion, you name it. Having that background enabled me to switch industries, from the music business to having an internet startup without really fearing much. I mean, when you've been working all day and all night for a decade with your bank account often hovering at the zero mark, how hard can an internet company be???

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Our company ChallengePost is a web platform that powers software competitions. Organizations release software challenges in order to inspire software makers to build apps that solve a problem, or that use a specific tool in a unique way. Developers participate not just to earn money, but to gain recognition for themselves and their software, to have an impact, and to learn new skills. We're all seeing in our society that the concept of 'learning' isn't just about school. Rather, people can build things themselves more than ever, and there's a dramatic shift toward people teaching others and themselves, as opposed to just learning at school. At ChallengePost, we see software developers learning daily about new tools and ways to make software, and we see organizations learning about amazing applications that can be built by outsiders. 
<p>
Perhaps there's a thread between ChallengePost and my past company Messenger Records, in that education isn't the end goal -- amazing, creative solutions are -- but along with creating and building comes a lot of learning.

<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> College is great, but it's a rip off, and traditional education is being disrupted by the Internet like every industry. That's a good thing. But I'm also equally excited by people teaching themselves new skills and learning they never had access to previously.  Just one small example is my wife, who is getting into this concept of 'zero waste' in which our family reduces our impact on the environment. We'll likely never be as extreme as others, but she recently made our own dish detergent, laundry detergent, and hand soap which took 10 minutes each, cost a fraction of what it costs in stores, and is significantly better on the environment. She learned how by reading some blogs like <a href="http://zerowastehome.blogspot.com/">this one</a>, and it's had a profound effect on our lives. 

<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> ChallengePost now powers in-person hackathons on our platform. Hackathons are events where software programmers, designers, and topic experts get together in-person and create software around a theme over a weekend. They're a great way for all participants to learn about technology and problems that need solving, and we power them for free. That's the type of learning I'm passionate about.
