          <p>
            Several studies during the 2000s showed that the <a href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/11/schools-picking-up-autism-tab/">number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder</a> grown to 78%. In the report, published several years ago, also found that 1 in 88 children have autism. The amount of children with autism has placed a burden on schools. This situation is made worse by a decrease in federal government spending for schools. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health believe that the rise in autism diagnoses since has come with an expensive cost; a burden shared by the public system. The biggest challenge is how to support the needs of those who have been or are impacted by autism. 

It is not right for a child with autism spectrum disorder to have to face further suffering due to the government's inability to provide the necessary funds and service. Although the cost is rising, children with autism should be allowed to have a free and appropriate education. The good news is that laws have been passed in 34 states requiring insurance companies to aid in the payment of some autism treatments. I support this as well because it shows that insurance has become a vital aid in the situation. It has helped families in a way that they do not have to feel the harsh effects of paying out of their pockets.
