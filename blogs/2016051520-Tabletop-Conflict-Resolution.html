<p>Student gets in trouble in class. Student gets sent to the principal’s office. Principal calls home. For most people, this progression is all too familiar. But a pair of researchers from Cyprus is looking at new ideas to change this behavior management routine. In this research study, they use tabletop technology, which enables users to touch and interact with a screen on the table, to resolve conflicts between students.</p>
 
<p>The study focused on twenty students from the same elementary school. From these students, five groups were formed based on ongoing conflicts that had existed among them throughout the course of the year. The students in each group were instructed to participate in games on the tabletop that required teamwork and collaboration. Most of the games also employed curricula in English and math; for example, the students played iMath, which is a program that provides calculation practice through games like Match Card.</p>
 
<p>The researchers collected data through pre-, post-, and delayed interviews, as well as through observations based on videos of the students’ interactions while using the tabletop. Results showed that the multi-touch function of the tabletop allowed all participants to engage equally, even though some of the students had more dominant personalities. Students were also found to increase their collaboration over time, despite starting off with certain elements of conflict and friction between each other.</p>
 
<p>This study is one example of how new technology can be used in schools beyond the standard laptop carts in science classes or math apps on iPads. The tabletop in this study helped promote teamwork for students who were at odds with one another by creating a playful environment for them to take on conflict resolution.</p>
