            <i>Preface</i>

It has been suggested that "schooling will more likely contribute to the development of national unity than to the continuation of political cleavage" (Dreeben 2002).  However, remarkably segregated schools and municipalities have stymied this dream.  And although rates of education are now higher than ever, so are levels of segregation and political inequality (see "American Apartheid" and "Resegregation in American Schools" amongst the litany of similar works).  

If schools are to facilitate more than intellectual development; if inequalities in human experience expand beyond the discrepancies in books read, then our projects must follow accordingly.  As do schools, our projects must begin to recognize and appreciate the socioemotional needs of students.  They must seek to foster growth beyond the cerebral and to engage those students who are not classically defined as "self-directed" learners.  We must aim to engage new audiences previously overlooked in an effort to join the College's campaign for equity.  

For these reasons - that development engulfs substantially more than that of the intellectual; and that we should and do hold a commitment to equity - our project seeks to address the socioemotional needs and interests of students, while in a simultaneous pursuit to highlight diversity and social inequity.  


<i>Overview</i>

Our project - designed to integrate technology, the arts, and social awareness in a practical manner - proposes an art & technology show to highlight the lives of disparate students.  The project would give voice to groups of K-12 students to self-document their lives; and create a unique locus for others to encounter these individuals.  Central to our proposal is that the lives documented are diverse yet authentic.

<i>Logistics</i>

The initial plan would be small, and easily doable.  In order to create a small initial piece, we would identify 5-10 students whose backgrounds, race, SES, and day to day lives were widely diverse.  Each student would be given a disposable cell phone with camera.  The students would be texted on their phones multiple times each day for a week (e.g. every day at 10am, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm).  The text message would inform the student to immediately capture a few images with the camera phone which document their current activities.  They would also be asked to jot down paragraph or more about what they were doing and feeling.  At the end of the week, the pictures and text will be combined to create an artistic representation of each student's day to day life.  This could be done purely by the student or with the help of an artist.  By displaying all the portraits in unison, the viewer is exposed to the realities of diverse lives in a socially and emotionally relevant way. The locus for presentation could be an art gallery or website.

<i>Future Growth</i>

This project could be expanded to a site that allows anyone to do this.  As an example, imagine 1036.com - a site which documents the activities of students at 10am,3pm,and 6pm over confined periods of times.  The site could focus on students, and ask that they reflect upon their lives and schooling at these time periods; asking "How do these cross-sections of your day represent/effect your schooling experience?"  This approach would vary from other existing mediums, like blogs, in crucial ways.  

First, the element of photography introduces a form of documentation that is compelling to complete and view. To further this, the website could use ad revenue and/or grants to mail camera phones to students.  Students could then message their photos and text to a central system which would integrate them with the site.

Second, the open-ended structure of documentation is augmented with the structure of time (defined cross sections) and purpose.  This allows the site a flexible and compelling human touch, while identifying a unique niche market.

A variety of future growths could be planned, and this highlights a strength of this idea.  As I've outlined in previous postings, successful projects are not planned the first time, they grow and become something compelling.  Flickr was a game site for girls, Craigslist a place to keep track of local events, ad infinitum.  Starting small and growing with a project that is flexible and a group that is adaptive may yield better results than supposing the answer initially.  Thus we plan small and prepare carefully.
