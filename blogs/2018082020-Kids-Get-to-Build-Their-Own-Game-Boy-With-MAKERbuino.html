<p>The <a href="https://www.makerbuino.com/">MAKERbuino</a> is a DIY handheld video gaming console. The kit comes with all the electronic components, such as wires, buttons, screws, and a printed circuit board (PCB) which must be meticulously soldered together. The end result of the build is a kind of open source Game Boy. The kit costs around $60 and is targeted for ages 11 and up.</p>  

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The first thing that I noticed when I opened my MAKERbuino was how beautiful the parts and components were. The bright red PCB in particular stands out as a work of art, displayed through a clear plastic shield when the kit is completed. The old school 8-bit design will surely provide a sense of nostalgia for those interested in retro gaming.</p>

<p>Instead of confusing directions folded into the box, MAKERbuino’s instructions are succinctly  <a href="https://www.makerbuino.com/build/">posted online</a>. The build is broken down into six chapters, making a daunting task feel more manageable. The entire project is supposed to last around five hours, though this will depend on the skill and experience of the builder. Since I didn’t have any soldering experience, it took me longer than expected. I had to re-do some welds, but the MAKERbuino team and site provided helpful support to get me back on the right track.</p>

<p>After the build is complete, the finished product is a portable gaming system. The MAKERbuino team and community offer free, downloadable, <a href="https://www.makerbuino.com/build-6-going-further/">open source games</a> from the company’s website. All of the offerings are simple, retro, and akin to old-school Mario or Tetris games.</p>  

  <p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Extra care will be needed when putting this system together, and parents should supervise their kids while they work on this project. People might not realize how many components are used in a small handheld <a href="https://www.makerbuino.com/build-1-basics-of-electronics/">video gaming device</a> like this. It is very easy to lose, misplace, or drop these tiny items, which might frustrate younger builders. Additionally, the soldering can be tricky, and it will take considerable practice to get right. If the welds are not done correctly, the system will not work.</p> 

<p>The graphics on the MAKERbuino harken back to video gaming consoles from the 80s and 90s. While I enjoy these retro video games, younger audiences might not appreciate this older style, especially if they are used to playing the newest generation of Playstation, Nintendo, or Xbox releases. There could be some disappointment after hours of soldering and fitting together the device.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Constructing my own handheld device was very satisfying. During the building process, I frequently lost track of time because I was so enthralled with the experience. MAKERbuino really will get kids thinking about how electronics work while instilling a maker ethos. I loved taking apart electronics as a kid, and I wish I had something constructive like the MAKERbuino back then.</p>
