A strong driver of the national conversation around our educational system (or lack thereof) is how the U.S. ranks on international tests of student ability.  Our middling performance exacerbates 21st century economic and political insecurity, reinforcing a growing narrative of decline built on our sluggish recovery and China-envy.  

The tireless Eric Hanushek, along with co-authors Paul Peterson and Ludger Woesmann, has <a href="http://educationnext.org/is-the-us-catching-up/">a report out</a> from Harvard's Kennedy School that brings us up to speed on how we've been doing, and where we're going, in the crowded field of international education.
<!--break-->
Summary:

That U.S. students don't score as well on international tests as a variety of other countries has long been well-known, but often the discussion ends there.  What Hanushek and his co-authors do is take a look (using data from 1995-2009) at changes in test score performance, in an attempt to figure out whether the United States' position has been improving or declining.  This lets us examine how effective our policies have been over this period at increasing student performance, as well as comparing that effectiveness to policies enacted by comparison countries. 

As the authors point out, over the period they examine “American governments at every level have taken education-related actions that would seem to be highly promising. Federal, state, and local governments spent 35 percent more per pupil–in real-dollar terms–in 2009 than they had in 1990. States began holding schools accountable for student performance in the 1990s, and the federal government developed its own nationwide school accountability program in 2002.”

International comparative data demonstrate that U.S. educational gains are firmly in the middle of the pack.  Over the fourteen years of their analysis, student achievement is estimated to have increased by 22 percent of a standard deviation, which, they point out, is the equivalent of one additional year of schooling. This is nowhere near Germany or Hong Kong's gains, but at least we can console ourselves that, unlike Sweden or France

The way they've transformed their data also allows them to compare inter-state gains with the US.  America, being a world unto itself, has about as much variation between state test scores as there is between country scores.  The strongest gains have been seen in the South, where, the authors argue, the school reform movement has had the most influence.  On the other hand, there's a fairly strong relationship between initial weakness and subsequent growth, so, as they point out, there may be an element of “catch-up” at play.  

However, it's only near the end of their report that they authors admit none of these gains are evident in the scores of 17 year old graduating seniors, and are already fading in the scores of 8th-graders. 

Edlab Relevance:

Comparisons like these offer two kinds of opportunities.  The first is to go look at what the fast-improvers are doing, to try to copy their techniques.  The second is to go look at what the slow-improvers are doing, so as to know what not to do.  On the other hand, the gains are so minor, and so tenuous, that perhaps the entire range of policy solutions we currently put into play are not worth studying at all, and instead we should either focus our attention on some entirely approach, or accept our status as not the brightest of countries.
