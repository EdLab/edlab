            With more and more schools adopting iPads and mobile phones to increase students' forms of learning, home-schooled children are also catching up on the trend thanks to Knowledge Quest, Inc., a leading provider of online resources for home —schooled children. The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/01/20/prweb4987364.DTL">company recently launched a new website</a> aimed at helping home-schooled children identify the latest and helpful educational apps for their mobile phones. There is little secret that students, regardless of where they attend school, are enamored with mobile phones but recent surveys conducted by Knowledge Quest showed most students often don't know how to identify and effectively use educational mobile apps.

The new website will allow home-schooled children, their parents, and teachers to click on quick links, where the top and most recent apps will be posted. According to the company's president, the results has so far been positive, “kids who download our featured apps are reporting improvements in their school achievements, while companies who have listed their apps on the site are seeing sales increases of 300% or higher.” All the apps are downloadable through the site, most are free and none cost more than $5. Users can browse by subject, company, or price and developers and publishers of iPhone and iPad apps are encouraged to submit their apps to the new site to enrich its database and leave users with various options to choose from.
