<p><i>"Selected matches teachers with schools and jobs they love."</i> (<a href="https://www.getselected.co/about/"> About Selected</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Matching Teachers and Schools</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.getselected.co/">Selected</a> is a New York-based educator employment startup founded by Waine Tam and Luis Pazmino. <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/32544/">Tam describes</a> the service as a dating app for teachers and schools that allows them to connect directly. Applicants just need to complete a basic questionnaire to create an online profile. The service then uses a matching algorithm that scans the NYC School Survey database of over a million teachers, students, parents, and staff to provide a list of the best choices for both schools and prospective teachers. Candidates can choose to apply to any of the schools through a single common application, saving significant time and cutting down on job search tedium. </p>

<p>Because there are no large teacher-specific job hunting sites, both educators and schools often must use sites like Monster or LinkedIn to find or post openings. These one-size-fits-all job sites cannot capture education specific characteristics necessary for the sector, making the process difficult for both administrators and applicants. Selected uses its common application and questionnaire to incorporate school culture directly into the job hunt. Potential applicants can choose school attributes that are important for their personal teaching success in several categories: collaboration, school leadership, trust, supportive environment, rigor of instructions, family engagement, diversity, bilingualism, and special education. The focus on school culture should allow for a more comfortable and efficient process for all parties involved.</p>

<p><b>Location, Location, Location </b></p>
 
<p>Selected is currently only operating in the New York City area, parts of New Jersey, Connecticut, and Philadelphia. It has already partnered with some leading schools in these areas, such as Avenues: The World School, Montclair Kimberley Academy, and Nightingale-Bamford School. Even if a school is not directly partnered with Selected, the service still can connect applicants to the school’s hiring information, which is obtained via the Department of Education’s website. While New York City and the surrounding areas may already have rich data available, it might be challenging to expand this kind of platform to other areas with less readily available information. For now, the service can still be an important tool for teachers and schools in the nation’s largest metropolitan area.</p>
