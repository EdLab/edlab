          <p>
            Reality television has experienced a recent boom in America.  Ever since I've moved here all I've seen are thousands of new reality shows pouring in everyday.  Just the other day I saw commercials for “The Singing Bee” a show that DOESN'T require you to sing well (huh?), “The Ex-Wives Club” which is a clever way to get revenge on your rotten ex-husband, who took the convertible AND the pool table, and “Pirate Master,” the show where you dress up like a pirate, act like a pirate and live like a pirate even though you're not a pirate.  All these riveting shows are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reality TV in America.

I have to confess though, that I was one of the 37.7 million viewers that tuned in to American Idol, and currently I'm watching American Inventor; America's got Talent and Last Comic Standing. Well actually, when I really have nothing to do at home I end up watching Wife Swap, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, The Age of Love, So You Think You can Dance etc.  Needless to say I too, am one of the people that watch these shows every week.
Anyway, I didn't really understand why other people liked the shows so much, because even though I do watch the shows, I'm not one of the religious viewers who grabs a bowl of chips, soda, and clears the living room of Aunt Lily who snores too loud and Snuffles the cat who thinks it can yodel, to watch any of the shows. I never understood why the media endorsed so many of the shows, but today I realized that the moguls that concocted these programs were actually on to something.  As hard as it may be to accept, reality shows are a present day embodiment of the pursuit of happiness, one of the three most important ideals on which the nation was founded on.

It seems unsuitable to try to associate mass produced shows to one of the golden principles that John Locke presented during the Enlightenment, but if you examine the shows, you will be able to see that they do have the principle within them.  Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were first presented by Locke as unalienable rights that every person possessed, and then Thomas Jefferson took his words and incorporated them into the Declaration of Independence.  This was where America's obsession with fulfilling and interpreting these rights began.

In the past the pursuit of happiness was more of a pursuit of property. It contributed to Manifest Destiny and the mass migrations of people to the West where there was plenty of land, but if we examine America today, we'd see that the pursuit of happiness is more closely associated with realizing your dreams and gaining money.  In the past gaining land wasn't an easy feat, but it was possible for any average person that decided to try it. In today's world realizing your dreams just isn't that easy and that's where reality shows come in.   
	Take American Idol as an example.  People that wanted to be singers since they were two or even people that decided singing would be better than working at the local Laundromat audition to make it big on TV and Hollywood.  American Inventor is another show where people's dreams come true, through four judges that deem if the contestant's invention is worthy of developing and mass marketing.  When I was watching American Inventor I could see how much time people had spent on their inventions, and the program was definitely a stepping stone for them to reach their goals. The people that appear on these shows are all pursuing their dreams, and ultimately pursuing happiness.  Some of the reality shows might not really have much substance to them, like Big Brother which doesn't really make any specific dreams come true, but the prize is money, and for some people money is the ultimate dream, and synonymous with happiness.  

So whether happiness is getting revenge on your ex-husband or having a new home, reality shows are one of the outlets in which Americans continue to pursue their happiness.
