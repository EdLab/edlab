<strong><em>Support the growth and development of </em>all <em>adults—teachers, principals, and superintendents—in your school community!</em></strong>

Educators at every level go through different stages of development over the course of their lives and need different kinds of supports and challenges to grow. <strong><em>Leading Adult Learning </em>introduces a model of adult development that helps school and district leaders consciously cultivate teacher, principal, and superintendent capacities in the educational workplace.
</strong>
Eleanor Drago-Severson's developmental model of learning-oriented school leadership draws from multiple knowledge domains, including adult learning, developmental theory, leadership practice, and organizational collaboration. The book shows school leaders how to foster growth and learning for individuals with different needs and developmental orientations. With a focus on research and application, this volume:
<ul>
	<li>Details four Pillar Practices for growth—teaming, providing leadership roles, collegial inquiry, and mentoring—which can support <em>all </em>adults</li>
	<li>Presents extensive research and practical application from principals, teachers, superintendents, and other school leaders from across the nation</li>
	<li>Includes application exercises, reflective questions, and lessons from the field to assist you in applying this learning-oriented model to your school and school system</li>
</ul>
Drago-Severson makes a compelling case for deliberately supporting adult development within and across school systems to enhance adults' capacities, school improvement, and student achievement.
