<p>Researchers in a recent study set out to create an objective method for classifying art as either expressionistic, impressionistic, post-impressionistic, or surreal. Researchers collected digital images of 1635 pieces of artwork by 19 artists from each of these four genres. Half of the images were used as input vectors to train a self-organizing map and the remaining images underwent a computational analysis to determine color and composition. First, average hue and saturation were calculated using a statistical computation method. Next, composition features were identified using an algorithm that  segmented each image into a set of distinct objects. Finally, the data was plugged into the self-organizing learning map that grouped images into visual clusters based on color and composition. </p>
 
<p>Researchers found that paintings with similar features were grouped closely together on the visual map. In fact, this program was able to accurately classify painting style with 93% precision. These findings suggest that unsupervised learning methods like self-organizing maps are a reliable tool for objectively classifying artwork. In the future, researchers hope to expand the dataset to include more artists and painting styles. </p>
 
<p>Scientific art classification techniques like the one described in this study could become a source of base data for art history researchers or those interested in the study of art and aesthetics. They also offer students new ways to think about, analyze, and interpret visual media. For those working in the field of museum education, these datasets could lead to the development of a new suggested painting system, which would recommend images based on style or author. Who would have thought that training computers to recognize artistic style would give humans new ways to think about art as well?</p>
