          <p>
            I don't know how many of you have encountered this story about cloned dogs roaming the city. Apparently a local New York City resident used DNA of one of his old dogs that he had been very fond of and made two clones out of that dog. This might not seem like a bad thing but apparently this man has been having trouble with the law because of the behavior of these cloned dogs. He has acquired many tickets because he believes that they should roam free.  You could read more about it in <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/attack_of_the_0HhSXbttE8cbc8LOHqhfEL">this article</a> and also I have posted a vialogues video to discuss this situation.

This is something I found to be very shocking as I was not aware that you can clone dogs but that their behavior can be very vicious. This makes me want to think why anyone would want to clone a dog. These dogs have attacked other dogs and also their owners. I don't find this as a good reason to want a cloned dog. I wonder why they keep allowing this man to have pets with that kind of behavior outside. It seems like they've given him countless warnings and tickets but no one has really done anything about it.
