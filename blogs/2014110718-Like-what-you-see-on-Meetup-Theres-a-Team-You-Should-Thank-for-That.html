            What's better than a meetup on usability? Meetup's usability meetup! 

I stumbled on their philosophy of testing by happenstance but the more I read about it, the more impressed I became. Meetup doesn't just have a usability team, it has a usability <i>lab</i>. It takes Nielsen's rule of 5 to the extreme: 5 (or more) testers every week of the year. In 2013, they tested over 400 people! They practice lean UX, so they are able to do numerous testing/dev cycles super efficiently. They want to learn what users think of their site as quickly as possible so they can iterate and maintain a pleasant user experience. 

I found <a href="http://making.meetup.com/post/46268864442/how-meetup-hq-does-usability-testing" target="_blank">a brief explanation from Meetup itself</a> of how it does user testing. But I think the more educational and thorough artifact is the vialogue I'm embedding below (sorry I got a little comment-happy). 

In this presentation, VP of Strategy, Product, and Community Andres Glusman and  then-usability lab leader Brenna Lynch lend great insight into the usability practices at Meetup. Their talk includes how they recruit all of those users, what their testing environment looks like, and how they incorporate user feedback into product development. 

There's much to be learned here. For one, their culture of usability is admirable. I do wonder if 400 user tests a year is a bit excessive, but their dedication to being the best at what they do is compelling! I also like that, because they are <i>always</i> testing, there is constant communication among the product, design, and development teams. Interestingly, the usability lab seems to sit outside of all of these areas in its own hub of research. <i>Very</i> interesting indeed!

But there are also a lot of questions with their approach. Can you think of any? Add them to the vialogue below!
