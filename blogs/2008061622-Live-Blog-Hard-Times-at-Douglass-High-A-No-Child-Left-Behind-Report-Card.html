            Movie Screening and Discussion

11:30. 
On the library's fifth floor, the movie "Hard Times at Douglass High" was being viewed by an audience of about 35 people in the Edlab.  All of the attendees seemed to share the same interest: how to improve education!

11:35. 
Professor Gary Natriello introduced Oscar-winning filmmaker Alan Raymond who gave his insight on the movie and the reasons he was drawn to this particular subject.  The film studies the hardships of life at Douglass High, and provides a context for the national debate over the controversial issue No Child Left Behind Act, focusing on the inequalities of American education, considered an American catastrophe by many. Mr. Raymond started by asking how many of us would think to work in an urban high school.  I looked around and about 15 hands were raised. Not bad!  He explained that Frederick Douglass High School was an inner city school and that the problems there could represent many schools in America. 

11:45. Movie commences
This movie was a year-long look inside Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore, Maryland.  The movie offers a view of the everyday adversity that the students, teachers and school officials face. With successful stories and not so successful, Hard Times at Douglass High serves as a reminder that education is an achievement of people, not policy.

The No Child Left Behind Act is controversial in that it threatens schools with sanctions, or even closing, unless student scores improve in annual standardized tests.  At Douglas High, keeping up with the No Child Left Behind goals proves to be much more than numbers; the high ratio dropouts and absentees, failures, discipline, the lack of certified teachers, and the lack of funding among other issues jeopardize the vitality of Douglass High School which besides the bad side it has a positive one, a successful music department and great basketball team.

This movie gives an insight of what may be happening in any school in America today.  The movie does not suggest any solutions â€” that job is assigned to the viewers.  The movie suggests reform and restructuring is a very difficult task, and that raising awareness is the stepping stone for the search of solutions. 

2:00. 
With a round of applause the movie ended.                               The audience asked Mr. Raymond many questions about what happened with many of the participants of the movie, but little was asked about the current NCLB act.  Questions were also asked of the Mr. Raymond and his thoughts on how the school year unfolded on film.  Overall, the attendees enjoyed the movie immensely.
