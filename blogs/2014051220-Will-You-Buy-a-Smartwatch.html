            What will make you buy a smart watch if you already have a smartphone? This was the question my group was responsible for answering as part of a class project. Smart watches have the same features as smartphones. To tackle this problem, my group decided to brainstorm ideas that will help as create a smart watch that is different from a smartphone. We had some initial difficulties coming up with ideas. We checked different kinds of smart watches and compared it to smartphones. Most smart watches are huge because of the features. My team then created something small but different from smartphones. 
<p>
We designed a smart watch just like an average watch, small and simple, but one that contains all the features a smartphone don't have. For instance, we designed a car starter in our smartwatch. This feature can start your car without using keys. This feature can also heat up your car during the winter months without you physically doing so. One important feature we had in our phone was a notification system. We connected our watch to our phone. Any notification you receive from your phone can be seen on your watch. This will help you get everything you need on your phone even when you are in business meeting, or in any please you cannot use your phone.
<p>
This was our small way of helping convince some individuals to buy a smart watch. The question still persists: will you buy a smart watch if you have a smartphone? What features do you want to see on your smart watch?
