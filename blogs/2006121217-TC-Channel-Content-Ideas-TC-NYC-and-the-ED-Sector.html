          <p>
            I've reviewed the feedback from our 12/6 channel event, and made some lists. Overall, there are a lot of ideas for creating content for the channel, as well as ideas about how to publish it on the web. Though we eventually publish to other formats (still thinking of the cell phone), it was agreed upon that creating a website was a good first step. 

We will likely seed a new website with material we've already put on iTunes. But there will continue to be new and competing production opportunities, so we should think about specific media that may make for attractive content. Here are some of your ideas from the discussion (video is prominent, but we do not have to limit ourselves to video):
