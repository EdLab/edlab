<a href="http://crl.acrl.org/content/73/3/263.full.pdf+html">Reinsfelder, T. L. (2012). Citation analysis as a tool to measure the impact of individual  research consultations. <i>College & Research Libraries, 73</i>(3), 263-277.</a> 

Several months ago, I covered a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7472">paper</a> about the effectiveness of the social citation game Bibliobouts. <i>Citation Analysis as a Tool to Measure the Impact of Individual Research Consultations</i> applies a similar evaluation to the traditional research interview. Gaming is (unfortunately) not compared straight to the effectiveness of flesh and blood librarians, but we can draw our own conclusions. 

The literature has generally been kind to one-on-one reference consultations, though the studies have largely been survey-based and the hard results have seldom been measured. Bibliographies and research are also highly subjective as authority and relevance are very much in the eye of the beholder and change very quickly, especially digital resources. The authors did their best to overcome this, using a select group of faculty members to evaluate and extensively cross checking. The evaluations revealed that students' bibliographies improved in overall quality, authority, and currency after a reference consultation in comparison to control students who did not meet with librarians. The consultations did not reveal a change in relevance or scope of the bibliographies and the consultations didn't appear to lead to higher grades. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The results of the study were modest and expected, though they did reveal a research strategy benefit. The most interesting part of the study was perhaps the marketing and unforeseen surge in library notoriety. The librarian authors billed the reference study as a new service that was working to “help improve the quality of student research papers.” The interest level was high among faculty members and students and the librarians reported glowing reviews from participants and a closer working relationship with faculty members.
