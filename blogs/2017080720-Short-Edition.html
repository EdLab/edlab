<p><i>"With enthusiasm and humour, Short Edition brings together a community of readers and authors who share the same passion for short stories."</i> (<a href="http://short-edition.com/en/">About Short Edition</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Writer’s Community</b></p>

<p><a href="http://short-edition.com/en/static/about-us">Short Edition</a> is a French startup that has built a community of over 5,000 writers and 200,000 literature fans since its founding in 2011. The company specifically caters to the medium of short stories, including comics and poetry, which can all be read in under 20 minutes. Writers submit stories to be reviewed by Short Edition’s team of authors and editors. The stories that are accepted are then sent out to the community of readers. Users can rate and give feedback on the stories they receive in order to have a tailor-made reading experience. Currently, the company only accepts submissions in French, and the stories for the American audience must be translated into English. Hopefully, the company can expand to include more languages in the coming years.</p>

<p><b>Short Story Dispensers </b></p>
 
<p> The most interesting and innovative aspect of Short Edition is their Short Story Dispensers. These are physical kiosks that print free short stories from the community in three different reading durations: one minute, three minutes, or five minutes. The idea is that these kiosks will be placed at locations where people are often waiting, such as doctor’s offices or hotel lobbies. Anyone can use the machines to print a short story from the community to read in order to pass the time. The company has just recently expanded these machines into the U.S., placing them in locations in San Francisco, Boston, West Palm Beach, and also at Penn State University. Francis Ford Coppola, the famous American filmmaker, even took notice and <a href="https://youtu.be/G0Vf30w2yZg">ordered one</a>  for his restaurant. Short Edition hopes to continue the expansion across the United States.</p>

<p> Even though we are in the smartphone age, there is something whimsical about pushing a button on a machine, getting a printed story, and reading a physical document. The parchment-like scroll that pops out of the Short Story Dispensers plays into this effect. If the company does expand to New York, we hope to try the kiosks ourselves for an <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/section/EdLab%20Review">EdLab Review</a>.</p>
