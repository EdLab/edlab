<strong>Authors:</strong> Rosamund Stone Zander &amp; Benjamin Zander

<strong>Publisher:</strong> Harvard Business School Press,  2000

<strong>Call Number: </strong> <a title="The ARt of Possibility" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6/?searchtype=t&amp;searcharg=the+art+of+possibility&amp;searchscope=6&amp;SORT=D&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=tshort+cuts" target="_blank">BC199.P7 Z36</a>

<strong>From the Publisher:</strong> The Art of Possibility offers a set of breakthrough practices for  creativity in all human enterprises.  This inspirational book is a  synthesis of Rosamund Stone Zander's knowledge of cutting-edge  psychology and Benjamin Zander's experiences as the conductor of the  Boston Philharmonic Orchestra.  Infused with the energy of their dynamic  partnership, the book joins together Ben's extraordinary talent as a  mover and shaker, teacher, and communicator with Rosamund's genius for  creating innovative paradigms for personal and professional fulfillment.

In lively counterpoint, the authors provide us with a deep sense of the  powerful role that the notion of possibility can play in every aspect  of our lives.  The Zanders' deceptively simple practices are based on two  premises: that life is composed as a story ("it's all invented") and  that, with new definitions, much more is possible than people ordinarily  think.  The book shifts our perspective with uplifting stories,  parables, and anecdotes.   From "Giving an A" to the mysterious "Rule  Number 6" to "Leading from Any Chair"--the account of Ben's stunning  realization that the conductor/leader's power is directly linked to how  much greatness he is willing to grant to others--each practice offers an  opportunity for personal and organizational transformation.

<strong>About the Authors:</strong> Rosamund Stone  Zander is a family therapist and a landscape painter.  Benjamin Zander is  the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra and a professor at  the New England Conservatory of Music.

<em>Amazon.com Review</em>
<div>The lure of this book's promise starts with the assumption in its  title.  Possibility--that big, all-encompassing, wide-open-door  concept--is an art?  Well, who doesn't want to be a skilled artist,  whether in the director's  chair, the boardroom, on the factory floor,  or even just in dealing with  life's everyday situations?  Becoming an  artist, however, requires discipline,  and what the authors of <em>The Art of Possibility</em> offer is a set of  practices designed to "initiate a new approach to  current conditions, based  on uncommon assumptions about the nature of  the world."  If that sounds a little too airy-fairy for you, don't be  put off; this is  no mere self-improvement book, with a wimpy mandate  to transform its  readers into "nicer" people. Instead, it's a  collection of illustrations  and advice that suggests a way to change  your entire outlook on life and, in  the process, open up a new realm of  possibility.</div>
<div>Consider, for example, the  practice of "Giving an A,"  whether to yourself or to others. Not intended  as a way to measure  someone's performance against standards, this practice  instead  recognizes that "the player who looks least engaged may be the most   committed member of the group," and speaks to their passion rather than   their cynicism. It creates possibility in an interaction and does away   with power disparities to unite a team in its efforts. Or consider  "Being the Board," where instead of defining yourself as a playing  piece, or even as the strategist, you see yourself as the framework for  the entire game. In this scenario, assigning blame or gaining control  becomes futile, while seeking to become an instrument for effective  partnerships becomes possible.</div>
<div>

Packed with such examples of  personal and professional interactions, the  book presents complex ideas  on perception and recognition in a readable,  useable style. The  authors' combined, eclectic experience in music and  painting (as well   as family therapy and executive workshops) infuses their  examples with  vibrant color and sound. The relevance to corporate  situations and  relationships is well developed, and they don't rely on dry  case  studies to do it. Indeed, this book assumes the emotional intelligence   and desire to engage of its reader, promising access to the rewards of  that  door-opening notion--possibility--in return. --<em>S. Ketchum</em> <em> </em>

<em>From Publishers Weekly</em>

</div>
In a lively, sensible manual for turning life's obstacles into  possibilities, the Zanders introduce various "tools" for transformation,  drawing on their extensive experiences with musicians, students and  patients in therapy (Rosamund is a psychotherapist and painter; Benjamin  is the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic). In a chapter entitled  "Giving an A," for example, Benjamin relates a classroom technique that  allows students to envision their own futures: all students in his class  receive an A if they write him a postdated letter relating "the story  of what will have happened to you by next May that is in line with this  extraordinary grade."

Other chapters emphasize practices such as  thinking in terms of making a personal "contribution" rather than stark  "success or failure"; "lightening up" in order to see a problem from a  new perspective (e.g., a patient of Rosamund's was able to have a  sensual experience with her husband even though she was angry at him);  and reassessing "frameworks for possibility" (e.g., a teacher shaved her  head in order to "reframe the meaning" of a hairless class member who  had leukemia). The authors' emphasis on "practice," the importance of  "flow" and the joy in creation and expression is apt and often truly  inspiring. Although not groundbreaking, the Zanders' suggestions  constitute sound, practical advice that has much in common with Zen  concepts of holism, balance and grace. --<em>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</em>
