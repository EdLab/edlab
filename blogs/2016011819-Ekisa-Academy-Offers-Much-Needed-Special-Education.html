<p>In 2011 <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/frontlines/sudan-south-sudaneducation/uganda-invests-educating-students">USAID reported</a> that there were more than 184,000 children in Uganda with learning disabilities. Although there have been <a href="http://newhopeuganda.org/programs/special-needs-program/">initiatives</a> and <a href="http://www.kakunyuchildren.org/">programs</a> that seek to bring more inclusive schooling to the country, Uganda and many other countries across the world still lack the necessary resources to educate students with disabilities.

<p>Ekisa Academy is one school that specifically caters to students with disabilities, currently enrolling a total of 45 children. The school focuses on on motor, daily living, and language skills throughout the day. And they always leave time for sports, too!</p>

<p>"Special education is not very common in Uganda," says Emily Henderson, Head Teacher at Ekisa Academy. "The majority of children with special needs are getting no education right now."</p>

<p>What are some ways in which special education both in the U.S. and abroad still needs to be improved? What types of resources are still lacking in Ugandan schools? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/26433/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:51 dinosossi2:</b> Often the higher a country's socioeconomic status, the wider breadth of academic programs it provides. How do we foster impactful teaching and learning experiences for those who are the most vulnerable within underprivileged communities?</p>

<p><b>@01:43 dinosossi2:</b> Providing spaces for both residential and community members should help those with the most acute needs receive more suitable personal, pastoral, and educational assistance.</p>
