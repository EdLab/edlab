Susan Grajek is <a href="http://bit.ly/1QZlJoL">EDUCAUSE's</a> vice president for data, research, and analytics. She leads the EDUCAUSE Core Data Service, the EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis and Research (ECAR), and the Top 10 IT Issues series. She also has programmatic responsibility for EDUCAUSE cybersecurity, GRC (governance, risk and compliance) and enterprise IT programs. Before joining EDUCAUSE, she spent over 25 years at Yale University in a variety of IT management and leadership roles throughout the university. Grajek holds a PhD in research psychology from Yale and held a faculty appointment in the Yale University School of Medicine's Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, where she started teaching a data management course in 1996. Her work with the School of Medicine included creating and leading its IT research department and serving as co-PI on the School’s IAIMS grant from the National Library of Medicine. Her expertise encompasses the design and execution of research in management, the behavioral sciences, and public policy, as well as statistical analysis. She also has an established background in IT planning, assessment, and metrics, as well as IT operational leadership. </p>

<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
My current role is really the convergence of my educational and professional history. My graduate training in research psychology at Yale taught me how to think analytically and how to apply research problems and opportunities. When I was a graduate student in the 1980s, the computer center was one of the most interesting places to get work done and meet smart and interesting people. University computing services at that time provided some great opportunities to do work that was both very pragmatic and also highly creative. During my working career at Yale, I was able to pursue many interesting opportunities that were relevant to but not yet a mainstream part of the profession of higher education IT service delivery—such as evaluating administrative services, developing KPIs and metrics, creating a staff performance development program, supporting the adoption of project and service management, and serving as the change management lead for a University shared business services initiative. I learned how to usefully apply my research skills and I also learned the importance of staying abreast of emerging techniques and issues. EDUCAUSE was one of my go-to organizations to understand trends in higher education IT and to meet capable colleagues and thought leaders. I developed a deep admiration for the association. So when I learned EDUCAUSE had created a new executive role to lead all of its research and analytics services, I jumped at the opportunity and was lucky enough to get the position. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape? </b><br>
The EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative (ELI) led by my colleagues Julie Little, Malcolm Brown, and Veronica Diaz is an invaluable partner in helping the research and analytics arm of EDUCAUSE I lead remain relevant and focused on the most important aspects of learning and technology. I hope my work helps in two fundamental ways. First, I hope our research makes it easier for IT professionals, learning professionals, faculty, and institutional leaders to know which new learning technologies, services, and practices are being adopted, by whom, why, and at what pace. Second, I hope the ECAR working groups and analytical tools we are producing will help people understand where they stand and give them resources to accelerate successful adoption. <p>

<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
Analytics will help institutions to make better decisions to enable students to engage in higher education more affordably and successfully; faculty to improve and enrich their teaching and the support they can give to their students; and students to create more effective degree plans, select the best courses, and understand their progress in real time. </p>
<p>Gamification and simulations are still not widely and deeply adopted, but I think they are among the most exciting possibilities to enhance and extend learning.</p>
<p>The quality, cost, and accessibility of bandwidth will continue to improve, and that will facilitate both richer e-learning experiences as well as greater penetration to under-served populations around the world. </p>
<p>The higher education ecosystem will become much, much more complex. Unbundling (of content from courses and programs, of experts from institutions, and of credentials from institutions) could vastly alter the system of higher education in place today. Economic constraints and changes are exerting pressure to make learning more affordable and to lower the cost of higher education, and are reinforcing the need to make learning a continuous part of adulthood rather than a discrete, one-time achievement. The prospect of economic opportunities is also attracting huge and arguably unprecedented interest in learning from venture capitalists and corporations. </p>
<p>The Millennial generation is reshaping learning to fit their adeptness at teamwork and collaboration, value of inclusiveness and diversity, and demand for high quality multimedia learning experiences, consumerism, and mobility requirements. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project? </b><br> 
We’re developing a series of maturity and deployment indices to enable institutions to assess and benchmark their capabilities (maturity indices) and the technologies and services they deliver (deployment indices) for a set of IT-related domains. So far we’ve created them for seven domains: e-learning, student success, analytics, research, IT governance, IT risk management, and information security. One of our next big projects is that we hope to integrate our data on faculty and IT, students and IT, the IT workforce, IT costs and staffing levels, and these new indices to design a comprehensive review of institutional IT services and their contribution to institutional strategic priorities. Our members trust us enough to contribute their data to our collective benchmarking and research services. We are committed to repaying that trust by creating truly useful resources for our members. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on twitter? </b><br>
My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/mbbrown">Malcolm Brown</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rielm">Riel Miller</a> (UNESCO head of Foresight), <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelrappa">Michael Rappa</a> (North Carolina State, creator of their analytics professional academic program), and <a href="https://twitter.com/emasie">Elliott Masie</a> are all doing interesting things worth following and featuring. </p>
