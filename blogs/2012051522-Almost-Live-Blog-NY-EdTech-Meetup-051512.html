Listed below are my thoughts & take-aways from tonight's <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7644">EdTech Meetup</a> & panel discussion:  

<b>The setting:</b>
The event was hosted at the Hatchery (on 7th & 37th), which is a tech incubator that officially opens next week!  As such, the space was still very much "under-construction", lacked AC and adequate space for the 50+ attendees.  Additionally, the video screens, which were only used to display #'s and panelist @'s were set on 3-D mode and all text was blurred. 

<b>"Secret", unadvertised sponsor & host...</b>
<a href=''http://www.collegeboard.org/">The College Board</a> was the "secret"  sponsor and two of the group's biz dev. members where the host and emcee... this seemed a bit disingenuous as the group hid their involvement & they seem to be the founders of this particular meet-up group.  Somehow this was a big turn-off, especially when they did a pitch for the group as an access point for making higher-ed more accessible.  Really?!  The SAT's & ACT?     

On a positive note, the group did mention the founding of an <a href="http://signup.edtech.org/">EdTech Council</a> (placeholder URL) that will have an advisory board that helps to move the edtech space forward.  However, based on this meet up, I am not sure it is a totally impartial or well-managed endeavor. 

<b>Take-aways from each of the panelists:</b>
<b>Brad Mcllquham - Director of Academics - <a href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a></b>
-"Early warning systems" built-into the analytics (did not elaborate).
-Trying to say that they are an "incubator" 
-40 plus programmers.
-Upcoming partnership with Pearson... <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7593">Sannier</a>? 
-Wearing a partner startup's tee... <a href="http://wistia.com/">Wistia</a>.

<b>Harris Goodman - <a href="http://latenitelabs.com/">Late Night Labs</a></b>
-Focus on community colleges... Partnership w ASU & soon PSU.
-Higher-ed market is more accessible than K-12.
-Community colleges are big users & more open to innovation. 
-NYC is a great talent pool - why they are here & not Silicon Valley. 
-Needs-based assessment vs licensing with schools.
-Want to work with Big pharma to gift labs to schools in need. 
-WATCH Late Night Lab's Seminar <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/744">here!</a>

<b>Jeremy Friedman - Co-founder, <a href="https://www.schoology.com/home.php">Schoology</a></b>:
-Focus on K-12, free to teachers, self-curated content.
-DOE is almost impossible to penetrate.
-Great inspiration from NYC but Midwest biggest growth opportunity.
-Should not try to get rid of teachers, but instead just augment them
-Scale of being a platform vs app.
-Read my StartupSpotlight on Schoology <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7198">here</a>.

<b>Joseph Cohen - Co-founder,  <a href="http://LORE.com/">LORE</a> (formerly CourseKit)</b>
-Wants to connect educators & students around content.
-Consumer platform that is free to join & doesn't target institutions.
-"Normals" ppl who are not tech-saavy... new term. 
-Feels that Udacity & MOOC's are "fluff."
-Importance of personalization
-Surprised by how little bandwidth & infrastructure is present in US schools.
-Not always best to name our product for what it is now - better to name for what it could be! Great point!

<b>Final take-aways...</b>
-LORE seems like an interesting course creation/LMS platform to explore for a review, Startup Spotlight & Seminar related to the mSchool. 

-The emcee (from the College Board) was the dullest public speaker I have ever encountered... and did not direct questions to specific panelists, instead, he just threw questions at them and expected the panel to sort-out who would answer & in what order.  Needless to say, this was not the best approach. 

-Panel discussions can be hard for audience members to sit-through if there are not opportunities for audience participation interspersed at regular intervals.  Additionally, once again, questions form a moderator should be directed at specific panelists and not the whole panel at once. 

-The space really matters... it is fun to have an informal, edgy feeling, but it needs to be comfortable and conducive to sitting for long periods of time.

-All technology needs to be pristine, more screens are not better if they are all blurry!   

-Finally, the EdLab's demo night is going to rock the EdTech world!
