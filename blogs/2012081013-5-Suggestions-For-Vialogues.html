          <p>
            After participating in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8173">the Vialogues Olympics</a> and various seminars, I have come up with some suggestions for Vialogues. I have already submitted some of these to the Vialogues Feedback system but have not received a response. I feel these issues deserve more attention.

<b>1. Real Time Comment Updating</b>
This feature was begging to be implemented during the seminars. I'm not sure if this is the case on all computers, but on mine comments would only refresh after I made a comment of my own. This issue ruined the conversational aspect as I would have to respond to my own comment or make a new one to see the responses of others. I could have refreshed the page but I would have had to reset the time-stamp on my video and potentially miss opportunities to comment.

<b>2. Better Facebook Integration</b>
Part of the Vialogues Olympics was to recruit new members. In a world with increased emphasis on Facebook, I found this rather difficult to do. Many websites feature a Facebook account alternative to creating a dedicated account for said website. As I'm sure you all know, they just say, "Connect With Facebook," and in two clicks, the user grants the site Facebook permissions and the site grants the user access to its system. I know it seems like a huge first world problem, but people don't want to go to a website and create an account(although Vialogues has a very fast sign up which I commend). This would be the easiest way to gather new users. Furthermore, a Facebook app should be developed to allow people to comment directly from Facebook. The existing embed option won't even allow me to let the video stream directly from my wall like YouTube does. This is probably obvious to all of you but I want to reiterate its importance.

<b>3. Email Notifications</b>
I'm not a big fan of how the notifications options are all checked. The existing site has a nice notification system as it is. People don't need emails cluttering their inboxes for every comment made.

<b>4. Let Me Change My Username or Email Account!</b>
If Facebook integration happens, this will be a moot point. It's just a tiny little issue I have with the system and I feel the option should be there.

<b>5. Let Me Look Up Users!</b>
As part of the Vialogues Olympics, Carmel, Mingoro and Duncan had to write about the Vialogues each participant made. It was a bit difficult tracking down each person's account and allowing people to search for users would help. Maybe a subscribe button should be added as well, to help bolster the community aspect of the site.

Thank you for reading and I hope some of these suggestions get implemented!
