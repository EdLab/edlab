As a designer who has been lucky enough to have designed and coded web applications all on my own, I've tried and ditched many tools in favor of those that strike me as a great balance between creativity and technical implementation. I want to share a shortlist of these useful tools and how each can greatly increase your productivity and team collaboration.

<a href="https://popapp.in/"><b>POP</b></a> is a mobile app that lets you take snapshot of your back-of-a-napkin sketches and turn them into interactive mockups. POP comes with a set of useful transitions and gestures you can map on regions of your mockups and the sweet thing is you can share with your teammates and users!

<a href="jsfiddle.net"><b>JSFiddle</b></a> is arguably the go-to for front-end developers and product designers. It is a web app with IDEs for HTML, CSS and JavaScript that let you code snippets of your project and see the results instantly. JavaScript libraries such as JQuery, Mootools, Angular, Ember, React, Underscore, Three.js, D3.js (you name it) are built-in and can be included easily. You can also import external stylesheets and fonts from CDN links such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Font-awesome, etc. If you have frequented Stack Overflow for HTML tips and tricks, chances are you have already seen answers provided as a fiddle link.

<a href="http://postgresapp.com/"><b>Postgres.app</b></a> makes relational database setup easy for designers and developers on a Mac. I was someone who had gone through the painstaking task of setting up Postgresql, and Postgres.app just took that pain away.

<a href="https://www.uxpin.com/"><b>UXPin</b></a> is a startup SaaS providing designers with cloud-base mockups and prototyping application of lo- and hi-fi. While it is a paid service, its collections of UI elements are beyond comparisons. Oh, and it allows collaborations too. The founder runs a blog and write tons of free downloadable e-books on UX/UI topics which are invaluable!

<a href="https://slack.com/"><b>Slack</b></a> is a shining startup providing a collaboration tool with integrations to Google docs, Dropbox and many more productivity tools in the market. Many have cited it as a rightful competitor of Google Hangout. It basically does what Google docs and Hangout are doing for team collaboration, but much simpler and powerful. Basically, you create a project and add teammates as well as customized team emails on Slack. Everything--and I mean everything--related to the project is gathered in one place. 

<a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/"><b>HTML5Boilerplate</b></a> is what its name suggests--a boilerplate template for your next web project. What makes it so popular is the stylesheets and predefined tags resulted from years of collective experience of veteran web developers. This helps save you time and the headache of fixing cross-browser compatibilities (like for instance, old IE's fallback handling and normalize.css). Recommended as a starter template for everyone's next web project.

Last but not least, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"><b>Twitter Bootstrap</b></a>. Some people dislike its opinionated rules, but one can't really deny its popularity. It sets a new standard for web design and has become the equivalent of a developer's Dreamweaver. Like it or not, HTML was created for documents, and documents have columns and rows. Bootstrap just emphasize that and make them explicit and clear. Also, Bootstrap comes with a powerful set of JavaScript built-in that free you from having to write a single line of JS for simple web pages. If you are among those who dislike Bootstrap for its "Bootstrappy" signature appearances, you have not tried customizing it with LESS or developing with its mobile-first responsive features.
