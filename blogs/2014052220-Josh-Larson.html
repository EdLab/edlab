<a href="www.linkedin.com/in/torncanvas">Josh Larson</a> is an artist, designer, and videogame creator who passionately engages with projects that have the potential to deeply affect humanity. With almost a decade of experience creating games for PC, web, and mobile devices for a wide range of audiences, Larson is ideally poised to add unique value to the industry. A recent speaker at this year’s <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/954">Games for Change</a> festival in NYC and part of the team responsible for the <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/">Teachers College</a> smoking cessation research project, <a href="http://lit2quit.wordpress.com/">LIT2Quit</a>, Larson has extended his reach beyond mere game creation and also actively contributes to scholarship on gaming for social good. Larson is currently partnering with <a href="http://www.mediagreenhouse.com/">Ryan Green</a> on the adventure game, <a href="http://thatdragoncancer.com/"><i>That Dragon, Cancer</i></a>, an interactive retelling of the Green family’s struggle with terminal cancer.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Part of my goal when I work is to continually learn new things, so my educational background has been essential to what I'm doing now.
<p>
I feel like I'm one of the lucky ones in the sense that I've had a strong desire to create computer-based media since age 11 or 12. There was a specific moment where I traced the Jurassic Park logo in MS Paint, and that's when I knew I wanted to create digital media. Because I didn't know any better, I thought that meant I needed to learn software, and that led me to learn how to create software. So I began making text adventure games about James Bond while learning art software. Those first couple years started me down a path of juggling programming, art, and design throughout my entire creative career. I am formally trained as an artist and designer, obtaining a BFA from Iowa State University, but I've always taught myself programming on the side.
<p>
Iowa State made art history quite boring and tedious to learn, since it emphasized facts over culture and aesthetic patterns. But I'm incredibly grateful for it anyway since I've been able to apply my knowledge of the history of artistic movements to improving the aesthetic aspect of videogames. Since I believe many mainstream videogames have pretty bad art direction, it encourages me to hear from players and critics who love the visual style of <a href="http://thatdragoncancer.com/"><i>That Dragon, Cancer</i></a>.
<p>
And I think my choice of juggling art, design, and programming was a wise one because it gives me a unique insight into how to create art and build systems to engage with players in a dance of poetry, emotion, philosophy, and reason.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> All of my experiences have informed my current work to some degree. I'm the kind of person that tries to appreciate the little things, even if they seem insignificant on the surface. I think that applies to my career as well.
<p>
Really, my current work feels like it has been the most formative for me. Maybe that will always be the case as long as I'm trying to do new things.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> We didn't develop it with this goal in mind, but I hope <i>That Dragon, Cancer</i> can be used to help students increase their emotional intelligence. I think being emotionally mature is a pretty underrated need; I appreciate an emotional intelligence community growing to help kids learn this important skill. Maybe somehow our game can help.
<p>
Since art programs continue to be diminished, I hope more artistic video games like ours can sneak in through the back door of the education system through technology and engineering. I would love to hear of a student in a technology class playing our game, wondering "How did they make the game look like this?", ending up on a Wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Expressionism">German Expressionism</a>, and deciding to take up drawing. I love technology, but I wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have art classes I could take in high school once I realized art is actually the foundation to good graphics and that the software is just a tool for that.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The largest trend I see in learning is the democratization of education through sharing knowledge on the Internet. The great news is that this will have a huge impact on those who have had limited access to learning. And for better or worse, I think it will erode some of the institutions of learning that have been established up to this point. The <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is a good example of this, and I think it's wise to let them try to redesign standardized testing since they have the ability to improve learning in such an adaptable and iterative fashion.
<p>
Another very large trend that has been going on for some time, and will continue to go on for a while, is US students no longer being the top performers. Any time there is movement among countries considered the best at education, it has a huge impact on learning. For the US, it has led to an increased focus on STEM subjects and to all sorts of education reform. Various schools and programs look to those who seem to be doing better and try to adopt some of their methods. It even impacts learning research, since more money is funneled into research projects that have the promise of improving our ranking down the road.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I'm currently developing That Dragon, Cancer with my partner <a href="http://thatdragoncancer.com/ourfamily">Ryan Green and his wife Amy</a>, along with three other very talented people. It's an emotional, story-based video game about Ryan and Amy's journey raising their son Joel, who fought terminal cancer for four years until passing away in March. This experience is like a memoir that allows Ryan and Amy to share what they went through and how it affected how they see the world. But hopefully it's more than a memoir because you have a presence in a 3d world that you explore to unlock the story, and you also get to play with Joel. We hope players will confront their fear of death, and then overcome it by choosing to hold on to hope. We'll be releasing the game on the <a href="https://www.ouya.tv/">OUYA platform</a> first, which is a $99 Android-based game console with its own app store.
<p>
My next big project will be taking our game to other platforms after OUYA. We also had to cut half of our vision for the game early on, so we might start developing that other half.
