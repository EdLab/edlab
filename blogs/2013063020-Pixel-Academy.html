<b>Pixel Perfect</b><br>
<a href="http://www.pixelacademy.org/#What">Pixel Academy</a>, currently offers a series of paid workshops and opportunities for "open exploration" focused on "21st century" skills (graphics, game design, programming, etc.) in their Brooklyn-based, tech-filled, open lab space.  Mike Fischthal, Pixel Academy Founder & CEO, describes their new Brooklyn space to New Learning Times, "The new Pixel Academy is a large open creative space.  We have a Tetris shaped white board that runs the length of the front room, a 120" projector screen in the ‘theater,’ a green screen room, a digital music area with drums, guitars, and keyboards, two 3d printers, virtual reality goggles, a 3D monitor, and enough computers and drawing tablets for everyone to get their own."  Despite being aimed primarily at learners in the early grades, the program is not limited by age and even hosts occasional adult workshops.  The benefits of this "ungated" program are explained on the Pixel Academy website, "The unique open exploration structure of the Pixel Academy allows us to work with a variety of ages at the same time. Most of our members are 7-12, but since the stuff we’re learning is technology-based, and not anything that directly corresponds to school, we find that having a range of ages is actually a real benefit for the kids, in terms of both learning and socializing." Club and workshop time is paid by learner’s guardians, and funds are preloaded onto RFID-enabled wristbands.  Participation in open lab time and workshops carries a flat fee with scholarships available to financially disadvantaged learners.  These RFID enabled bracelets serve as a secure tracking mechanism within the confines of the program and may even eventually allow learners to "unlock" computers.  
<p>
<b>The Arcade Model</b><br>
Far from a traditional classroom, the Pixel Academy space in Brooklyn resembles an arcade for a learner of the future. Stocked with state-of-the-art technology across a wide range of creative disciplines, paired with mentors who are available for on-sight, in-person tutoring sessions (check out the exclusive NewLearningTimes video coverage of the program <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/466">here</a>), the space even features a popcorn machine and dedicated space for snacks.  Fischthal explains his own inspiration, "This is what I would have wanted when I was a kid.  I loved arcades, and learning, and playing around on the computer, and learning.  To me this is the next logical step.  It's a modern day arcade where kids can be creative and learn real skills."  Despite providing an "open," unconventional learning experience that is not tied to traditional grades (or official credentialing), the program’s workshop curricula are aligned with the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">Common Core</a> standards and grounded in the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction">differentiated instruction</a>.  Fischthal explains the program’s focus on independent learning, "I think a lot of these technologies lend themselves to open exploration.  Kids are used to trying to learn these skills on their own by watching Youtube videos, their friends, or just messing around.  We don't want to get in the way of that process- just make it a LOT easier."  Additionally, the program provides opportunities for schools to participate by offering professional development classes and in-school activities through their <a href="http://www.pixelacademy.org/schools.html">school-focused programming</a>.  Many of the opportunities to work with sophisticated technologies like 3D printers, game design software and knowledgeable, human experts, are not often available through traditional educational pathways.

<b>Exclusive NLT interview with Pixel Academy Founder & CEO, Mike Fischthal</b>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Does Pixel Academy currently offer scholarships and opportunities for low-income learners?  If not, are there plans to do so in the future?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Yes, we have several members who are on partial scholarship and plan to offer more in the future as we grow.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Describe your new location and which cities are next?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The new Pixel Academy is a large open creative space.  We have a Tetris shaped white board that runs the length of the front room, a 120" projector screen in the "theater", a green screen room, a digital music area with drums, guitars, and keyboards, two 3d printers, virtual reality goggles, a 3D monitor, and enough computers and drawing tablets for everyone to get their own.  There's also a snack area with a popcorn machine, a few bean bags to relax and work in, and a mini-library of digital technology books.  Next stop for us is Upper West Side and soon other Northeast locations.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Is the curriculum for various workshops freely available for teachers who want to integrate these subjects in their classes?  Or is this a part of the paid schools program?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We offer in-school programming so teachers don't have to worry about staying current with the technology.  So for that reason the curriculum isn't made available or sold.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What is the number one reason you feel US schools do not prioritize 21st century skills like those taught at your workshops?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think they just don't have the time or money.  They want to but they have to deal with standardized testing and other requirements that have accumulated from decades of traditional non-tech education.  Schools aren't set up to be able to buy new technology every year and the teachers aren't afforded the time or resources to learn them.  Commercial entities like Pixel don't have to answer to anyone except the parents, PTA, or school administrators.  We're able to basically split the cost of our equipment and training across multiple schools and cultural institutions.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How many schools engage with the program?  Do you see this as a model that learners in mainstream programs could benefit from?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> In Winter/Spring 2012/2013 we've worked within 3 schools (2 public) and have had close interactions with half a dozen more in our after-school programs.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you address online privacy concerns?  Any pushback from parents re: RFID bracelets?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Our system is set up so we can monitor everything the kids do on our premises.  They're not creating any content that has personally identifiable information so privacy isn't a big concern.  Parents love the bracelet concept.  They would probably let us tether their kids inside if it meant keeping them safe.  In the future we'll expand the bracelets to make them more personalized and have them unlock computers.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Will the program ever offer credentials or badges?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Potentially.  Since we teach kids how to actually create things (games, toys, music) the real 'badge' is the thing they create.   That said, for things like 3D printer knowledge, guitar chords, and stuff like that - yeah - we want them to have that sense of pride so they can show off what they know. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you plan to attract more girls to the program?  What is the gender makeup now?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Girls are really into this stuff too, especially the 3d printing and engineering aspects - they just don't seem to flock in like the boys do for game design.  We're about 90% boys, and the occasional girl that does show up usually doesn't end up coming back.  Hopefully now that we are in a fixed spot with a fixed schedule we can become part of their and their friends’ routines.  We need them to come as a group so they're not discouraged by all the rowdy boys.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What personally inspired you to create the program?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> This is what I would have wanted when I was a kid.  I loved arcades, and learning, and playing around on the computer, and learning.  To me this is the next logical step.  It's a modern day arcade where kids can be creative and learn real skills.  The cool thing is-- Adults think it's awesome too.  Everyone loves this stuff.  Especially me.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Why did you choose a "differentiated instruction" model?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think a lot of these technologies lend themselves to open exploration.  Kids are used to trying to learn these skills on their own by watching YouTube videos, their friends, or just messing around.  We don't want to get in the way of that process- just make it a LOT easier.
