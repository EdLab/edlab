          <p>
            Aloha! <a href="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/">HICSS</a> is in it's 45th year and is one of the longest continually-running scientific conferences in the world.  The conference will be held January 4-7th 2012 and is sponsored by the  Shidler College of Business, University of Hawai'i at Manoa.  

There will be the following general opportunities to participate and contribute work: 

-Minitracks in a "matrix structure" for double-blind, peer-reviewed papers to be discussed in an abbreviated, informal format.   ("matrix" is described as a "rich mixture")  

-Full or half-day symposia described on the HICSS site as, "more flexible than a minitrack and more formal than a workshop."  

-Half or full-day workshops in which participants discuss position papers with the goal of, "advancing thinking and discovering new insights on that topic during the workshop." 

-Cross-disciplianary tutorials will also be held on a variety of topics. 

Papers are due by June 15th and you can find submission details <a href="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_45/45authorinstructions.htm">here</a>.

In addition, the following minitrack within the larger Internet and Digital Economy track may be especially interesting for EdLab:
 
LEARNING ANALYTICS & NETWORKED LEARNING
<i>This minitrack calls for papers that address leading edge use of technology or system design to analyze, support, and/or create learning and learning
environments. The remit is wide and calls for papers that use technology to
examine how social learning happens, use data from learning environments to
support learning processes, and examine new practices of formal and informal
learning on and through the Internet.</i>

If you are interested in submitting to this track Caroline Haythornthwaite from the University of British Columbia is the main contact: c.haythorn@ubc.ca 

Also, there is a call for proposals for a learning analytics workshop as well.  1-page proposals are due November 30th 2011 and Dan Suthers of the University of Hawai'i Manoa is the primary contact: suthers@hawaii.edu

More info on this workshop can be found <a href="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_45/45swt/WS/Learning-Analytics-Web.pdf">here</a>.

Any thoughts on whether or not EdLab could or should participate?
