          <p>
            One day at the student lounge at the Bronx Lab School, one of the teachers was playing this Flash animation on his computer. My cooperating teacher and I, being artists, gathered around and watched and laughed at this Matrix parody, <a href="http://www.themeatrix1.com/">The Meatrix</a>.  Absolutely silly, yet the subject matter was thought provoking and a bit alarming. Pretty savvy application of one of my favorite interests in education, <b>implicit learning</b>. 

I perused the rest of the site and found a <a href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/getinvolved/">getting involved section</a> that would educate the viewer and his or her community and an <a href="http://www.eatwellguide.org/">eat well guide</a> where you can type in a zip code to find the places that sell fresh, wholesome sustainable meat products.  

There is also a section for <a href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/schools/">education and schools</a> for teacher resources, cafeteria and dining halls, school gardens and food projects, and educational programs and centers. 

And the <a href="http://www.themeatrix.com/interactive/">3-D interactive feature</a> is pretty comprehensive in its facts and tidbits.

This site apparently won many awards from documentary animation and Internet awards not to mention from farming and environmental groups. They have gotten good press from CNN Headline News and Adbusters.

I believe that the lab is capable of such a production and is something to think about for the channel.  Flash animation has its own kind of charm (see cult Flash hit <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a> with episodes available on DVD) It is easy on the computer memory bank by keeping things vector, and is used not only online but on TV. I already have a few ideas swimming around my head...
