            <a href="http://thenexthope.org/2010/06/forty-talks-that-will-be-at-the-next-hope-not-even-half-the-total/">Talks are beginning to be announced for The Next HOPE</a>, which is hands down the most informative, most fun conference I know of (full disclosure: I'm on the speaker selection committee -- because I love this conference so much.) I highly recommend that everyone from EdLab try to make it down to the conference, which is held at the Hotel Pennsylvania, right across from Penn Station, July 16th-18th.

Don't think hacker issues apply to you? Think you're not technical enough? Let me try to disabuse you of that notion. Here's a short list of topics and speakers:

<ul>
<li>Hacking the Food Genome</li>
<li>Video Surveillance, Society, and Your Face (a second talk on this topic may include a surveillance-camera-foiling face-painting booth)</li>
<li>The DMCA and ACTA vs. Academic and Professional Research: How Misuse of This Intellectual Property Legislation Chills Research, Disclosure, and Innovation</li>
<li>Get Lamp, a movie about text-based adventure games of the 1980s</li>
<li>Technology infrastructure of North Korea</li>
<li>Hacking Your GPS</li>
<li>Hackers for Human Rights — "how creative technological efforts can combat oppressive forces, protect dissidents, journalists and activists, and save lives"</li>
<li>TC's own Ellen Meier speaking alongside radical tech librarian Jessamyn West (I set this up, and can't *wait* to see them riff off each other)</li>
<li>The Need for a Computer Crime Innocence Project</li>
<li>How to Run an Open Source Hardware Company</li>
<li>Lock Bypass without Lockpicks</li>
<li>How Hacking is Both the Death and Future of Traditional and Interactive Publishing, Journalism, and the Media (by a developer from the game Grand Theft Auto)</li>
<li>Privacy is Dead — Get Over It (by a speaker who was featured in the MySpace episode of The Media Show)</li>
<li>Sita Sings the Blues: A Free Culture Success Story</li>
<li>Likely security problems in IPv6</li>
<li>8bit music concerts on Friday and Saturday nights (video game-style music!)</li>
<li>How the U.S. Shattered the Axis Enigma Code in WWII</li>
<li>Julian Assange of Wikileaks as a keynote (provided he's let into the US and not arrested -- whether notable speakers will be arrested is often one of the conference's entertaining sideshows.</li></ul>

You see what I mean? It's sure not AERA, where you're likely to be bored to tears as you watch your tenure-seeking colleagues struggle to publish rather than perish. And it's 3 days for $85 (if you get tickets online now; at the door they're $100), which also makes it one of the cheapest conferences I know of. 

Worried that it might look bad on your record to be at a "hacker conference?" Don't be. When we say "hackers," we mean people who are exposing security flaws because they believe people should know about them, and companies should fix them. The main concerns of the conference are digital rights and privacy. And there are many academics on the panels; my favorite talk two years ago was by a team at the University of Pennsylvania which was tasked by the Ohio Secretary of State with demonstrating security flaws in voting machines.

This is hardly the half of what will be going on; a full schedule should go up soon. Suffice to say there was one proposal about which I wrote "he had me at 'bat echolocation'" when voting for it.

Join us! It's a heck of a party.
