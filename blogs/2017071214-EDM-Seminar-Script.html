            <h6><span class="s1"><b>Overview of EDM topics</b></span></h6><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is an African proverb: <b>It takes a village to raise a child</b>. It means that the environment has big impacts on the human development. There are multiple factors involved in education. Now we have the technology to assist us to monitor the inputs from the environments, the status of kids and guide school district administrator, teachers, parents for actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20170712142420-outline_png_79a74361de998702057daedc091ab70e.png" style /><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br /></span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Figure 1. The graphic illustration to represent the major topics of EDM conference.</span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The data had been collected from the multiple learning environments either virtually or physically. There are lots of papers using the Coursera and EdX data sets to build models for knowledge tracing, prediction, and automatic grading. Some teams from the online course content generators such as Harvard University, they create adaptive learning system based on the online student data. Some other teams applied new machine learning techniques such as deep learning, facial recognition to detect the students’ emotion and engagement<span class="Apple-converted-space"></span> level, in combining with the learning behavior data such as clicking, video watching time, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">All these data would also help us, the researcher and educators, to evaluate the educational theories, curriculum designs, and pedagogy environments, to facilitate the decision-making process, rethinking and trying to solve the ultimate problem:&quot;how to raise the children in our village?&quot;</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></p><h6><span class="s1"><b>Assessment automation</b></span></h6><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adaptive Assessment Experiment in a HarvardX MOOC (speaker: Ilia Rushkin)</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Current problem: some students don’t have the optimal path in learning.</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span><span class="s1">Solution: adaptive guidance with a specific assessment to probe learners’ state of knowledge directly.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>Experiment setup:</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">16 graded homework with </span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">assessment questions </span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">customized by javascript </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">4 out of 16 homework were adaptive homework are used for the experiment.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Control group:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>explore questions in the sequence of knowledge components (KC) once</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Experiment group: explore questions in the recommendation system based on their mastery of KCs and levels of difficulties, Bayesian knowledge tracing was used to construct the recommendation system.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>Conclusions:</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their preliminary findings suggest that the adaptivity assessment system they created leads to a higher efficiency of learning without an adverse effect on learning outcomes. Learners go through the course faster and attempt fewer problems since the problems are served to them in a targeted way.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The questions are tagged with 1 or more KCs. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">133 questions were tagged with 66 KCs, 39 adaptive homework questions with 25 KCs for learning curve construction.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the talk, I asked the following questions to the speaker:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">How do you determine the difficulty levels? <br />Answer: it was determined by the course developers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Do you weight the question differently due to the difficulty levels? <br />Not answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Why you choose Bayesian over cognitive diagnosis matrix. <br />Answer: he just chose BKT naturally. BKT is dynamic for recommendation system<br /></span></li>
</ol><h6><span class="s1"><b>NLP and Text Analysis</b></span></h6><p class="p1"><span class="s1">NLP helps the researchers with cognitive process analysis.<br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Example: Sentiment Analysis, Discussion Topic, Writing assessment<br /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wrote a lot about the NLP techniques in my <a href="https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/blog/u/xk2120" target="_blank">previous blog posts</a>. <br />Dr. McNamara's team at </span>Arizona State University created different tools to provide adaptive guidance for the student writing. This picture showing the interface of Writing-Pal,<br /></p><blockquote>&quot;an Essay Writing Tool allows students to author practice essays and receive automated feedback. Students can choose the prompt and submit their work to Writing Pal to be automatically assessed. This scoring process is based on a variety of algorithms that evaluate the essay as a whole, as well as specific essay sections and linguistic features. Formative and scaffolded feedback is provided to students to help them identify and select more appropriate strategies for revising their current essay and writing new essays in the future.&quot;</blockquote><p></p><p class="p1"><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20170712143630-writing_pal_png_64a999370376144664564fc3c91b1ce1.png" style /><br /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Figure 2.

The student data has less than 100 problem attempts were excluded.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Finally, they have 5 million data points.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Their paper was about to build different knowledge tracing and prediction models based on these massive data and compare the accuracy of the model. </span></p></h6><h6><span class="s1"><b>Engagement in Education</b></span></h6><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In EDM, we saw our old friend Dr. Beverly Woolf from the University of Massachusetts. </span><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">She gave a talk on the similar topic as she did in EdLab 5 years ago. Please check with <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/3393/">the vialogues video</a> for review. Dr. Woolf represents the group of researchers who care about students’ emotion and engagement, and how these would affect the learning outcome.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: 0.875rem;"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the online learning become a new trend in education, we also experience frustration, stress, confusion brought by the machine. The computer could not see our facial expression, could not talk to us to see if we are still motivated in learning. They could not get nor response to learners’ emotion, and therefore the drop out rate is so high in MOOCs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr. Woolf’s team created pedagogical agents could deliver different types of affective messages.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Correlation Results</b></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students who received empathic messages become more confident, patient, with higher levels of interest, and valued math knowledge more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students who received growth mindset messages, get more problems correct on their first attempt but valued math knowledge less and had lower posttest scores.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students who received more success/failure messages make more mistakes, to be less learning-oriented, more confused.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion: </b></span></p><blockquote><span class="s1">Affective messages are powerful media to influence students’ perceptions of themselves as learners, as well as their perceptions of the domain being taught. The use of empathy to improve student affect and attitudes in a math tutor.</span></blockquote><ol class="ol1">
