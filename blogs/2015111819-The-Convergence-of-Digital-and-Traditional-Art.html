<p>Digital and traditional art are typically perceived as two distinct forms of media; however, researchers from Taiwan sought to assess whether the gap between the two may be smaller than one might expect. By providing fifth- and sixth-graders in a Saturday art class in Taipei with ePainting, a web-based drawing program, they hoped to determine whether a digital form of art could actually influence learning attitudes toward paper-based art.</p>
 
<p>The authors stated that because students often become discouraged in traditional art creation when unexpected splatters or strokes might "ruin" an entire painting, they hoped that this digital software might give students the chance to maintain interest. On top of that, ePainting simulates paper-based painting with options like transparency and splashing, and also gives users the option to record and replay brushstrokes.</p>
 
<p>With this in mind, the researchers conducted three questionnaires—one about paper-based art before using ePainting, one about ePainting immediately after using the software, and another about paper-based art four weeks after the conclusion of the initial study. Many students reported that using the software helped them learn to paint different types of textures that they had previously struggled with on paper, although others emphasized that using the mouse to paint was too difficult. Overall, student attitudes toward art creation as a whole, as well as art creation on paper, were shown to improve significantly. The researchers also noted that males who initially showed lower levels of interest in art creation showed the greatest improvement in attitude toward art creation.</p>
 
<p>These findings may have implications for art teachers in a variety of contexts. Schools that are strapped for resources but already have computer labs can still implement art curricula by using digital media software since this study demonstrates that programs like ePainting create a positive attitude toward art creation. This research may also demonstrate that both digital and paper-based art may have more in common than we originally thought, which could lead to interesting hybrids for teaching, learning, and creating art in the future.</p>
