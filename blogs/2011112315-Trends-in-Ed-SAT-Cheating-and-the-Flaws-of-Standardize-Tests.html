          <p>
            We've been hearing alot lately about how students are cheating the SATs by paying  others to go to their testing site and take the exam for them. First we heard about the cheating in Great Neck North High School in Long Island, and now it seems there are some schools in Queens also being investigated for cheating as well. It looks like there is a growing trend of this type of cheating . Remember this type of cheating can be happening all over the country it just hasn't come to light yet. 

<a href ="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/education/more-students-charged-in-long-island-sat-cheating-case.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&ref=education">This recent article from the NY Times</a> describes in detail about the cheating scandal. I believe the most surprising detail in the article was how one person who was male, impersonated six students, that included a female student. The cheating students who are under 19 were charged with misdemeanors, and those accused of taking the test for the students will face felony charges.

Most news networks who are reporting this story argue whether or not these test takers should be charged with criminal charges. I believe we should be asking ourselves if this is a good reason to start questioning these types of standardize testing? My reasoning is that if a male substitute test taker can take the place of a female student without any test proctors noticing, doesn't this show how little we care about the individual student and how much they are learning, but only that someone is taking an exam? It doesn't seem to matter who is taking the test. I know this event wouldn't spark a huge debate on how flawed these standardize tests are because there will instead be talks on how this cheating can be prevented and debates on whether or not the cheaters should be charged criminally. 

What I would want more people to take away from this event is how students are so desperate to receive a high score on an exam that they would resort to this kind of cheating, instead of learning the skills they need to get a job and for life in general. We shouldn't ask how we can prevent this from happening but instead how we can evolve the current system to put more emphasis on learning and less on test scores.
