Trung Le, principal architect for The Third Teacher, explains in this video the importance of understanding the role of space in student learning. The Third Teacher, a firm composed of an international team of architects and designers, gets its name from Loris Malaguzzi, founder of the Reggio Emilia educational philosophy for young children. Malaguzzi believed children learn from three teachers: adults, peers and physical space. He also wrote about the 100 languages of children, a concept he used to represent the countless ways children interact with and learn from their environment. As Le highlights, there are strong connections between Malaguzzi’s philosophy and the ideas of John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and Howard Gardner.  <p>

This informative video tracks the The Third Teacher project at North Shore Country Day, an independent school in Winnetka, Illinois. Le describes the project’s resulting design and architectural changes, explaining the importance of differentiating space to personalize learning. In particular, the project aimed to create flexible spaces teachers and students could manipulate depending on the lesson or activity. Le and his team created a "new ecology of spaces" and they built an "integrated furniture and collaboration tool." The aim of many of their designs, whether a chair or an entire room, was to create spaces that allowed teachers and students to design and collaborate.<p>

After watching the video featured here, what are your thoughts on the new learning spaces? What would you add or change? Should we place as much importance on learning from physical space as we do on learning from teachers and peers? Share your experiences <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13549">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>
