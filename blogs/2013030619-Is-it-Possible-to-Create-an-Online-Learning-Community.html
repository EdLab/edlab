<b>Title:</b> Creating an Online Learning Community: Is it Possible?
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Jennifer L. Murdock & Amy M. Williams
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 

More than ever, postsecondary students are enrolling in online courses. While enrollment in distance education is growing, so are attrition rates, which are consistently higher than traditional classroom rates. Some scholars believe that an important contributing factor is the difficulty of fostering a healthy learning community in the cyber context. A learning community encompasses a mutual purpose among the players involved, and a solid understanding of shared responsibilities, roles and commitment. 
<p>
Since limited research exists on students’ experiences within an online learning community, Jennifer Murdock and Amy Williams conducted a study comparing the differences in perceptions of 16 students enrolled in a distance counseling class compared to 11 students enrolled in the same course in a traditional classroom. To measure students’ perceptions of the class’s learning community, the authors used a revised version of the Online Learning Community Survey.  Students were asked whether they strongly agreed or disagreed with statements related to their perspective on the instructor’s role, the degree to which they were engaged in the course and if they felt the course was an empowering experience.

<p>

<b>Findings:</b>

Results indicated that students in both courses felt a sense of community, as well as a sense of responsibility for their success in the class. The authors attributed this to the instructor’s commitment and effort to encourage a learning community in both courses. It is important to mention that the instructor had already participated in a university-sponsored training program focused on online curriculum development. Based on what was taught in the training program, in both the online and traditional courses the instructor intentionally developed assignments and activities that established a sense of community.

<p>

One important distinction in perception was that students in the online course felt the instructor had a more significant role in facilitating a learning community compared to students enrolled in the traditional course.  Students perceived the instructor as a mentor who shared personal experiences and encouraged students to build relationships among one another. 
<p>

<b>Moving Forward:</b>

Though small in scale, this study suggests that it is possible for students to experience an equal sense of community in an online course. The key is that instructors must be intentional about designing a course that fosters a learning community. Strategies like communicating high expectations, respecting distinct learning styles, fostering contact between students and instructors, and incorporating activities that encourage students to engage in discussions that integrate personal experiences relevant to the course materials provide the necessary scaffolding to encourage a learning community.  

<p>
As registration for online courses continues to grow, understanding how to lower attrition rates will become an even more pertinent puzzle to solve. Considering the mounting body of research that points out the importance of fostering a learning community in order to lower attrition rates, more effort must be made to provide future instructors with the knowledge and capacity to do so.
