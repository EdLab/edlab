          <p>
            I went to Edison, NJ during Thanksgiving for an observation study of cram schooling. Students (mostly Asian) who go to prep schools in the New England areas gathered in a hotel conference room to take crash courses in reading, writing, and math in preparation for the SAT or SSAT. I talked with some of them and looked around their taking courses. They said that they were sure of getting higher score in the test with taking this crash course. 

Earlier today, I came across <a href="http://http://www.fastweb.com/college-search/articles/1239-everyday-sat-prep">this article on Fastweb</a> which talks about preparing for the SAT. It says..

"No student should have to cram for the SAT in the few months before the test; cramming isn't effective educationally and makes the entire process more stressful than it needs to be."

There is a widespread cliche in cram schools that "if you get better grade, it is because you took courses here," which means a cram school. But "if you were not good on a test, it is because you did not follow the direction that we gave you!!"

Students will still keep registering for cram schools either by their own will or their parents' but we still do not know if it guarantees better grades on a test.
