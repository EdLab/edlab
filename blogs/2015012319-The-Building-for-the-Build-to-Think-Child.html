Get the inside scoop on this compelling school-meets-design-lab. The Nueva School is an independent school that partners with Stanford's d.School and is making waves in the education world. Nueva School seeks to "champion the build-to-think child" according to Kim Howard-Saxe who discusses the schoolâ€™s 3500 square foot innovation lab and the ways the lab supports using tried and true methods of learning. <p>

Kim has taught for 14 years at Nueva School in addition to teaching as a lecturer at Stanford. She has taught and built K-8 project-based curricula; she consistently relies on the methodologies of design thinking; and as director of the Design Thinking, Design Engineering, and Entrepreneurship programs at Nueva School she is constantly rethinking and re-imaging teaching, learning, and space. Among her many her projects, she has led an award winning robotics curriculum and spearheaded an engineering curriculum for students in 4th-6th grades. <p>

While many people think of design thinking as a theory, the Nueva School sees it as a practice. Concepts like mindsets take on real meaning in the life and work of students and teachers through innovative implementation practices spearheaded by leaders like Kim. <p>

Do you think design thinking could be in all schools? What is more important, the methodology or the space? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18661">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>
