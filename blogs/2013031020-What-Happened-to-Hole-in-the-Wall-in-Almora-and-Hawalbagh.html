<b>Title:</b> Hope-in-the-Wall? A Digital Promise for Free Learning
<p>
<b>Author:</b> Payal Arora
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 

<a href=" http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/abouthiwel.html"> Hole-in-the-Wall Education Limited (HiMEL)</a> has enjoyed international recognition  as a "minimal interventionist" digital educational approach, embracing a grassroots ideology. The experimental project provides unconditional access to computer kiosks in places outside of traditional school settings, beginning with a computer and touchpad built into a wall of a slum in New Delhi. A video camera was strategically located nearby to record what residents would do without instruction and guidance. In less than a year, children experimented with the equipment and, despite having little formal education or technological training, taught themselves how to use the mouse, surf the Net, download multimedia off the internet, and navigate basic programs. Today HiMEL is run as a joint venture between NIIT and the International Finance Corporation and has expanded to numerous countries that historically have failed to offer adequate educational opportunities for learners in underserved areas. While the program is popular among international development circles, Dr. Payal Arora came across two locations in India where the Hole-in-the-Wall project had come to a grinding halt.  
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
After eight months of ethnographic research, including in-depth conversations with local residents, Arora discovered that the computer learning kiosk in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almora">Almora</a> was vandalized within a few months of its installation. Residents who remembered the initiative (of which there were few) felt that the New Delhi office that orchestrated the project spent too much money on the computers and not enough on their upkeep. The local watchman had been entrusted to take care of the kiosk, even though he was not paid for this responsibility. Another teacher blamed the demise of the project on lack of computer instruction for a population that was predominately computer illiterate. She also complained that even after the program ended, the township continued to get bills for it. 
<p>
Teachers in the small town of <a href=http://www.maplandia.com/india/uttar-pradesh/almora/hawalbagh "> Hawalbagh </a> complained that the youth who visited the Hole-in-the-Wall computer kiosk typically ‘just played around.’ The caretaker, who had been employed by HiWEL but not financially compensated to maintain the equipment, reported that for the first few years, students often utilized the computers in an independent and proactive way. However, he felt the project fell apart when the power got cut after several months of not paying the electricity bill. He reportedly encouraged the New Delhi HiWEL office to pay, but they never got back to him. To ensure the computers were not damaged, he stored the computers in a locked room. When the researcher reported her findings to the team at the HiWEL New Delhi office, they responded that it had always been their expectation that the community would take responsibility for the Learning Station, a necessity to ensure community empowerment. 
<p>
Logistically we know what happened. But Arora takes her research one step further and postulates that the demise of its implementation in these two locations had to do with the program’s conundrum of embracing an ideology of learning that is free from the restraints of traditional educational institutions. But this institutional freedom unintentionally spiraled to a "free fall." Missing were the necessary social and institutional supports to ensure the project was sustainable and that it maximized learning opportunities. Arora can’t help but ask if the outcome of the kiosks would have been different if there had been more structured mediation. 
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
HiWEL is an important experiment with much potential to overcome the institutional roadblocks that can deter self-directed learning. In theory, it embraces the notion that learning can happen anywhere, anytime, and can break free of the confines of the traditional education system. But as the program evolves from an experimental idea to a more institutionalized project, this study recommends more structured processes in terms of implementation, as well as "more formal means of teaching and learning into its informal spaces…" This inevitably entails educating the educators about the values of the program so that they will be well equipped to foster autonomous learning.
