          <p>
            A quick note about a project that's finally come to fruition: the newsletter feature of the library website has finally been put into action. Thanks to Lin, Kim, Hugo, and Anthony for all their effort on this project.

What has been accomplished? More than you might think:<!--break-->

1) A process has been established so that any group in the library could conceivably take over the operation of the newsletter--it's driven by adding articles in contentworks.

2) A new page on the library website ("Newsletter") serves as a single point for seeing highlighted news (also on the Homepage), news we want to push to the front (like schedules and advertisements for services), and the news archive.

3) A content section runs down the right column... for now there are small images of the Service Cards, but this space may be better utilized with other visual content in the future.

4) An email version of the newsletter will be sent to the TC community. This summarizes new content and provides links to the website.

Although it looks simple enough, there were several alternate strategies that didn't make it to the final version... for example, brief news items originally envisioned in the email version of the newsletter will not make the cut. Also, content such as movies will need to be embedded in articles. Overall, designs that diverged from the existing library news articles were set aside because they seemed to add "clutter" to the website.

Hopefully this service will function as a quick and easy way for people to see what's going on at the library.
