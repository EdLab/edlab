<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-shapes-lumio-geometry/id658791693?mt=8">Dragon Shapes</a> is an app from <a href="http://www.lumiokids.com/about.html">Lumio Kids</a>, a company dedicated to creating educational apps for children aged 6-9. Dragon Shapes is a geometry challenge, in which players must arrange a given group of shapes into one large shape, without any overlaps or spaces. The challenges increase in difficulty and push users to think critically as they rotate the puzzle pieces and determine how to align them to advance to the next level.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The app is simple to use, and offers hints that the player can use if he or she gets stuck on a particular task. The app provides geometry facts that are relevant to the current shape so that kids can learn terms as they work through patterns. For example, the message "hexagons have 6 sides" may appear if the shape the player is working on is six-sided, to familiarize them with terminology. Each level is timed so that parents and teachers can see how long it took their child to solve particular challenges, which may be helpful to identify shapes they are having trouble with. Children can pause the app if they want to stop in the middle of a level without losing time. Finally, If players solve challenges without using too many hints, they receive "scrolls" within the game which allow them to uncover the legend of the Dragon Shapes, providing them with extra incentive to succeed.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are not many downsides to this app. The hints pop up rather quickly, which may make some users feel rushed. Other than that, this is a solid app with good gameplay and clear goals.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>This app is a great way to engage children with geometry. This app feels just like a fun puzzle game that invites kids to apply their knowledge of shapes. It could seamlessly fit into a classroom curriculum, providing students with some "play time" while actually challenging them and deepening their learning through the use of technology. </p>
