<p><a href="https://storytoys.com/apps/hungry-caterpillar-ar/">My Very Hungry Caterpillar AR</a> is an adaption of Eric Carle’s famous book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Designers used the author’s work to create an AR experience that encourages children to learn and explore alongside their own hungry caterpillar. It costs $2.99.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>My Very Hungry Caterpillar does an excellent job of paying homage to Eric Carle’s beloved illustrations through its beautiful, whimsical design. It is always refreshing to see AR that both has high production value and is used with purpose. The app lets you explore and interact with the AR world while it adjusts to the real world, detecting perimeters of the space you’re in (such as desk ledges). If you ignore him, your caterpillar will even follow you as you move your device out of the AR play area.</p>

<p>This app didn’t feel like a replacement for Carle’s book, which I appreciated. Though you act out the classic story by feeding your caterpillar the same food on each day of its journey towards becoming a butterfly, the additional activities in My Very Hungry Caterpillar make it a more personalized experience that can either be used alongside the text as it’s read, or as a completely separate activity.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are a few missed opportunities for further learning in My Very Hungry Caterpillar. While the user does gain a basic understanding of a butterfly’s life cycle, I think the app could have highlighted the caterpillar’s natural environment and other animals in a more meaningful way. While the Grouchy Ladybug makes an appearance, and fish swim in the pond, adding a clear purpose for both, or adding other characters a caterpillar might interact with, would be a nice way to expand the app’s educational merit.</p>
 
<p>While I enjoyed all of the elements of this app, there could have been even more opportunities to explore and engage in the AR world. With additional interactive components, there would be inspiration to stay with the app longer.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Though it could be strengthened by additional learning opportunities, My Hungry Caterpillar AR is a beautiful, fun app that does justice to Eric Carle’s original story.</p>
