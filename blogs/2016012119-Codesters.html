<p>In September, New York City’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/nyregion/de-blasio-to-announce-10-year-deadline-to-offer-computer-science-to-all-students.html">Mayor Bill de Blasio announced</a> that in 10 years, every public school in the city will have to offer computer science as a course option to its students. This will be a giant undertaking with companies and organizations everywhere scrambling to help meet this need. <a href="https://www.codesters.com">Codesters</a> is one such company, offering an online platform for students to learn Python, a popular coding language.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Coding is no easy feat, and starting from scratch (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">no pun intended</a>) can be overwhelming to say the least. But Codesters’ approach is rooted in creating and tinkering with coded games, allowing students to play games that others have created, and enabling them to go back and tweak the game to their liking through modifying the code. For example, they can change the Brick Breaker game by altering the number of rows of bricks, but only by fiddling with the Python code behind it. Codesters also makes learning easier by providing a drag-and-drop option, where students can select from a sidebar of text and shapes, then drag it on their workspace with the accompanying code.</p>

<p>One of Codesters’ biggest advantages, however, is its array of developed curriculum and lessons that come with appropriate assessments. Teachers can also track student progress and incorporate coding into Common Core-based math.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although the Codesters platform is free for teachers, students, and individual learners, curriculum has to be purchased through the company. Prices range from $5 to $30 per student per year for curriculum, which means teachers and administrators who do not have the resources or means to create their own computer science curriculum will have to find the money instead. Beginners might also have a tough time moving from the drag-and-drop stage to coming up with their own code, so students will have to be patient and put in a lot of time to progress in their coding abilities. As a result, much of this valuable platform’s promise may not be fully realized.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Codesters provides students, teachers, and administrators with an accessible and easy-to-use platform for bringing computer programming into schools. Not only is the interface intuitive and kid-friendly, but the company has also made an explicit effort to provide helpful curriculum and assessment tools—essentials in any classroom—in order to make coding in classrooms a reality.</p>
