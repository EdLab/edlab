<p>Disabilities are as unique as the people coping with them. Dillan is a courageous teen living with autism. He has always had difficulties communicating; sometimes Dillan would cry in frustration due to his inability to speak. His silence was often misinterpreted as lack of intelligence, but that just wasn’t true. Dillan’s mind has always been awhirl with fanciful ideas, he just has had problems sharing them with others. </p>

<p>This Vialogue shares the struggle that Dillan and his loved ones face as he begins to find his voice courtesy of an iPad. Dillan's touching story of redemption speaks to the awesome potential of electronic devices to help people surpass disability and achieve life-altering transcendence. </p>

Share suggestions for helping youth cope with disabilities by incorporating technology into their lives in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/28784">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><b>@03:12 saraehardman:</b> [Tech] can often provide a platform for communicating. Typing, drawing, and searching for pictures on an iPad or computer are all simple tools that can make a huge difference. </p>
