Sumesh co-founded <a href="https://www.boardinfinity.com/">Board Infinity</a>, a full-stack career platform aimed at increasing interaction between academia and industry. He holds an MBA from SPJain Mumbai and previously worked as a senior consultant in PwC US Advisory. He has worked with Fortune 500 clients delivering multiple engagements focused on post-merger integration projects, cost-reduction exercises, people and organization, program management, market assessments, and supply chain strategy. Outside of work, he writes about education, psychology, and finance. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Board Infinity?</b><br> 
<p>As a management consultant who worked with technology and higher education clients, my job entailed making data-driven decisions on a daily basis. I sensed a huge opportunity in the career tech space during my research on the education sector. Decision-making in careers is very random; yet at the same time, this is the area where an individual spends 75% of their lifetime. It is thus important to invest time in making informed decisions and understanding the paths to different job roles. For example, in management jobs, there are 35 sectors, 40 roles, and 10,000+ companies hiring just in India. When my co-founder Abhay and I teamed up, we thought we could marry data-driven decision making and career outcomes together. That was the genesis of Board Infinity. </p>

<p><b>What has been the response to Board Infinity from academia and the industry?</b><br> 
<p>Board Infinity has been accepted widely by both academia and industry. 75,000+ job seekers from top and growing institutions access the platform. More than 50+ industry clients actively hire through our platform.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I will focus on learning in higher education. Outcome-oriented platforms are going to win the higher education space. For example, bootcamps and last mile training platforms. Usage of more data, content unbundling, and more career development-oriented platforms will drive growth in the higher education industry in the next decade.</p>

<p><b>What, if any, are future plans for Board Infinity?</b><br>
<p>Building the world's first AI career coach and owning individual career outcomes.</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
