Article Review
Feature/Hollywood films such as Forrest Gump have shaped students' historical understanding (Wineburg, 2001)*, though not always in a desirable and positive way. Therefore, how teachers use films in classrooms and how students view and learn from them has become important research topics in the field of education. In this paper, Marcus, Paxton, and Meyerson (2006) presented two exploratory studies in this regard. The first study explored teachers' practices with films in social studies classes and students' learning through a qualitative study (interviews, classroom observations and class materials) of two high school history classrooms. The second study, through a controlled experiment, investigated how students' historical problem solving performance was mediated by watching selected movie excerpts.

Findings from the first study reveal that while students claimed that feature films were a less trustworthy source of history in comparison with teachers, textbooks and documentary films, they still used information learned from these films in other class activities (e.g. essay), which was an indication that the film is viewed as a valid historical source. This contradiction might have been attributed by teachers' practices with film-based instruction: teachers in this case did not provide space and guidance in their teaching for students to critically examine these visual materials. Findings from the second study confirm this inconsistency in students' perceptions of film as a history source. Authors admitted in this paper that how films mediate students' historical understanding is a complicated research question, and many confounding factors might have contributed to students' historical understanding. However, these two exploratory studies lay the ground for future research in this area.


EdLab Connections
Film is a double-sided sword for social studies educators. While it helps to catch students' attention on selected topics, students' historical understanding might be shaped in the wrong direction without proper investigations and discussions of these powerful visual materials in the classrooms. Developing supplementary online resources for various video projects at EdLab is a necessary step, though not sufficient, to provide both educators and students better learning experiences with films and videos in the classrooms.
