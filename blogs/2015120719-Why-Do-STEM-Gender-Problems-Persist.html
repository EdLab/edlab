<p>There is much to celebrate regarding successful efforts to bridge the gender gap in education. Due to years of research and reform, there is near gender parity in math performance and across general educational attainment as a whole. Unfortunately, despite focused attention on the gender gap in science and technology education, women pursue STEM degrees at significantly lower rates than their male counterparts. A recent study examines the role of high school contexts on girls’ plans to major in STEM fields. The researchers argue that widely shared beliefs concerning gender shape the local environment of schools resulting in gender-specific formation of academic study plans. </p>
 
<p>First, the study uses data from the National Education Longitudinal Study to demonstrate between-school variations in attracting students to STEM. The study estimates the effects of two concrete characteristics of high school on STEM plans—the school's STEM curriculum and its gender segregation in extracurricular activities. The study reveals that these two factors have a substantial impact on plans to major in STEM, either promoting or impeding academic planning depending on gender. </p>
 
<p>And second, the study also demonstrates larger variations in the abilities of different schools to attract students to STEM at the narrower institutional level. For example, if a school supports STEM orientation programs for girls, the gender gap is reduced by 25%. However, despite this impact, a large gender gap still remains. The researchers believe multiple factors contribute to this problem. They include individual characteristics, school characteristics, school curricula, extracurricular activities, as well as broader beliefs regarding the relationship between gender and majoring in science and engineering across society as a whole.</p>
 
<p>The authors propose concrete interventions to address the gender gap in STEM education. For example, school-specific interventions—like providing more intensive science curricula, minimizing gender-based segregation in extracurricular activities, providing access to above-average teachers, and expanding outreach programs—help to narrow gender differentials across subjects. Only by working on multiple fronts and by being vigilant against the dispiriting impacts of gender stereotyping, will we be able to narrow the long-lasting gender gap in STEM. </p>
