<p>You’d love to learn Programming with Python, Strategic Management and Innovation, and Modern Psychology, and… Buddhism—so why not sign up for some online classes? You imagine yourself spending an extra few hours a week enjoying those classes from the comfort of your couch, instead of another Orange is the New Black rerun; or at the very least have access to these materials if something comes up. If that’s you, you’re at the center of a debate over the meaning and value of online course completion. Online learning platforms have established themselves as a common medium, but the nature of the learning experience is a subject of considerable study. A frequent concern is the low completion rate: if few students complete the courses, what kind of learning experiences are they having? This study investigates the user motivation and completion for one online course to test some theories on what’s happening when users sign up and never finish. </p>
 
<p>The authors developed a survey of motivational factors ranging from mastery goals to beliefs about one’s ability to finish a course, and reasons for enrollment ranging from learning specific content to accessing expertise from a prestigious university. The researchers found that students motivated by the content were more likely to complete the course than students motivated by factors related to trying out online courses as a learning medium. This makes sense considering our scenario above. Perhaps you were just curious to see what a class was about, or were seduced by the ease and low-risk of signing up compared to the endless bureaucratic tape and costs of university registration, only to find that the demands of life prevented you from getting around to watching all the videos or doing all the assessments. That’s fine—so long as when course completion is used to describe online learning platforms, it’s understood that completion might not be a driving goal for many students. </p>
 
<p>Contrary to the researchers’ expectations, completers and non-completers had similar mastery goals and beliefs in their ability to complete the course. This is surprising at first, but it also makes sense once you consider the self-selective nature of seeking out or stumbling across a class on a topic that interests you to begin with. The only indicator that correlated to completion rate was a student’s self-rating on whether or not they were likely to complete the course. Again, matters of casual interest or curiosity versus career or class credit goals affect whether or not course completion is an objective at all for learners. Furthermore, traditional "completion" doesn’t account for users who bookmark materials for future use or achieve learning goals through selective parts of the course. </p>
 
<p>For many users, crossing the finish line is not the primary goal. Instead, these findings on the relationship between motivation and completion can start a conversation about what type of learning experiences online courses offer different learners, and how to establish meaningful measures of success along those objectives to enhance the learning experience. Another important consideration for future research, as the authors admit, is that this study only evaluated the motivation of students in a single course on Big Data in Education. Similar studies of students in introductory courses and courses in different disciplines would help determine whether these findings are generalizable.  </p>
