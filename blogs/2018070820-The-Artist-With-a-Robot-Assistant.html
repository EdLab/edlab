<p>Barnaby Furnas goes to his New York studio each day and paints like any artist, except for one small detail: he uses a robot to help his process. Created by art and engineering company <a href="https://www.artmatr.co">Artmatr</a>, Barnaby’s artistic assistant is named Sozo, which means <i>imagination</i> or <i>creation</i> in Japanese. With its paintbrush tip, Sozo marks the canvas according to Barnaby’s instructions, either filling in patches of paint or drawing new lines. Barnaby says this provides him with more security as an artist because Sozo can help correct mistakes, or avoid them altogether.</p>

<p>Barnaby works with Sozo at one of Artmatr’s New York studios, where artists and engineers regularly come together to rethink art in the era of digital technology. They consider their studio space an art and technology playground, and use it to play with new ideas to reimagine one of the oldest and least high-tech art forms: painting.</p>

<p>Will Sozo become a common tool for artists? How do you think art is changing in the digital revolution? Join the conversation <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/43943">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:35 Melanie Hering:</b> I feel like because the artist here is still the human, an individual who is directing the robot to create the art in a specific way, this shouldn't be too controversial. The robot is following very specific instructions and is acting more as a tool at the artist's disposal. I would be more skeptical if the robot was left to its own devices.</p>

<p><b>@01:40 Ryan Allen:</b> I don't really understand what this is or what this is for. It seems the "robot" is following the movement of the artists. Does that mean it's not really a robot and more of just a tool? Like, would we call a crane or a tractor a robot? This just seems really gimmicky in general.</p>
