            I just received an email from my mother this morning in which I read a fantastic short story that I just had to share with everyone.  It was poignant, timeless and well worth the read.  The  original author is unknown, but it is based on a Chinese folktale written by Demi, titled, <a title="The Empty Pot" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805082271/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0805012176&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1521T44BDVE3FBF93W79" target="_blank">The Empty Pot</a>, which I have recommended  to be added to our Children's Literature section, as I found that it was not part of our  collection. <em>The Empty Pot</em> would be a valuable resource for our TC student teachers to start  planting the seed of honesty in our future leaders nice and early (smile).

<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/07/empty-pot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11299" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/07/empty-pot-249x300.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="300" /></a>

The following interpretation of the story (which was intended for those in the business world, but can be adapted to any situation, as the lesson is really for everyone) is an affirmation for all you do-gooders out there, a recommendation to all  of the not-so-good-doers who need a morality check, and a prescription  for those of you who are straddling the moral fence. After reading, I  encourage you to engage in a little self-reflection to see how you weigh in on the ethical scale.  Are you a healthy weight? Should you place yourself on a special diet?  In order for us to engage in honest behavior, we must begin by being honest with ourselves. Enjoy!

<em>A successful business man was growing old and knew it was time to choose  a successor to take over the business. Instead of choosing one of his  directors or his children, he decided to do something different.</em>

<em>He called all the young executives in his company together.</em>

<em>“It is time for me to step down and choose the next CEO," he said; "I have decided to choose one of you.”</em>

<em>The young executives were shocked, but the boss continued.</em>

<em>“I  am going to give each one of you a seed today - a very special seed. I  want you to plant the seed, water it, and come back here one year from  today with what you have grown from the seed I have given you. I will  then judge the plants that you bring, and the one I choose will be the  next CEO.”</em>

<em>One man, named Jim, was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed.</em>

<em>He went home and excitedly, told his wife the story. She helped him get a pot, soil and compost and he planted the seed.</em>

<em>Every  day, he would water it and watch to see if it had grown. After about  three weeks, some of the other executives began to talk about their  seeds and the plants that were beginning to grow. Jim kept checking his  seed, but nothing ever grew.</em>

<em>Three weeks, four weeks, five weeks  went by, still nothing. By now, others were talking about their plants,  but Jim didn’t have a plant and he felt like a failure.</em>

<em>Six  months went by - still nothing in Jim’s pot. He just knew he had killed  his seed. Everyone else had trees and tall plants, but he had nothing.  Jim didn’t say anything to his colleagues, however. He just kept  watering and fertilizing the soil - he so wanted the seed to grow.</em>

<em>A  year finally went by and all the young executives of the company  brought their plants to the CEO for inspection. Jim told his wife that  he wasn’t going to take an empty pot. But she asked him to be honest  about what happened.</em>

<em>Jim felt sick at his stomach. It was going to be the most embarrassing moment of his life, but he knew his wife was right.</em>

<em>He  took his empty pot to the board room. When Jim arrived, he was amazed  at the variety of plants grown by the other executives. They were  beautiful–in all shapes and sizes. Jim put his empty pot on the floor  and many of his colleagues laughed. A few felt sorry for him!</em>

<em>When the CEO arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted his young executives.</em>

<em>Jim just tried to hide in the back.</em>

<em>“My, what great plants, trees, and flowers you have grown”, said the CEO.</em>

<em>“Today one of you will be appointed the next CEO!”</em>

<em>All  of a sudden, the CEO spotted Jim at the back of the room with his empty  pot. He ordered the financial director to bring him to the front.</em>

<em>Jim was terrified. He thought, “The CEO knows I’m a failure! Maybe he will have me fired!”</em>

<em>When Jim got to the front, the CEO asked him what had happened to his seed.</em>

<em>Jim told him the story.</em>

<em>The  CEO asked everyone to sit down except Jim. He looked at Jim, and then  announced to the young executives, “Here is your next Chief Executive!  His name is Jim!”</em>

<em>Jim couldn’t believe it. Jim couldn’t even grow his seed. How could he be the new CEO the others said?</em>

<em>Then the CEO said, “One year ago today, I gave everyone in this room a seed.
I  told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me  today. But I gave you all boiled seeds; they were dead - it was not  possible for them to grow.</em>

<em>All of you, except Jim, have brought me trees and plants and flowers.</em>

<em>When  you found that the seed would not grow, you substituted another seed  for the one I gave you. Jim was the only one with the courage and  honesty to bring me a pot with my seed in it. Therefore, he is the one  who will be the new Chief Executive!”</em>

<em><strong>Moral:
</strong>If you plant honesty, you will reap trust
If you plant goodness, you will reap friends.
If you plant humility, you will reap greatness.
If you plant perseverance, you will reap contentment
If you plant consideration, you will reap perspective.
If you plant hard work, you will reap success.
If you plant forgiveness, you will reap reconciliation.
So, be careful what you plant now; it will determine what you will reap later.</em>
