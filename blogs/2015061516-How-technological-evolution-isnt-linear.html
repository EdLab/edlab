            The New Yorker posted an article on <a herf="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-startups-love-moleskines">Moleskine notebooks and the startups who love them</a> yesterday, and it's an interesting read. It starts out talking about how just when we think something might be obsolete (like physical, printed materials), it seems to pop up everywhere.

I won't give away the whole story, but there are some compelling reasons why hi-tech places might benefit from using low-tech solutions.

The part I think is most interesting, though, comes at the end, in a description of how Evernote uses physical materials to keep everyone in the office in the loop on their products and designs:

<i>"Before, Evernote’s design department did almost all of its work on computers, with the result that no one knew what anyone else was working on. Now staff members print out designs for both physical and digital products, which they pin to a wall that spans the length of the office. “It gives the product and software designers a new frame of reference … a physical manifestation of the brand. They get three hundred and sixty degrees of feedback that’s not just limited to how it is on a screen,” Zwerner said. “The policy is: get stuff up so it takes flight.” "</i>

I think we definitely have the potential to share things in a similar way at EdLab, once we're back on the 5th floor—especially if we end up using dividing walls in interesting ways.
<!--break-->
I've also seen really great ways of displaying information on screens—the image below of the Etsy office is hard to make out, but the screens on the left have up-to-date stats, prototypes, and other status updates to keep everyone aware of different teams' work and goals, as well as shared goals.

Still, I think there's a real charm to posting physical things and writing on walls directly, at least to get ideas out, and I think we do that really well here.
