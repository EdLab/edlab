          <p>
            My roommate's friend, who has now become my own friend as well, has been staying with me at our apartment. She is an MBA graduate... so we end up talking about business and strategy over egg tarts and onion pie. 

Here's something we recently talked about that got me thinking about how we are prioritizing our strategies around our products...

She referenced Dr. Faulkner, who wrote about <a href="http://www.differentiateyourbusiness.co.uk/competitive-and-corporate-strategy-by-cliff-bowman-and-david-faulkner" target="_blank"><i>hygiene value</i></a>, which refers to, <blockquote>"those elements of the product or service that all competitors offer. These are the standard order qualifying product or service aspects that every firm has to provide just to be a credible player in the game.”</blockquote> 

My friend described it to me in this way. At one point, no company ever used Twitter. Now you see news anchors to Tropicana orange juice sharing their Twitter handles and hashtags... And the point is, it's not "special" anymore to have a Twitter, but to NOT have Twitter becomes an oddity.

So that made me wonder... Are we on par with the hygiene factors of our tools?

Then we went on to discuss what REALLY makes the difference. And that's a motivator: 
<blockquote>“In order to win some customers, the firm needs to offer motivator value. these dimensions of perceived use value are not generally offered, and they would tend to be unique to a particular firm. These motivator values excite customers, and are the source of differentiation.” (page 4/5)</blockquote>

With hygiene value (minimum offerings) and motivator value (new offerings) in mind, it's still important to strategize how to balance what we emphasize:

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Total customer value can only be increased by increasing order winners — improving the quality of order qualifiers above the minimum standard has negligible difference.</li>
<li>Order winners become order qualifiers as competitors imitate.
</li>
<li>Activities within the business can be linked to order winners and order qualifiers. Activities for order winners need to be managed for effectiveness while activities for qualifiers need to be managed for efficiency and low cost.
</li>
<li>Order winners generate premium prices and profit. Order qualifiers at best pass on their cost to the customer and, if the activities are inefficient, reduce the profit of the business.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
