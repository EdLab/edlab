<p>How can games support formal learning environments? Do our assumptions and the words we use to describe teachers and games match up with teachersâ€™ experiences in traditional classrooms? It is obvious that there are generational, technological, and pedagogical challenges that arise between students and teachers. It is also obvious that the literature assumes games have the potential to teach the skills needed for our modern day society, such as collaboration, systems thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. The teacher in a traditional classroom is both mediating challenges and designing learning experiences, game related or otherwise. Given these ideas, what is the reality teachers face in their classrooms when they incorporate games?</p>

<p>The researchers looked at a group of primary school teachers in Singapore who use digital games in their classroom. They first explored use of the word "designer" in education; do teachers view themselves as designers? They also considered the reality and value of incorporating games into traditional classrooms. These two inquiries overlap in a small number of cases where teachers are invited to either give feedback on educational game designs or actively help design educational games. The researchers conclude that the term "designer" does not sufficiently and fully capture the work of the teacher. Furthermore, the researchers conclude that there are many realities of implementing games in the classroom and many questions about the sustainability of game programs.</p>

<p>Games introduce practical problems for teaches who are working within a formal curriculum. These can range from technical difficulties to pedagogical challenges to differences between the school and home. Parents, for example, may see games as outside the scope of the school. At home, playing a game on the computer could be seen as anti-social and the invisibility of the teacher during game-playing at school leads parents to ask whether learning is actually happening. Even for the teachers, the various levels of engagement and the actual skill development of each student are difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, the researchers are hopeful about the agency of teachers to form new learning experiences and the potential for games to contribute positively to that process. The researchers push for greater clarity around terms and more focus on the experience of teachers in future game designs. </p>
