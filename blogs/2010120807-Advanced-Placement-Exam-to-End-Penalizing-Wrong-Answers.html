          <p>
            During a brief class discussion about the format of the Advanced Placement (AP) test, a student revealed the College Board was <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/08/10/guess">ending</a> its long scoring policy of penalizing pupils for a wrong answer on the exam. This news came not only as a surprise to me and my fellow classmates but also to our instructor. It turns out the decision was announced during the summer months and as applicable to all upcoming tests, most of which will be in May 2011.
 
The former AP exam scoring method deducted a Â¼ of a point for every question answered wrong, resulting in an altered final grade. For example, if a student answers 6/10 right, their score becomes 50% instead of 60%. As I was sitting there, I pondered how fortunate I was to be a part of the first class of students in the nation whom this scoring methodology would apply to. Natural intuition also made we wonder why the College Board decided to make amends to its scoring after nearly a half century of the old method.
 
With all this being said, the decision to eliminate this method is part of a broader reform of the AP program according the College Board hierarchy. The official reason as to why students were penalized for a wrong answer was that it was a way to discourage guessing. Since each multiple-choice question corresponds with 5 choices, the probability of a student guessing is higher compared to the standard 4 choices widely used in non-AP courses. Also they wanted every question to reflect a student's knowledge of a particular subject. My personal view of this penalty is that guessing should be allowed because most test takers that guess are mostly on the right track and constantly have mind battles about which answer to choose. This is especially evident in a college level class where the answer is not always clear and requires further analysis.
 
 
Ever since its introduction, the old scoring method has always been the subject of much criticism since the methodology negatively affects students' scores.  There are certain students who have failed the test mainly because of this methodology. Having knowledge that you'll be penalized for a wrong answer creates anxiety for students who know that points will be deducted for a wrong answer, which in turn affects their final, or deserved grade. It is notable that this change is going to be applied to only AP tests and not the SATs. It's quite bewildering as to why they would eliminate it for AP tests and not SATs. The argument about how it negatively affects students taking the AP exam is certainly applicable to those taking the SATs. One might even argue that it affects students taking the SAT more since there is a higher importance placed on SATs.

In all, I am pleased and feel lucky that this method has been eliminated from the AP tests especially since this would be my first year taking the exam. It sure will quell some nerves that I am having about the test, which in turn helps me feel a little more comfortable knowing that I won't be penalized.
