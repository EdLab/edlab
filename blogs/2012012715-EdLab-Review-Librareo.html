            <a href="http://blog.gale.com/librareo/information/" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/Screenshot2012-01-27at30342PM-1.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

<a href="http://blog.gale.com/librareo/information/">Librareo</a> is a collaboration between the publisher <a href="http://www.gale.cengage.com/">Gale Cengage</a> and <a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/">Library Journal</a> aimed at creating a community of library students. The site has been around for a couple of months, but the launch was relatively soft and it doesn't seem to be attracting many users at this point. 

<b>Pros:</b> 
The low participation is not for lack of content. Free registration scores library students access to community features, a suite of Gale databases full of useful articles and e-books, and a year subscription to either Library Journal or School Library Journal. Stephen Abram of <a href="http://stephenslighthouse.com/">Stephen's Lighthouse</a> is also featured in the forums and the level of interaction and engagement seems very robust. The marketing seems to be expanding through targeted ads on library blogs and the Library Journal website. 

<b>Cons:</b> 
The name is rather strange. Gale formerly ran a video contest under the handle Librareo (Library + Video?) which has morphed into the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=library_love&search=tag">“I Love My Library”</a> contest to make room for the new network. They might be fixing for some integration in the future. The Gale integration is a little distracting, but at least it's made abundantly clear that this is a Gale product. The site might look and run more cleanly without it, but it's admirably overt for a vendor spiel. The forums could use a little more moderation too, there's some pretty clear spam. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
Librareo may fill a niche in the library student community for protected discussion, but it's going to need constant staffing to be successful. Drudging the library community for volunteers through LJ might work and it might become a more integral platform if it serves as a way to connect working librarians and library students in confidence, like Ednode. It's an interesting example of an attempt to build a network from scratch. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
Librareo has potential, but it may not be the kind of potential they're currently after.
