<p>Mari Kilpeläinen is the founder and CEO of Keeduu, a Finnish edtech company that created an app that combines textbooks, educational videos, games, and assignments. Kilpeläinen has also worked as a classroom teacher for the past decade, as well as a vice principal and principal in the School of Eastern Finland, a language school specializing in Russian. Keeduu was voted as one of the best learning solutions in the eEemeli E-learning solution contest. Kilpeläinen holds a masters in education from the University of Eastern Finland. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role at Keeduu?</b><br>
<p>I have a masters degree in education and also focused on computer aided learning. I worked 15 years as a teacher and four years as a vice principal and also as a principal in a primary and secondary school. The school where I work is a language school with many immigrants and we teach Russian and Finnish. As such, we have to find new ways to teach them. </p>

<p>About four years ago, I had to lead a project in my school in Finland. We started to teach with tablets and trained teachers to use more mobile devices and computers. All our classes went mobile and there were a lot of challenges (e.g., teacher ICT-skills, internet connections, rules and regulations on how to deal with tablets). I realized schools and teachers need a solution that is easy to use and everything in the lesson is in the same place. The material and apps available are scattered on the internet. I wanted to create an all in one solution that also motivates students. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Keeduu will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Learning games are mostly considered as repetition based. I want to create new ways to think about learning games. They can actually be entertaining and based in problem-solving. In games, it is possible to practice things we are not able to practice in normal life (e.g., flying). I think learning is a two-way path. First, you have to improve cognition, find the answers, reshape your structure in the head, and then you have to practice to gain the skill. After that, you can say you know or you can do something. People learn differently. That´s why pupils should have an opportunity to choose their ways of learning and forms of content they have to learn. They have to learn same things but they can follow different paths to get there (e.g., videos, games, and peer support). I hope digitalization, the integration of digital technology into daily life, gives everybody the possibility to learn more efficiently and a style which is suitable for them. Games, social media, and YouTube are not just entertainment, they are new ways to learn things and we have to utilize that. Keeduu is just an example of digitalization and new pedagogy. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>People learn more from their peers. It is very important to teach kids what is high-quality information because nowadays everybody has a voice. Blended learning is a way of learning. Inquiry and phenomenon-based learning are important ways to practice problem solving but without practice and repetition you can't gain skills. You have to have both. Different virtual worlds will help people learn and practice new things and they will become more common. For example, the military already uses war games to allow their soldiers to practice in different circumstances. </p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Keeduu, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I´m currently working as a principal in language school. I’m developing Keeduu further and my next big project is dealing with interactive videos.</p>
