Doing things <b>in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud</a> </b> has become a popular technological term these days, but this is something most people have been doing for many years now. It currently became very popular courtesy of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>  and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> . Working in the cloud is simply the ability to store and share resources and software through the internet without the need for physical storage. <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>  is a good  example of a company that lets its users work in the cloud through their Google Doc application. More interestingly for STEM educators, Google has a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/stemcollaboration/">website</a>  specifically designed to help STEM educators with the resources they need to have their students collaborate in the cloud.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> How will collaborating in the cloud going to improve the future of STEM? Students already collaborate on a host of projects in the classroom, why do they need computers to collaborate? When exploring technologies that you believe would improve STEM classrooms, it's always good to ask yourself these types of questions. After all, just because an educator is using a new type of technology, it doesn't necessarily mean it help students learn any better than doing things the traditional way. So how will collaborating in the cloud improve STEM education? Well one good reason is that it will allow students to work together on a project after school, and from the comfort of their homes. It's important to teach student to not only collaborate in the classroom, but outside of the classroom and in the real world as well. People with STEM careers often work in teams, so getting students into the habit of collaborating in and out of the classroom will better prepare them for the real-STEM-world. Let's keep collaborating, everyone.
