            The result of a thinking exercise as I bought my groceries (mmmm potatoes!).  It was really for technologies in general (perhaps operating systems), but to keep the example clean, we'll pretend we're selecting laptops.  How does this sound?

Incentives:
<ol>
<li>Experiment with new technology!</li>
<li>Free lunch once a week for 10 weeks!</li>
</ol>

Guidelines:
<ol>
<li>You will not have the same machine every week.  You could get the same model (there will be 2 or more of each), but not the same psychical machine.  It is important to understand that nothing you do in the rest of the events can alter this.  This means you would be benefited by saving all files to a network share (something we should get in the habit of anyway).</li>
<li>During bidding rounds, you cannot bid more than half of your remaining credits on a single machine.</li>
</ol>

And now, the game:

Anyone in the library will be free to sign up so long as they find the incentives enticing and the guidelines reasonable.  Once signup's are over, process will close and a group of non-participants familiar with technology will choose a set of 5-10 different laptops to be evaluated.  These machines much meet library standards in terms of cost and any other restrictions, i.e. they are machines which could actually be purchased on a large scale if desired.  Two or more will be purchased of each model (it is critical that there are at least two) depending on the number of participants. 

Once the machines arrive, each participants will be given 10,000 credits.  Each week,  participants will bid on the machines (in such a way to guarantee exactly one machine win per person), spending no more than half of their remaining credits.  At the end of the bidding round, participants will be taken to lunch while machines are swapped in and out to replace current machines with those won during the bidding round.  At the end of 10 weeks, the best machine is the one which the market appraised at the highest value.

This process of letting the market decide could be used for circulation machines as well.
