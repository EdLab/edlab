<p>In the <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/gamification-game-based-learning-unit-andrew-miller">rush to "gamify" lessons</a> to make content more interesting for students, it can seem like everything has to be a game just to be engaging and effective. However, a recent study comparing two different interventions—one game-based, the other non-game-based—showed that they were both effective in increasing student learning, but neither one was more effective than the other.</p>
 
<p>The study focused specifically on high school students, who were split into two main groups. The first group was given a game-based intervention called "Mission Biotech," a 3D virtual reality game where the player acts as a biotech researcher studying a viral outbreak. The second group underwent a nongame-based intervention called "Viral Quest," which was a narrative approach to learning about tracking a viral disease. These students still conducted simulations when the corresponding practice came up in the narrative, but they were not playing an overarching game.</p>
 
<p>The authors of this study observed that both interventions supported student learning, especially with respect to Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) principles like solving complex problems. They also found that the game benefited students with lower levels of interest and performance in science more than those at higher levels. This happened despite the fact that some teachers expected the game to be too complicated for these students. This could have potential implications for using game-based learning for students with less interest or lower levels of academic performance in science.</p>
 
<p>However, the researchers also found that there was not a statistically significant difference in learning gains between the game-based and nongame-based interventions. Despite the fact that many studies show significant benefits of using video games for educational purposes, teachers and administrators may want to weigh the costs of investing in such typically expensive games. After all, if going low-tech can still spark the same interest as a pricey game, perhaps the money saved can be put to better use elsewhere in the school.</p>
