            A BusinessWeek reader of a blogging titled <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/business_at_work/business_entrepreneur/archives/2008/06/ entrepreneurshi.html">Entrepreneurship as America's Greatest Export</a> comments on jobs; the failings of higher ed; and The American Way:

The purpose of higher ed is to prepare entrepreneurs:

"I am so glad this article was made. My father was able to run a household with 8 kids, a stay-at-home wife and no mortgage...on Long Island! Plus I got to see him much more since he worked from home. Because my father chose to be in business for himself and give up the rat-race-status-quo-job, our quality of life has always been great. People come here to America for opportunity, not to sell their soul to a job..they can do that much more easier outside of this country since that's where all the jobs are anyways. I'm 24 and "retired" thanks to my father's example. If America is to survive the current economy, it needs to go back to its roots and fess up that a job is suppose to be ONLY be a stepping stone to then run your own company. Colleges have become just overpriced cubical-slave factories instead of being an asset to society. Observe this when most students are there since their parents just want bragging rights and they have no clue what to do nor do they even get a job in what they studied. This lack of the entrepreneurial spirit we've had up till now is what created the society of overworked, fat Americans instead of dreamers and trail blazers like we used to be."
