<p>Nowadays classrooms are filled with laptops and iPads, but that trend might change as a tech company just released a new set of smooth, sleek, black notebooks. Not just another laptop, Montblanc’s journal is the notebook of the future, complete with paper and pen. However, this paper is augmented in that you can write down notes and transfer them to any digital device.</p>
 
<p>Many students claim that their memory is enhanced or their writing flows more freely when they do it by hand. However, written notes get lost, and very few professors or publishers accept handwritten submissions. With the value of handwriting lessons covering topics like cursive under attack, it is no surprise that students who are dependent on writing might find themselves at a disadvantage. That is why the Montblanc synthesis of technology and traditional writing is a welcome answer for those who value writing on paper. The pen is coded so that when pressure is exerted on paper, letters can be identified and transferred to other devices. Though the Montblanc notebook is currently marketed as a luxury item, future classrooms could include this type of paper for everyday use.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/cursive-obsolete-writing-may-be-wall/">Experts have cited</a> increased creativity, memory, comprehension, and literacy as handwriting’s benefits. However, others have rebutted the idea. They note that script enthusiasts’ panic about advancements in technology have been overblown since the introduction of the typewriter. What are your thoughts on augmented paper? Are you a fan of handwriting? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/32383/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:08 saraehardman:</b> There's a lot of emphasis on the ability to share something across a digital platform right now, and this technology will finally allow handwriting with pen and paper to be part of that process. This could give teachers new ways to develop handwriting curriculum in their classrooms, and it could also give students who prefer handwriting their notes an easier way to share them across platforms.</p>
 
<p><b>@00:46 RuthS:</b>There are already ways to sync your phone, tablet, and computer, and this new tech throws paper into the loop, as well. This is an incredibly useful tool for anyone who takes notes by hand. It's tech like this that will save handwriting and paper.</p>
