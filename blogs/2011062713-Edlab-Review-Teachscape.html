Teachscape Higher Education offers online Masters degree programs in education, and courses in continuing education.   They have partnered with Marygrove college to provide a Masters in the Art of Teaching, and with Cardinal Stritch University to offer a Masters in Education.  All of the coursework is done through their online program, including readings, video instruction, and learning activities (both solo and collaborative). Once you sign up, Teachscape will also send you printed materials of the required reading, and CD to set up the program. All of the work, however, can be completed online, by emailing assignments and exams to an assigned grader.

<b>Pros</b>:  
The website and its resources load smoothly, and don't require a lot of extra downloads or futzing with the computer to get running.  Teachscape has done a great deal of work to get the entire learning experience online.  The videos are fairly comprehensive, and will contain both examples of real-life applications of the material and expert instruction. To enable the group work that is an essential component of the learning material, Teachscape has also set up a fairly basic internal forum, in which participation is required.

<b>Cons</b>: 
Navigating the various resources of a lesson seems somewhat unintuitive and clunky. Although I have no experience in the relevant fields, from what I can see of the work required the courses are not particularly rigorous.  Furthermore the student is given a year to complete a course, although Teachscape itself estimates that each course (including coursework and readings) will take around 40 hours.  The role of the mentor also seems somewhat circumscribed.  The only feedback the student will receive is his or her grade report, along with a transcript (for which there may be a fee).  

<b>Edlab Relevance</b>:
Along with the rest of Edlab, I'm excited about the possibilities of online learning.  And perhaps it's inevitable that the first attempts will feel primitive.  But I don't find this to be a satisfactory program, particularly due to the lack of a “human” element.  One can run through the exercises and the videos, but to me the work feels somewhat perfunctory.  Even the group discussion elements seem artificial.  Perhaps a program like Ednode can help create stronger learning ties both within a student group and between students and teachers, which will also help motivate the learner to take the work more seriously. 

<b>Our Takeaway</b>:
Although it's a valiant first effort, the educational programs offered by Teachscape, at least as is apparent from the sample courses offered, are unsatisfactory vehicles for higher education learning.
