<p>The artist Teek Mach spends 8–10 hours each day immersed in virtual reality (VR), creating virtual pieces of art. Trained in painting, Teek’s life changed when she first tried <a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com">Tilt Brush</a>, Google’s VR painting app. "It’s like talking about love," she says. "You have to experience it to fully understand it." Tilt Brush allows you to create 3D paintings that more closely resemble an immersive environment than a framed piece. For Teek, this space gives her the opportunity to create worlds unbound by physical laws, but only by her own imagination.</p>

<p>While Teek uses VR as her main artistic medium now, she is not the only artist to do so. In fact, Tilt Brush has an artist in residence program, where the artist and VR designers work together to better develop the tool and explore its potential uses. VR is giving artists another way to express their ideas, and for Teek that medium has more potential than any other to fully immerse viewers into her mind. "To me, it is the real world," Teek says of VR. "It is just as valid as the physical world."</p>

<p>How do you think VR will change the future of art? Do you agree with Teek that the virtual reality world is just as real as the physical world? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/38720/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:47 Evans.Asamoah:</b> This new form of painting is drastically fascinating in addition to its capability to entertain the user. With virtual reality, art has become increasingly interesting and has allowed the artist to show more passionate in their work.</p>

<p><b>@03:41 csd2126:</b> I don't agree with this claim as VR is not currently a social technology. Big tech companies are trying to find ways to make virtual reality more social so that it can begin to connect people, but at the moment the uses of virtual reality for connecting people is quite limited.</p>
