Marjan Ghara, is the Founder and CEO of <a href=https://www.biblionasium.com/#tab/content-summer-reading >Biblionasium</a>, an award winning platforms for kids that supports the independent reading activities of children. Like a "Goodreads on steroids," it is used in classrooms and libraries to engage, excite and encourage children to read. Marjan is a technologist by training and her passion is to get kids hooked on reading.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I studied computer science and systems design and that training has been critical to everything I have done. I learned how to apply technology to solve problems. My first position was at a tech startup and my last position was at a tech startup. I love the pace and energy of startups. In between I worked at large organizations where I learned how to build large-scale websites and work in complex environments. I started Biblionasium because I had two elementary school age children and was looking for ways to encourage them to read. It made sense for me to build a digital platform that would support that mission. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
As cliché as it sounds, reading is the foundation of learning and if children cannot read properly by 4th grade, they fall behind academically. The problem compounds every year and most of the rest of their education becomes remedial. It is critical that we engage children to read early on, read often and read for pleasure. We consider reading to be like a sport and that is why we are a Biblionasium! We use our platform to encourage children to set goals, to practice, have discipline around reading and we reward them with badges for their reading activities. Most important we connect children online to the three constituents that most influence what they read: their friends, teachers and parents to create a community and conversation around reading and to change it from a solitary activity to a fun, social one. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
I love what is going on. The digital revolution and the ubiquity of digital devices, and the comfort and ease by which this generation of children interact and engage digitally, has created a great deal of opportunity. Children learn in different ways and at different pace and we should be able to use technology to deliver some of their education based on their personal learning styles and needs. I don't mean quite a personalized learning curriculum but we can do better and we are getting better at identifying who needs more help where and to be able to provide that assistance either through digital means or by a teacher.  We can also now connect kids to kids, kids to educators and kids to educational and reading content in so many ways that were not possible before. Kids in New York Skype with Kids in Bombay and they exchange book recommendations! It’s very exciting. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> 
We constantly look for feedback and are always looking for ways to improve our platform.  Currently we can generate a great deal of conversation and excitement around books and children review and recommend titles to their friends all the time. We are looking to add the option to deliver the books to them online at the point where they discover a new title or get interested in a book. It is important to close the gap between the time that there is interest and excitement around a book and when and how they can access the books. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I follow Fred Wilson (<a href="https://twitter.com/fredwilson">@fredwilson</a>) as he has great insight into the overall technology landscape. I follow Tom Vander Ark (<a href="https://twitter.com/tvanderark">@tvanderark</a>) because he is passionate about and influential in the EdTech space and follows both the policy side and the business side of education. I also follow many Educators (the boots on the ground) but particularly Shannon Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/shannonmmiller">@shannonmmiller</a>) who is a rock star Educator and on the forefront of how technology can be creatively used in the classrooms and libraries. </p>
