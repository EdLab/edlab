<p>Commercial video games were put to the test in a recent study measuring desirable skills in higher education called <i>graduate attributes</i>. While educational video games have been shown to have positive effects on students’ cognitive abilities, commercial video games are often viewed as detrimental to their success.</p>
 
<p>But a new study found that commercial video games might indeed have a positive impact on skills that will help students in both higher education and beyond. These graduate attributes include communication abilities, adaptability, and resourcefulness. Researchers recruited 100 undergraduate participants and split them evenly into a control group and a video game group. Both groups filled out a questionnaire that measured their graduate attributes based on their own self-reflection.</p>
 
<p>The video game group was instructed to come to the lab to play 14 hours of eight different video games over the span of eight weeks. The games included titles such as <i>Borderlands 2</i>, <i>Minecraft</i>, Portal 2</i>, and <i>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</i>. The students could participate on their own schedules. The control group had no additional tasks during this period of time. After eight weeks, both groups again took the same questionnaire, self-assessing the same set of graduate attributes.</p>
 
<p>The results from the questionnaires reveal that the students in the video game group scored themselves significantly higher on all three graduate attributes tested: communication, adaptability, and resourcefulness. While the students in the control group in general scored themselves slightly higher in the second test, those in the video game group scored themselves much higher in all areas.</p>
 
<p>This study demonstrates that video game playing can improve students’ perception of their graduate skills, even in a short amount of time. Because of this, the researchers suggest that video games could have a role to play in higher education. Perhaps this role could be in academic interventions or soft-skill development, or maybe it could just be supporting students to play on their own time instead of scoffing at the mention of Dark Souls. It might also be noted, however, that 14 hours of play over eight weeks is much less than steadfast gamers typically play. So while this study levels-up video game playing, for now it does so only in moderation.</p>
