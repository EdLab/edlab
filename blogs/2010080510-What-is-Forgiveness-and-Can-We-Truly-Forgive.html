          <p>
            Last month's ESPY Awards brought to light some things that we often fail to ponder unless situations arise which requires us to do so. What is the true meaning of forgiveness? Do we believe in giving a second chance to someone who has killed a close family member? The ESPYs, ESPN's now annual awards show, reward athletes from all sports for their accomplishments on the field. The ESPYs also hand out special awards, notably the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage. Past recipients of this award include soccer legend <a href="http://espn.go.com/espy2004/s/04asheaward.html">George Weah</a>, who has devoted his personal wealth and time to help his birth nation Liberia recover from years of civil strife and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Valvano">Jimmy Valvano</a>, best remembered for coaching NC State to the 1983 NCAA basketball championship and who gave perhaps the most inspiring speech in ESPYs history when he accepted his courage award while battling cancer, a battle he lost a few months later. <p>

This year's Arthur Ashe Award for Courage went to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/e60/news/story?id=5374290">family of Ed Thomas</a>, a beloved high school football coach and father who was gunned down by a former player in Parkersburg, Iowa. Thomas' family was awarded the courage award primarily for their decision to forgive the alleged shooter, Mark Becker, and their fight to have the Iowa legislature to draft a law that will require hospital personnel to notify law enforcement before releasing a psychiatric patient facing criminal charges.  <p>

The Thomas family's decision is admirable and courageous as I will personally find it hard to forgive someone for committing such an act, especially since it was unprovoked. Thomas was more than just a high school football coach, he was also an influential member of the community and served as a father figure to the hundreds of players he has coached over the years, including four current NFL players. Let's hope I am never confronted with such a dilemma.
