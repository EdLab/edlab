          <p>
            This week I attended a career development workshop hosted by the Arts &amp; Humanities Department at Teachers College. This week's topic covered on-campus interviewing preparation for doctoral students.

Dr. Christine Baron, Assistant Professor of Social Studies, and Dr. Ansley Erickson, Assistant Professor of History and Education, shared their experiences with on-campus interviewing for academic university jobs.

First, students were asked which category they fell into. The categories were:

1. I have an interview or I have a serious possibility of an interview
2. I came to earlier CDP sessions on campus interviews but want to know more
3. "CDP"? What?

Students were given the opportunity to participate in a "fishbowl" style mock interview in front of the room. Two students agreed, providing some information about the positions to which they had applied. Each student was interviewed for ~25 minutes. Students were then given candid, constructive feedback from Chris and Ansley as well as from audience members.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2017/01/interview-interviewing-on-campus-interviewing-OCI.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26284"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26284 size-medium" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2017/01/interview-interviewing-on-campus-interviewing-OCI-300x213.jpg" alt="Interview in Progress" width="300" height="213" /></a></p>
A Q&amp;A session followed. Concerns were addressed around interview planning strategies and Skype interviewing versus traditional in-person interviewing.

Suggestions for preparation ranged from how to do the necessary research beforehand to holding mock interviews with tough peers who could speak to your research. Other subjects, like comfort during interviewing, were touched upon as well. I never thought about how I like to drink my water -- but it indeed affects my concentration during a presentation or interview.

There will be a repeat A&amp;H CDP Workshop titled <strong>"Workshop: Preparing for On-Campus Interviews" on Monday, February 6th from 3:00 - 5:00PM in the library, Russell Hall Room 306</strong>. For those who attended this week (Monday, 1/23), you should only attend if you'd like to review the same materials.
