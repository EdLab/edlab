          <p>
            <p>When we talked about natural language processing (NLP) projects, the first impression comes to mind might be the geeks working on data analysis (like me?). The truth is, NLP could be the golden source and tool to fight against social challenges. When Facebook and Twitter are filled with junks like fake news, bias posts or hate crimes (referred to Dino's D&amp;R seminar about the fake news), these crowdsource information are not reliable and sometimes harmful to the society. Dr. Kathleen McKeown in Columbia University, Computer Science department, is one of the great professors working on these social challenges with the weapon of NLP. She gave an excellent talk on her research projects at Google NYC last night. My classmates in Learning Analytics program went to this meaningful event with me. I would like to share Dr. McKeown's talk with my colleagues in EdLab again. </p><p><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20170718122407-141500392999__jpg_9f72a8a7d96412396bc03985b52ad468.jpeg" style /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The talk was separated into four parts, from the perspectives of disaster descriptives, personal narratives, social media text analysis, and Chicago teenagers crime tweets. The first project, disaster descriptives, has a case study of Sandy Hurricane in 2012. Dr. McKeown's group generated domain dictionary from Wikipedia and collected real time social media tweets about Sandy, which was large scale and played out over multiple days and areas, triggered other events. They used geoinformation, text, timestamp as the sources to provide a description of the event at the magnitude with multiple timelines and areas, generating long-lasting effects and subsequent events. This disaster descriptives project was extended to cover other types of disasters such as earthquakes, terror attacks, floods, and shootings. Their group was motivated to look at the disaster related data and see what could be done to help people when disasters happen.</p><p><br /></p><p>The next two projects were about the personal narratives and social media text analysis. I think these were more focused on the NLP techniques such as the parallel investigation of the corpus from multiple languages, how to use the neural net to generate the automatic summary of the long text, sentiment analysis of social media posts, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>The last project was about predicting aggression and loss from Twitter of the gang involved youths in Chicago. Dr. McKeown's group developed a corpus of tweets from a teenage female gang member who had eight deaths to her name and her communications with other gang members. They were looking at what triggered the conversations into aggression. The gang members used slangs, strange phrases, and metaphors which were distinguished from the normal speech. Multiple NLP classifiers were used to identify the tweets that express aggression and grieving. This research would help the social workers to monitor and detect the teenagers who need helps.</p><p>This was an excellent talk demonstrated good communication with complex ideas and humanity. NLP could help address the social challenges in many approaches. We are so lucky to have so many outstanding professors in the school that we went to and worked with. </p>
