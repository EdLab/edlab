<p>Does playing video games make you a better learner? Several studies have shown that video games can actually improve cognitive functions like visual attention, cognitive control, visual short-term memory, and general processing speed, but experts have been hesitant to accept these findings due to inconsistent results. The authors of this study investigated whether the inconsistency was due to the genre of video game by testing both first-person shooter and real-time strategy "action" video games. The authors found that these different genres produced different cognitive benefits for players, but that both styles were beneficial.</p>

<p>The researchers hypothesized that videogame players would outperform non-videogame players on a variety of cognitive abilities, and video gamers who play real-time strategy (RTS) games would have better cognitive performance than those who play first person shooter (FPS) games. In order to test these ideas, the researchers assembled three groups: non-videogamers, defined as those who play less than 5 hours per week of RTS and FPS games; RTS players, consisting of those who play 7+ hours per week of RTS games; and FPS players, who play 7+ hours of FPS games per week. The groups were gender "balanced" insofar as that can be done in a group of video gamers, with 28 males and 2 females per group.</p> 

<p>The experiment revealed that RTS players perform better on task switching and multiple object tracking exercises than non-videogamers and FPS players. Both types of gamers displayed similar cognitive flexibility, but RTS players had significantly faster reaction times compared to FPS players and non-videogamers. The researchers concluded that the increased cognitive abilities of both FPS and RTS players, when compared to non-videogamers, are due to the variety and high speed demands of action based video games.</p>

<p>Does this mean that playing videogames automatically increases an individual’s cognitive abilities? Not necessarily. It is important to measure increased cognitive function in relation to the specific types of tasks required in a user’s video game and these might not translate well to the real world. Still, this study is another intriguing data point in the case for video games in learning.</p>
