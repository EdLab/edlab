<p>Reading to children has long been recognized as crucial to the development of language growth and emergent literacy skills. Child engagement during reading has been proven to have developmental benefits ranging from increased vocabulary to critical thinking. The advent of electronic literature may have changed the format of exposure children have to books, but it certainly hasn’t diminished the importance of parent-child reading. New research even suggests that ebooks may actually provide more opportunities for skill development than print books when read aloud.</p>
 
<p>While research has been conducted on the potential gains of ebook use among pre- and early readers, researchers in Toronto wanted to understand the differing effects of print versus electronic picture books on toddler learning. A study was conducted with 102 children, aged 17-26 months, in which half of the parent-child pairs were assigned two 10-page picture books in a traditional print format, and the other half were assigned the same books in ebook form.</p> 

<p>The books centered around the activity of different farm and wild animals, and afterward toddler learning was assessed through asking participants to correctly identify the animals they’d learned about from cartoon pictures, photographs, and small plastic replicas. Throughout the reading process, the researchers also observed and assessed nonverbal behavior, tactile behaviors, child language, parent language, attention, and engagement.</p>

<p>Results of the study indicated that parent-child pairs spent almost double the time reading picture books in electronic format. Parents pointed more when reading print books, which can be a distractive move for children, but toddlers pointed more when reading ebooks, which initiated direct interactions that often led to language learning. Also, children self-initiated significantly more content-related comments, made themselves significantly more available, and were overall more attentive when being read ebooks. In regards to learning, children who were read ebooks made more correct choices in identifying animals than those who were read print books.</p>
 
<p>These findings demonstrate that electronic reading is supportive of early literacy activity. Multimedia enhancements can lead to more opportunities for parent and child talk while also allowing children a greater sense of control (tapping a page to turn a book is a lot easier than physically turning pages at 17 months). Though print picture books may be favored by many traditionalists, this study makes it much harder for ebooks to be categorized as inferior.</p>
