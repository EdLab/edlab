            <strong>Leung, Louis. (2009). User-generated content on the internet: an examination of gratifications, civic engagement and psychological empowerment. <em>New Media Society, 11(8),</em> 1327-1347.</strong>

Leung's study examines the motives of people who generate content in popular Web 2.0 sites such as Blogger, Live Spaces, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Leung summarizes that people's content generating activities happen because of four primary reasons: 1) recognition needs -- a desire to be respected and build an identity -- the "uses and gratification" theory Wimmer and Dominick (1994), 2) cognitive needs (a desire to be informed and stay on top of developments) -- individual psychological empowerment (Katz, 1984; Zimmerman et al. (1992), 3) social needs (sharing feelings and connecting with friends and family) (Chang, 2005; Zimmerman and Rappaport, 1988), and entertainment needs (pretty self-explanatory). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leung also set out to find if users who made more content were more engaged in civil society but found no significant correlation. </span>This article is largely quantitative and is based on data collected from telephone survey.

<strong>Oberdan, Thomas. (2009). Google and Godel. <em>Bulletin of Science Technology Society, </em>29(6),  464-469.</strong>

It is an interesting article which provokes us to think about what online reading really is. Oberdan takes issue with Nicholas Carr's Atlantic article "Is Google making us stupid?" in which Carr argues that people are losing our ability to read because they spend so much time on the Internet. Instead of readers, nowadays internet users are "power browsers." Oberdan makes an argument against Carr's research, by arguing that there is nothing inherent in the architecture of the computer to determine a different kind of reading. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The determining factor seems to be what we read online: are we watching videos or reading e-books?  One is visual and involves cognition similar to television watching; another is semantic and involves the same cognition as reading a "real" book.</span>

I am more thinking about the multimodality of reading happening online, reading both videos and e-books. What kind of cognition would this reading be? Can the theory of "distributed cognition" support the multimodality which leads to the hybridity of online reading? I was reading the theory of distributed cognition mentioned in Jenkins et al (2006), which comes from Clark (1997) who states that intelligence of human beings is distributed across “brain, body, and world”, in the context of the big sociocultural environment with extended technologies (Clark, 2003). This theory is further expanded by  Pea (1997) – intelligence distribution means “…resources that shape and enable activities are distributed in configurations across people, environments, and situations…intelligence is accomplished rather than possessed” (p. 50, as cited in Jenkins et al, 2006).
