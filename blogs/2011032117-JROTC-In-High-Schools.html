            There has been recent discussions among elite universities about allowing the Reserves Officers Training Corps (ROTC) on their campuses. Harvard became the first of such institutions to lift their decades long ban on ROTC. Although for different reasons, the Junior Reserves Officers Training Corps (JROTC) is also the subject of much controversy in American high schools.

JROTC was founded as part of the National Defense Act in 1916 and was originally meant just for high schools. Its mission is to teach citizenship, leadership, and respect of authority to its participants. Students learn about military history as well as engage in activities such as drills, physical training and even perform community service. As of now there are just under 3,000 units, compromised of various branches of the US armed forces spread out across the country with over 450,000 student participants. Over half of these units are funded by the Department of Defense. 

The opposition to such a program has come from groups who feel militarism has no place in the nation's educational system. Such groups include The Coalition for Alternative Military in Our Schools, American Friends Service Committee, the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, Veterans for Peace, and the War Resisters League. They believe civilians, instead of military personnel, should conduct education. There is also a widespread belief held by these groups that the military uses the program as a tool for recruiting especially during times when military recruits are down. 

Watch the video below and be the judge of whether JROTC belongs in our nation's high schools.
