            I'm a fan of the <a href=http://www.mta.info>MTA</a>. Actually no, I'd be lying if I said that. 
Correction: I'm a fan of the NYC Subway System. 

After my fair bit of traveling and living in another state, I have come to the firm conclusion that no other public transportation system is as well knit as NYC's. Yes, I am more than fully aware of how arrogant I sound by making this statement. Yes, NYC's subway system can be dirty and dark, and yes, some stations smell like urine (though not as bad as in the 80s I hear), it can be pretty dodgy at night and there are lots of creeps and perverts running amuck. 

But, and I repeat, But, as clean and pretty as other countries'/states' systems may be, I have yet to ride on one that runs as quickly and as efficiently, but most importantly, on a 24/7 basis.

This is not to say that I'm enamored with the MTA. Some of its fare prices are scandalous (but I quickly shut my mouth when they also started charging $2 a ride in Boston as well), I hate the 7 train with an utmost unholy passion on the weekends (Take the Manhattan-bound to 61st Street and transfer onto the Flushing-bound express and yes the express will run slower than the local), and the E train is always too full for my liking. Full of weirdos. 

Like any woman who's lived in NYC for a substantial period of time, I have my share of WTF moments, Pervert Complaints, Late Night I-Wish-I-Rode-in-the-other-Car stories, OMG-that-happened-to-you?! Stories, Crazy Homeless Man tales — the whole works. There are times when I want to pretend I'm in a <a href=http://photoblog.jeffooi.com/cyleow/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/Sports_05.jpg>rugby match</a> and can excessively use my elbows to make room, sometimes I wish that I could kick all those baby carriages down the mezzanine steps in the 74th and Broadway Station, and yes, I am one of those nasty people that will glare at you if you happen to be trying to make your way down the aisle with your roller suitcase and tread over my toes (you know, the dagger-like glare and the quick intake of breathe between your teeth that sounds like “cchhhht!”). 

It's a love-hate relationship. Because as much as I gripe about the subway, it never ceases to amuse me. From the 16-year-old girl that keeps on playing tonsil hockey with her boyfriend who is in return, sneaking peeks at the emo girl sitting next to the window who is listening to her iPod, while she is staring in amusement at the woman with dreads all the way down her back who is gyrating in her seat, eyes closed, mouth pouted, eyebrows furrowed as she gets lost in her own world. It's prime ground for people watching. But then again, there's people watching, which is harmless and mindful of distance, and then there's staring, which can be downright intrusive. 

<a href=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grilling>Grilling</a>, and no I do not mean the cooking contraption or the <a href=http://www.seemygrill.com/f/pics/114744405718814-phpr0RvoL.jpg>iced out retainers</a> that have become so popular these days. Eye contact is a big no-no anywhere in New York. For whatever reason, it is shunned, and those that dare cross that boundary are asking to catch one in the lip. It's the most common reason for a fight if I ever saw one; two teenage boys burst into a violent screaming match because they didn't like the way the other was “grillin'” them. Girls roll their eyes and exchange nasty comments after being caught looking jealously at another girl. People complain about another person's stare, “He was grillin' me!” or “yo I don't like her grill, if she looks my way again I will slap her soooo hard…” and so on and so forth. Parents tell their children not to stare at people. Why? Staring, boys and girls, is rude. It is a rude thing to do. 

So why on earth would you stare at someone, especially if you know that they don't like it? 

So I'm on the E train at 9:15 in the morning, yawning and trying to keep from falling over people's laps. It's crowded, it's packed, and I'm very much aware that today's issue of <a href=http://www.hoyinternet.com/>“Hoy!”</a> is the only thing between someone else's face and my cheeks… and I'm not talking about the ones on my face either. 

I'm taking a cursory glance around the rest of the car, and I stop mid-yawn: some greasy-haired, pasty skinned man is staring. Whatever, he probably zoned out. Just shrug it off and turn up the volume on the iPod, clutch the subway pole a little tighter, shift your hand a little lower so that other person's hand won't touch yours. Look up and hello! Buddy boy is still staring. 

This time, you look him in the eye. He just blinks at you but he won't avert his gaze. This irks you for some unknown reason so you scowl at him, snuff your nose and glare. He stares on, undaunted by your intimidatingly ugly morning-commute face. Your scowl deepens into a full out glare as you watch him slide his eyes down before bringing them back up onto your face. 

What to do? I could, 1) cause a scene and scream out something to the effect of “look away” with a few choice expletives, 2) scowl at him and try to look hideously unattractive, eye gunk, morning puffiness and all and hope that he becomes disgusted and look away, or 3) look away and try to ignore him for the rest of the 40 minutes. I chose to do number 2. It failed by the way. (I was later informed by a friend that it never works unless you do something drastically disgusting — like, say, scratching my crotch)

Some might scoff at dismiss this feeling of invasion by calling it conceit, exaggeration, or irrational female hysteria. Call it what you like, but one should be able to define what an invasion of personal space it, and that includes staring. So listen up while I say this nicely — avert your eyes, (insert adjective)!
