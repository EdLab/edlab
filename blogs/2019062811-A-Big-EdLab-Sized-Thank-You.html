          <p>
            <p>People often say that they leave jobs with mixed emotions. To be honest, I never quite understood this until now. (In the past, it’s usually just been a singular feeling.) Over these last few days, I’ve been thinking about how to draft this post and it hasn’t been easy. EdLab has meant so much to me these past five and a half years. On one hand, I am excited to be starting the next chapter of my career; on the other, I am incredibly sad to be leaving this amazing team.</p><p><br /></p><p>I’ve often said over the years that the people here are what truly make the difference in this being such a great place to work. This has been by far, the most talented, inspiring, dedicated, creative, humble, down to earth group that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. And even though teams and members have changed over the years, this still remains the case. </p><p><br /></p><p>Unlike many other folks, I actually found out about EdLab through a job fair, of all places. (Thank you, Jo!) I knew from the moment I stepped into this place, that this was where I wanted to be. The continued mission of being a true learning organization is what has kept me here and made me look forward to being here every day. There is a “can-do, up-for-anything” spirit that is so uniquely EdLab, a refreshing change from traditional organizations. (I mean, where else can I convince 40 people to sit together for an hour to play the recorder together?)</p><p><br /></p><p>My time at EdLab has made me a better administrator, colleague, learner, and educator in countless ways. For that, I will always be very grateful. I would like to personally thank,</p><p><br /></p><p>- Hui Soo for inviting me to be part of the D&amp;R team from the very beginning. The Tuesday D&amp;R sessions have always been a highlight of my week</p><p>- Brian Hughes and Kim for involving me in so many Learning Theater events and even giving me opportunities to produce events in the space</p><p>- Brian Sweeting and the Publishing Team for allowing me to be an honorary member of the team, by virtue of proximity. I’ll always remember the cake-decorating activity and the many VR sessions</p><p>- Zoe and the Design Team for helping me with my ALA poster and countless other things over the years. You guys also throw the best gallery opening parties!</p><p>- The Video Team for making “Cooking With Chris” a thing! (Thanks again Jackie for your superb directing skills!)</p><p>- The Dev Team for inviting me into your lunch group. We’ve had some great conversations over the years and I’ll miss our Shake Shack and dumpling lunches. </p><p>- The Services and Materials Teams; it has always been such a pleasure working with everyone on the 1st floor</p><p>- And most importantly to Gary, for his vision and leadership of EdLab. Without him, none of this would be possible. The EdLab and the Library are truly the shining star of the TC campus!</p><p><br /></p><p>I’ll end not by saying goodbye, but rather see you around! Keep in touch and let me know how you are doing. Please feel free to connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophergu" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or by email at <a target="_blank">chrisgu14@gmail.com</a>. Best wishes to everyone on their future endeavors. </p><p><br /></p><p>“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Nelson Mandela</p>
