<p>Farming is no easy profession; not only is it demanding in terms of lifestyle, it is unpredictable due to its dependence on the whims of the weather and local climate. <a href="http://www.arable.com/">Arable Labs</a>, a small company funded by the National Science Foundation, has been working to create technology that might ease some of that difficulty, especially when it comes to being aware of what crops most need.</p>

<p>Arable Labsâ€™ new device is composed of sensors that assess weather and crop health, and the system uses machine learning to auto-correct national weather data so that it reflects more local conditions. The system determines how much fertilizer is being consumed, measures leaf temperature and moisture content, gauges sunlight, and gives disease predictions, all to help farmers make more informed decisions that won't risk wasting resources.</p>

<p>In what other contexts could this device be used to teach us about plants and our environment? Do you see any potential downsides to this new technology? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44734">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:49 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>The technology shown here seems fairly harmless to the crops themselves. However, a possible indirect danger could be that the increase in information farmers receive could lead them to interfere more with the crops (adding more pesticides, etc) to get the perfect harvest.</p>

<p><b>@01:27 RuthS: </b>Watching this video, I realized that I generally think of farming as being an area where high-tech gadgets don't really have a place. But obviously tech like this would likely help people working in agriculture, especially as fewer people are taking up farming as a profession.</p>

<p><b>@01:45 Monica Brown: </b>I could see something like this being used as an educational tool in school gardens to teach kids about the atmosphere, biology, and conservation.</p>
