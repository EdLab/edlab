<p>While books like <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> have captured the hearts of children for decades, emerging tech has literacy scholars reimagining possibilities in children’s literature. In particular, new research looks at how augmented reality picture books (ARPBs) affect children’s story comprehension and happiness in comparison with traditional picture books. Oh right, the study also looked at one other factor: whether or not children viewed ARPBs as <i>magic</i>.</p>
 
<p>The study was conducted in preschool classrooms with 92 five and six year olds. Each child had a one-on-one reading session with an augmented reality picture book, which looked like a regular printed book except with computer-generated graphics and information superimposed on the pages. Children could interact with these images and graphics while reading the story. After, the researchers surveyed each student regarding their levels of happiness and conducted a story comprehension test.</p>
 
<p>The results were clear: children reported high levels of happiness while reading the ARPBs. And yes, they viewed them as magical, as well. While this might be because augmented reality is still a novel technology for many children, the levels of interactivity that ARPBs grant young readers could also contribute to their enjoyment. Perhaps caused by the higher levels of happiness, children also tested with greater story comprehension after reading the ARPB than they normally would after reading a traditional picture book.</p>
 
<p>This study suggests that augmented reality can be used in picture books as an educational tool to improve children’s reading comprehension and story enjoyment. While the idea of infusing tech into children’s stories may make lovers of print books cringe, fear not; this study proposes no burning of books a la <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>. Instead, it looks toward the future and suggests incorporating tech elements into books that could open new possibilities in children’s literature. At the very least, adding a few augmented reality stories to the bookshelf might make reading even more magical for kids.</p>
