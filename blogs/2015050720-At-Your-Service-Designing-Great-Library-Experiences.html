<p>First, what is service design? Marquez and Downey define it as a holistic, co-creative, and user-centered framework to create (or refine) services. It’s an intentionally broad definition, because service design can incorporate a wide array of disciplines, including consumer research, interaction design, product design, industrial design, marketing, and even corporate strategy. It has a lot in common with user experience design, but it’s not quite the same thing: UX may be built on the concepts of experience and context, but it’s primarily about creating products and apps. Service design, on the other hand, takes more of a macro view of user experience; the goal is to employ assessment tools in a holistic way. It’s particularly relevant for libraries, since patrons generally view a library as a whole entity, rather than a series of disconnected services. This article explores service design in the context of an academic library, and evaluates library services as part of the whole library ecology.</p>

<p>How is service design implemented in a practical way? There’s not a set of standards or guidelines to follow, but Marquez and Downey provide an easily customizable framework that could be used by any library to set up a service design project to create or refine their own services. The authors break the process down into four phases: pre-work, observation, understanding/thinking, and implementation. The pre-work phase is essentially the planning phase, when user groups are selected and an activity schedule is drafted. The observation phase is when the team discovers and refines the problems and barriers that patrons experience when using library services. The methodology will vary depending on the scope of the problem, but can include activities like space analysis, focus groups, interviews, and surveys. Building on what the team has observed, solutions start to emerge during the understanding/thinking phase. Probably the biggest part of this phase is testing the possible solutions to examine logistical issues and determine the viability, feasibility, and desirability of carrying out the solution. The implementation phase is when the service is documented, goes live, and often transitions away from the design team into the hands of administrators to manage. Like many design frameworks, the process is meant to be iterative: the implementation phase can often cycle back to the beginning to further refine services to meet user needs. </p>

<p>The authors also address other elements that help lead to a successful service design process. One key aspect is finding touchpoints that can make the intangible into something tangible. Touchpoints exist when users interact with a product or service; in a library, this can include interactions with staff, the physical space, the website, the catalog, signs, or even third parties like the professor who recommends the library or the fellow student who shares a library experience. Identifying touchpoints can help the library design team identify points of success or failure within the library ecology. Other tools to help develop a tangible sense of service design include blueprinting, prototyping, journaling, and design ethnographies. </p>

<p>Libraries can benefit from a service design approach when evaluating, refining, and developing services. The methodology can lead to implementing or refining services based on actual users’ demands, rather than national trends, and enables decision makers to allocate resources accordingly. Ultimately, libraries are service providers, and taking a service design approach allows libraries to develop services that meet the needs of their users. </p>
