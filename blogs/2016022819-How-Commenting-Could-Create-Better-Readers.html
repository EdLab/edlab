<p>For learners studying a new language, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/how-immersion-helps-to-learn-a-new-language.html?_r=0">immersion is often the best way</a> to practice and hone new skills. What about language immersion is so beneficial? Some experts think it has to do with  <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5897308/immersion-in-a-foreign-language-rewires-your-brain---especially-when-you-take-time-off">implicit learning</a>—rather than explicit instruction on grammar and syntax—as well as organic interactions among individuals using that language. </p>
 
<p>In a recent study at a Taiwanese university, researchers explored the effectiveness of an immersive online reading comprehension system by asking graduate students in an ELL course to label, annotate, and comment on each other’s class notes and ask each other questions based on the text. Push notifications alerted members when new posts were made, and external links were provided when relevant to the notes.</p>
 
<p>The students then completed a survey on the process, and a majority felt that the collaborative nature of reading and annotating was helpful in improving their understanding. Most students also felt that the process increased motivation and decreased their anxiety. Interviews with the students revealed that the questions helped them locate main ideas rather than read one word at a time; although a few students confessed to not taking the time to use the external links, as they felt that reading the articles was time-consuming enough alone.</p>
 
<p>Overall this study and ones like it highlight the effectiveness of collaborative tools for language learning; annotation systems are just one of several evolving technologies that teach cognitive and metacognitive reading strategies through online immersion activities that weren't previously available.</p>
