<p><b>Title:</b> Student Perception and Usage of an Automated Programming Assessment Tool (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Manuel Rubio-Sánchez, Päivi Kinnunen, Cristóbal Pareja-Flores, & Ángel Velázquez-Iturbidea</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213001040">Computers in Human Behavior</a></p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Machine-based code testing products for novice programmers have been successfully applied in classrooms, though existing literature does not examine students’ use of the tools or their perception of their impact on learning. The authors of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213001040">Student Perception and Usage of an Automated Programming Assessment Tool</a> sought to test one of these tools, <a href="http://mooshak.dcc.fc.up.pt/">Mooshak</a>, in the context of an algorithm design course. Two past studies of the Mooshak reported that it decreased the dropout rate in first year programming courses, though it was unclear whether the dropout rate decreased because of the assessment system or because of differences in teaching methodology. The authors investigated how frequently students used this tool as a substitute for manual program testing and debugging, their experiences and suggestions for improving the tool, and whether usage influenced dropout rates.</p> 

<p>The authors conducted their study in an algorithm design class made up of computer science students at the <i>Universidad Rey Juan Carlos</i> in Madrid, Spain. Fifty-two students completed questionnaires, and their work was coded for date, feedback type, errors, and first accepted submission. Students' algorithm design exercises were submitted through Mooshak. Exercise and exam grades were also considered, and the authors looked at programming skills and dropout rates for the class. Students were considered early dropouts if they did not submit any assignments for credit and did not take exams. Students were considered late dropouts if they submitted at least one homework assignment during the semester but did not take the final exam.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results showed no significant difference in dropout rates between students who used Mooshak and those who did not. Grades and programming skills were lower for early dropouts. Based on the first accepted submission time of each exercise, the authors found a negative correlation between submission speed and performance on the final exam, which means students with more advanced programming skills solved exercises faster than their peers. The authors also looked at how many times students attempted the homework and found that submission accuracy distributions decayed with the number of submissions. This indicates that feedback from the Mooshak tool may not have been sufficient to help students correct their programming errors. The survey confirmed that students found the tool unhelpful.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Creating systems for program code evaluation has always been a challenge. Syntax debuggers have been successful, but they do not provide a semantic level of feedback and still require too much human input. The <a href="http://iaied.org/about/">AIED</a> community has recently proposed some promising methods for auto generating feedback in program evaluation. These tools may help advance learning opportunities for novice programmers. Data science is an in-demand field and a certain level of programming skill is increasingly helpful in many disciplines. The results of this study may help generate more useful, meaningful auto feedback tools. Though Mooshak was found to be inadequate in this introductory programming course, the demand for this type of tool is increasing and with it the opportunity for further testing and research.</p>
