          <p>
            Hello folks,

Thank you all of EdLab again for participating in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7994">yesterday's D&R</a> :D

Based on the outcome of yesterday's group exercise, and an overview meeting with some core members of the NLT team, here is my summary of NLT visualizations: (Read only if interested)...

<b>NLT visualizations will exist to serve two different purposes</b>: An original content role, and a supporting role.

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/visualizeED.png"/>
<b>1. "VisualizeED"</b> is the original [visual] content stream. It will be accompanied by a brief 100-200 word description. VisualizeED pieces are stories each in themselves, addressing something controversial or curious that our readership wants to know or would care about. The research for VisualizeED will be original, as will the visualizations.

<b>Vetting process: </b>
Stage 1 - Anyone can propose an idea for VisualizeED. Contact me, and we can develop the concept together.
Stage 2 - If concept is approved, must find the data/research to support the vis.*
Stage 3 - If/When there is data, move to production. 

<i>*Multiple ideas should be on the block simultaneously. The search for data can be long or happenstance. We need backups.</i>

<b>Timeline:</b> 
Weekly deliverable. But I anticipate and suggest having always having three VisualizeED piece in the works each week: Something in each Stage 1, 2, and 3 (above).

<b>Questions/Concerns:</b> 
How soon can we incorporate interactive elements i.e. polling, GPS, camera, touch, full-screen gallery? What are we aiming for in September? JPEG? GIF? 
Can the NLT design team offer a mockup for the VisualizeED section? And a mockup for how a poll would look? 

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/supporting.png"/>
<b>2. Supporting visuals</b> for text content streams (i.e. Research Digest, Startup Spotlight...) are informative pieces, but not story pieces. They will follow a strict style guide so that there is consistency across articles under each section. 

<b>Vetting process:</b> 
Once the text concept is finalized (perhaps even written), the writer identifies (perhaps even sketches) the key points to be visualized. Designer (who may also be the writer) then produces the images. 

Research Digest: One or two graphs (pose a question in image) and one "photo-statistic" (a relevant photo overlaid with quote/statistic from article) 
Startup Spotlight: Company logo, company collateral, photo of users using product in context, ad for premium content (EdTechTalk)
EdLab Review:  Company logo, photo of users using product in context, ad for premium content (ALT), screenshots of product with key point marginalia
High Five (previously Trends In Ed): One HD image, probably a photo, for each link (5 in total)

<b>Timeline:</b> 
5-14 images produced daily, Sunday to Saturday. Need to have a repository** of original stock photography, as backup, especially for High Five column. Or is NLT able to support an iStockPhoto account? 

<i>**I have an idea for a summer photography contest within EdLab to produce our first stock photography repository. We will provide a vetted list of keywords and themes that represent potential NLT material; EdLabbers can then produce photography that fits those themes. Maybe we can provide small incentive for winning person/group... and celebrate the occasion after work :D</i>

<b>Questions/Concerns:</b> 
For each day's High Five column, how soon within the day will we know which stories have been confirmed? Should corresponding images for HF be the responsibility of the HF column writer because of the time crunch? I know Laura will ultimately decide which 5 are chosen; will she also decide which 5 images are most appropriate? Other columns are less crunched so we can be more meditated and specific with the photography (and extra photos will go to photo repository)

PS I believe this is a VERY ambitious timeline, but let's see how Week 1 goes :D
