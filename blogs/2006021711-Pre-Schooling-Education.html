            As Gary noted yesterday during our pre-Sachs lecture conversation, a lot of interesting educational programs take place outside of schools. <cite>New York Magazine</cite> ran a short <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/news/politics/citypolitic/15950/index.html ">article </a>about the<a href=" http://www.nursefamilypartnership.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home"> Nurse-Family Partnership </a>a program that pairs experienced nurses with pregnant teenagers.

The program in brief: “Pair nurses with impoverished first-time mothers when they're pregnant–before any parenting habits need to be unlearned–and keep the nurses and moms together during the crucial first two years of a child's life, when formative medical and emotional issues are in play (other key aspects are that the moms volunteer to be in the program and that it's free)." 

The nurses provide medical care and tutoring, but that includes everything from a proper diet to quitting smoking and drugs. The crucial work is teaching parenthood–breast-feeding, how to play with an infant to promote bonding and brain development, the importance of planning and spacing pregnancies–and encouraging the mother to get an education or a job. And then there are the subjects that aren't on any nursing-school curriculum, like how to deal with a former boyfriend who's become a stalker?

Some of the results: “For the kids, it's higher IQs and lower rates of child abuse–and, in the children who've been tracked for fifteen years, elevated school performance and fewer encounters with the criminal-justice system?"

This week's <cite>New York</cite> also featured a cover story on <a href=" http://www.newyorkmetro.com/news/media/15967/">blogging </a>and an article called<a href=" http://www.newyorkmetro.com/news/businessfinance/15958/index.html"> How Is a Hedge Fund Like a School?</a>
