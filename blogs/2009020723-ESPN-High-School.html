          <p>
            Last week there were rumors on the Internet that <a href="http://espn.go.com/">ESPN</a> would be opening a high school in NYC. I for one was intrigued by the idea of working as a teacher/coach there. However, ESPN quickly clarified that this was inaccurate. The fact is that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/index">ESPN the Magazine</a> will be working with the Business of Sports School (BOSS) in NYC (set to open in 2009) to provide internship opportunities, curriculum development, and  volunteer support. According to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, BOSS is part of a plan to update the current vocational and trade schools in NYC. 

Are there are types of vocational/trade schools that Mayor Bloomberg should consider opening? For example, what about the MTV School for Music Management? Or the Fox School for Journalism? 

Is this an opportunity for the EdLab to propose the EdLab School for Educational Careers or the <a href="http://tcrecord.org">Teachers College Record</a>  Publishing School? Better yet, what about the <a href="http://aftered.tv">After Ed TV</a> School for Media Production?  

To read more about ESPN's involvement in NYC schools click <a href="http://www.realclearsports.com/lists/espn_high/espn_high_school.html">here</a>. You will also be treated to a list of fictional courses that could have been offered at ESPN High.

(For those of you who are not avid ESPN watchers, the guy in the middle whose head is photoshopped is longtime ESPN anchor (and Brown alum, 1977) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Berman">Chris Berman</a>. I have no idea who anyone else in the picture is.)
