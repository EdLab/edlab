Channel your inner "mad scientist" with <a href=" http://thixlab.com/chemist.html">Chemist</a>, an interactive chemistry lab. This app is designed for attempting experiments, exploring chemicals, and conducting scientific research. It offers full sets of the most commonly used lab equipment: beakers and burners and vials, oh my! It also includes "tap-drag" design to conduct experiments and immediately see results. 
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Chemist is a beautifully designed app. Tapping and dragging are both incredibly responsive on tablets. As a result, a wide range of users—in terms of age, agility and scientific ability—could use this app. Also, its instantaneous display of results should appeal to millennials conditioned for rapid cuts, instant consequences, and fantastic explosions! When your mix of chemicals is not scientifically sound, chemicals spill and beakers blow up. You have been warned. </p>
 
<p>The Chemist app could prove to be an incredibly useful asset for students who do not have access to their school lab for last-minute review. Also, due to its beautiful visual interface, Chemist appeals to students who become engaged by visual or tactile features.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Chemist may be <i>too</i> beautiful, which may sound counter-intuitive, but the gorgeous interface may make younger students, or those who prefer their chemistry experiments a little messier, steer away from this spit-and-polished app where chemicals pour elegantly into the specified container without a drop of waste. A more cartoon-like and kid-friendly interface could also entice much younger students to explore chemistry purely for the visuals alone. Promoting informal science learning as widely as possible is important in light of the growth of jobs in science and technology. </p>

<p>As a point of improvement for future iterations, Chemist could provide users with more direction. It is fun to experiment, but users without sufficient discipline may just mix chemicals willy-nilly without a defined purpose. Although this would be a useful starting point for exploration, this may not be useful in promoting more systematic scientific explanation in the long term.</p>

<p>Chemist also prompts a wider question about apps as a whole. Can any app truly lead to impactful learning? The best science education is a fully embodied affair. Remember the thrill of discovery as you pulled down small vats of chemicals from the shelves, sniffed inside of multicolored beakers, set a Bunsen burner on fire, and watched the magic of science explode in front of you? Due to poorly funded schools, chemistry labs may become a thing of the past. Given perpetually stretched school budgets across the world, Chemist could prove to be a welcome replacement for schools that do not have sufficient operating budgets for fully-equipped science labs. Unfortunately, this assumes that schools still have enough money to provide students with devices in order to access Chemist at all.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Chemist is an exciting, well-executed foray into the burgeoning realm of replicating experiential learning in a purely digital form. This app should prove to be an excellent complementary piece to a more comprehensive science education that ideally is already offered in schools. The beautiful design and classic look of the chemistry set make it appear as though it was designed primarily for high school students and beyond. However, its ease of use could push mini mad scientists to become crazy for science. Could we ask for anything more? </p>
