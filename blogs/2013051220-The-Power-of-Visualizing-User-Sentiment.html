<p><b>Title:</b> VISA: A Visual Sentiment Analysis System (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Dongxu Duan, Weihong Qian, Shimei Pan, Lei Shi, & Chuang Lin</p>



<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Sentiment analysis has become an important opinion-mining method over the last decade. Researchers use methods like opinion summarization, tree map visualization, and 2D matrices of sentiment overviews to help visualize digital interactions like tweets, blogs, and product reviews. Sentiment analysis can be a useful decision tool, and it is currently used in fields like commerce, politics, and entertainment. Helpful visualizations of this data can illustrate trends in how sentiment evolves over time, sentiment polarity definition, and comparisons between users’ sentiments.</p>
 
<p>The authors of <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2397700">VISA: A Visual Sentiment Analysis System</a> developed and tested a visual sentiment analysis system, called VISA. The system took an integrated approach to visualizing sentiment analysis results and structured facet data by using machine learning techniques to classify text sentiments. VISA’s point of difference is its interactive interface for end users. The system uses and combines several existing visualization widgets for comprehensive analysis and exploration of raw data. The widgets include a sentiment trend visualization, a dashboard panel, data snippet view, and a keyword search bar.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors conducted a case study on over 11,000 customer reviews posted to <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a> between 2002 to 2010. Each review contained a text comment, the reviewer’s profile data, and the reviewer’s numerical rating of the hotel. VISA classified the features into five aspects: value, location, cleanliness, room, and service. The VISA system created visual summaries ranked by the number of positive reviews and users could further explore the visual summary by clicking on the keyword text to unfold more specific information. Users were able to see the review analytics, sort positive/negative reviews, and quickly identify facts about the hotel visually through timeline and sentiment clusters.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Opinion mining has become a popular strategy for sentiment analysis. Most current applications focus on extracting opinions from social media, and this approach has not yet been applied to education in a significant way. In the years ahead sentiment analysis technologies will be taught in journalism, law, and business schools as a strategy for gauging opinion and reporting. We will likely also see a greater application of this technology in interactive digital communities such as review sites where the aim is aggregating user opinion. Education and adaptive learning systems will also support the integration of this technology into learning analytics, to add another layer of analysis on top of basic reporting.</p>
