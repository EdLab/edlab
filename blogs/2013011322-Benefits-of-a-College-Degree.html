            A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/education/study-shows-college-degrees-value-during-economic-downturn.html?ref=education&_r=0">recent study by Pew</a> looks at the benefits of a college degree during the recession. It concluded that individuals with degree are better off than those without, especially during the economic recession. During the recession, many young adults faced difficulties in finding jobs or even paying their college tuition. As the study shows, Americans between the ages of 21 and 24 who lacked college degrees are worse of than those with degrees. The recession also caused a drop in employment and income for this age group. This shows that a post-secondary education is very important not just for the individual but also for the labor market. Before the recession, the percentage of young adults not finding jobs was very high but as the article shows, salaries during and after the depression shows a huge drop in percentage with those with high school diplomas or lower. There was little drop in salaries for those with degrees. However, the consistent problem remains finding employment for those without.
