<strong>From the publisher: </strong><em>Zing! Seven Creativity Practices for Educators and Students </em>is a beautifully written guide that offers seven powerful practices for personal creativity and professional inventiveness. For each of the seven practices, author Pat Mora proposes seven symbols and presents parallel exercises for teachers and students. Evocatively written in the form of letters to teachers and librarians, this book:
<ul>
	<li>Helps educators access their      creative selves and, in the process, become better teachers</li>
	<li>Nurtures students in      expressing themselves through writing and other creative pursuits</li>
	<li>Includes activities at the      end of each chapter</li>
</ul>
This moving and inspirational volume serves as a reminder that inventive teaching is truly an art form that enriches lives and transforms teachers and students.

<strong> </strong>
