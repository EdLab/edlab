Mike Olsen is co-founder of <a href="https://proctorio.com/">Proctorio</a>, a fully automated proctoring solution that uses artificial intelligence to validate student activity and identities during computer-based assessments. As Lead Research Software Engineer for ASU Online, Mike helped develop one of the world’s premiere online educational systems. He graduated from Arizona State University with degrees in Aeronautics and Software Engineering.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Proctorio?</b><br>
<p>As Lead Research Software Engineer for Arizona State University Online (now EdPlus at ASU), I helped develop one of the world’s premiere online educational systems. However, many students who did well during unproctored exams throughout the semester would fail the final exam when proctored. We were inspired to create Proctorio to help create more consistent learning outcomes in online education. Because Proctorio is fully automated it can be deployed throughout the semester on all assessments. Traditional proctoring is expensive and cumbersome. As a result, many online programs will only require proctoring on the most high-stakes exams. This leads to students passing courses in which they failed the final exam. The obvious implication is they were cheating during the unproctored assessments and were unable to perform at the same level when proctored. Too often students were matriculating into higher division courses without the required knowledge, which resulted in further attempts at academic dishonesty and ultimately, low retention rates.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from institutions using Proctorio?</b><br>
<p>We have Instructional Designers and Executive Directors endorsing our automated proctoring solution from coast to coast. Maintaining academic integrity is essential to growing online learning environments. The most innovative online programs are experiencing the benefits of consistently using automated proctoring on every assessment. From the University of South Florida to the California Community College system, Proctorio is providing unscheduled, flexible proctoring for every exam type at an affordable price. Our partner institutions are not only protecting academic integrity during online exams, but also, they are verifying the identities of online students and securing exam content throughout the semester. Probably the most gratifying feedback we receive is from the students themselves. Certainly proctoring is not something they enjoy, but students are increasingly acknowledging the value it adds to their degrees and the fairness established when everyone is tested in a secure environment.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The distinction between digital and in-person learning will diminish significantly in the years ahead. As instructors become more adept at using digital resources and institutions find new ways of engaging learners where they work and live, students will have new opportunities to not only access education, but also, interact with each other beyond the traditional lecture hall format. It isn’t simply about moving more learning online, but rather, it’s about making hybrid settings an integral part of education so that all students will be able to engage with new technologies as part of the learning process. We have only just begun to leverage the possibilities of the digital classroom; similarly, we are just beginning to understand the importance of working with others in order to make learning more empathetic and directly applicable to the lives of our students. </p>

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to Proctorio?</b><p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that I am working on anything in addition to Proctorio, but rather, we are growing our idea of what Proctorio is. Our vision is to increase the quality and availability of education in service of a more just and equitable world. This goes beyond merely proctoring and includes efforts to improve the caliber and prestige of online degrees as well as facilitate new modes of learning in every classroom. As a Google for Education partner, we work with some of the most innovative teachers in the world. It is inspiring to see instructors leveraging our technology in ways we never imagined. Automated proctoring and student authentication have the power to take learning to new environments and unleash today’s genius in service of tomorrow’s wisdom.</p>
