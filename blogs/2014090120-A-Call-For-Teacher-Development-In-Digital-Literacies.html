<p><b>Title:</b> Preservice Teacher’s Perceptions about Using Mobile Phones and Laptops in Education as Mobile Learning Tools (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suleyman Nihat Sad & Ozlem Goktas </p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8535">British Journal of Educational Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do preservice teachers perceive the use of mobile phone and laptops for teaching and learning?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The authors randomly recruited 1,087 preservice teachers enrolled in two universities in Turkey to investigate teacher perceptions towards mobile phones and laptops as potential mobile learning (m-learning) tools in their own classrooms. The authors aligned themselves with the definition of m-learning as portability, learning through mobile devices and wireless internet, anywhere, anytime; they viewed both mobile phones and laptops as m-learning tools. They applied quantitative analysis methods to survey data to examine and compare preservice teachers’ perceptions about strengths and limitations of laptops and mobile phones, as well as their uses in education. </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Major findings indicate that preservice teachers’ notions about using laptops in the classroom were not positive overall but they were significantly more positive than the use of mobile phones. In addition, factors as program, grade level, gender, and device possession had no significant impact on their views. The teachers’ views on the limitations of laptops and mobile phones were more similar, but they again favored the use of laptops over mobile phones in education. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> While preservice teachers prefer to use laptops in their classrooms in comparison to mobile phones, the findings of the study highlight the general hesitation regarding both kinds of devices in the classroom. The findings suggest the lack of teacher preparation in digital literacies found in other research and a need to provide practical, specific professional development opportunities for preservice teachers to implement technology-integrated learning into their teaching.</p>
