<p><b>Title:</b> Effects of Digital Dictionary Format on Incidental Acquisition of Spelling Knowledge and Cognitive Load During Second Language Learning: Click-on vs. Key-in Dictionaries (2013)</p>

<p><b>Author:</b> Tsu-Chien Liu, Melissa Hui-Mei Fan, & Fred Paas</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513002200">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> 
Which digital dictionary format facilitates better learning of spelling for ESL students: key-in or click-on dictionaries?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> 
There have been numerous studies examining the benefits of online reading tools for ESL/EFL students, but few have compared the effectiveness of different digital dictionary types: those that require the user to search by typing ("key-in") and those where users click directly on the word ("click-on").</p>

<p>Based on previous research, the authors of this study understood that language learners prefer click-on dictionaries, learning-by-doing leads to better visual letter recognition, more mental effort results in higher performance, and frequently encountered words are more likely to be learned. Thus they hypothesized that despite requiring more time, key-in dictionaries would be more effective than click-on dictionaries for learning word form.</p>

<p>To verify this, the authors divided 45 undergraduate Taiwanese EFL students into three test groups (key-in and click-on dictionaries, and a non-dictionary control group), standardized for variables like English proficiency, reading level, and dictionary material, used eye tracking to monitor participants’ eye movement, and administered multiple post tests that measured spelling accuracy, reading comprehension, mental effort, and time investment.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> 
The results of the study confirmed the hypothesis that learners who used key-in dictionaries invested more time on dictionary consultation and consequently performed higher on spelling tests. Eye tracking revealed that the key-in group spent more time looking at target vocabulary during the reading exercises, but devoted less mental energy during the spelling test. It was also noted that although there were measured differences in spelling performance, there was no significant difference in reading comprehension between the dictionary groups and the control group; dictionary usage did not improve reading comprehension. The biggest takeaway from these findings is that having a learner actively involved in defining a word encouraged the successful understanding of form.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> 
The lack of a connection between dictionary usage and comprehension may validate many teachers who balk at dictionary activities out of concern that students might become dependent on tools unavailable in real-life (and tests) and experience the detrimental "split-attention effect." This paper calls for more research on the distraction that occurs when a reader disengages with a text in order to look up a word. Existing platforms (like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1140">Rewordify</a>) that replace unknown words within the text could be appropriate tools to test this. </p>

<p>If further studies are conducted, they should account for students with different vocabulary sizes, which could affect the frequency with which they search for definitions. It would also be informative to examine the effect of dictionary interfaces, and whether or not participants memorize the spelling of words before searching (perhaps using participants who also use the Roman alphabet in their native language).</p>

<p>Overall, the results of this study are significant because they validate previous assumptions while raising questions about how cognitive load shifts with the use of different technologies. It confirms many teachers’ suspicions that students who only rely on click-on digital technologies will suffer in spelling. It would be interesting to see these experiments repeated in other target languages, especially Chinese languages that are prone to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_amnesia">character amnesia</a>. In any case, weighing the perceived advantages of technology versus the actual benefits encourages educators to carefully consider the costs and benefits of technological convenience.</p>
