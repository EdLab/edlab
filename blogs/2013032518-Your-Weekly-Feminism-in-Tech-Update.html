            I feel like I'm running a column at this point ("reporting from the front lines... I'm Nara Kasbergen"), but I think it's important for everyone to be aware of what's going on.

Last week was one of the worst weeks in a while in the feminism-in-tech debate. If you're active on Twitter, you probably saw some tweets about. Here are the most relevant/best reads about the situation:

Basically, what happened was that at PyCon (the annual Python Conference for developers), a woman named Adria Richards overheard some guys behind her making sexual jokes referencing "big dongles" and "forking". It made her personally uncomfortable and she felt like those kinds of remarks should not be made at an event that's striving to be inclusive of women since it is representative of many of the ways the tech community is dominated by men and male humor, so she tweeted a picture of the offending men to the PyCon staff. The PyCon staff removed the men from the room, and one of them was later fired since he was there as a representative of his company, which now had to deal with a lot of negative attention.

To add fuel to the fire, Adria posted a lengthy blog post about what had happened and why she had done what she had done... a questionable move, since most people (myself included) did not agree that posting a picture publicly to Twitter should not have been the first course of action; she should have talked to the men herself first, and only resorted to the public shaming if they refused to stop.

Anyway, the damage was done, and within hours, Adria was being attacked from all sides; she received numerous blog comments and tweets calling her various terrible names, telling her that she deserved to be raped or to die, etc. Her blog was DDoSed, as was the website of her employer, SendGrid. In short, the Internet wildly overreacted.

The next morning, SendGrid posted that they were letting Adria go, which only served to make a bad situation even worse... many feminists were outraged by SendGrid's action, since for as far as we know they did nothing to try to resolve the situation with her first; they simply gave into public pressure and were too concerned about their image and their revenue loss from the DDoS attacks to try to find a less drastic solution.

Less than a week later, there's still a lot of simmering anger within the tech community on both sides. Some people have managed to channel their energy into projects such as <a href="http://thisispycon.com/">This Is PyCon</a>, several PyCon enthusiasts' attempt to overcome the negative publicity and rehabilitate the conference's image -- but most can agree that no one won. The last link in the list above provides a pretty good reflection on "how we all lost".

For me, the biggest takeaway is the lesson that if you're going to stand up on behalf of women in technology, you need to be very, very careful how you go about it. It's unfortunate that Adria got fired, but it's worse that she got attacked personally and given the level of vitriol she was confronted with, likely spent some time in serious fear for her own safety. On the other hand, it's also unfortunate that what most of us can now agree was one critical mistake (tweeting the picture rather than confronting the men directly) has served to perpetuate a negative image/stereotype of all of us self-professed feminists in the tech world. Because of the extreme negative reaction it caused, this situation is probably going to make it just a little bit harder for all of us to achieve the equality we're hoping for.
