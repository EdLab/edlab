<p><b>Title:</b> Learning by Teaching Human Pupils and Teachable Agents: The Importance of Recursive Feedback (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandra Y. Okita & Daniel L. Schwartz </p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.807263#.Umq2Q5Tk9bU">Journal of the Learning Sciences</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
What is the value of recursive feedback for learning-by-teaching activities? How do teachable agents facilitate learning?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Peer tutoring is an effective practice that benefits not only students who receive assistance from their classmates but also contributes to learning gains of student-tutors. In order to help others to learn, each student-tutor has to go through three phases of learning-by-teaching activities: preparing to teach, the act of teaching, and observing recursive feedback from tutees. The authors of this paper hypothesized that recursive feedback plays a significant role in the learning of student-tutors and designed two experiments to test their hypotheses and understand more about how recursive feedback works.</p> 

<p>Of particular interest is the experiment in which high school students learned about hypothetico-deductive reasoning through a game-like computerized environment with a teachable agent. 94 participants were assigned to several learning conditions. Some students acted as tutors and learned this reasoning skill by tutoring the teachable agent in game, while others learned by playing activities and receiving feedback directly from the computer program. Students who were in the control group learned the same content without using the computer program at all.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
High school students who taught the computer agent and observed recursive feedback from the teachable agent learned much better than students in all other learning scenarios, including students who played the computer program and received feedback directly from the system. Similar results were found in the other experiment in which graduate students who received recursive feedback from their tutees had higher post-test learning scores than the other three controlling conditions. In sum, findings from both experiments suggest that getting recursive feedback from either human pupils or teachable agents results in more productive learning for student-tutors. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Given the great value of recursive feedback on learning, it is important to incorporate this component into the design of any learning-by-teaching activities. It might also be the case that recursive feedback on do-it-yourself projects where producers have opportunities to learn peopleâ€™s responses to their works would create similar positive learning effects for project creators. It is encouraging that the utility of recursive feedback extends to teachable agents. Further development of teachable technologies could support learning-by-teaching pedagogy in more contexts in the future.</p>
