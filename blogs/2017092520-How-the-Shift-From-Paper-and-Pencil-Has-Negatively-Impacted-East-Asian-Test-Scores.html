<p>The East Asian region historically has some of the highest scores on international mathematics, science, and reading assessments. However, the 2015 results on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) exam saw a sharp decrease in reading scores from students in this region. The researchers assert that this drop in scores can mostly be attributed to the switch from pencil-and-paper testing to a computer-based testing (CBT) between PISA 2012 and 2015.</p>
 
<p> While the East Asian region has been touted for its educational and technological prowess, curricula in these nations often excludes technology and, instead, relies on more traditional learning methods. The researchers cite a report from OECD that shows the region at the bottom of global rankings in classroom computer-related activities. Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea also had the lowest computer-to-student ratios in the world. Conversely, Western nations have collectively ranked highly on educational technology usage rates and saw no parallel decline with the 2015 testing change. The scholars believe that unfamiliarity with CBT was the main culprit for the reading score decline among East Asian test takers. </p>

<p>To test their hypothesis, the researchers first employed a correlation test between national average PISA reading score differences between 2012 and 2015 with CBT indicators (computers per student and time spent using the Internet). The correlation tests show that nations with the greatest fall between the two testing cycles tended to have the lowest measures of CBT indicators. Next, they used another correlation test between national average scores in reading, math, and science with average time spent using the Internet. The results show that lower levels of Internet usage correlates to higher PISA results.</p>

<p>The authors criticize the shift from traditional pencil-and-paper testing to a computer-based testing in PISA as a decision rooted in Western bias. While the OECD and Western nations often lionize technology usage in classrooms, the scholars in this research show that some of the best scoring educational systems in the world do not utilize the Internet or computers in their classrooms. They offer an important lesson: there are no magic bullets in educational pedagogy, including from the newest technological innovations. </p>
