            “All men are created equal.” Those are the very words written in the Declaration of Independence. This phrase is used by many to combat discrimination and racism. It is way of informing people that no ethnicity or race is superior to the other. In actuality, these were the words our forefathers used to free themselves from British oppression. Some individuals believe this statement has failed to live up to its meaning. This <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-21/princeton-review-tells-asians-to-act-less-asian-and-black-students-to-attach-photos" target = "blank">article</a>  proves to be a perfect example to show why all men are not created equal.

Generally, for statistical reasons, colleges request prospective students to identify their race applying. There is no need for applicants to emphasize or play down their racial or ethnic background. However, in the book Cracking College Admissions, the Princeton Review commits an eight-page section to advising prospective students who are black, Hispanic, or Asian on the types of interest they should mention and not mention. This shows the power race can play in the college admission process.

For instance, for the admission committee to know that an applicant is black, the applicant must attach a photograph of themselves. For Asian Americans or applicants who aren't Asians but have an Asian sounding surname, they must avoid being an Asian Joe Bloggs. Essentially, a Joe Bloggs is an Asian student who is strong in math and science but weak in verbal test scores and the humanities. I believe this advice should stop. Education is very important and if people are screened due to their race, it limits them from achieving their goals.
