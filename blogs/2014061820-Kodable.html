<p>Kodable is an iPad game aimed at younger students and structured to teach programming concepts and problem solving skills. In gameplay, users guide little hairy creatures called "fuzzes" through mazes to collect coins and help them find their way out. Players provide guidance to the fuzzes by dragging and dropping various action instructions such as turns and loops into the command space and arranging them in order for the fuzzes to follow. Major computational thinking concepts like sequence, condition, and function, and skills such as debugging are integrated in the gaming activities.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Collecting coins and escaping mazes make good learning contexts for 5-7 year-old students beginning to learn about programming since these settings might be familiar from other games. The drag-and-drop approach for creating sequential commands makes it easy for users to understand programming concepts. One feature that distinguishes Kodable from other similar apps is its in-app educational resources. The accompanying learning guide for each level turns this app into a useful and easy to use teaching tool. The premium service, Kodable Sync, offers new features to help educators to manage classes and monitor each student's learning progress from the website.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although loop and function are shown as two different commands in Kodable and are introduced at different levels, in the gameplay they produce the same result. This is because Kodable simplifies programming and does not provide tasks complicated enough to require full use of either loop or function in the gaming activities. Educators might consider unlocking all levels at the beginning so that students who grasp programming concepts more quickly can decide their own learning pace. Students looking for challenge and a more nuanced understanding of concepts might find the advanced levels more engaging and effective.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Resources and tools for learning how to code have been growing rapidly. Similar to apps such as <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1458">Light-Bot</a> and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1192">Cargo-Bot</a>, Kodable offers a fun way for young students to learn programming. Along with the in-app educational resources and class management portal on Kodable Sync, the app creates a useful teaching and learning platform. This model could serve as a template for the development of future educational apps.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p> Kodable and its attendant resources make a fun and effective platform for teaching and learning programming. </p>
