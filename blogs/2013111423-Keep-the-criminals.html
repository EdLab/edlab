            The exclusionary rule is one of the rules that has been brought up in class lately. It's no surprice that this wouldn't be a one sided rule, there are students who are against it and some who are in favor of it. The Exclusionary rule is a law that prohibits the use of illegally obtained evidence in a criminal trial. Even though this law protects your rights there are always some exceptions. For example, if police find drugs in a house that they entered without a warrant but where going to find the drugs regardless because the criminal was being followed already then the exclusionary rule would not be in effect. 

Many people argue the case that if a police officer strongly believes that a crime is happening but does not have a warrant than he should still check the place out. It is also said that if drugs, or deadly weapons without a license to be in posession of it should not have the exclusionary rule. Basically what is happening is that a person who is technically disobaying the law is able to be free because they were searched without any permission. 

What are your thoughts about this, should people who are doing illegal activites be able to be free because they were seached illegally?
