<p>Anne Richardson is the Director of Educational Partnerships at the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/">Exploratorium</a>, where she collaborates with its partners to develop cultures of learning that align with their organizational and community goals and values. Her work includes master planning, program development, and professional development. During her tenure at the Exploratorium, Richardson has directed the <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/education/field-trip-explainers">Field Trip Explainer Program</a> and Member Education Programs. She also launched and directed <a href="https://helixlosaltos.org/">Helix</a>, a one-year, experimental community-science center. In her early career, she developed and implemented science-and-art learning experiences at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Department of Environment, Mass Audubon, and the <a href="http://www.greatlakes.org/glimw">Alliance for the Great Lakes</a>. Richardson holds a PhD and an MS in environmental studies from Antioch University and a BA in art history from Northwestern University.</p>
 
<p><b>How did your educational and previous professional experiences shape your current role as Director of Educational Partnerships at Exploratorium?</b><br>
<p>I learned a few key skills that were reinforced at every step of my professional and educational path. The most important ones that have shaped the way I work in my current role are: 1) the process of iteration and human-centered design; 2) critically examining how actions align with vision, mission, and desired outcomes; 3) how to analyze and succinctly synthesize messy information; 4) resilience in oneself and the systems we create to do our work; and 5) wondering what I have to learn from every person I meet.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Exploratorium, through endeavors such as Helix and Global Studios, will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>The goal of our work in Global Studios is to increase access to inquiry-based learning experiences for people who may not have access to the Exploratorium’s resources through our other channels. My personal vision is a smarter, kinder world. In order to arrive there, people need to be able to be curious about the world around them, themselves, and each other, and to have the confidence that they can learn about their own questions. I also think that openness to new ideas, ways of learning, and ways of being in the world are critical. The experiences we create through the Exploratorium’s Global Studios foster curiosity and openness and empower people to be in control of their own learning.</p>
 
<p><b>What trends do you think will have an impact on learning in the coming years?</b><br>
<p>Clearly, edtech and widespread access to mobile technologies are profoundly changing what is possible in the learning landscape. At the same time, there is rising recognition of the importance of social-emotional skills and character strengths. How might we balance and/or integrate these two separate forces? I am excited by the possibility of so much connectivity and access to learning through technology, and also believe deeply in the importance of direct experiences in the physical and human worlds.</p>
 
<p><b>What else do you have down the pipeline at Exploratorium?</b><br>
<p>We’re collaborating with Google on the development of educational materials for their new app, <a href="https://makingscience.withgoogle.com/science-journal/activities">Science Journal</a>. This app allows you to use sensors to collect and review data from the world around you, and provides you with this information in multiple modes so that you can quickly and easily come up with questions and test your ideas. We’re interested in creating inclusive, accessible entry points into science and making for young people in out-of-school settings.</p>
