            <i>The New York Times</i> ran <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/business/creative-learning-pays-off-for-web-start-ups.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">this article</a> on <a href="http://www.creativelive.com/">CareerLive</a>  and casual learning site Lynda.com yesterday and caught and held my media-overloaded attention for the following three reasons: 
<b>
1) The NYT's does not often run learning-focused stories outside of the Ed section.

2) They mention MOOCs... a recurrent subject of debate here at EdLab.

3) The distinction between the casual learning and more formal online learning models is often overlooked.</b>

Here is the NYT's description of why CareerLive & Lynda are signicant in the flood of new MOOC offerings:

<blockquote>
While companies like Udacity and Coursera – providers of giant online open courses – are just beginning to introduce courses with fees that count for academic credit, other online learning companies have carved out a lucrative niche in courses on design, photography and other creative pursuits. CreativeLive, Lynda.com and others have tapped into an audience of customers who are highly motivated to hone skills that might help enhance their careers. The online courses are usually less expensive than intensive in-person workshops on photography and other subjects, and can attract top-notch instructors with their promise of big national audiences. 
</blockquote>

<b>
Questions to consider:
-Will you try CareerLive?  If so, why?  If not, why not?  

-Why should we be careful to always clearly distinguish between casual & formal learning on platforms like MOOCs?

-Do you feel that the addition of live-streaming is a compelling enough point-of-difference? Why or why not?

-Have you used Lynda.com?  If so, for what purpose?</b>

As we continue to evolve the EdLab's mSchool this trend towards casual learning for highly-motivated online learning opportunities is a trend to watch and learn from...
