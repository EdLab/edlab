<a href="http://bit.ly/1QZhLbs">Anant Agarwal</a> is the <a href="http://bit.ly/1VESBA4">CEO of edX</a>, an online learning destination founded by Harvard and MIT. Anant taught the first edX course on circuits and electronics from MIT, which drew 155,000 students from 162 countries. He has served as the director of CSAIL, MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. He is a successful serial entrepreneur, having co-founded several companies including Tilera Corporation, which created the Tile, multicore processor, and Virtual Machine Works.</p>

<p>Anant won the Maurice Wilkes prize for computer architecture, and MIT's Smullin and Jamieson prizes for teaching. He holds a Guinness World Record for the largest microphone array, and is an author of the textbook <i>Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits</i>. Scientific American selected his work on organic computing as one of 10 World- Changing Ideas in 2011, and he was named in Forbes' list of top 15 education innovators in 2012. Anant, a pioneer in computer architecture, is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a fellow of the Association for Computer Machinery. Agarwal holds a Ph.D. from Stanford and a bachelor's from IIT Madras.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
As an MIT professor, I’ve always been deeply committed to education and engaging with committed, active learners. Now, as the CEO of edX, I’m able to bring my passion for teaching to education at scale and reach learners around the globe. My first MOOC on edX, Circuits and Electronics, had more than 155,000 learners in it. With this one MOOC, I was able to engage with more students than if I taught for 50 years at MIT. </p>

<p>The edX platform provides teachers with tools and insights to promote better learning engagement and results. As a teacher, it is important to me that the edX platform and tools not only help increase access to high-quality education, but also produce positive and actionable learning insights and outcomes for both teachers and learners.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
Up to now, quality education—and in some cases, any higher education at all—has been
the privilege of the few. We see MOOCs as the great democratizer, and believe that in the
future, economics, social status, gender or geography will not determine a student’s access to
education or opportunity for success. </p> 

<p>Our vision for the future is to continue to work with universities, institutions, faculty, researchers, and students to innovate and transform education, to make education accessible to everyone, and to improve on-campus learning through research. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
As I’ve written about in the <a href="http://huff.to/1Q7DzS1">Huffington Post</a>, I see the unbundling of education as having a large impact on learning in the coming years.<p>

<p>MOOCs are now helping to unbundle education and create a culture of lifelong learning. Why is four years a magic number for on campus college education? As we continue to embrace online learning and integrate it into the on-campus experience, we could use it to unbundle the traditional higher education timeline. </p>

<p>In an unbundled model, students might begin their higher education largely online, perhaps even their entire first year, taking AP and introductory-level courses. Then they might have two years of on-campus schooling, followed by on-the-job learning and education. Then, to stay on top of new trends, people would continue learning new skills, potentially again online, throughout their careers. </p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
At edX, we are continuously experimenting with online education, and exploring new opportunities to expand access to education. One area that I’m particularly energized about is how we are reimagining credit and credentialing. Just as we think about unbundling content and time with online education, we are thinking about how to unbundle credit and credentialing. </p> 

<p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) continue to gain traction around the world with millions of learners using free or low cost courses to earn new forms of credentials in higher education and in the job market. Learners are now using online courses to earn both traditional college credits and new forms of credentials. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, we announced a collaboration with Arizona State University (ASU) on The Global Freshman Academy, an initiative that offers full university freshman level online courses for credit. Learners anywhere in the world can enroll in ASU courses on edX, pay for credit only when they pass the course and at a largely discounted rate than traditional on-campus credit and earn college credit. </p> 

<p>We also offer other forms of credentials, such as Verified Certificates and XSeries Programs that show mastery of a topic or subject-area. Learners can share these credentials on their academic applications or their LinkedIn profiles to advance their education opportunities and careers.
And, we are developing truly exciting initiatives, like our partnership with LaunchCode—a non-profit organization that creates pathways to economic opportunity and upward mobility through apprenticeships and job placement in technology—that is helping people to develop new skills and secure new jobs via online learning and credentialing. <p>

<p>We are excited to see how online learning and credentialing continues to evolve in the next five, 10, 20 years and beyond. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I enjoy following <a href="http://bit.ly/1j81HZM">Queen Rania Al Abdullah</a>, who, although her lighthearted twitter bio describes her as "A mum and a wife with a really cool day job," is a truly inspiring world leader. One of her many projects has been to create Edraak, the Arab world's MOOC Portal, and I'm always interested to see her updates on how that is changing the landscape of the region. <p>

<p>I follow <a href="http://bit.ly/1JSAmjS">Arne Duncan</a>, who until recently served as U.S. Secretary of Education, for his insights on education news, initiatives and trends in colleges and K12, both nationally and world-wide. His department has made great progress improving the American educational system, and I've especially enjoyed reading his updates on the ways educators are innovating in the classroom and new steps the government will take to support them. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/1Nn62FN">MITx Entrepreneurship 101x</a> feed is a personal favorite of mine, as I love seeing the interaction between passionate students and business owners from around the world with instructors and professors. Their twitter feed in particular is always cheering students on, providing support, amplifying successes, and ultimately building a fun, engaging community of entrepreneurial learners. </p>
