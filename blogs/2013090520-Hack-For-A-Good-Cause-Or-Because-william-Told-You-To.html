In various cities across America on the weekend of June 1-2 of this year, a beautiful thing happened. Technologists, software developers, designers and entrepreneurs joined forces to take part in the National Day of Civic Hacking. Sponsored by Intel, the event aimed to use "publicly-released data, code and technology to solve challenges relevant to our neighborhoods, our cities, our states and our country." Among several contributors to the event was will.i.am’s nonprofit, i.am.angel Foundation. <p>

will.i.am has been <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/840"> an outspoken ally</a> in the movement to build excitement around coding and developing. While the above video is only 40 seconds long, it’s enough time for the rapper and mogul to get his message across: Find a group and make some apps! <p>

Working in multidisciplinary teams within a fixed amount of time has proven to be the kind of pressure cooker environment that brings great ideas to life (see <a href="http://nycedu.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend EDU</a>). When the next National Day of Civic Hacking comes around, will you be one of the participants? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10348">on Vialogues</a>. In the meantime, Kanye, Britney, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre—in the words of will.i.am himself, let’s get it poppin’!<p>

<b>@0013 Rita:</b> Musicians, dancers, artists.... not exactly the group you'd expect at a hackathon, but I like where it could go!<p>

<b>@0018 MartinPaper:</b> What would it mean for the field if Kanye (et. al) really did host a hackathon? Seeing as every single person he listed can be seen as a role model to young people, I think it could serve as a source of inspiration, if nothing else. It may even open their eyes to new avenues and opportunities!<p>

<b>@00:21 YogiP:</b> I can't wait for the next one of these to roll around again. What a great opportunity to work with the most driven, creative people in my area. ….I hope there IS one in my area next year!
