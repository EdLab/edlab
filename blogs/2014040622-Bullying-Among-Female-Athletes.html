          <p>
            In sports, there are many incidents that come up in terms of bullying and its effects on athletes. This <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/9965221/espnw-wake-incognito-martin-incident-bullying-issue-female-athletes">article</a> highlights the story of a young Asian American student athlete who was bullied by teammates on her middle school basketball team. The bullying started during a practice session when some of her teammates restrained her arms during a drill. This eventually led to verbal taunts. She complained to the coaching staff who in turn told her to keep playing and that it was a way to make her tough enough to become a leader. 

Her family was aware of the fact that she was being bullied by her teammates. Some of the taunts deteriorated into ethnic slurs. Inevitably, the bullying dramatically affected the way she played and her grades began to decline. After further complaints to team officials and school authorities proved futile, her parents told her to pray and keep working hard and hopefully she would get better.

This was a very sad story in the sense that, the primary goal of sports for the most part, is to bring people together. Sadly, that was not the case for this young athlete. I think coaches should be held responsible for not taking immediate action when their players report issues of bullying. Mostly, students spend most of their time after school with coaches and these coaches are supposed to play several roles such as mentor and parent. Bullying hinders the ability of young athletes to showcase their talents.
