            Stemming from an earlier discussion with Erica Boling, I believe that we are right to question the efficacy of current educational material, and more specifically, the efficacy of textbooks.  We referred to a comment previously raised regarding the poor attempt of textbooks to cite authors–and how absurd it is to expect our students to learn citation and academic etiquette from such prevalent examples.  (I cannot remember exactly who said it; all I can attest is that he or she was older than 50. Discuss among yourselves.)

Why is it so absurd that many students feel citation is so… passÃ© and unnecessary?  Why hinder the speed of knowledge harvesting, acquisition and transfer by requiring additional time to be spent to attaching authorship information?  Hell, is authorship <em>really</em> that important?  As an educator, I would have to say “yes.â€? Take the time to evaluate the source and its contextual basis; however, as an economist, mathematician/social actuary and nerd, I would have to say “noâ€? (more often than not), and quantify the probability of factual accuracy, getting expelled and a multitude of other factors and find an expected outcome. But now, I'm just getting off-topic, pedantic and contentious. So, I'm going to de-pop my collar and offer one last question:  

Does our Draconian adherence to traditional academic ethics hindering students in high school and college from researching well?

(I apologise for not concluding in an appropriate manner, but I have a six page, APA-formatted essay to construct. In other words, I'll have five pages and a bibliography when all is said and done.)
