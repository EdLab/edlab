          <p>
            Our recent research on Vialogues found that topics generated from Vialogues discussions are on average more similar to the original video topics than those generated from YouTube comments (using cosine similarity measure). In other words, Vialogues discussions are in general more relevant to original topics comparing with YouTube comments for the same pieces of videos. The topic similarity research finding statistically proved that we are getting meaningful discussion on Vialogues.

This density plot below illustrates the reason of topic similarity differences between two platforms. Each color coded density graph represents the distribution of topic words probability from LDA with corresponding text corpora (the video “Introduction to Work and Energy”, from Khan Academy is chosen as our example). This video was moderated by a class instructor as an extended classroom. Red illustrates statistics for Vialogues, green for YouTube and purple for caption. The font size of words represents the relative value of the probability, e.g. large size indicates more discussions around that word. 

Considering that this is a physics lecture around work and energy, it is not surprising that in the caption, “work”, “velocity”, “mass”, “energy” and some equation related words are included in the high probability group from 0.35 to 0.37. With Vialogues discussions included, the probability of meaningful topic words e.g. “work”, “velocity”, “square” are amplified to 0.55 while the probability of these words were shrunk to less than 0.1when YouTube comments are included. A possible explanation for this phenomenon may be that as there are approximately 20 times more comments on YouTube than Vialogues (12 comments), many viewers digressed from the physics subject by posting around “job”, “student”, “school” or strong sentiment words as “great” or “wrong”. The quantity of comments on YouTube to some degree shows that the traffic of YouTube is significantly heavier than Vialogues, however, it might create a problem of information overload that people may be buried in the irrelevant discussions. The mission of Vialogues, engaging meaningful discussion, is here represented by case study statistics.
