            A <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/china-debuts-top-international-education-rankings/story?id=12336108&page=1">recent report</a> from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reveals 15-year old US students are lagging behind their counterparts in other countries when it comes to science and math. The OECD is a 34-member body composed mainly of Western nations and a few nations in the Asia, Latin America and the Pacific. Their math, science and reading assessments are measured on a scale from zero to 1,000. The report revealed that 15-year US students ranked 25th in math, 17th in science, and 14th in reading among the 34 nations of the OECD. Shanghai, arguably China's most affluent and developed city, ranked first in math, reading and science. Shanghai was included in the study as a non-OECD educational system. Among OECD nations, Hong Kong finished second in science (behind Finland) and reading and placed third in math (behind South Korea and Finland). 

The results of the study were received with concerns about our nation's K-12 public education system. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan found the results, “to be brutally honest.” “The findings, I have to admit, show that the United States needs to urgently accelerate student learning to try to remain competitive in the knowledge economy of the 21st century,” said a concerned Duncan. US students averaged 509 in science, 487 in math and 500 in reading, all below or around OECD averages. The results of the study also reveal a gender gap among US students in the three major OECD topics. Boys scored higher than girls in science than math while girls outpaced them in reading. 

According to Duncan, the primary reason American students are falling so far behind their peers “is that socio-economic disadvantage leads more directly to poor educational performance here in the United States than is the case in many other countries…our schools, in other words, are not doing nearly as much as they could to close achievement gaps." Duncan has ruled out throwing more money in the system since the US spends more on education than most OECD member nations. The answer, according to Duncan, is the recruitment and support of more talented teachers. His sentiments was echoed by Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers who stated that “what the PISA results tell us is that if you don't make smart investments in teachers, respect them or involve them in decision-making, as the top-performing countries do, students pay a price.”
