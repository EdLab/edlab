          <p>
            There are several heuristics and principles that we should take into account when designing and implementing a User Interface.  The following is just a sampling.

This is my take on the points presented in this article: 
<a href="http://www.sylvantech.com/~talin/projects/ui_design.html">UI Design</a>


1. <b>Target Audience:</b> Determine who is going to be the main user of the website, and design appropriately.  For example: the language used in a website aimed at children is going to be different from the language used in websites aimed at adults.
2. <b>Familiarity:</b> Use familiar behaviors and systems already out there, so that the amount of learning or adjustment for the user is minimal.
3. <b>Keep things Simple:</b> Don't try to be crafty and hide the menu bar somewhere.  It's better to keep things out in the open or in a commonplace position so the user can more easily get to a button and therefore get a task done.
4. <b>Coherency/Consistency:</b> The UI design should be somewhat "intuitive" or consistent.  Pulling the example from the article: if the color of one entity in the UI can be changed, it would be expected that the color of another entity could be changed.
5. <b>Reflecting Change:</b> When something in the UI is changed, such as an option is selected, something corresponding in the UI should also change.  One example is a used hyperlink.  A clicked hyperlink would have a different shade of color as opposed to a unclicked link.
6. <b>Shortcuts:</b> There are many different types of shortcuts, but for frequent users, it would be nice to have some quick ways to do things.  One example is the copy and paste commands that can be done with the keyboard as opposed to the mouse.
7. <b>Focus:</b> A user's focus is difficult to predict.  But things like flashing texts are more likely to attract a user's attention than non-flashing texts.  So we have to keep in mind what we would like for the user to concentrate on in our UI.  And in determining that, we should try to not add things like flashing text to distract the user from going to say the menu bar.
8. <b>Connections/"Grammar" in UI language:</b> Entities in the UI should have logical connections.  For example, a button is a subject.  The color of a button is an adjective.  The function of the button is an action or verb.  This shows that UI is sort of like a language, and thus we must define the rules in our UI language and keep them consistent.  If a button is supposed to have an action, give it one, otherwise it would be weird to have a button that does nothing on the site.
9. <b>Help:</b> We should recognize that the user may require help.  So it would be a good idea to have a help section or something that I thought of was caption boxes that show up when the mouse hovers over something.
10. <b>Safety Net:</b> Allow room for the user to make error.  Not everyone who is going to be using your UI is going to use it the way that you want them to.  So things like pop-up boxes that ask things like "Are you sure you want to continue?" are certainly something that could be put in.
11. <b>Context:</b> The UI should not be too busy.  You want to have it so that the user can concentrate on doing one particular thing without having other things be too distracting.  And when there is more than one thing on a page at a time, there should be some logical correspondence or connection between the two.
12. <b>Aesthetics:</b> This is essentially keeping things visually pleasing.  You don't want to have different types of buttons (some flashing, some super small, etc) on the website, it's better keep things consistent and slightly uniform, since it's more visually pleasant.
13. <b>Feedback/User Testing:</b> It is a good idea to do incremental development.  Like when one is writing code it is a good idea to run and test out your code a little bit at a time instead of writing the whole thing and hoping it will compile and run perfectly the first time.  Similarly, when implementing a User Interface, it is a good idea to do a test run and see what the users have to say.  Perhaps your idea of positioning the menu bar across the top didn't really appeal to the users and they want it moved elsewhere.  And that drop-down menu you put in, it didn't really work for them.  So it is definitely a good idea to test out the UI as you go.


<u>Quick Notes:</u>
<li>For shortcuts, we should keep them somewhat generic.  For example: the copy and paste shortcuts should not be changed from ctrl+c and ctrl+v to ctrl+z, since ctrl+z is usually the undo shortcut.  And overall it is annoying getting adapted to new shortcuts, only to have to go back to the old ones when switching computers.  This reminds me of when I first switched from using a windows to a mac, and I realized that the cmd/apple key replaced the function of the ctrl key for a majority of the keyboard shortcuts.  That was a slightly hard adjustment to get used to, and every now and then I try to do a cmd shortcut on a windows computer, only to find there is no such button.</li>
<li>Different browsers may be in use, so we should make it usable in Internet Explorer as well as Safari, and several other prominently used browsers.</li>


As an aside, this was something I came across that I found interesting and applicable:

Fitt's Law: "The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target"

Article: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms993291.aspx">Fitt's UI Law Applied to the Web</a>

The article points out some things that we may not necessarily immediately think of or take into account, since something like a larger clickable space seems like common sense.  But sometimes common sense is not so common.
