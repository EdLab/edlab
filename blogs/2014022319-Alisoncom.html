<i> We believe that all certifiable or standards-based learning for every subject can be made available for free online. We also believe that <a href="http://alison.com/free-training/United-Nations-Universal-Declaration-of-Human-Rights">Article 26 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> which states "Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free..." will, through ALISON, become a reality.</i> (From the Alison.com site) </p>

<p><b>The Biggest Online Learning Platform Youâ€™ve Never Heard Of?</b><br> 
Described as "A World of Free Certified Learning" on <a href="http://alison.com/">their site</a>, Alison.com (ALISON stands for:  "Advance Learning Interactive Systems Online") straddles the line between professional certification and informal, self-paced online learning. With courses ranging from the practical, a "<a href="http://alison.com/courses/Diploma-in-Law">Diploma in Legal Studies</a>," to the future-focused new course offering, "<a href="http://alison.com/courses/Introduction-to-Bitcoin">Virtual Currencies: A Case Study of Bitcoin</a>," Alison.com offers something for almost everyone.  From the lifelong learner to the professional who would like to gain new knowledge to build a career, the platform fills many professional and educational niches.  Beyond the aforementioned use cases, the platform provides a compelling way for learners to explore potential fields of study or career changes without investing a large amount of time or (any) financial resources.  Put directly, "The mission of ALISON is to enable anyone, anywhere, to educate themselves for free via interactive, self-paced multimedia. It is our belief that through ALISON, the cost of access to high-quality education can be removed."  While removing cost as a barrier, the platform does impose display ads from partner organizations and companies.  Beyond potentially distracting advertising, the site does offer a wide range of helpful features, from a user dashboard and progress reports to content organized by publisher as well as clearly stated "learning outcomes" that accompany each course.  Publishers of content hosted on Alison.com range from "<ahref="http://alison.com/courses/Google-Android-Development">Android Developers</a>" to the University of North Carolina offering "<a href="http://alison.com/courses/Fundamentals-of-Human-Computer-Information-Retrieval">Fundamentals of Human Computer Information Retrieval</a>." </p>

<b>An Alternative to MOOCs?</b><br>
Unlike course platforms from MOOC providers Udacity or Coursera in which the learning experience is tied to courses that might be offered at a traditional post-secondary institution, Alison.com provides a platform in which basic introductory level content necessary for on-the-job or remedial training is combined with more casual interest-based learning opportunities. This mix of foci and content is a nice point of differentiation in an already saturated online learning market.  Of course only time, in the form of a few thousand online hours, will tell whether employers will accept this version of free, and free-standing, education as a valuable credential.
