<a href="http://bit.ly/1vUIMCw">Stephen Downes</a> works for the National Research Council of Canada where he has served as a Senior Researcher, based in Moncton, New Brunswick, since 2001. Affiliated with the Learning and Collaborative Technologies Group, Institute for Information Technology, Downes specializes in online learning, new media, pedagogy and philosophy. Downes is best known for his daily newsletter, <a href=" http://bit.ly/1o423CH">OLDaily</a>, which is distributed by web, email and RSS to thousands of subscribers around the world, and as the originator of the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). He is a popular speaker, appearing at hundreds of events around the world over the last fifteen years. He has published hundreds of articles both online and in print through two decades of research and development into learning networks and related technologies. Downes holds a B.A. and M.A. in philosophy from the University of Calgary.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
My formal education was in philosophy, which developed in me a focus on precision and accuracy, as well as a comprehension of how people come to know things, what they know, and to a certain extent, how they create and how they reason. In particular, my post graduate work focused on learning networks, as described for example in early work in connectivism, which enabled me to understand sub-symbolic ways of knowing and to see how a person can learn directly through experience. This was important because it helped me see exactly how the distinction between learning by reading or listening, and learning by immersion and practice actually impact what was learned. Additionally, I developed skills in journalism and computer science through my own avocations. I actually had a career in computers before studying at university and over the years have taught myself to program in various languages. And while at university I was an active and prolific contributor to student newspapers, including a two-year stint in a paid position as editor. These have had a significant impact, allowing me to instantiate my ideas in computer code and develop novel ways of talking about them over and above the traditional academic publication. And I have through my time in educational technology developed expertise in learning theory (properly so-called) and pedagogy, the result of many years teaching in different fora.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I want my work to open education to the wider mass of population, so that people can take advantage of the opportunities it offers to lead fuller and more rewarding lives. I want people to be able to discover that learning is something they can do for themselves, rather than being forced to wait until some agency provides it for them. 
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
The massive open online course, which I developed along with George Siemens in 2008, will continue to have a major impact—perhaps the name (and the fad) will change into something else, but the idea of open online learning is not going to go away, and will have a pervasive and system-wide impact in a few years. It will become increasingly normal to access learning resources for free from online sources, forcing institutions to alter their business models, focusing increasingly on providing access to a social network, providing in-person educational services, and on authentication and credentials.  We are also looking it more mores of learning, even online learning, as these resources and services will be available not just in person or on a computer, but also on mobile devices and even in objects and systems. There will also be an increased focus on personalizing learning and learning analytics, but these will have pushback as people begin to voice concerns about privacy and ownership of data.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
I am currently leading a program called <a href="http://bit.ly/ZTMFhk">‘Learning and Performance Support Systems’</a>—this is our effort to move learning technology from its existing emphasis on the corporate or institutional agenda and to replace it with a focus on personal learning. This does not mean ‘learning by yourself’ – it means learning in a community, but in such a way that each person learns different things, using different sets of resources, designing and pursuing their own learning path for themselves. Elements of LPSS include for example a ‘Resource Repository Network’, which is an individual’s personal set of subscriptions, contacts, knowledge resources and services. It also includes a ‘Personal Learning Record’, which tracks and records learning activities, credentials and related data, and which is owned by and managed by the person (rather than, say, being something that is owned and monetized by an institution).
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I don’t follow people on Twitter and I don’t like to recommend people to follow. I <i>do</i> follow people on other services, but I prefer to keep my lists private. I don’t like the idea of highlighting individuals as especially important. The best people to follow are the people you follow; the best way of meeting them is by meeting them. I’d rather see each person develop his or her own individual network of connections rather than driving everyone toward one person or a few people.</p>
