<p><b>Title:</b> Making Students' Work Visible on the Social Web: A Blessing or a Curse? (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenny Waycott, Judithe Sheard, Celia Thompson, & Rosemary Clerehan</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151300119X">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
Is online social sharing a blessing or curse for classrooms?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Students who came of age in the digital world are used to interacting collaboratively on the social web, but these skills are still often in contrast with the focus on individual assessment in formal schooling.
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151300119X">Making Students' Work Visible on the Social Web: A Blessing or a Curse?</a> examined several social web technologies used in class including blogging, wiki-writing, photo and video sharing, podcasting, and assignments that involved combinations of different social web technologies to assess whether social sharing was an asset or a liability for students. The study consisted of surveys and interviews with Australian lecturers about the benefits and drawbacks of student-created work on the social web. Most of the instructors taught in the humanities, medicine, and technology. The interviews were recorded, coded, and interpreted based on the authorsâ€™ understanding of learning goals.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
From the interviews, the authors isolated two major functions of the academic social web: collaborative work with peers and publishing to an online audience. The instructors interviewed suggested that collaborative work encouraged students to participate, created a community in the classroom and helped students become aware of the ideas and experiences of their classmates. The instructors also noted that participatory work online had a positive impact on group dynamics in the classroom. Some of the drawbacks to this practice were ambiguity around assigning credit to individuals, an increase in the volume of overall work, and online miscommunications. Of web publishing, the instructors said that it gave students a sense of accomplishment and helped motivate them, but the educators found that they had to remind students to be aware of their audience. Most of the interviewees were in favor of classroom activity on the social web, though they had concerns about privacy, piracy, and standards of online behavior.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This paper focused on a summary of instructor interviews, but the results contain important insights into emerging issues in the digital classroom. A more comprehensive meta-study on this subject might help clarify these suggestions into more conclusive and usable data for educators. As more innovative tools are created for instructor use, the benefits of online sharing may bring this practice to greater numbers of classrooms. At this juncture, more research and the development of best practices may help bridge the gap between educator expectations and the possibilities of online education.</p>
