<p><b>Title:</b> Measuring Success: Examining Achievement and Perceptions of Online Advanced Placement Students (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharon Johnston & Michael K. Barbour</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://ejournals.ebsco.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/Article.asp?ContributionID=29637693">American Journal of Distance Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
How do advanced placement students enrolled in the Florida Virtual School compare with traditionally-taught AP students in Florida and the rest of the country?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Advanced placement (AP) courses were some of the first online offerings for K-12 education. Because hosting these courses onsite often requires devoted staff and the purchase of new materials, budget-strapped districts can offer these courses to students through state financed online versions like Florida Virtual School (FLVS.)  The authors of <a href="http://ejournals.ebsco.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/Article.asp?ContributionID=29637693">Measuring Success: Examining Achievement and Perceptions of Online Advanced Placement Students</a> compared online AP students from FLVS with classroom-based AP students in Florida and nationally. Students at the virtual school were also surveyed for their perceptions of AP experiences online.</p> 

<p>This study examined quantitative data including AP exam scores by subject area obtained through the Educational Testing Service and the State of Florida. National scores were provided by the College Board. Data collection began in 2009 to coincide with a new policy at FLVS that required all enrolled students to take the AP exam. This policy enabled the researchers to obtain a more accurate representation of student performance because students were unable to opt out of the test, even if they did not believe they would pass. A survey was conducted of students enrolled in FLVS programs and follow up interviews were conducted with a subset of this population that had taken both FLVS and traditional AP courses.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors found that, while students at FLVS and traditionally-educated students in Florida both scored lower than the national average on the AP exams, students at FLVS had scores that more closely approximated the national average and far exceeded the performance of other students in Florida. The surveys revealed that most students thought that their online course was comparable or better than in person learning, with some advantages over traditional learning including flexibility in pacing and the ability to participate offsite.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The results seem to confirm the adequacy of online AP courses especially because many students enrolled in FLVS come from rural or disadvantaged districts and because students in traditional courses were still able to opt out of the exam. Special interest groups like the Florida Tax Watch Center have been especially interested in this type of research because of the cost savings associated with online education. Further research and the consideration of other state online programs may moderate these results, but it seems that in Florida online AP students have a potential advantage over their classroom-based peers.</p>
