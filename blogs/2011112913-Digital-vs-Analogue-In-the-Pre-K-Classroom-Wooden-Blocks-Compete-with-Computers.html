According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/28/nyregion/with-building-blocks-educators-going-back-to-basics.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=With%20blocks%20&st=cserecent">this </a> New York Times article, educators and parents are re-embracing the basic & analogue in children's education... Blocks.  Simple, wooden <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_block">"unit blocks"</a> as they are scientifically called, are making a comeback.  Self-described "block consultants" are even making appearances at parent-led meetings and consulting with NYC-area schools.  Best summarized by this quote from the above NYT's article, "As in fashion, old things often come back in style in education."  Apparently blocks are once again, having their day.  

What is it about blocks that is piquing parent & educator interest?  From increased math retention and easier language acquisition to simply providing a visual, tactile & spatial way for children who struggle in other areas to express themselves, blocks are now hailed by researchers and parents alike as a valuable addition to Pre-K-1st grade students.  Additionally, "block play" has long been embraced by progressive private schools, and now many more conservative institutions are taking notice amid growing concerns that an emphasis on testing and technology is cutting-into or eliminating valuable unstructured playtime.  Some NYC-based charter schools are even adding "block labs" that compete on equal footing with 21st century science and technology labs and are often strategically located in close proximity of one another.  

Given this trend towards re-embracing more simple & open-ended accessories for imaginative play, I wonder what would happen if early childhood education programs combined wooden blocks & computer programs?  Could the analogue & digital support one another?  I see haptic sonar-based manipulations that integrate simple sounds or early, simple 3D design programs that would allow kids to dream-up an idea and then generate a simple blueprint for the class to follow.  David Rockwell's group was clearly on the right path with their recent introduction of the <a href="http://imaginationplayground.com/">Imagination Playground</a> (learn more in the vialogue embedded below).  Learn more about the value of block-based play in <a href="http://www.naeyc.org/files/yc/file/Hewitt0101.pdf">this article</a> from the NAEYC.org archives.
