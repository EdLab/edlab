          <p>
            I recently read a blog on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/weekinreview/16steinberg.html">New York Times</a>  in which the author argued that college is simply not for everyone. It seems like modern society and all of its technology and innovation has caused students to think they are obligated to get a college degree in order to be labeled “successful”. Some notable business executives like Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Facebook creator Mark Zuckerburg dropped out of college to pursue their business interests.  
 
The article noted that in 2006, of the students who began a four-year bachelors program degree, slightly above half of them actually earned the degree they were seeking. This statistic is significantly lower for students who were ranked in the lower quarter of their class. As a result of this, these student spent huge amounts of money on a degree they never received and were been better off learning a trade at a vocational school and increasingly in community colleges.
 
The demand for careers that don't require a college degree is set to increase in the coming years, which implies that there is a market out there for students who don't excel at traditional four-year institutions. For example, my high school, Aviation, is a vocational school that offers students a chance to earn Federal Aviation Mechanic License during their high school tenure and an additional year for those pursing a second license. Upon graduation, if they get accepted into a job, they are scheduled to make $50,000 their first year.
 
I am in no way advocating pupils to skip college but instead I want them to know there are other options available.
