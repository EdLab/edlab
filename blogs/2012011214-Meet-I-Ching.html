<strong><em>Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</em></strong>

I am a doctoral student in Instructional Technology &amp; Media program at Teachers College.   I have a master degree in TESOL and am interested in Second language acquisition, inter-cultural communication, and technology.  My current research interest focuses on using technology as a mean to reduce ESL students' perceived stereotype threat and English learning anxiety.

<em><strong>Where’s your hometown?<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2012/01/ShekMemorial.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15041" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/01/ShekMemorial-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="342" height="257" /></a></strong></em>

I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan. Taiwan is an island in the western Pacific Ocean and located off the southeastern coast of Mainland China.  It is well known for its delicious food, fruit, and friendly people.  I speak fluent Mandarin and write Traditional Chinese characters.  I came to the States (Philadelphia) in 2003 to pursue my master degree and then moved to NYC in 2005 to continue my education.

<em><strong>Your favorite meal?</strong></em>

My favorite meal would be brunch. It's probably because I associate it with weekends.  And weekends are usually the only time of the week that I get to walk around the city and try new things.

<em> </em>

<em><strong>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:</strong></em>

Somewhere over the rainbow. There are many more songs that I love,  but this is the first one that appears in my mind when reading the question. And I am humming it~

<em> </em>

<em><strong>A country you’d like to visit?</strong>
</em>

Oh...just one? That's too difficult to answer.  I'd love to visit and experience any country that I've never visited before (as long as it's safe and clean).

<em> </em>

<em><strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></em>

It has always been a tough question for me.  I didn't really know.  I always went blank when getting this question. However, adults really liked to ask kids about this.  Seeing other young kids who could answer this question with no hesitation made me nervous. To put it in a nice way, I was the kind of kid who didn't want to limit her potential and possibility : p

<em><strong>What was your first job?</strong></em>

I worked at an educational publisher which develops English textbooks for K-6.  I worked as an assistant to the head textbook content developer. I enjoyed the job and learned a lot from it.  It also leaded me to where I am today.

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

<em> </em>

<em><strong>What has been your worst</strong><strong><em> and best jobs?</em></strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>

Let's say if the job is not rewarding and can't help me grow (or grow with me), that's not a good fit for me.

<em><strong>What do you remember about your first day of school?<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/01/16771-Clipart-Picture-Of-A-Chicken-Drumstick-Mascot-Cartoon-Character-Jumping1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-15043" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/01/16771-Clipart-Picture-Of-A-Chicken-Drumstick-Mascot-Cartoon-Character-Jumping1.jpg" alt="" width="94" height="130" /></a></strong></em>

The Kindergarten teacher expected everyone to finish all the food on their plates.  I couldn't finish the chicken drumstick that school lunch served that day and throw it under my own chair. I was happy about being able to solve the problem. However, I got caught right away and was punished  by the teacher (I think I was forced to eat another chicken drumstick).

Lesson learned? Maybe I should have at least thrown the drumstick under other people's chairs, j/k, we shouldn't waste any food! I should have just finished my own drumstick : p
