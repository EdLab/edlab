            The current <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11916590">political (or violent) standoff</a> in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial and cultural heart, represents a test case for democracy in Africa. The tension started last fall when de facto leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> refused to cede power to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">Allassane Outtara</a> following presidential elections. The presidential elections, nearly two decades in the making, was meant to heal a bitter Muslim North-Christian South divide in the Ivory Coast which resulted in a civil war at the beginning of the 20th century. Ivory Coast is the world's <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5242">leading producer of cocoa</a>. Gbagbo represents the Christian South while Outtara represents the Muslim North.

Outtara has been recognized by all impartial observers including the EU, UN and all Western powers as the clear winner of the elections. Gbagbo however refused to accept the results and sworn himself in for another term almost immediately afterwards. Following four months of diplomatic talk and brutal crackdown on civilians by Gbagbo's much feared security team and the national Army, Northern rebels sympathetic to Outtara launched an offensive which has seen them take control off the entire country with the exception of the presidential palace in Abidjan, where Gbagbo is apparently holed up with his trusted aides and family. The rebels' only grievance is to formally give Outtara the presidency. 

For the earlier years of its postcolonial history (1957 onwards), most African nations were governed by freedom fighters who quickly became dictators. Most of these dictators were heavily supported by the two global superpowers at the time to maintain power due to the politics of the Cold War.  Though some nations have tried their hand at democracy in recent times, the results have been lackluster at best. For instance, ethnic tensions came to the fore a few years ago following elections in Kenya, a country that was considered an example of how a full fledge democracy can work in Africa. Far too many dictators still rule under the disguise of democracy: Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe and Paul Kagame in Rwanda, etc. Most of these dictators constantly delay or postpone presidential elections, use force to maintain control or violently suppress electoral results that may threaten their power.

The complexities of international relations and interests of Western nations often mean dictators in developing nations often rule with impunity. By refusing the results of the elections, Gbagbo was essentially adhering to the status quo. However, with Gbagbo's fate all but sealed in the coming days, and an eager sub-Sahara Africa waiting to see the aftermath of the crisis, Ivory Coast may very well represent a test case for how to ensure that democracy in sub-Sahara Africa has a chance.
