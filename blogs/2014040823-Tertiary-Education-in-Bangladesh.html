            The Higher Education Quality Enhancement Project (HEQEP) is a project that intends to improve learning and research in the tertiary sector of Bangladesh. The project's primary goal is to enhance the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/03/19/bangladesh-connecting-minds-in-higher-education">quality of tertiary education</a>. The challenges faced by the tertiary education sector are enormous to the extent that there has been a weak connectivity of research collaboration between academic communities at home and international peers. Research as we all know is about finding interesting information to share with not just people in your surroundings but with those around the globe, which helps to create some networking relationship. In Bangladesh, funding is also another challenge faced by the tertiary education sector. 2.1% of the country's GDP is poured into education, but just 0.12% is allocated to tertiary education. This inadequate share is the reason for creating the HEQEP, to generate money for investing in research, computers, and the improvement of teaching, learning, and research.

Normally, a person will decide to start a business when he/she has been able to raise a good sum of money. In the case of HEQEP, the Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) is the funding mechanism used to promote academic innovation in both public and private universities. So far, the AIF has provided 96 grants to reconstruct teaching and learning, 73 to enhance research capabilities, campus network, improvement of laboratory facilities, and renovation of training institutes. Additionally, the project has created the Bangladesh Research and Education Network (BdREN), which has given researchers and students access to share their knowledge and findings with institutions of higher education within the country and abroad. Thus, the HEPQEP has been effective by far, accomplishing the goals it had set to accomplish. Without any arguments, I believe that Bangladesh has now built up a good team of researchers.
