<p><i>"Bringing continuous professional learning to every teacher, everywhere. We empower teams of teachers to quickly learn what works for their students (and what doesn't)."</i>  (From the <a href="http://www.teachcycle.com/">TeachCycle</a> website)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.teachcycle.com/">TeachCycle</a> was founded on the belief that quality professional development is not a one-time, isolated experience. Rather it must be continuous and build off itself, just like all good learning. TeachCycle is a new offering from the company that designed <a href="http://betterlesson.com/">BetterLesson</a>, a site that offers over 10,000 Common Core aligned lessons created by master teachers. Both BetterLesson and TeachCycle rely on a network of master teachers to support educators at all levels through curriculum assistance and professional development lessons and coaching. </p>

<p>When teams of teachers enter a TeachCycle, the system pairs the teachers up with a coach. The team and coach interact online. Together they select one of the lessons or challenges. Each challenge has a single metric to track growth. TeachCycle encourages an experimental cycle: teachers try a change in the classroom, measure its impact, learn from the results, and then continue to experiment. As Christine Glandorf, Project Manager at BetterLesson, explained to NLT in an interview, "teachers owning their professional learning and teachers owning their professional growth" is a core mission of TeachCycle.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Professional development for teachers that is made by teachers seems to be a recipe that works, especially when the content and process is rigorous. One user, a Principal from Kentucky, writes, "TeachCycle allows teachers a rigorous and intentional model for which to have professional, collaborative conversations regarding the learning of each individual child on a timely basis. Isn't that the essence of teaching?" The measurable, project-based, and clearly defined cycles of TeachCycle are structured to mimic the most effective types of learning. The structure has the potential to create better professional development and inspire teachers with effective strategies for learning.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>TeachCycle is designed for groups of teachers in a school, so the current version won't be as useful for a single teacher in a classroom. TeachCycle is also charging $490 per teacher per semester, which could be steep for some schools, though the individualized instruction seems to promise a more impactful professional development experience than similarly-priced lecture style courses.</p>

<p><b>Our Take Away:</b>
<p>A promising supplement to or replacement for professional development programs, TeachCycle has its own platform currently in beta. In the interim, the site uses a combination of Google Hangouts for coaching and BetterLesson for content. With its bold, results-based virtual programs, TeachCycle seems ready to raise expectations for teacher professional development. </p>
