<p><i>"The world is exploding with new information and high specialization. For children to learn to navigate this fast changing landscape they need a chance to actually be at the helm of their 21st century learning experience; to practice making decisions and discovering their gifts, talents, and passions." </i> (<a href="http://nycagile.org/about/21st-century-education/">About Agile Learning Center</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>A School Without Multiple Choice</b></p>

<p><a href="http://nycagile.org">The Agile Learning Center</a> (ALC) rejects basing education on rote memorization and standardized test preparation. In fact, there is no standard curriculum at ALC, nor are there distinct classes grouped by ages. Instead, students learn what they want when they want. One group of students might devote time to learning code in order to create a video game, while another might want to write and act in their own theatrical production. Perhaps one group simply wants to play with hula-hoops. All are acceptable and encouraged at ALC, which currently has one location in Manhattan and four others in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.</p>

<p><b>Freedom to Learn</b></p>
 
<p>ALC believes that by giving K-12 students unlimited freedom to explore within their educational setting, they will discover their lifelong passions more easily than they would in a traditional school. And when students are interested in learning a particular subject, the school facilitators (the ALC version of a teacher) guide them. Yes, this even includes subjects as basic as reading and math.</p>
 
<p>At this point, the question that people generally ask facilitators at ALC is this: But what if a student doesn’t want to learn math (or another subject she finds difficult)? The answer: Well, that’s okay, too. The idea is that if enough children are learning a particular skill, such as basic multiplication, the few students straggling behind will probably want to learn it, too, even if the desire isn’t immediate.</p>

<p><b>Fueling Passion</b></p>
 
<p>It’s a precarious model for a school in a time when standardized tests are the gateway to higher education. Yet there’s no denying that letting students self-direct their own education develops a particular set of worthwhile skills and strengths within them. ALC encourages creativity and ambition, grit and collaboration. It cherishes the curious student and seeks to inspire a love for learning in all. Mostly, ALC hopes its students find their passion and purpose at a young age so they can avoid changing their major five times or having to find themselves on a backpacking trip in Southeast Asia after college. Within the support of its unique school culture, ALC wants its students to learn to live happy and fulfilling lives.</p>
