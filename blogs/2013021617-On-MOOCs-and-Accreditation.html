          <p>
            On Monday, Harvard law student Chris Seck posed a hypothetical thought scenario in the opinion pages of his school newspaper, The Record:

"Think about the employer who wants to hire one of two candidates for a $100,000-per-year engineering job. The first candidate is an MIT graduate with a 4.0 GPA in Mechanical Engineering, while the second candidate is a kid who says [paraphrasing Matt Damon's character in Good Will Hunting], “You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for free from Wikipedia and MOOCs.” …Which candidate would the employer hire?"

Seck observes that, as things stand, the employer's only “safe choice” is the “institutionally-vetted” MIT grad who has “paid his dues to the system.” The second candidate, brilliant though he may be, has no comparable way to demonstrate his ‘hireability'. So, to borrow a phrase from Lenin, what is to be done?

In an interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education last year, Bill Gates — college drop out and one of the world's most successful autodidacts — said, “the ideal would be to separate out proving your knowledge from the way you acquire that knowledge.” 

The emergence in recent years of badges, certificates, and other alternative forms of accreditation in the world of inexpensive online learning may be the beginning of something revolutionary; but as signaling mechanisms these early efforts are still no replacement for a traditional university degree.

For individuals who (by choice or out of necessity) chart an unconventional path to erudition, the only real hope for professional success in today's economy lies in entrepreneurship. In other words, they can do like Gates and hire themselves. This route too, though, is accompanied by great barriers and, for even for the most competent of self-starters, great risks. 

But Seck's question need not be rhetorical forever. The challenge today is to bring about a breakthrough in the credentialing process offered by MOOCs providers, and/or bold changes to the ways by which firms screen applicants. Were this to happen, it will have gone a long way in making real the promise of inexpensive, self-directed learning.
