<p>With so many language learning apps available, it can be difficult to pick out the worthwhile ones from the duds. That said, if you’re interested in learning Mandarin Chinese, you will want to check out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chineseskill-learn-mandarin-chinese-language-free/id777111034?mt=8">ChineseSkill</a>; it’s one of the worthwhile ones. Through its many scaffolded lessons, flashcards, and activities, you can learn how to understand and pronounce Mandarin words, construct sentences, and recognize and write Chinese characters. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>ChineseSkill is almost overflowing with different lessons and activities to help you practice Mandarin. All in all, the app claims to teach a total of 331 characters, 568 words, and 1,033 sentences. The app also helps you contextualize this vocab through various faux-conversations, ranging from buying tickets at the airport to attending your ex-boyfriend’s wedding. Yep, whatever situation you encounter, this app has you covered.</p>
 
<p>The app is split into three sections: learn, review, and discover. In the first, users can work their way through a scaffolded series of lessons, beginning with the basics and working through specific sets of vocabulary and grammar. In the review section, users can test their skills with flashcards and continue practicing how to draw Chinese characters. The final section, discover, provides users with several different toolkits, including games and charts on the different tones, mock conversations, and helpful phrases for traveling. In this section, users can also record their own speech and replay it, matching it with a native speaker to easily note the differences in pronunciation.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although there aren't many constructive comments to make about ChineseSkill, it should be noted that the app focuses more on vocabulary than on grammar and sentence structure. If you are more advanced in this language or seeking specific practice on grammar, this app might not provide what you seek.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Anyone interested in learning Mandarin will find this app useful. Although it is mostly geared toward beginners and intermediates, even advanced Mandarin learners could find some elements useful, such as the referential tone chart. In addition, it could work well as either supplemental material for a class or a stand-alone learning platform.</p>
