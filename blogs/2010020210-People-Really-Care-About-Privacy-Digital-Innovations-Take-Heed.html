          <p>
            I think others have mentioned this story around the lab in the past, but I'd like to point out the recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2010/01/20/20readwriteweb-the-3-facebook-settings-every-user-should-c-29287.html?em">NYTimes article on Facebook privacy</a> for another reason. I've been surprised to see this article among the top emailed for almost 2 weeks now. I haven't seen many articles with the same staying power and I think it hints at how much people are worried about their privacy as they put their whole lives online. Even with Facebook's new privacy features, I've seen huge holes in the way you can access other people's info. For example, if a friend of mine comments on a photo of mine, then a complete stranger who is friends with my friend can actually follow a link to seem my whole album ... kind of worrying. 

In EdLab's Development & Research, we're thinking about ways to make privacy and data portability work together. With people posting things to Critter, taking courses on online learning environments, and connecting with colleagues through social networks, we think it is going to be important to be able to share all of the content people produce across applications while also giving them sensible and clear control over their data. How do others envision balancing sharing data and controlling your privacy online? What are some schemes out there for managing your data online that you think work?
