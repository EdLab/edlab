<p>Research breakthroughs take considerable resources, knowledge, and skill, and they often happen behind closed doors. Because of these steep investments, private companies, government funded labs, and universities often protect their innovative processes through patents or other legal barriers. The Open Innovation movement is looking to change this closed system by democratizing innovation.</p> 
 
<p>Open source software, crowdsourcing, and crowdfunding are all aspects of this movement that purposely opens the door to new innovations to anyone with internet access, tapping into to the talent of the entire world. The first wave of this kind of transformation was with the physical infrastructure for the internet: servers, cables, and routers. The second wave included software and other tools like search engines, social networks, or other apps.</p>  

<p>The next wave of this movement will impact health, energy, legal, and financial sectors, completing changing how they operate. Decentralized networks like  <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4975/what-is-blockchain-and-why-is-it-important">blockchain</a> technology are already beginning to impact these areas. How has the open source movement affected your industry? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/43972">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:57 Dallas Milanovich: </b>I don't know if I'd say innovation mostly occurred outside of the public eye. Of course having resources and knowledge is important, but those things don't only exist in labs and the offices of business execs - all sorts of grassroots innovation happens within communities and has happened since the dawn of time. Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>, the father of modern genetics - he was a monk! He certainly didn't receive government funding!</p>

<p><b>@01:20 Sara Hardman: </b>I am a bit skeptical of phrases such as "invoking innovation" and the idea of opening innovation up to the whole world. This make is seem like innovation can only happen in particular contexts, or when people consciously create environments for it to happen. While I feel like context is important, I also feel like innovation can happen anywhere, and often it happens in areas you wouldn't normally think it would.</p>
