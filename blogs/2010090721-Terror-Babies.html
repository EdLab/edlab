          <p>
            I recently watched a documentary on CNN titled  “Terror's Babies.” It was an interesting documentary as it highlighted a troubling trend in the ongoing battle against terrorism. In the documentary, Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert and State Rep. Debbie Riddle claimed that former FBI agents gave them information that illegal immigrants from foreign nations came to U.S to visit and give birth in order for their children to become U.S citizens, then take them back to their native country so they would train to become potential terrorists. The story of the aforementioned politicians took a drastic and unusual turn when host Anderson Cooper questioned their sources and asked them to present evidence to back up their claims. Both claimed there didn't have evidence to present at the moment. To further question the accuracy of their statements, former FBI official Thomas Fuentes noted the notion of “terror babies” is “absurd.”

I think the documentary and some of the themes it touched on, specifically the ones about illegal immigrants purposely giving birth in America and returning their babies to their native lands so they can train as terrorists is an unfortunate circumstance of post 9/11 bigotry towards Muslims, immigration and immigrants.  As the current furor over the proposed building of an Islamic center a few blocks away from Ground Zero suggest, “we the people” as a nation still got a long way to go before we can someday perfect our imperfect union. I think the politicians in the film and countless others across the nation are stirring up popular sentiment or conjure up baseless arguments to drum up votes in this critical election year.
