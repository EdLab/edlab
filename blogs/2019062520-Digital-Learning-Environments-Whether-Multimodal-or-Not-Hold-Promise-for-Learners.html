<p>Anyone who’s been a student in the twenty-first century can relate to clicking back and forth between images, primary sources, notes taken in class, and data visualizations spanning far more tabs than they’d like to admit they have open on their computer. Whether writing a research paper or simply trying to synthesize different information to solidify an opinion, connecting and confirming information in a digital learning environment (DLE) is often a complex, multimedia experience. However, while most students today use DLEs, little is known about how effectively students connect knowledge they learn from the different texts, images, and videos they consume digitally.</p> 

<p>In order to better understand how individuals integrate information, or reconcile contradicting information, from these different sources in order to effectively learn, a German researcher decided to study how students interacted differently in text-only environments versus in environments that involve both text and images. Ninety-seven university student participants were assigned to one of four conditions, viewing a) two sets of consistent documents with complementary pictures, b) two sets of consistent documents without pictures, c) two sets of inconsistent documents with pictures, or d) two sets of inconsistent documents without pictures. While participants reviewed each set of documents and took a recall and transfer test, their gaze was tracked, letting the researcher know how long and how often they looked at the information they were given.</p> 
 
<p>Analysis of the results revealed that inconsistent information changed gaze behavior, whether pictures were present or not. Participants spent more time fixated on text and images when they detected diverging information, indicating that the learners were re-activating information they were presented with beforehand. While duration of fixation differed on text vs. picture inconsistency, implying different strategies to resolve contradictions, comprehension wasn’t affected, as test results were comparable.</p> 

<p>These results imply that cognitive processes are similar for those learning on multi-modal or purely text-based DLEs. If anything, including images might provide new ways of learning and integrating new knowledge. Hopefully further studies can help illuminate the role other multimedia sources, like videos, play in the integration of information for online learners.</p>
