<p>Piedmont, Alabama has a population of under 5,000 and is about ten square miles in size. One of its biggest industries is textiles, with many of its citizens employed at textile mills. But as Matt Akin, superintendent of Piedmont Public Schools, emphasizes, the focus in schools is not to funnel students into the textile industry. Instead, the district hopes to inspire its students to get into coding, foreign languages, and STEM subjects.</p>

<p>The teachers in Piedmont are encouraged to understand how to use technology in the classroom so that it is fully integrated with the curriculum. As you look throughout the schools, students are using laptops to work independently on assignments, and teachers are projecting things like Kahoot—a game-based learning platform—onto the interactive white board at the front of the room.</p>

<p>What challenges do you see for fully integrating tech and computer science in rural schools? In what ways can these districts provide robust and challenging computer science curricula? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/27992/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:29 ABARRY:</b> Many students have the potential and ability to excel in certain areas of study. However, they're never given the opportunity to explore their talent.</p>

<p><b>@00:50 Beckieb:</b> Matt Akin is an educational leader that understands what is necessary to foster success for students in life post high school. It is crucial that the educational environment invites kids to tap into skills that they would not have access to otherwise, especially in a town with limited professional prospects.</p>
