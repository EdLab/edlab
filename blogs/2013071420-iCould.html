<p><a href="http://icould.com/">iCould</a> is an online resource from the UK for students who want to explore their career options and find out how other individuals started their careers. The site includes a library of video interviews with current professionals. These individuals describe how they got started, their daily tasks, and some of the challenges they face in their careers. Users can browse these videos by interest, job type, and interestingly, by life decision. iCould provides teachers with resources associated with particular careers, including activities and how-to guides for inspiring students.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The site distinguishes itself from similar sites by providing unique interview content. An example of this is asking professionals about the high point of their career. Interviewees talk about their own personal experiences, the path that led them to their career, and what they do on a daily basis.  All of this gives users a more realistic understanding of the particular career. The videos are grouped by career field, school subject, and life decision.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The information on the site is targeted toward students living in the UK. It would be helpful to see interviews from people in same profession but from different countries. In a global economy, users might benefit from comparing the career experiences of professionals working in different parts of the world.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>There are many resources that provide static data on <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/">jobs and careers</a>. iCould’s unique feature is that it provides real life accounts of professionals and their fields. The site has some interesting browse options including a tag cloud that allows users to look through tags and bring up videos grouped by keyword. The site’s most distinct feature is the ability to browse videos by life decisions pertaining to issues such as financial troubles, changing careers, following hobbies, and initial career failure. Users are able to search for video interviews created by professionals with similar life experience. The advice given in these videos may be more likely to engage students because they can relate to the experience of the featured professional. Armed with this information, students will have a better sense of real life careers before making one of the most important decisions of their lives.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>iCould provides career advice from real professionals in the field.</p>
