<b>Event Diary: Knewton/NYEdTech Meetup hosted demo/panel event @ Knewton's new offices...09.19.12</b>

After an exciting rain-drenched adventure downtown I arrived at the new <a href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a> offices just off union square on 5th Ave.  

<b>First impression of the space...</b> they went from a "start-up" fun vibe with legos and bikes everywhere to an office that reminded me of a <a href="http://www.westelm.com/">West Elm</a> ad, with dark wood floors and fancy fixtures. The space for the event was separated by a bank of elevators and the working space, when I peeked around a corner disregarding an "employees only" sign, contained low cubicles).  The event space was large with modern "bubble" lamps, an open bar, beer fridge and snack bar.  All attendees were provided leather lounge chairs.  Clearly Knewton's big corporate contracts (ASU etc.) are paying-off.  Basically Knewton was providing the space the NYEdTech Meetup emceed event to take-place.    

<b>Event Itself...</b>
Presenters: 
<a href="http://www.desire2learn.com/">Schoology</a>
<a href="http://www.haikulearning.com/">Haiku Learning</a> 
<a href="http://www.desire2learn.com/">Desire2Learn</a>
<a href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a> (formerly Canvas)
<a href="https://www.schoology.com/home.php">Schoology</a>

Presentations began with demos and thinking on the "future of LMS" from representatives from each of the above groups.  Most reps work in biz dev & marketing capacities with the exception of Jeremy Freidman from Schoology.  I have summarized overall sentiments from the group and then focus on specific points from the panel discussion.  If I had to bet on one of these systems to succeed... I would put my $ on Schoology.

<b>Overall future trends/issues in LMS:</b> 
-Move towards offering open APIs for educators & a marketplace of related apps for each LMS. 
-End goal for all to encourage "mastery-based" learning (track that students have accomplished one concept b4 moving to the next).
-LMS will become more integrated to "social" networks and sharing of evals with parents, students etc.
-Challenges of Twitter & open forum integration with privacy. 
-Risky but emerging trend towards sharing portfolios of student work through LMS. 
-RE: above: Privacy issues for K-12 related to <a href="http://www.coppa.org/">COPPA</a>. 
-LMS should encourage "just-in-time" learning through moment-to-moment recommendations.
-Tagging of metadata should be a priority.
-Emerging problem: content purchase transactions... should educators be able to buy content from one-another through LMS?
-Recurrent issue of educators need to remove "uptake time" for students to all log-in to various system... move towards removing "walls" & linking logins (this also brings-up COPPA concerns cited above).
-Danger of "edtech flavor of the week" coloring market integrity.
-Move towards customizable content on the front-end with LMS providers mostly handling back-end analytics. 
-You MUST have a teacher "data dashboard"... & potentially even one for learners. 
-Data interaction & integration not fully realized for mobile platforms. 

<b>Favorite quotes from the panel discussion</b>
"No one has figured-out yet whether the MOOC train is heading towards certification..."

"How long will sponsoring universities provide funding for MOOCs, as they are as yet untested?  How do you justify this to your board?"

"It's not about the tech it's about the learning."

"Free can be a good marketing decision (Dropbox, Flickr etc.)."

<b>Overall thoughts:</b>
-The presentations were way too long... 
-Panel discussion was the best part with much of the focus on filming & audio capture to then feature on the web. 
-Knewton management was conspicuously missing with only a few reps present. 
-Even though we always know a handful of people in every event it is important to keep the EdLab brand out there in the edtech world!  The "network effect" was alive and well as many past seminar speakers/EdTech Talk interviewees made glowing remarks about the EdLab to other attendees... sometimes you have to be on the ground to learn & share what is really happening in edtech! 

<b>New Knewton offices include an event space with a bar & leather lounge chairs for all attendees...</b>
