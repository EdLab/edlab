<p><i>"Minerva offers a unique undergraduate education. The intensive four-year experience is deliberately designed to enhance your intellectual growth and prepare you for success in todayâ€™s rapidly changing global context."</i> (<a href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu//">About Minerva</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The Mission Behind Minerva</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu//">Minerva</a> is a new type of liberal arts education that was established in 2013 by the Keck Graduate Institute and former Snapfish CEO Ben Nelson. Its founders believe that global education is integral to fostering the development of critical and creative learners who will transform the world. Minerva admits top students internationally using an application based entirely on merit. And not only is the tuition rate lower than a typical liberal arts college, there is also financial aid available. Minerva students are described as passionate, deeply curious, and motivated to make a difference.  About 78% of the  students come from outside the U.S., with the greatest proportion coming from Asia.</p>

<p><b>A Degree in a Greater Global Context</b></p>
 
<p>Minerva students engage with curriculum based on active participation and seminar discussions. Through thoughtful online conversations with their peers, students discuss Social Sciences, Computational Sciences, Natural Sciences, Arts & Humanities, and Business, each with a focus on four capacities: critical thinking, creative thinking, effective communication, and effective interaction. Based on the idea that more than half of current grade school students will have careers that do not yet exist, the program intends to develop students for both future educational and professional possibilities. </p>

<p><b>A College with Wings</b></p>

<p>Although Minerva hosts courses online, traveling is a part of the program, with residence halls located in different countries around the world. Incoming students start in San Francisco, as Minerva considers the city the hub and origin of the technology revolution. Second year students can move to Berlin and then Buenos Aires while they begin work on their Cornerstone courses. Third year students begin working on their capstone projects in Bangalore and Seoul. Students in their final year conclude their Minerva education with a final project created in London and Istanbul. With a 58 percent matriculation rate, the program is delivering a liberal arts education for the global community. </p>
