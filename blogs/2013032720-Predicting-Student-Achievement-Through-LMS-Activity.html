<p><b>Title:</b> Mining LMS Data to Develop an ‘‘Early Warning System" for Educators: A Proof of Concept (2010)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Leah P. Macfadyen & Shane Dawson</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The proliferation of MOOCs and online learning increasingly means that individual instructors are responsible for large groups of students. With larger class sizes, it becomes more difficult for educators to meaningfully assess the impact of teaching strategies. Traditional summative approaches, like exams and assignments, are results-oriented and typically do not reveal much about student learning strategies, student engagement, and other process aspects of learning. In research studies data from learning management systems has been successfully used in predictive analysis to identify at-risk students and enable timely pedagogical interventions. While such early warning tools can flag at-risk students and allow instructors to develop early intervention strategies, the authors of this study aim to investigate how accurately we can predict academic achievement based on students’ online activities.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The researchers looked at 15 online learning variables to forecast student success including:  total number of discussion messages posted, total number of mail messages sent, total number of assessments completed, time spent online, and degree of student engagement with peers. The authors found that students do not show simple univariate patterns of online behavior within course websites, but instead undertake complex composite behaviors and make individualized decisions to give more or less time to particular tools and activities.</p> 

<p>There are many paths to success, and the researchers were unable to identify a particular strategy that correlated universally with student achievement. It was quite a bit easier to identify whether particular students would fail. Logistic modeling was able to correctly identify 81% of the students who earned a failing grade. The authors also used network analysis on discussion forums data to explore the student learning community. The network visualization was able to easily identify students who were peripheral or absent from the learning network. Overall, the model explained more than 30% of the variation in students’ final grades.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
A major takeaway from this research is that in order to offer teachers meaningful indicators of student performance, dashboard-style visualizations of student tracking data for a selected course must be highly customizable to reflect variations in student strategy. The research also found that it was relatively easy to predict which students were at risk of failure based on activity in the course space. This information might be used in online learning environment development to automate the delivery of extra reminders and help to these students.</p>
