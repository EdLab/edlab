ResearchBroker outreach has mainly been one-on-one lead generation... but we have tried to broadcast it on more scalable platforms. Quora is one place we've checked out to see if we could generate discussion around the topic of finding research projects.

<a href="http://www.quora.com/Scientific-Research/Researchers-What-do-you-think-of-this-concept-for-finding-work?__snids__=86352571&__nsrc__=1" target="_blank"><img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/Screen shot 2013-01-17 at 9.27.23 AM.png" width="300px"/></a>

Quora is a question-asking site, with crowd-sourced answers from the Quora community. At first, our question got tagged as a "Promotion/Advertisement"... which would shed a pretty sleazy light on us. But a kind user responded with some simple tips on how to avoid this categorization and since then, we have managed to get 1,142 views on the question, 12 people following the question, and 2 respondents with some back-and-forth.

<b>1. Don't use words like "product" or "feedback". </b>
Instead we changed all instances of "product" into "tool" or "resource" and "feedback" into "your thoughts"... For example, the title was originally "Looking for feedback on ResearchBroker, a tool for connecting researchers to companies"... which we later changed to "Researchers: What do you think of this concept for finding work?"

<b>2. Broadcast it under a group that is relevant, but with a great following. </b>
We chose to broadcast our question under "Scientific Research" which has 90,249 followers, whereas "Research" has just 9,389 followers. Note: You can still apply multiple tags to a question, though I'm talking here about the main stream.

<b>3. Ask people to answer your question.</b>
After you post your question, you can select people to notify to answer your question. Some are "Free to ask", and others require points to ask. You gain points by being active on Quora...

Simple!

Does anyone have any other tips? Does anyone know of any awesome, and active education people on Quora that we should be following??
