<p>Stress has been linked to sleep deprivation, depression, and other health concerns. Considerable research and testing have been conducted on Internet and mobile-based Interventions (IMIs) for stress-management, but much of this research has focused on adults in the workplace. Because academic life poses its own unique stressors, understanding how students react to IMIs is also important. A team of researchers set out to understand these interventions on college students in German-speaking universities.</p>   

<p>In conjunction with a randomized clinical trial of IMIs, the researchers sampled ten participants for qualitative interviews about their experiences using Get.On Stress, an online stress management platform. Students used the platform for an eight week period, during which they read information related to stress management, wrote in a personal diary app, gained feedback from an online support coach, and completed muscle relaxation techniques and meditation exercises.</p>

<p>While the findings varied given the small sample size, the researchers were able to draw out some general themes. First, most of the students linked their motivation for participating in the study to stress from activities directly related to school, such as homework and exams. These problems led to a lack of sleep and time. Students were attracted to the Internet-based tool because it was flexible and provided anonymity, though, some wished that they could directly contact their online coach via more common apps like WhatsApp.</p>
 
<p>There seemed to be a divide in how students viewed the length and detail of the course, which left some wanting more, while others felt overwhelmed by the tasks. Most of the students agreed that the information provided was novel, but a few thought it was too basic. Half of the students wished that the platform provided more scientific information backing for the proposed interventions.</p>
 
<p>The findings from this inquiry suggest that the platform was useful for students, but it could be maximized through more customization to individual needs. The researchers especially recommended making the system less daunting by allowing students to audio record responses and entries, rather than just writing. They believe that this analysis will be useful in tandem with their future quantitative research on the clinical trials of this system.</p>
