<p><a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">Depression Quest</a> is not fun, but it’s not supposed to be. Instead, this pay-what-you want game is designed to be a learning simulation tool to help people understand what life is like for those with depression. Some of the game’s proceeds go to the the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The gameplay is akin to text-based simulations popular in the 1980s or even "Choose Your Own Adventure" books from the 1990s. Players start as a "mid-twenties human being" with a mundane job, a girlfriend named Alex, a distant but caring family, and a crippling bout of depression. Daily life scenarios are presented, such as decisions related to work and relationships, and users must decide how to respond. However, positive choices are often not allowed and sometimes only the bleakest options are available. Below is an example where the only selectable option further sinks the character’s mental health.</p> 

 <aside class="quotebox">
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>You have to be awake for work in a mere 8 hours, and you know your performance has been sagging lately, and that this won't help the situation one bit.</i> </p>
         <p> </p>
<h4>What do you do?</h4>

<ol type="1">
  <li><s>Force yourself to sleep.</li>
  <li>Go to bed. It shouldn't be that hard.</li>
  <li>Just close your eyes and let it happen. Why won't your thoughts back off for five seconds?</li>
  <li>Snap out of it. What is wrong with you? Why can't you stop stressing out for five seconds?</li>
  <li>You're probably going to go into work tomorrow exhausted and mess everything up and get fired.</s></li>
  <li>Go to your computer. Sleep is clearly not happening no matter how long you lay here.</li>
</ol>  
    </blockquote>
 </aside>

<p>
<p>This game does not have fancy graphics; instead, it relies heavily on evocative texts and a haunting piano score to evoke emotion. The entire game is fairly short and can be completed in around an hour. However, the creators concede that there is no real ending for the game because there is no real end to depression.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Depression Quest is difficult to play for long chunks of time. I found myself quite bored during my playthrough and even started feeling some ills from the dreary scenarios. Perhaps eliciting this kind of response was the hope of the creators, but I could only muster a few minutes of play at a time. Because of this uneasiness, I believe other players will give up on the game too quickly without absorbing its message.</p>  

<p>While the game is supposed to be a learning tool, I’m not sure it has a wide audience. Those with depression are warned of possible <i>triggers</i> from the dark content, meaning teachers should be hesitant about using the game as a classroom resource. Frankly, I’m not sure who is actually going to play through this game.</p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>It’s impossible to truly understand what it’s like to have depression if you are not suffering from it. Depression Quest is an admirable effort in building empathy, but while the game has a meaningful message, the grim delivery makes it difficult to share widely, especially for educators who must think about the wellbeing of their students. Garnering support for this cause through edtech should be more engaging in order to have greater impact, and unfortunately this game misses that mark.</p>
