<i> Sorry folks, this one's a little long, but please do bear with me as I start to get my ideas out there </i>

After my <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7770"> blog post</a> the other day I received quite a few interesting comments, and spent the last day or so going through <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PUYw3MgHTyiMHsMCw7rx0qCt2lWa4NdavWkl2s3vzlI/edit"> this Google doc</a>. I was looking to see what resources were already out there for teaching students the basics of information literacy (as well as more substantial topics students may find useful, like searching in particular databases or for specific kinds of materials).  I'm really looking to see what works and what doesn't work for providing effective and engaging lessons. And of course, keep in mind that while I'm focusing on library instruction at the college level (because that's what I'm most familiar with) I feel like the principles can be carried over to other subject areas and student levels.  

The specific challenge of course with library instruction is that in many cases professors expect their students to know, for example, how to find a scholarly journal article, assuming that the student has already been taught how to do it. Academic libraries do their best to reach out to faculty (particularly those who assign research papers and other research-based assignments), but outreach is not always successful. Virtual instruction is one way to bridge the knowledge gap (an instructor doesn't need to take time from their lecture to teach the information, and it takes the pressure off the reference desk to a certain extent, leaving the desk for research assistance). And of course, then there are a growing number of students who do most or all of their courses virtually, some of which may never step foot in the physical library while still drawing from its resources. I was especially inspired by <a href="http://esc.edu">Empire State College</a> and their <a href="http://subjectguides.esc.edu/workshops">synchonous virtual library workshops</a> after hearing about them last week. 

I'm not going to post my entire annotated list, but I will share a few of the better resources and tutorials I found on a spreadsheet on Google Docs that can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apm5nz2naLr_dE5GQnRha0pyTWpNaEFoY0l4VC1fc3c">here</a>. 

(There is one other resource I found that I'll have to explore more, <a href="http://ants.wetpaint.com/">ANTS</a>, which is designed for content creators.)

I'm also trying to think of things in relation to what would be actually useful. A major problem I see that's common in these tutorials (even the better ones) is that for the most part the people making these tutorials are not experts in designing online resources. There are design flaws and features that are lacking from tutorial to tutorial. Many of the tutorials I looked at lack interactive features (to keep students engaged) or assessment tools (to make sure students grasped the material, and if they didn't allow the instructor/librarian to make tweaks to better suit the users' needs). I'm also trying to keep in mind the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7786">post Rebekah made</a> about the studies done by the Gates Foundation. Some of what holds true for classroom teachers holds true for those of us that teach information literacy and our colleagues who teach on a more ongoing basis. 

A few questions to think about:
<li>What are best practices for information literacy instruction? Both face-to-face and virtually?</li>
<li>How can virtual instruction be integrated into a greater curriculum? In most instances, instruction occurs in conjunction with a project or assignment.</li>
<li>How can we make use of assessment tools? Most of the ones I saw had no real integration for grading. I have no idea if there was feedback for the instructor/librarian on the back end, but that would be invaluable information to have.</li>
<li>Are there ways to string together modules or segments of videos without having to make new tutorials for each assignment or course?</li>
<li>Could an interface be assembled in such a way like <a href="http://www.springshare.com/libguides/">Libguides</a>, where institutions can customize the interface for their institution? This could solve the issues in design and interface because it takes the interface design aspects out of the equation to a certain extent.</li>
<li>How could these ideas be integrated and used in a convincing way with products like Vialogues and Survey Sidekick? Can we build upon existing components to make something integrated that would be more powerful than the individual parts?</li> 

I'm curious to know what other people think on the topic. I'd love to see if I can get this to go somewhere.
