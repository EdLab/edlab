<p>When children play, they learn. Yet studies show that kids play less often now, both in school and out, than they did 20 years ago. Dr. Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a psychology professor at Temple University, is working to change that statistic as part of her research on how play affects learning. With a team of psychologists and architects, Hirsh-Pasek created the first Urban Thinkscape in Philadelphia. Urban Thinkscape is a playground designed to allow children and their parents to have meaningful learning experiences together.</p>

<p>Located near a bus stop in West Philadelphia, the Urban Thinkscape includes four playful learning activities that incorporate guided play. Unlike free play, guided play has specific learning goals and generally necessitates parents leading their children through activities. While playing, children practice skills such as numbers, language, creative thinking, and storytelling, all while waiting for the bus. Hirsh-Pasek hopes to expand this project to other cities around the country and to incorporate it into other public spaces, such as laundromats, grocery stores, and waiting rooms.</p>

<p>How do you think play affects learning? How can a child learn through play? How do you think play could be incorporated into public spaces not often associated with fun? Tell us about some of your experiences with play and learning <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48189">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:10 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> I understand how guided play leads to cognitive development, but don't understand from this video how these spaces will support social-emotional learning. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/sunday/democracy-play-mccain.html">this article</a>, Jonathon Haidt and Greg Lukianoff argue for the importance of unsupervised free play for learning skills such as independence and conflict resolution. It seems to me that both guided and free play have benefits for learning.</p>

<p><b>@01:28 Dallas Milanovich:</b> I blame the lack of play in young children these days on the pressure to participate in structured extra-curricular activities and tutoring. Parents are worried their kids won't be "well-rounded" if they don't participate in every sport, music lesson, and skill-based class, but this deprives them of play, which provided other generations with a creative and active release.</p>
