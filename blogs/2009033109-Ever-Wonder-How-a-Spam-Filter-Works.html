            A couple of us at EdLab's Development & Research are taking a machine learning course that has some really good applications to human learning and tools to support education. One interesting topic we just completed is that of classification systems based on probability models. We applied this tool to the task of classifying documents - i.e. figuring out whether an email is spam or regular mail or if some piece of text is by Shakespeare or Dickens. Such tools basically keeps track of all the words that occur in a document and generates a probability about whether the document is one class or the other. Usually, it uses information from previously classified documents to help it generate the probability for the new document. You can get a more <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/4771/notes/class8x.pdf">detailed set of documents showing exactly how this is done </a>. I also have some working code if anyone is interested in looking at that. 

A lot of these machine learning techniques have very direct applications to the work we are doing here, which is why it is good to at least know what is going on in this field (at least generally). For example, we are already thinking of ways to improve text recognition for our Fluensee application using some machine learning techniques. Creating more adaptive learning systems as well as systems that report and analyze large data sets (e.g. all that No Child Left Behind data) are other domains where such techniques might be really useful. 

You might wonder how to tell whether machine learning techniques would be useful in a specific project you are working on. Here is a simple recommendation in this regard: think about whether (as a human) you can identify some set of data involved in your project that might give you hints about future behaviors or inputs by users. If you have a reasonable way of identifying that prior data and the future outcome that is of interest to you, then come talk to one of us who is taking machine learning about how you might put those techniques to use.
