            In the October edition of the Atlantic is a<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/10/the-shame-of-college-sports/8643/?single_page=true ">long article</a> by Taylor Branch, historian of the civil rights era, titled “The Shame of College Sports”.  The basic issue (highlighted, for instance, in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_Baby_Athletic_Association">a recent South Park episode</a>) is that student-athletes in the university system are, (outside of athletic scholarships which are only given out in 1-year blocks, and are often withdrawn partway through the student's college career) uncompensated, whereas the television, gaming, and merchandising rights to the products of that labor are extremely lucrative.  The NCAA justifies this rule by arguing that students participating in college sports are amateurs, not professionals, more concerned with their studies than game-performance.
<!--break-->
What follows, after a short history of college athletics, is a series of dispiriting and unsavory anecdotes where we see the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) legally pressuring and punishing college athletes for attempting to do the exact same thing it does: profit off their labor.  Students who negotiate with professional sports teams, or receive free tattoos, or in any other way attempt to circumvent their own “amateur” status, face administrative action, and are often barred from playing, or will have their victories ruled illegitimate.  

Another unhappy consequence of the NCAA's “student-athletics” mission is the widespread academic fraud that universities encourage and enable so as to ensure their athletes don't fall so far behind that they'll be ineligible to play in sports events.   Although there are occasional scandals when specific incidents of this practice get out, Branch claims that “NCAA officials have tried to assert their dominion–and distract attention from the larger issues–by chasing frantically after petty violations.” 

One might respond that what the student-athletes get out of it is the opportunity to make their skills known to the professional sports leagues, and be recruited by them, but as Branch points out, “‘Approximately 1 percent of NCAA men's basketball players and 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted by NBA or NFL teams,' stated the 2001 [Knights Commission] report, basing its figures on a review of the previous 10 years, ‘and just being drafted is no assurance of a successful professional career.'”

As it is, college sports seem stuck halfway between amateur and professional.  
In my opinion, Branch makes a strong case for allowing paid compensation to student athletes, but what I would prefer is that we got all the way in the other direction, and ban athletic scholarships/recruiting, and make sure to enforce strict academic requirements on the athletes.  On the third hand, this proposal might just be because I don't have any experience of life at a big sports school.  Anybody with the relevant background want to share their thoughts?
