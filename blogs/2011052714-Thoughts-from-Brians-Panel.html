            Private:

Hi Everyone! 

I was able to "sneak-into" Brian's Pressible panel discussion today at <a href="http://blogs.tc.columbia.edu/creativityconference2011/">TC's Creativity, Play  and Imagination</a> across disciplines conference and here are some of my thoughts. Peter Beaugard, Assistant Professor in the College of Architecture and Design at Lawrence Tech, was also presenting and some insight from his fascinating presentation on design and a student-created learning platform is shared below as well.  Check-out <a href="http://studiocouturedetroit.org/index.html">Peter's amazing student-driven design studio</a> in Detroit. 

Thoughts from Brian with my questions mixed-in:

5 characteristics of a social learning tool:
Real - authentic
Public - not school only
Shared - community (who defines this?) 
Helpful- automated, data driven
Deep - emph. on content creation

How similar is Pressible to Tumblr as a microblogging hybrid?
 
<a href="http://themediashow.net/">The Media Show</a> 

Talked about media like YouTube in context of Pressible - importance of Recontextualizing media to be relevant to Ed & subject area - ex: would be UFR  how are we making the media relevant to the material? 

Too many scholarly rituals - instead, lets play in an academic context.

A social learning tool is:
Real
Public
Shared
Helpful
Deep

Potential problems with social learning tools:
Copy & paste - unthinking behavior (publicness can help)

May not reinforce scholarly norms like citation & attribution

May not be appropriate for peer-based learning


Peter Beaugard  from Lawrence Tech:

Design Naturally linked to the arts & language

Old paradigm - user error
New paradigm - creator error

Link of mythology to design

Democratization of design

Importance of not giving too much info to users - info overload

Don't want to be redundant

Design all about anticipation

Intrinsic v extrinsic motivation Ex: wanting to do a course for personal joy vs to get a grade - finding a balance (very important for Edfluences!) 

Use of online education  as a repository - asynchronous

Idea of millennial learner- many questions - high level of parental involvement?  How design for parents?
Do teachers give-out personal email?

To do: email Dino re putting videos from conference on Vialogues?

We should contact Peter re using Vialogues! 

Visual literacy of the time

Use a variety of deliverables IE print & digital to access many learners 

Chalkboard project (course management tool a student of Peter's designed for 5th graders - we need to see if we can access his slides, as the product is not launched).

Very graphically appealing, large "button-like" icons 

Student parent & teacher login - very graphical & iconic

Idea of "breadcrumbing" navigation trail  

Assessment? How do you test students for understanding 

Idea of reward - ex only place to find out what's for lunch

Importance of being able to customize your own page

What is "recess in an online environment?"

Importance of metaphors as icons! 

Vialogues would be perfect to show how students engage with video
