            The Early Childhood session on Saturday morning consisted of an all-star panel, including Dr. Tobin and Dr. Souto Manning (Discussant: Dr. Eugene Garcia). While Dr. Souto Manning presented her observational study of how teachers can create a “third space” to involve immigrant children, notice the “expected” and “unexpected” discourses disclosed by children's conversations and make their linguistic and cultural differences “visible” in the classroom, Dr. Tobin and his colleagues talked about a cross-national project (“Children Across Borders”) in five countries investigating: 1) teachers of immigrant children, and 2) parents' participation in classroom, and the connection between teaching/parents' participation and the culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP).

Some findings were revealed from their study: while teachers desired to implement what they learned about CRP at graduate school into classroom, they found it very hard to make connections from theory to practice, because of complex and disturbing issues arisen from their own cultural conflict with parents, e.g., in the process of inviting parents to classroom. The background of “invitation to parents” is introduced in the England case: after new legislation in England, schools are demanded to integrate parents' “voices” in classroom curriculum. However, the observation video showed that when parents of immigrant children were invited to sit with teachers and talked how they read picture books to children at home, all teachers couldn't help but started to interrupt and teach parents what reading should be done at home; also, some parents were not comfortable with sharing their “cultural voices” with teachers. Meanwhile, other countries such as France don't advocate the notion of parents' participation, just excluding them from their children's classroom…

All the cases gave us a chance to ponder and rethink the “best practices” through the CRP. What would be the best for children and their families? As Dr. Garcia discussed, it is time for us [researchers and teachers in the U.S.] to rethink the definition of this pedagogy; it is the time to localize solutions and understandings in classroom; it is time to notice that maybe we are imposing the American notion of involving parents and ignoring where they come from; it is time to consider more the entire well-being of immigrant children's families than just the children, their community and the Funds of Knowledge; and it is also time to take actions and think about the overall legal, social, and linguistic backgrounds of immigrant families in the U.S. [e.g. the new legislation in Arizona State depriving immigration].

During the session, I kept thinking about the “cultural models” embedded in Chinese families. When I was visiting a public school in Chinatown last year, parents of Chinese immigrant children, who lack the fluency in English speaking, were eager to “obey” instructional needs given by teachers. Rather than sharing “Chinese cultural models” with teachers, they chose to accommodate for learning all main-stream cultural models and let their children get as much as possible from the “white” culture…In this case, how could a white teacher bring Chinese cultural voices to her classroom, with such a conflicted requirement brought up by Chinese parents?

Some programs are moving too fast (!), Dr. Garcia commented that, instead of bringing the pedagogy into classroom in a rush, teachers should take time to carefully think about “cultural integration” in their individual classroom.

I value the notion that children from diverse cultures need to learn to “see” and value differences. But I also believe that teachers should help immigrant children adapt to American society for their future success. Culturally responsiveness is an indispensable component in classroom curriculum. However, is it the dominant emphasis? Early childhood teachers may not be over-obsessed with this concept rather than first observing the classroom contexts. In early childhood, what should be valued and presented most in the curriculum? Some people might argue that it is too clichÃ© to talk about developmental appropriateness and child-centeredness. I feel that the happiness of an individual child should be the core. Through playful learning, children learn various basic knowledge, ways of thinking, ways of argument, ways of respecting and understanding others (including cultural differences) in an “organic” learning environment. To know more about their parents, their families and communities, it takes time to investigate. It is a process that teachers really need to put heart in. Teaching is fluid while full of investigation and understanding. Teaching is far more than a profession, it is a noble career, full of moral responsibility, artistic design, and aesthetic permeation.
