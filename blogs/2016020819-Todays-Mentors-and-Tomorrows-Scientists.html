<p>Everyone can benefit from a role model. Students especially may gain a lot not only from having someone to look up to, but also from someone prompting them with challenging and engaging questions. An expert and professional in the field can be an apt mentor, particularly in the specialized, inquiry-driven context of science. Researchers therefore sought to determine the effects of having scientists as online mentors for students learning science.</p>
 
<p>The study utilized a computer-based program called PlantingScience, which integrates scientific inquiry, classroom instruction, and online mentoring from scientists who ranged from professors to graduate students with specialties in different subtopics. Seventh graders from a rural public school were placed into 10 different teams, each of which was partnered with a scientist for six weeks. </p>
 
<p>This study considered several different measures to evaluate the effect of mentors. Motivational support was determined by the mentors’ word choice and textual expressions, including capitalization or use of emoticons. Autonomy support was defined as how much the mentor encouraged independent problem solving. The mentors were also evaluated based on their competence support, which was comprised of feedback that challenged students without "giving away the answer." Student inquiry engagement was measured at each stage in the experimental process—research questioning, making predictions, developing the experimental design, making observations, analyzing results, drawing conclusions, and proposing future research.</p>
 
<p>The top three motivationally supportive scientists used a great deal of questioning, including questions to determine the students’ background knowledge, elicit clarifications or justifications from students, and encourage students to draw conclusions. The researchers also found that the highest levels of student engagement were seen during the prediction phase, and less so during the experimental design phase. This could be due to the uncertainty students may feel while making predictions, causing them to reach out for support.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the authors of this study found that there is a relationship between motivational support from online mentors and student engagement in scientific inquiry, even though they could not conclusively determine causality. The challenge, however, in implementing a program like PlantingScience to take advantage of this finding is seeking scientists who have the time and the training to foster these strong connections with students. Perhaps online mentorship programs may spring up in the future, rooted in the proper research and training to provide grade school students with enough encouragement and support to get them interested in STEM.</p>
