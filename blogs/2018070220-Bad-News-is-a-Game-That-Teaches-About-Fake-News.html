<p>What can educators do about the growing prevalence of misinformation spread via social media? The only answer seems to be by building stronger media literacy skills. DROG, a Dutch-based organization, and Cambridge University have teamed up to create a new resource for educators focusing on this pressing issue. <a href="https://www.getbadnews.com/#intro">Bad News</a> is a game geared at boosting media literacy by letting students become "fake news-mongers." </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Playing Bad News is very simple. The game can be played from a browser on a phone, tablet, or computer, and there is no sign-up required! Anyone can just go to the website and immediately start playing.</p>   

<p>Gameplay is akin to <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-text-based-video-games-4152013">old text-based games</a> from the 80s and 90s. Players must choose various actions related to spreading fake news and building followers on Twitter, and are awarded badges for their nefarious accomplishments. For instance, in one part of the game, I chose to impersonate the NASA Twitter account by using a slightly altered handle, @NASÄ, instead of the real <a href="https://twitter.com/nasa">@NASA</a> handle, and won the Impersonation badge for making up my title as editor in chief at a nonexistent newspaper. These types of lessons train students to think about similar impersonations on real social media.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the game that I liked is that it considers issues in new media from all sides of the political spectrum. Players are reminded that fake news can be spread from both the left and right. At one point in the game, I was given the choice to either attack the government or big business, highlighting conspiracy theories that have emerged from both the far right and far left.</p>    

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Bad News is a fun way to introduce ideas in media literacy, the game is somewhat limiting. It only takes 20 minutes to complete. Further, gameplay would benefit from the inclusion of some extra creativity. For instance, when choosing a name for my fake newspaper, I was forced to pick between three pre-made selections. I think it would be more engaging if users could come up with their own titles.</p> 

<p>Even though the game is free and there is no sign-up, the creators are hoping to draw research from the people playing it. Though players can opt out of surveys throughout, educators should be aware of this aspect if using the game as a classroom tool. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Bad News is a nice companion game for educators teaching media literacy. The organization even provides a simple <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qAL83zCsfgWykcCMQ7-k8pQD4oiBVuxg
">teacher’s guide</a>  for using the game in classrooms. It will only offer one lesson’s worth of material, but it is a solid, free resource that kids will enjoy playing through, while also getting them to think critically about sources and motivations on social media.</p>
