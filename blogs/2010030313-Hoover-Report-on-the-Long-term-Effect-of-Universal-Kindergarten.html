          <p>
            The Hoover Institution/Education Next at Stanford just released <a href="http://educationnext.org/what-happened-when-kindergarten-went-universal/">results of a new study</a> conducted by a professor of economics at Dartmouth College about the long-term effects of universal kindergarten on Caucasian and African American students. Surprisingly, the research findings indicate that the policy of universal kindergarten though with a large, immediate impact on kindergarten participation, has had little impact so far on the outcomes of attendants' earnings, employment, public assistance receipt, etc. One notable exception is that Caucasians of kindergarten age, after passage of a funding initiative, were less likely to reside in prisons or institutionalized group quarters as adults.

<img class="alignnone" src="http://educationnext.org/files/ednext_20102_62_fig3.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="444" />

The results also imply that there were some positive impacts of state subsidization of kindergarten, particularly on incarceration rates, however, the positive effects were unexpectedly only for Caucasians. Caucasians also seemed to have more education as adults as a result of the initiatives, but the effect was quite small.

The researcher suggests the reasons for the positive effects on whites regarding dropout and incarceration is not entirely clear and should be grounds for future research.  From this report, I feel that many qualitative studies can be linked together, e.g., African American teachers' and parents' perceptions toward teaching and learning, ethnographic studies on African American communities, research on voices of African American students and their perceptions of surviving in high schools (e.g., Farrell, 1988), etc. It is obvious that a one-year universal kindergarten program is not going to change the academic outcomes of disadvantaged students in the long run. What then would be the next decision from the national and state governments?  Should more funding go to the reduction of class sizes of African/Hispanic American students? And should more teacher development and parent programs go to districts resided by disadvantaged students?
