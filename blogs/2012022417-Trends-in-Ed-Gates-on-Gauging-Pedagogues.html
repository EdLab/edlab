            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/opinion/for-teachers-shame-is-no-solution.html">Here is Bill Gates</a>, in the New York Times, trying to put the brakes on incipient overuse of new and fancy teacher evaluation metrics. Gates has been a powerful (measured at least in millions of dollars) and effective voice for education reform for a while now, and although he's often criticized for the specific policies he pushes, at least he's willing to change his mind, as he did on the issue of small class sizes.

Gates, responding to recent efforts in New York and elsewhere to publicize teacher ratings, argues that this represents an over-reliance on what should be only one of many tools. “At Microsoft,” he argues, “we created a rigorous personnel system, but we would never have thought about using employee evaluations to embarrass people, much less publish them in a newspaper. A good personnel system encourages employees and managers to work together to set clear, achievable goals.” How convincing you find this may depend on your opinion of Microsoft's products, but on the merits of the issue he makes a strong case.

Even the strongest advocates of the new value-added methodologies of teacher assessment are careful to make clear that the data won't be able to justify the kind of snap judgments parents and education consumers will base upon them. There's too much noise; scores can vary too much, too quickly.  Gates argues that this over-reach will damage the cause of responsible education reform, and cast doubt on "the most powerful idea in education today."
