<p><a href="http://bouncykids.net/">Bouncy the People Trainer</a> is a program designed to help children ages four to six develop a mindset of perseverance and resilience. Through interactive stories, live videos, and music and art activities, young children learn that they can do anything they set their minds to. Their guide through this journey is a three-legged dog named Bouncy. Bouncy the People Trainer is available for free on the iPad.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>It’s easy to navigate around the app, even for non-readers. There is audio guidance throughout and children can be completely self-directed, further increasing their sense of agency. The badges earned at each level of the program also help increase engagement. </p>

<p>The app offers users many ways to interact with the concepts, which should appeal to many types of learners. The interactive story illustrates Bouncy’s journey from struggle to resilience with fun sounds and animations. Art activities allow users to color in key phrases while music activities allow them to drum along to special songs about resilience. Live videos show real kids modeling these self-efficacy behaviors, such as taking a breath and starting again after a mistake. The app continually reinforces concepts to support understanding, including through quizzes at the end of each level.</p>

<p>To further create a sense of agency, users are invited to create an avatar when they begin using the app. This avatar is then inserted into an animated story where Bouncy helps the avatar learn how to be brave enough to try skateboarding. This strategy brings users into the experience and encourages them to imagine themselves in similar situations.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While the app is inspiring and engaging, I wonder how much impact it would have without outside support. The teacher’s version of the app, which is available for $19.99, includes supplementary materials and lessons that would be helpful for reinforcing key ideas. For parents, it would be probably be helpful to spend some time engaging with kids about the material after each level of the app. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Bouncy the People Trainer is a fun and inspiring program that teaches young children that there are no limits to what they can achieve.</p>
