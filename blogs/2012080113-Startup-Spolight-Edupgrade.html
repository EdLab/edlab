<b>Details & Back-story</b>
<a href="http://edupgrade.org/">Edupgrade</a>  is a nonprofit organization that connects teachers and developers to help create innovative learning technologies. The creators of Edupgrade- Beth Rabbitt, Jennie Dougherty, and Ben Brete -  believe that teachers and developers are not connecting as much as they should, and so their site serves as a way to connect them on or offline. Teachers would apply through the website by submitting a <a href="http://edupbeta.moonfruit.com/?utm_source=Official+Innovative+Teacher+Network&utm_campaign=c0ee871a99-3_17_2012&utm_medium=email#/sign-up/4560038272">membership application</a>, and edu-tech companies would <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFplcUQ1YWhTSktsODlZSVhHVkZnSFE6MQ">apply here.</a> After getting accepted teachers would have access to a separate site where they will be able to select education applications that be a perfect fit in their classrooms, and then report on their effectiveness which will be valuable the the developers of the educational technology in improving the tech's teaching power. 

<b>Unique Point-of-Difference</b>
This is one of the few educational websites that helps educators connect with other professional, and this might be the only site that specifically helps teachers and developers connect to create better educational technologies

<b>Edlab Relevance</b>
Edupgrade is much like the Edlab's own growing project, Learning Technologies Community Reviews (formely ALT) in many ways. Both initiatives are connecting educators to people of other professions to help create better learning technologies. The difference is that the Learning Technologies Community Reviews (LTCR) will set out to connect educators with developers, researchers, students, venture capitalists and more. LTCR will also evaluate educational technologies through our educational research-based review written by people with different background but the same passion for education, and present them to the public. At the moment it's uncertain whether or not Edupgrade will show off any of their evaluations on educational technologies. 

<b>Our Takeaway</b>
The website itself is very interesting, and adapts to the size of your browser window. If the window is wide or narrow the user will see a different UI that fits to the size of your window, which is a very interesting UI design.
