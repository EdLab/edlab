<p>Virtual reality is making a huge impact as an exposure therapy tool that helps people get over their phobias. Part of Samsung’s <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ae/launchingpeople/">#BeFearless campaign</a>, this video shows one woman’s experience using VR therapy to confront her fear of public speaking. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3591/public-speaking-is-no-easier-in-virtual-reality"> Research shows</a> that people get just as nervous in front of a virtual audience as they do in front of a real audience, so practicing public speaking with a VR headset could help prep fearful speakers for the real deal.</p>

<p>The woman in this video, named Salminaz, goes through several stages of VR therapy. At first, she practices speaking in front of a small group of four virtual students, but the audience grows as her speaking skills improve. In order to pass each level, she must talk smoothly and confidently for a designated amount of time. The last level contains an auditorium filled with one hundred audience members. Although Salminaz grips her seat nervously at the beginning of her VR therapy, by the end, she appears calm and says she feels free and more confident engaging with an audience.</p>

<p>Why do you think people get as nervous in front of a virtual audience as they do in front of a real one? Samsung’s #BeFearless campaign also targets people with a fear of heights. Do you think VR therapies can be more effective than traditional methods? Share your comments<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30872/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:44 Victoria57251:</b> This seems fantastic! But the real test will come when they can translate their interactions with technology to one with people.</p>

<p><b>@01:44 RuthS:</b> The advantages of this type of therapy is that it is so easy to set up and repeat again and again. The disadvantages are that even the most advanced VR headsets can't capture the full scope of a real-life situation.</p>
