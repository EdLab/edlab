<p>How might students respond to literature using digital arts tools in the K-12 classroom? Could students use those tools to design the aesthetic qualities of their work while conveying comprehension? A recent qualitative study examined how an eighth-grade public school teacher incorporated digital comics into an intervention class for students who had failed to pass their English language arts state exam. The authors conducted student interviews and examined the digital comics students created in order to gauge comprehension levels and understand aesthetic choices.</p>

<p>The teacher in the invention class introduced students to graphic novels and a comic creation software called <a href="http://plasq.com/apps/comiclife/macwin/">Comic Life</a>. Students began to experiment with Comic Life to create a multimodal representation of a selected scene from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)"><i>The Outsiders</i></a>, a novel they had just read. Students were guided to conduct their own internet searches for images that might represent the relevant characters and settings, and make individual decisions regarding adding dialogue and narration into their comic representations.</p>

<p>The authors found that students had created comics with unique inter-textual meaning. Students specifically chose metaphorically resonant images from a range of cultural texts and added dialogue and colors to their comics to signal the mood and atmosphere of selected novel scenes. Overall, students leveraged multiple digital, artistic, personal, and popular culture resources to make meaning with digital comics. The authors also discovered that students applied primarily standard templates to the overall design of their comics and that they expressed a lack of engagement with the novel in interviews.</p>

<p>While the authors did not study the impact of digital comic making on students’ academic performance, the practice seemed to provide a space for them to tap into the experiential, sensory, and creative aspects of reading and writing. Digital comics served as an alternative for students’ reflective literary expressions; moreover, the comics helped students to reflect on selected key moments in a story and combine their literary, cultural, and aesthetic perspectives to reinforce their comprehension of the novel. This case shows that digital arts can add to classroom learning and engage readers and writers to create literary expressions using new perspectives.</p>
