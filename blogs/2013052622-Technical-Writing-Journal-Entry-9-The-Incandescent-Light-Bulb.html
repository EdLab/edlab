            Hey everyone. For today's blog, I just wanted to share a writing assignment from my technical writing class. The assignment was to describe any current innovation in a technical manner. For my paper, I chose to describe the light bulb simply because it's so common that we overlook just how important a role it plays in our lives. So far I am halfway through my paper and I came across some interesting history behind the light bulb and its components.
<blockquote>
HISTORY
Contrary to the popular belief that the first light bulb was made by Thomas Edison, it was actually the English chemist, Humphry Davy, who developed the first electric light in 1809. Davy did so by connecting two pieces of wires to a battery and the other ends to a strip of carbon (Lienhard n.d.). The current flowed through the carbon and caused it to glow resulting in the first electric arc. 

Other innovators followed, contributing to the design and experimenting with different filaments and materials. In 1878 Sir Joseph Wilson Swan became the first to invent a practical longer lasting light bulb. Although lasting longer than that of his predecessors, Swans bulb still burnt up quickly to be practical (The Incandescent Light Bulb, n.d.). It wasn't until only a year later in 1879 that Thomas Edison discovered that a carbon filament in a bulb without oxygen would burn for a much longer period of time. Edison thus invented the longest lasting bulb yet, burning for over 40 hours. Further improvements on his method allowed Edison to eventually create a light bulb that could last up to 1500 hours.

Other modifications to the light bulb included the development of the tungsten filament by The General Electric Company (History of the Light Bulb, n.d). Because of its strength and high melting point, this filament was able to burn brighter and last much longer than others. Due to the fact that the burning filaments would evaporate and cause a black film to cover the inside of the bulbs, inert gases (nitrogen and argon) were added to the bulb to prevent this.
