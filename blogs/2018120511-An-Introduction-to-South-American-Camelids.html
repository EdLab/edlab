            <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Animals, like celebrity couples and
basketball shoes, come in and out of fashion. The trendy woodland creature of
2018 will likely give way to a mythical beast stealing the hearts and
imaginations of the populace once January comes round. While I invite you to
wonder at what creature will be on our mugs and sweaters next spring, I will
not be offering my predictions in this post; more importantly, I write to
address a desire by one Ryan Wu to possess the knowledge to properly identify
one of this season's trendy animals: the llama. Of course I would be remorse if
I didn't address the llama's brethren, which are often unfairly excluded from
these discussions. So, here you are, Ryan, and world: an overview of South American
camelids. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">What are camelids?</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"></span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Camelids are members of the biological
family Camelidae and include all species of camels (yup, there are like three
different species of camel) as well as four camelids indigenous to South
America. Camelids are large herbivores with split upper lips, long necks, and
three-chambered stomachs (instead of four, like cows, deer, and sheep, which
are part of another family of mammals called ruminants). They also have
elliptically shaped red blood cells which allow for added oxygen consumption at
high altitudes. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">One of the most distinctive characteristics
of camelids are their toes. They do not have hooves, but rather two-toed feet
with toenails and soft foot pads. These are excellent for gripping rocky rocks
(aka treacherous terrain), which is very important for our South American
camelid friends living in the Andes.</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">What are the South American camelids?</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"></span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Why I'm so glad you asked! There are four
camelid species residing in South America: the alpaca, the guanaco, the vicuña,
and of course, the llama. Alpacas and llamas are domestic, while vicuñas and
guanacos represent their wild relatives. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">What is the difference between these four
species?</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"></span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Here's the SparkNotes version:</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Llama: The Big One.</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Alpaca: The Very Wooly One.</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Vicuña: The Small and Elegant One.</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Guanaco: If it doesn't fit in the above
categories, it's a guanaco. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Here's a bit more detail:</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Llamas</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> are the most well-known of the
South American camelids. As the largest of the group, they grow to be
nearly four feet at the shoulders (up to six feet at the top of their head),
and can weigh between 280 and 450 pounds. Llamas have been used as pack animals
for centuries and as such were instrumental in the construction of
Machu Picchu. They're sassy, stubborn, smart, and social, but are
also pretty peeved at you for spreading that rumor about them spitting all the
time. Llamas do spit, but not often, and not without reason; spitting is a
social cue to other llamas when asserting superiority, expressing contempt, or
for the purpose of self defense. Examples of proper occasions for spitting
include but are not limited to the following: you're a lady llama and a dude
llama is interested in something you are NOT interested in reciprocating;
you're a dude llama who knows another dude llama definitely can't lift as much
as he says he can and needs a good neck wrestle to learn some humility; you're
a llama whose little sister llama is being a selfish glutton and is trying to
eat all your food. Moral of the story? Bad behavior gets you a big hunk of
green goo in the face. Take note, humans.</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Alpacas</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> might not have as much
personality as llamas, but they are lovably kind. They are the ones responsible
for all those soft sweaters, scarves, and hats that often sport images (or
mistaken for images) of those traitorous llamas everyone seems to love so much
these days. Their soft wool is their defining feature; their dense, full-body
fluff make them look sort of like they stuck one of their toes in an electrical
socket. Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, coming up to 3 feet at
the shoulders and weighing between 105 and 185 pounds. Because they are bred
for their wool and not their labor, their behavior is similar to that of sheep,
so though they build social hierarchies, the herd mentality is strong. Proof of
point: when one alpaca has to poop, typically a whole bunch of other alpacas
realize they also have to poop so they all go together and create communal dung
piles. Because alpacas like to relieve themselves in the same place time after
time, they are actually fairly easy to house train. Want a pet alpaca? Here is
your excuse to move out of the city. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Vicuñas</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> are delicate, elegant, and
graceful, looking strikingly like gazelles when running. They are the
ballerinas of the camelid world. Alpacas and llamas are united in their hate of
them and their sleek bodies and their
who-me-I'm-just-a-sweet-innocent-little-vicuña act. However, like all Marilyn
Monroes of the world, vicuñas have suffered pretty significantly for being
gorgeous. Honestly, if you're going to look up more about any one of these four
camelids, choose vicuñas because their history with Incan royalty and the
illegal wool trade is fascinating. All I'll say is this: Herman Adams,
President Eisenhower's Chief of Staff, was forced to resign in 1958 for
accepting a coat made of vicuña wool. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">At only 3 feet tall and weighing a maximum
of 90 pounds, vicuñas are the smallest of the South American camelids, and used
to populate the Andes in numbers close to 3 million. Because their cinnamon coats
are finer than cashmere (the finest of all fibers, 12 micrometers in
diameter compared to the 50 micrometers of sheep's wool), however, they were
hunted until only 5,000 remained in the 1960s. They're heavily protected now,
and their population has been restored to about 350,000, but they're still a
rare sight, and are almost exclusively found high up in the Peruvian Andes.
They're very timid and wary of intruders, but as wild animals, they're entitled
to that. They also have better hearing and eyesight than other camelids, so
they have both talent AND beauty and should be respected. Did you hear that,
llamas in the back? </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Guanacos</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> are (I hate to say it, but) the
least memorable of the four South American camelids. They really don't deserve
it, though; they can spit up to six feet (llamas want you to know that they can
spit between 10 and 15 feet), their wool is second only to the vicuña in terms
of fineness, and they are the ancestors of the domestic species. Always playing
second fiddle, guanacos are one of the largest wild animals in the Andes but
still smaller and more slender than llamas, weighing in around 175 to 265
pounds and coming up to about 3.6 or 3.8 feet tall at the shoulders. They can,
however run the fastest - up to 40 miles per hour - and can run almost from
birth. Respect. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Like vicuñas, guanacos have faced their fair
share of poaching because of their fine wool. However, while 90% of vicuñas
live in Peru, guanacos are mostly found in Chile and Argentina. In fact,
guanacos really put the "camel" in camelid, as they live not only in
the mountains, but in the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, where
they survive on water-bearing cacti flowers and lichen. No camel hump, though.
I was going to make a jab at camels not being able to run as fast as guanacos
because of the hump, but it turns out that camels can also run at 40 miles per
hour. I am too impressed to come up with a better way to end this section, so
I'll just leave you to YouTube some footage of running camels.</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">How can I tell all these awesome camelids
apart?</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"></span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">Beyond size, physical features like ears,
wool, and face shape can be helpful when differentiating between South American
camelids. Llama ears are banana shaped, with an inward curve, while alpaca ears
are smaller, straighter, and blunter. Llamas and guanacos have longer faces
than alpacas and vicuñas, but vicuñas and guanacos have similar wool - fine and
smooth - while alpacas have wool that looks like a well-groomed sheep's and
llamas have wool that can look longer when groomed, or like one of those sad,
sad mountain sheep that's been left out in the rain. </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">In terms of behavior, llamas are the easiest
to pick out. They tend to be pretty independently minded, while the others fit
better under the categorization of herd animals and tend to be more skittish.
Alpacas, however, can also be differentiated by their ability to be amiable
companions for humans.</span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"> </span></p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">In conclusion...</span></b><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;"></span></p><p>






















































































</p><p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Helvetica;color:black;">As a child, I was that kid that memorized a
whole bunch of animal facts and took every opportunity possible to share them
with anyone who so much as glanced my way. Clearly I have not changed that
much, as I ended up devoting quite a bit of my free time to giving a far more
thorough answer to a question Ryan probably expected me to respond to in a
couple paragraphs. But it made me happy, and hopefully it will give some of you
a new conversation starter or two when at those awkward dinner parties and
networking events when you don't know anyone. The again, maybe only I think
they're awkward because the sorts of conversation starters I use are things
like, "Did you know alpacas use communal dung piles?" </span></p>
