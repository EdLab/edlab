          <p>
            I went to the ER on Thursday. 

No, it was not for me, and no it was not life-threatening. 

My roommate, it turns out, had an allergic reaction to Excedrin. Made me feel kinda bad about poo-pooing it as a case of food poisoning. But that's besides the point. 

Though our wait was relatively short (we were out in two hours, which is a miracle compared to Queens ERs), my roommate confided that it hadn't really done much to ease her, physically or mentally. 

For out of those two hours, an hour and a half was spent waiting for the actual doctor. <i>(read more)</i>
<!--break-->
The remaining half hour was spent in my roommate speaking to a doctor for ten minutes, receiving her release form, and finding her way to the waiting room to find me. Efficient. 

Hospitals, I believe, after courts and public offices, best demonstrate our American bureaucratic way of life. Take for example, this illustration of American hierarchy: 

1.	Nurse escorts roommate to room, takes vitals and leaves.
2.	Comes in another nurse to collect information about her, informs roommate she can watch TV.
3.	PA comes in to examine her, leaves.
4.	Actual doctor comes in to confirm what the PA said. 

<b>Doctor</b>: *looking at her* Mmm... you had an allergic reaction to something, but your body's absorbing it. 
<b>Roommate</b>: Yeah, but to what exactly?
<b>Doctor</b>: Mmm... <u>we don't know</u>. You should go to an allergen doctor to get tested. I'll go sign your release form. 

So much for that $600 ride in the ambulance, all for naught. If we had known that this was about the only diagnosis we were going to get, we might as well have tucked her in bed and gave her some Benadryl. 

Nonetheless, is this kind of treatment some sick joke construed upon us by "The Man"? No, I doubt it. 

One of the strongest features of the Roman Empire that helped it to succeed (and bring about its downfall ironically) was bureaucracy (aside from its military strength and slave labor). It was the only way an empire as vast as that could have been run efficiently without confusion and differences. I think it's safe to say that for a nation the size of the United States, a bureaucracy is needed. 

Which may be bureaucracy's Achilles heel. There's no need for a bureaucratic system if the population is too small, but because of the vast size, a bureaucracy cannot be personal and all warm and fuzzy. 

While we were still waiting for my roommate to be taken in, there was a woman lying in a stretcher, obviously in pain and distress. She had been there before us, and soon her quiet weeping started escalating, in both noise and violence. 

<i>”They don't respect my injury here! They're terrible! I'd rather go home! They don't respect me!”</i> she screamed over and over again into her cell phone. The triage nurses merely shushed her. 

Everyone wants to go home as soon as possible. Everyone wants to know what's wrong and have their problem fixed right away. Everyone has places to be. What can you do though? Other than to try to tweak the system by making inside connections or trying to beat the system by submitting everything early or never becoming sick — how do you avoid bureaucracy and its hold on our lives?
