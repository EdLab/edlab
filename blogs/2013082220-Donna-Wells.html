<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My high school, college and graduate school experiences were dramatically different, which was challenging at the time but something I deeply appreciate now.  I learned first-hand that people’s motivation and performance were completely driven by their organization’s culture and incentive systems.  For example, my public California high school set low expectations for all of its students and got just the results it expected.  My private, northeastern undergraduate university fostered a hyper-competitive environment, portraying academic achievement as a zero-sum game.  This was superb training for a successful Wall Street career.  But poor preparation for leadership roles in the Age of the Knowledge Worker we were entering.
<p>
My graduate school experience has been the model I’ve tried to live throughout my career.  The school was exceptionally selective in who they admitted, solving for diversity, academic excellence and social skills.  My classmates included doctors, artists, professional athletes and, yes, Wall Street veterans.  What we shared, though, was the certainly that we had all earned our way in through hard work, and that we were expected to raise our standards even higher over the next two years.  What made that possible was the positive culture, reinforced and nurtured by the organization’s systems and norms.  The school gave equal support and respect to students headed to the public or private sector, to for- and not-for profit organizations, science, academia and the arts. And encouraged us to learn from and stay close to each other. It’s a model for how to successfully run any organization today, in my opinion. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’ve lived the disruption of two global industries and those experiences drive me in my current work…to disrupt a third.
When I joined American Express, travel planning was still a charming, but inefficient and expensive process requiring a visit to your travel agent at her brochure- and poster-strewn office.  When I left Expedia, the entire industry had gone online and DIY, increasing convenience and reducing costs.  There were negative impacts as well.  By 2005 the major players were all struggling to differentiate themselves in what was now a commodity business.
<p>
The financial services industry was similar.  Payments went digital while I was with American Express, investment management went online while I was with Charles Schwab & Co., and personal financial management moved to the web during my years with myCFO, Intuit and Mint.com. 
<p>
I’ve seen time and time again that small teams of dedicated, talented people can change consumer behavior and market economics using the right ideas and the right technology. In fact, it’s the only way that I’ve seen industries transformed.
<p>
I’m applying those experiences in my current role, leading a start-up on a mission to transform how organizations train their employees.  We’ve seen companies transition their accounting, marketing, customer service, operations and virtually all other key functions to the web…while the $30 billion training industry remains largely stuck in a 1950’s mode of live training.  We believe that this is largely due to the historically poor technology and therefore poor trainee experience that online training has delivered.  And that’s what we’re working to revolutionize.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> My team’s work should transform the role of the corporate trainer, the learning outcomes for trainees and the C-Suite perspective on Learning and Development. We provide online training software that removes virtually all the administrative burden of hosting, tracking, analyzing and reporting on online courses.  And that’s so easy to use, that no IT support is required to launch or modify courses.  This allows professional trainers to spend their time doing the work that they are uniquely capable of:  Learning and Development strategy, training content development, coaching, etc. It also allows them to rapidly respond to changing company, competitive and market conditions … and to trainee feedback …all critically important in our increasingly dynamic and unpredictable work lives.
<p>
All adult learning research clearly shows that frequent, short and interactive educational experiences increase learners’ comprehension and retention.  We’re delivering a tool that enables educators to create (and learners to have) exactly that learning experience in the only way it can cost-effectively occur:  online. 
<p>
Lastly, we’re providing organizations with transparency and accountability for their investment in training, often for the first time.  Our customers can quantify and demonstrate to their CEO and CFO the true impact of time and dollars spent on employee training on their business results, using our advanced learning analytics tools, created in partnership with the Big Data innovator, GoodData.
<p>
We’re hopeful that we’re creating a future state where trainers are allowed to do their best work, where trainees get more and better on-the-job learning, and where senior management feels confident in the ROI of their training budget.  Frankly, isn’t that a place all of us would like to work?
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>The rush to remote work worldwide (37% of global workers forecast to be remote by 2015 according to IDC) is making it significantly more challenging for organizations to design and deliver an effective Learning and Development program.  First, they’re struggling to create and maintain the global, multi-lingual Knowledge Bases required to ensure that all employees have access to job-critical information anywhere/anytime.  Second, they face the challenge of ensuring that proprietary information remains secure, while still making it available to employees across myriad devices.  Third, and perhaps most challenging, they are being forced to invent new methods for measuring employee performance from afar and ensuring ongoing professional development for people that may rarely have live interactions with their boss, peers or other subject matter experts in the company.  Having said that, I’m incredibly excited by the potential of new technologies to radically improve the online training experience.  We’ve already seen a quantum improvement in teleconferencing quality, and that will only become more affordable over time.  The incorporation of powerful video, audio and GPS technologies into desktop, handheld and, soon, wearable devices give us exceptional opportunities.  I believe we’ll first leverage these technologies to more closely replicate the best aspects of the live training experiences online, but quickly move forward in applying them to create an online learning experience that’s in many ways superior.  One that’s more objective, more personal and more relevant based on the collection and instant analysis of potentially thousands of data captured about the learner, their learning modality and preferences, and their unique needs.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We’re just this month launching a public beta test of some exciting technology developed by Stanford computer science PhD’s.  It’s popularly known as "look-away" technology, and it’s going to give trainers (and their CEO’s) the confidence that critical training content is being reviewed and understood.  In its first version, our FocusAssist feature will pause the course display if a trainee taking a course gets distracted.  But that’s just our starting point.  We can still do so much more to provide meaningful, real-time feedback to trainers on their trainees’ engagement, emotional response and feedback to course content.  I think the revolution in the e-learning space is just beginning.  And the next wave of innovation looks to be amazing.
