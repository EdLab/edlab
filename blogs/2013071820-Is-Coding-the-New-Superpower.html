Computers are everywhere, but how many people actually know how to read and write code?   With only one in ten schools offering classes in computer science, who will fill the increasing number of programming jobs available for people around the world?  In this video, a number of successful coders, including Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Drew Houston, Jack Dorsey, and even basketball star Chris Bosh, come together to send people a simple message about the importance of being able to code regardless of where you work.  Many of them compare coding to sports, reading, or music; it may seem intimidating at first, but it’s an extremely useful skill once you learn it. <p>

Moreover, these coders see computer programming as the future of technology and our lives.  As Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve, said, "The programmers of tomorrow are the magicians of the future."  Do you think coding is the new superpower that everyone should learn?  Add your thoughts to the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8292">Vialogues</a>. <p>
 

<b>@00:00 35654:</b> I think it’s amazing that some people have the patience and creativity to code and create new programs.  It would be awesome if more schools taught students how to code.  We need to prepare them for the future job market and it seems like that’s the direction we’re headed in! <p>

<b>@00:24 jagnitti:</b> it’s really refreshing to hear that some of these people learned how to code in college.  It seems like so many programmers started/mastered their languages at such a young age.  It’s enough to make someone like me (who wants to code!) feel discouraged to do so… But not anymore! <p>

<b>@01:14 danielblee:</b> I see programming as a foundational life skill that should be developed at an early age.  In the video they compare it to music and athletics, I think another parallel would be home economics.  Being able to cook and sew are skills that you use throughout your life, and that improve your quality of life.  Technology is an integral part of our modern lives—knowing how to code helps you to better understand and get the most out of the world around you. <p>
