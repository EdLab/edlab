<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1Y4MKZC">Guido Kovalskys</a> is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1t47aGN">Nearpod</a>, a startup that creates interactive learning experiences for the classroom. A serial entrepreneur, he also founded several other companies, including Panarea Digital, a startup that creates mobile learning experiences. He recently served as a fellow and lecturer at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University. He received his bachelors from the University of Buenos Aires, his MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and worked at McKinsey before starting his entrepreneurial endeavors </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>I've been an entrepreneur for most of my professional life and education seemed like a natural next step. My previous work in tech, healthcare, and education led me to start Nearpod. I then joined the Stanford d.school as a fellow (working on Nearpod) and I fell even more in love with the use case of the live classroom. I'm convinced that learning in a group setting in the same physical location is the best way to learn.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>The work we're doing in Nearpod has two innovative sides to it. From a product standpoint, we are creating cloud-based software that helps teachers support a new instructional modality that we call <a href="http://bit.ly/1NuaKT0">"the interactive lecture."</a> We're also innovators with our go-to market. The concept of offering freemium services in K–12 education is quite new and our bottom-up approach is proving to be very effective. This post called <a href="http://bit.ly/1VOEL3k">"Why is Nearpod Free?"</a> can be helpful in understanding our approach to monetization. We signed our first contract a bit over three years ago and we're already $5M in annual recurrent revenues and growing fast so this model is proving to work well. K–12 education has traditionally not been very welcoming to startups without large sales teams on the ground. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Research will prove that the success of edtech is closely related to the ability of teachers to implement it effectively in their classrooms. More focus will be placed in teacher preparation and less on building the killer software edu-app. The realization that "standardized testing" only perpetuates the industrialization of schools. Also, project-based learning will gain significant momentum.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>NearpodVR is where our current product efforts are focused. This <a href="http://on.wsj.com/1YQDxlr">article</a> and this <a href="http://bit.ly/1NucITF">teacher blog</a> will give you lots of great information about why we think that our "low tech" approach to virtual reality is the right one for classrooms today. There are lots of great things in the pipeline. The most exciting ones have to do with helping teachers solve some of their biggest pain points. We're working on very innovative and scalable solutions for improving teacher professional development and solving the substitute teaching crisis in America. Both can be game changers if we execute properly.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1Svf1T4">Susie Wise</a>, the director of the <a href="http://bit.ly/1VUdcF9">K–12 Lab</a> at Stanford's d.school. <a href="http://bit.ly/1NMrJeb">Elon Musk</a> is making history. He's an inspiration for millions. His work can (and should) be discussed in classrooms from elementary ELA to HS science. <a href="http://bit.ly/12EIeaE">Audrey Watters</a> brings an independent and cynical perspective to an industry (edtech) that has been drinking a lot of its own Kool-Aid lately. <a href="http://bit.ly/1T0uiKZ">XQ America</a> is trying to redesign high school. <a href="http://bit.ly/1WQwhYr">Teachers Pay Teachers</a> because they've built the biggest community of teachers ever. <a href="http://bit.ly/21dbWN8">Alice Keeler</a> shares tech tips that any teacher can follow, not only the tech savvy ones. <a href="http://bit.ly/20RIV9P">EdSurge</a> keeps me informed about the industry. <a href="http://bit.ly/1NuhG2C">The Darwin Awards</a> gives me 20 seconds of fun every day and <a href="http://bit.ly/1rv8iCp">Stanford VR</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1NMtjN6">Drew Olanoff</a> help me follow virtual reality news.</p>
