<p>Lab test animals often live in prison-like conditions, such as in small boxes with little to no social interactions or mental stimuli. These creatures are often more obese, have weaker immune systems, and are at a greater risk for cancer than their wild counterparts. For years, scientists thought that keeping test animals in simple conditions minimized the number of variables, making extermination easier. New research now suggests that these unnatural living conditions for rats, guinea pigs, or other lab animals can alter test results, possibly connecting to research replication problems. </p>  

<p>When scientists in Australia began to put toys and other stimuli in their lab rat enclosures, they found that their rodents tended to be healthier. Researchers are now saying that companions, toys, and puzzles allow lab animals to be more physiologically like wild animals. The University of Michigan has even opened a research center specifically on the study of these enrichment practices, called the <a href="http://animalcare.umich.edu/animal-use/refinement-enrichment-advancements-laboratory">Refinement & Enrichment Advancements Laboratory</a>. </p>  

<p>Some scientists are still skeptical of this new trend and worry that these interventions will negatively impact replication. If these skeptics are right, should we return to the old methods of housing lab animals? Should we even be conducting scientific tests on animals at all?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:12 Dallas Milanovich: </b>So glad this is happening - it always seems to me that scientists and animal rights activists get unfairly pitted against each other. This presents a middle ground, wherein it is recognized that lab animals are not being treated right but there are solutions that help both them and people benefiting from the drugs they're testing.</p>

<p><b>@01:31 Ruth S: </b>It's no surprise to me that play and toys help the lab rodents have a better quality of life. I wonder if the same thing can be true of humans. Does play contribute to better health?</p>
