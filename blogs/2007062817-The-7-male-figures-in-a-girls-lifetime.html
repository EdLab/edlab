            So after 20 years of living without a father, my dad decides to “grace” me with his presence recently. Upon receiving his phone call I pondered the types of male figures and guys that have entered my life, and of course 15 years experience of girl-talk has led me to come to the conclusion that there are 7 categories which a guy falls into within a girl's life. Some types of men might think they are one or the other but there are fine gray lines between some of these categories, so most likely it is possible to be more than one type of man. Also, to each and every girl you might represent a different category even if you might not admit it, gentlemen. So please be forewarned that these may not necessarily be ALL the categories, but in one way or another, if you can think of any more they probably more or less fall into one of these (one way shape or form). <i>Ah! And of course these descriptions can also vary from one girl to another. </i>
<P>

<b>The stalker/peeping tom</b>
<i>This is the guy that secretly has a crush on you, or maybe it's not such a secret. Just because he can be open about his feelings for you doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a stalker - more like a stalker with a lot of guts or maybe a big ego. Either way, he's the guy who never really had a chance in hell with you. Although you don't mind the attention and admiration from a distance, the second it invades some personal space or crosses the line of sanity is when you pick up the phone to call the police.</i>
<P>

<b>The best friend</b>
<i>He is the one that you can tell all your secrets to, although he can sometimes be judgmental at the things you tell him, in the end you know that he will always be there for you. More often times then you would like to admit he is your voice of reason and tells you things you really don't want to hear. You've been through everything with him, and once a lover of yours says one word of complaint about him its “good riddance to them”. He is usually the all around good guy who takes your moaning and whining from everyday stress and in the past at one time or another you've had a crush on. But as all great friendships need a time of trial, you've bypassed such feelings knowing the risk it entailed. He's the one that will be your savior when all else is crumbling and sometimes can also be the one to make your world crumble. But still, no matter how many times either one of you screw up or how far the distance, he'll always be the one to dig you out of your own mess.</i>
<P>

<b>The first love</b>
<i>The first love is the one person/ boyfriend that all the other boys are compared to. He'll be the first one who will give you the over the fence, reach for the stars, World Series kind of feeling. The one that will make you little bit on the obsessed side; He is the… can't eat, can't sleep, and thinking of him day/night illness. And at the end of it he will be the one to break your heart into a million little pieces. But yet even when you look back years from now, it will not be with a regretful heart.</i>
<P>

<b>The crush/the ideal</b>
<i>Sweaty hands, weak knees, and puppy eyes. Yep! These are the symptoms you get when you see this man. Although some girls fall for the pin-up pretty boy who have it all: athleticism, intelligence, and dashing good looks, to others it comes in a different form. To some it might be the older bad boy, who despite all his imperfections is still viewed as flawless in your eyes. He is the one you will never get or probably “the one that got away”. Either way, the memory of him will be stored up in that secret place you dare not mention to your spouse years later.</i>
<P>

<b>The creep</b>
<i>He pulls your hair, teases you, and is your sworn enemy. The sight of him repulses you and yet without him you would have no drama or intrigue in your life. Even though you would hate to admit it he is probably a pretty intelligent individual thinking up such evil thoughts to make your life hell. I mean most likely you'll meet this person in elementary school, but like I said before these can vary (ahem* college). Still, you must remember that this vermin you consider to be the offspring of Lucifer does (in fact probably)have a mother, so I'll spare you the next couple of lines. And may all you men who fall into this category be blessed with a son just as charming as yourself.</i> 
<P>

<b>The true love</b>
<i>Were you expecting Prince Charming? Well here is the guy who'll give you a news flash - there is no such thing. He shows you all his flaws: flatulence, burping, messy, and loud. He too accepts you for all your flaws: the nagging, your need to be a perfectionist, and your rage. He might not be the one that treats you the best, but he's the one you know you truly care about. He will never seize to amaze you with how much he cares, and will most likely be the one you marry. (Well… nowadays maybe the one you marry within the first two marriages) He will mend your heart back into one from the million pieces it once was, and be the proof that this kind of love still exists in the world. And by this kind of love I mean the love that no one speaks of, you know the “your poop smells like roses”, “I'll clean the dishes tonight” *mumbles to self*, and “I don't mind sleeping on the couch tonight” kind of love.</i>
<P>

<b>The “not so father, father”</b>
<i>It takes a special kind of man and human being to fall into this category. After all he can come in many forms: a teacher, a mentor, or a pastor. No matter what shape or form they all have one thing in common - they have a big heart. A heart that is big enough to hold love for someone who isn't their own. To these men, I am most grateful. With all the drunk, violent, gambling, irresponsible men out there they restore a small part of a girl's mind that thinks all men are dogs/scum. They believe that all girls are princesses and show to us the softer side of those who carry high levels of testosterone. They aren't afraid to show love and kindness, and they will always be highly respected. They are the one whose approval is sought after; they are the “not so father, father”.</i>


Although your opinion on this matter might differ, I still believe in my theory of these 7 categories that men fall under. And like it or not ladies we're stuck with them!
