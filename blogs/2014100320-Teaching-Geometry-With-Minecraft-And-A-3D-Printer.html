For years, educators have used some form of games (e.g., Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, Oregon Trail) in the classroom to teach students. In recent years, there has been a lot of research into gaming and its impact on student learning. However, in an era of increased accountability where student success is measured by standardized test scores, it seems there is little room for teachers to implement educational games in the classroom. But games offer opportunities for struggling students, so they might offer another way for such students to comprehend and further understand the materials they are taught in class. <p>

Minecraft, the popular block building game, offers an educational component in which students learn about math and geometrical concepts. During Minecraft gameplay, students think and experience 3D concepts and upon completion can use a 3D printer to print out the shapes they created. As a result, students are able to manipulate and experiment with their creations and make connections with the shapes.<p>

What other educational games are practical and useful in the classroom? Is there a place for educational games in the classroom? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16573">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>02:32 zjjhfy: </b> Now the 3D printers come in to enable the students to physically experience the shape. <p>

<b> 03:07 yfang: </b> It is my own experience that students are fascinated at the printing process and will spend a long time observing and thinking.
