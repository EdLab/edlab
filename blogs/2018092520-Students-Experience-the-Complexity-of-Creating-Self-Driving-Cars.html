<p>Stanford graduate students got a taste of the complexity involved in developing autonomous vehicles through a recent robot competition. Teams were tasked with programming a robot that could explore a simulated neighborhood and identify animals in need of rescue. Despite their small size, the robots utilized most of the sensors found on self-driving cars. </p>

<p>In addition to fulfilling the project requirements, students could develop extensions to equip their robots with other capacities, such as the ability to react to an unexpected bicycle crossing the road. Do you think projects like this help students develop skills they can use beyond the classroom? Could similar projects be implemented in undergraduate education or high school? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44456">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:09 Betsy Harrington:</b> Projects like this give students a great opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to skills that seem relevant to real life. I would love to develop a classroom project in which the map simulates the neighborhood around the school. This would force students to consider not only the robot, but the environmental characteristics of their neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>@01:52 RuthS: </b>Projects that utilize transferable skills have more potential to help students outside of school, and this project seems to do that. This is especially true at a time when self-driving cars are being tested, modified, and improved. People studying this field have a huge potential to make an impact.</p>
