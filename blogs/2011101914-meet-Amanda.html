<em>Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</em> I just began my first semester at Teachers College. I'm in the MA TESOL K-12 Certification program.

<em>Whereâ€™s your hometown? </em>I  am from a small town outside of Syracuse, NY, which is located right in  the middle of New York State. Contrary to popular belief, Syracuse is,  in fact, quite a drive from New York City.
<div>

<em>Your favorite meal? </em>I view meals as a social activity, so give me some great food, great people, and great conversation and I'm set.

<em>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:</em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkP_NaMsrMM&amp;noredirect=1"> Hoppipolla</a> by Sigur Ros. A professor once told me we should all have a theme  song (if you don't have one, get one) and that one is mine.

<em>What did you want to be when you grew up? </em>I'm still not really sure what I want to be when I grow up...?  But in terms of past wants, I used to want to be an interior designer, a  teacher, a librarian, working for<em> any</em> non-profit (highly do not  recommend--if you're not truly invested in the organization's  mission, you will dread going to work every day)... My choices  have changed frequently, and still do, but I seem to be honing in.<a href="http://826boston.org/"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12900" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/bigfoot-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="142" height="142" /></a>

</div>
<em> </em><em>What was your first job? </em>I  have previously worked as a laboratory research assistant at the  Greater Boston Bigfoot Research Institute, with a focus in cryptozoological  habitats.
<div>

I have also previously served as an AmeriCorps VISTA  (colloquially known as the domestic version of the Peace Corps) at  Syracuse University, acting as a liaison between students at the  university and community-based agencies around Syracuse.
<p style="text-align: left"><em>A book you strongly recommend?</em> Since it keeps coming up in a surprising number of conversations, a book I would recommend is <a href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/search?searchArg=Born%20to%20Run:%20A%20Hidden%20Tribe%20Superathletes%20and%20the%20Greatest%20Race%20the%20World%20has%20Never%20Seen%20&amp;searchCode=GKEY^*&amp;recCount=50&amp;searchType=1"><em>Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World has Never Seen</em> by Christopher McDougall</a>.</p>

I've been to so many collegiate men's lacrosse final fours that I've lost count.</p>
<em>Best places to read:</em> cozy couch with some natural light, on a blanket in a grassy London square in the spring (I know it's not exactly close by, but it still holds true), and the subway (I have found this is an excellent place for your reading on the side--the books that aren't for class that you can't seem to find the time to read).<a href="http://hoodedutilitarian.com/2011/01/strange-windowskeeping-up-with-the-goonses-part-7/"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12902" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/LondonRussellSquare-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

<em>Strangest thing ever done:</em> Not  sure about the strangest thing I've EVER done, but the majority of my strange  adventures seem to happen when I'm visiting my brother in Los Angeles.  Take, for example, dressing up as a flamingo for a music video... yup,  that happened.

<em>The most fascinating person I've ever met was: </em>One single person who I have found to be fascinating beyond all others does not come to mind. But I do find all of my friends to be incredibly fascinating--that's why I enjoy hanging out with them.
