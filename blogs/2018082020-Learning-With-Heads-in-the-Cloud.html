<p>The Government of Tanzania and its development partners are seeking to improve the quality of education by equipping government-sponsored secondary schools with eLearning platforms. However, the cost to install and maintain computer labs in schools has hindered the project. Researchers found that in 2018, only 31.4% of government secondary schools have one or more computers, and just 20.1% of these schools have access to the internet. Instead of fighting for more computer labs, these researchers proposed implementing cloud-based learning that students can access on their phones.</p>
 
<p>To test the feasibility of their solution, the researchers distributed 1,050 questionnaires to seven secondary schools in Tanzania. The 820 responses revealed that more than half of the students have access to the internet at home via smartphone. However, of these students, most spend less than $0.05 per week on internet expenses, which researchers saw as an indicator that many students cannot afford high quality internet. The research team suggested that the Government of Tanzania subsidize the cost of internet for citizens in lieu of equipping schools with computer labs and internet. If students have internet on their phones, they can engage in cloud-based eLearning both at home and at school, without the need for school computers.</p>
 
<p>In addition to lack of internet access, the researchers also discovered a lack of knowledge about available internet-based learning platforms. Of the students surveyed, 87.6% reported that they use their phones to play and download music, indicating a fairly high level of internet literacy. However, only 53% of students were aware of eLearning platforms currently sponsored by NGOs in Tanzania.</p>

<p>The researchers concluded that Tanzanian students have the computer literacy to benefit from cloud-based eLearning. Utilizing mobile devices for eLearning is a cost-effective solution that has the potential to foster student learning in and out of school.</p>
