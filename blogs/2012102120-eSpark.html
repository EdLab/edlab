<p><i>Students are not as successful as they can be, and it is not the fault of students. We, as adults and educators, must do a better job of meeting students’ needs (<a href="http://esparklearning.com/">eSpark report</a>.) </i>


<p><b>Fun Meets Learning</b></p>
<p><a href="http://esparklearning.com/">eSpark</a> seeks to connect content to students by acting as a platform for over 53,000 different educational apps. The system uses data from existing school testing to diagnose each student’s learning level and then creates a custom "playlist" of apps based on their individual needs. eSpark was in the 2011 class at incubator <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/31/500-startups-unleashes-34-spooktacular-companies-and-1-thrilling-video-for-its-next-group/">500 Startups</a> and has the business model to prove it. The site offers educational grants to new subscribers and focuses on whole school and whole classroom subscriptions. Founder <a href="http://esparklearning.com/about-us">David Vinca</a>, himself a former teacher, has built a team with impressive educational credentials to appeal to educators. The company has also invested in research to appeal to schools and has racked up some impressive improvement rates in <a href="http://esparklearning.com/testimonials-interviews-and-case-studies/">pilot programs</a> across the country. Based around a classroom set of iPads or iPods, eSpark is meant to take the guesswork out of technology in education and promises to select quality apps tailored to individual student needs.</p> 

<p><b>Bridging the Startup and the Classroom</b></p>
<p>eSpark might just be the curation engine education has been looking for. While it has similarities to content creation platforms like <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a> and <a href="http://learnzillion.com/">LearnZillion</a>, it is most closely connected to curation sites like <a href="http://emergingtech.tbr.edu/">TBR eMerging Resources</a> or <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/">EdSurge</a>. If eSpark is successful, it should make destination sites for curation obsolete. The system harnesses the work of edtech startups to the careful selection of eSpark’s educator-heavy team. The result of this fusion is a wider audience for the apps and a reliable, automated way to introduce technology for teachers. The system also aggregates student performance data for teacher analysis, making it easy for teachers to pinpoint problem areas for individual students. eSpark’s success, like that of any curation-focused technology, will depend on a constantly developing roster of quality apps and greater accessibility through adapting to a wider range of classroom technologies with BYOD support. The incorporation of technology in the classroom and the possibility to extend classroom quality learning beyond the traditional school day have the potential to dramatically change the way we educate. eSpark is well-poised to offer vetted, simple access to the learning technologies that will facilitate this change.</p>
