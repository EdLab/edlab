          <p>
            The Thomas Fordham Institute, a conservative education policy think-tank, has <a href="http://www.edexcellence.net/publications-issues/publications/high-flyers.html">put out a paper</a> analyzing what happens to the “high fliers” in our school system.  Most education policy thinking is, understandably, focused on improving the performance of the lowest-scoring groups in school.  This report, pushing against the current, focuses on the highest-performing students, and tracks them through their high school careers.

Description:

The authors looked at “students who scored extremely well on the NWEA [Northwest Evaluation Association] assessment, known as the Measures of Academic Progress,” and tracked how many high performing students fell down into the general population, how many remained in the high-performing group, and how many rose up from the general population over discrete periods (elementary school to middle school, middle school to high school).  They also measured how much each group (high-achieving and low-achieving) progressed during those periods.  

Their conclusions, appropriately general for such non-specific data, are that our current focus on “gap-closing” (reducing the distance between lowest and highest performing students) may also be producing some “leveling” (by simply reducing the performance of the high-fliers).  There may be some lost opportunities involved in not worrying about those students who, for instance, fall out of the high-fliers group over the course of the grade or high school career.

Edlab Relevance:

It strikes me that in considering how technology can improve education, what you're going to be looking at and developing could vary quite dramatically depending on whether you're trying to improve the performance of the average student, the 10th percentile student, or the 90th percentile student.  All the focus on “spaced repetition,” for instance, might be less appropriate for students who can quickly grasp and apply concepts, and need a program that can keep up.

P.S. I see that <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6518">someone</a> is way ahead of me here.
