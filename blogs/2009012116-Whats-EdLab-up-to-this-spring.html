          <p>
            It turns out that we EdLabbers have a lot going on this Spring. Below are my notes from today's seminar, in which everyone shared a taste of things to come. My notes probably don't do the best job of communicating each project - please correct me or add in more content in a comment if you'd like to clarify the way your project is described.

If you heard about a project today that you'd like to know more about, or contribute to, or ask a question about, please don't hesitate to speak with the project leaders to learn more.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/559">I</a></b> kicked things off by introducing the upcoming exhibit featuring innovations in the TC Program in Nutrition. This program is organizing a conference on April 4th to celebrate their 100th anniversary. The exhibit will open in late March to coincide with the conference. Exhibit material will include historical items from the TC collection as well as modern-day examples of how Nutrition Education at Teachers College has (and continues to be) an innovator in their field. Anyone interested in learning more about our historic collections, or sharing your own knowledge of the field of nutrition education, should get in touch with me asap!

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/555">Faisal</a></b> introduced his Discussion Overlay Web Application (DOW). This app overlays discussion onto video. Faisal is interested in your ideas about how a tool like this could be used, as well as settings that might find it useful.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/363">Erin</a></b> and <b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/285">Laura</a></b> told us a bit about the next School Redesign. They're interested in taking more of a documentary-style approach this time around, and they're interested in everyone's help finding teachers who would be interested in working on a school redesign project with their students.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/14">Hui Soo</a></b> and <b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/149">Eric</a></b> talked about the TC101 project. This will be a new way to introduce new TC students to TC history and other useful info. So far, they're considering including elements like an online gallery/experience, an online game, a face to face workshop, and a 1 credit orientation course. The online game might involve a scavenger hunt-style search for free food on campus. An online game might include a way to visualize TC's buildings that's similar to Google street view. This resource might merge a tour of the physical spaces on campus with more information about departments and programs. The 1-credit course might include a reading list that could help to unite the entire TC community.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/285">Laura</a></b> was kind enough to speak for <b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/433">Simon</a></b> (who's "on the beat" in DC today). Simon is currently taking the lead on a rethinking of the way AfterEd does the news. His idea is to enhance the audience base by collaborating with other educational news organizations. He would appreciate your help thinking about groups or organizations to collaborate with.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/557">Jessica</a></b> and <b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/274">George</a></b> introduced us to their Barack Obama Resource project, which will serve as a resource for teachers and students interested in learning more about Obama. They're thinking about including an element on the site that would allow people to upload and share relevant lesson plans. If you know of any good educational resources related to Obama, let Jessica and George know - they're interested in collecting as many good examples as possible.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/568">Doug</a></b> introduced two projects. First, he's interested in working on a project that explores informal assessment models that empower students using media. He's working on a proposal that would give the EdLab the opportunity to collaborate around media production with teachers and students.

Second, Doug has begun a collaboration with a school on the Lower East Side on a Google maps mashup project. He's going to support the students in collecting material to use to populate their own neighborhood maps. 

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/7">Gary</a></b> has a few upcoming projects in the works, including: 1) Thinking about how the library can do a better job of activating its resources to make it a less passive environment; 2) The development of more intuitive ways to connect people with funding opportunities, and; 3) Continued thinking about an EdLab degree program.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/426">Gus</a></b> told us about her current work to improve the Media Show by producing shorter episodes an publishing them on YouTube. She's got some PSA parodies in the works.

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/14">Hui Soo</a></b> and <b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/555">Faisal</a></b> told us about their Live Syllabus project. This idea is for an intelligent syllabus tool that will suggest options based on your user profile.
