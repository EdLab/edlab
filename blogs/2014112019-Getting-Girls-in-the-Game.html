The need for our schools to provide students with a strong background in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is one of the hottest current issues in education. The argument is that our students need a robust education in these areas to be able to compete in a global economy as adults. However, there is a large disparity in the percentages of boys and girls who pursue STEM fields in college and subsequently in professional life. <p>

How can we close this gender gap? Girls Who Code is a national organization that hopes to play its part in increasing educational and professional opportunities in STEM for girls. Although 74% of girls express an interest in STEM subjects, only 0.3% choose computer science as a college major. Additionally, fewer than 12% of computer science graduates are women. Girls Who Code offers a host of programs for young girls in subjects such as web design and mobile development. With a major increase in computer science jobs anticipated in the coming years, Girls Who Code is working to ensure that girls have the interest and necessary skills to fill at least half of those positions. <p>

Why are girls underrepresented in the STEM fields? What can we do to close this gender gap? <a href= "https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/17469">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>01:13 jagnitti: </b>She's teaching her father how to code? That's awesome! You don't often hear that story, usually it's just about a kid who wants to learn to code so that they can create the next big app. <p>

<b>02:21 g7status: </b> The argument that the mediaâ€™s portrayal of computer science as a male only field has merit. Programs like Girls Who Code can hopefully buck this trend and motivate young girls to pursue educational and professional opportunities in computer science.
