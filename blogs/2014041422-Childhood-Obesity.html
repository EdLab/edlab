          <p>
            One of the most enduring health issues in America remains <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/health/obesity-studies-tell-two-stories-both-right.html?ref=health&_r=1#">obesity</a>, especially among young people. As a result, there have been countless studies and researches over the years about the total number of young Americans affected by obesity. Seventeen percent of Americans, aged 2-19, are affected by obesity, a 5% increase from the 1970s. However, as this NY Times article highlights, some of these studies have been questioned, especially in terms of methodology, though both paint a grim picture of youth obesity in America. The current focus is whether youth obesity is declining.  

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina and a team of federal researchers, is widely believed to be the most accurate picture of youth obesity in America. The researchers looked at data of young people aged 2 to 5 over a 14-year span to draw appropriate conclusions about childhood obesity. They concluded that obesity remained flat during the time span. 

At the end, childhood obesity remains a serious health issue. I took a health course during my first few years in high school and we covered obesity and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, I feel most students don't often apply what they learn to their life outside of school. I play sports year around so I have to maintain a healthy lifestyle at all times. This is my motivation. What about other students who may not have a similar motivation? How can we make our health classes more robust so students can apply what they learn when they leave the classroom?
