          <p>
            I recently led a presentation for my colleagues at <a href="https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">EdLab</a>, Teachers College in which I put them through a series of exercises on their thoughts and recommendations about the Institute for Self-Directed Learning. There were four groups of five individuals per group. I was interested in gaining a collective working definition of self-directed learning and what an offering (e.g. workshop, certificate, degree program) could potentially look like. Together, we all agreed that in self-directed learning, the learner controls various aspects of the “learning process” such as pace, goals, and content. Learner motivation is central to this process. Interestingly, some of my colleagues argued that the motivation learners bring to the self-directed learning process should be a “mentality” they bring to any learning experience, including those in the classroom. This was an interesting recommendation to the self-directed learning that I have not seen in the literature. The idea that learning is a mentality one must have at all times when they want to learn is interesting and warrants further exploration.

After coming up with a working definition of self-directed learning, I engage the team in an activity in which they had to conceptualize a potential offering for an Institute for Self-Directed Learning. Groups differed in their vision for the Institute. One group argued that the Institute should:
<p style="text-align: left">     - <strong>KNOW </strong>the self-directed learner (Background knowledge, race, gender, etc)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">     - <strong>Analyze</strong> the need for self-directed learners (introduction, deep understanding, academic)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">      -<strong>Provide</strong> guidance or direction to proper platforms</p>
<p style="text-align: left">     - <strong>Create</strong> assessment based on the choices of direction or offering</p>
Another group argued for the Institute to focus on helping learners become better learners by recommending resources based on learner inputs/interests, pathways for learning about a topic, and teaching metacognition. This was an interesting and first stab at what we hope to lead to something tangible in the coming months. Stay tuned!!!
