            With the College’s new emphasis on its role as “policy mecca” and the inception of the new Department of Education Policy and Social Analysis, we in the library have sought to identify effective means of searching for and finding policy-related materials in support of research in this area.  Recently, I was presented with the challenge of advising students on how to track down policy briefs, specifically ones pertaining to the integration of technology into the classroom.

For those unfamiliar with them (as I was), policy briefs are usefully defined by the Brookings Institution as “short and informative analyses . . . that bring background and recommendations to policy-makers, journalists and the general public.”  The website of the library at Richmond University, the American International University in London, offers this definition:

“Policy briefs are a form of report designed to facilitate policy-making. The core purpose is to succinctly evaluate policy options regarding a specific issue, for a specific policy-maker audience. Policy-makers need to make practical decisions under time-constraints, so the brief should provide evidence and actionable recommendations.”

As it turns out, identifying optimal strategies for finding policy briefs is more problematic than it might seem, for a variety of reasons.  For one thing, while searching for books and serials by publication type is often expedited through the use of “subdivisions” (qualifying terms) added to Library of Congress Subject Headings (e.g., “Education – Political aspects – <em>Case studies</em>,” “Education and state – United States – <em>Handbooks, manuals, etc</em>.”), there is no offical subdivision for “policy briefs.”  Furthermore, in searching databases for periodical articles that are policy briefs, one finds a lack of a document type (e.g., “reports—research,” “information analyses”) that would facilitate retrieving this category of publication pertaining to a given subject (e.g., the infusion of technology into all aspects of education).

After attacking this problem from a variety of angles, I am forced to conclude that there is no really systematic way of searching for policy briefs, though a number of approaches do yield good results.  One of the most straightforward ways of finding what’s available through our library and Columbia University Libraries is simply to search EDUCAT and CLIO by the title phrase “policy brief”; this turns up a decent number of series (such as those produced by Brookings, the OECD, the UN), as well as individual, one-shot briefs from various sources.

Another approach is to search individual databases, such as ERIC or Education Research Complete, combining the title phrase “policy brief” with a subject term, or several subject terms (e.g., in ERIC, “technology integration,” “instructional technology,” “computer uses in education”).  Throwing an even wide net by using a federated search engine (Super Search for our library’s holdings, Find Articles for Columbia Libraries’ holdings) and searching by the title phrase “policy brief” in conjunction with terms like “technology” and “education” or “classroom” yields commensurately more extensive results.
