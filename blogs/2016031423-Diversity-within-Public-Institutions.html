          <p>
            Diversity within public school institutions has gradually become an issue of great importance. When I was in middle school, I wanted to attend a specialized high school because that's where most of the smart kids went. Unfortunately, in order for students to be admitted into a specialized high school, they have to pass a special test. The test was literally one of the most hardest tests I've taken. I failed miserably but luckily I applied to other public schools and was accepted to Dewitt Clinton High School, close in proximity to Bronx Science, a specialized high school. Whenever I walked passed that school, I couldn't help but notice the school had few Hispanics and African American students. 

Admission to an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-citys-elite-public-high-schools-have-a-big-diversity-problem-2016-3 ">elite public high school</a> is an accomplishment for most students but it's a bigger accomplishment for African American and Hispanic students. Why? African American and Hispanics make up no more than 4 and 6 percent, respectively, of the student population at those institutions. The undeniable fact is that these two groups people make up 70 percent of the public school population in New York City. 

Why is there such a divide in public institutions? How can we resolve this issue?
