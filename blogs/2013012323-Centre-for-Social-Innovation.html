            *KEEP PRIVATE**

Kate and I went to an event sponsored by the Centre of Social Innovation and Be Social Change.  The focus of the evening's event was innovations in education in the 21st century. Met some cool folks from a company called Human Condition, which basically helps socially conscious organizations tackle their most pressing problems.  One of their team members succinctly described a trend he noticed in the startup sphere which entails - meet ups, hackathons, incubation action. (Obviously there is an iterative process, but this linear pattern is the gist). Anyhoo,  He expressed frustration at the amount of meetups and ideation but not enough action or taking things to the next level. So this got me thinking, maybe this could be a role the EdLAb could play as we think about Launch Pad- encouraging  action beyond talk and ideation and hackathons

In another fun-filled conversation, I asked a participant if he  had experienced other events that he felt really inspired participants and encouraged them to advance in their work. He said that he went to an event that asked everyone upon entering the event to write their contact details and a brief 1 sentence description of their work and interests. This info was put into some funky program which then lumped folks together based on interest. The idea was that it would encourage  networking or communities of practice among attendees who were working on similar issues. I thought this might be a fun thing for future demo nights. 

All in all a fun event.
