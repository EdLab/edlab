<p>This summer, the <a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/hollingworth/">Hollingworth Center</a> hosted an experiential event in the <a href="https://lt.tc.columbia.edu">Smith Learning Theater</a> during their<a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/hollingworth/sciencecamp/"> annual summer science camp</a> for elementary students. The event, called Diving Deep, plunged camp participants into the depths of the ocean where they completed scientific studies in truly immersive surroundings. In the five levels of the Learning Theater ocean, students checked the pH levels of coral, encountered glow-in-the-dark creatures, made a topographic map, explored the ocean floor, and learned about the sad but true effects of man-made trash.</p>

<p>Jacquelyn Duran, Director of the Summer Science Camp as well as enrichment services at the Hollingworth Center, spent all year working on the program with other members of the center. The camp runs for an entire month each summer and focuses on a particular theme. This year’s theme was Oceanography, and over 200 rising 1st–5th grade students attended the camp and the Learning Theater event. The participants also studied their own group topics in addition to oceanography, which included subjects such as the human body, simple machines, and botany. The Learning Theater experience was just one of their special events this year, which also included going to the <a href="https://www.maritimeaquarium.org">Maritime Aquarium</a> and the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/calendar/unseen-oceans">Unseen Oceans</a> exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
 <p>Duran has worked with the Hollingworth Center since 2005, and is also working towards completing a PhD in Sociology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. She says that the summer science camp helps advance Hollingworth’s mission to develop the potential in everyone by not only creating enriching educational experiences for children, but also for Teachers College students who work with the camp while studying to become science teachers. This year’s event in the Learning Theater added to that mission by sparking wonder and excitement in participants, encouraging them to pursue scientific exploration in their everyday lives.</p>
