            EdLab Review- Atlas Systems, Inc. ILLiadâ„¢

A single interface</a> for a more efficient interlibrary Loan</b>


<a href="http://www.atlas-sys.com/products/illiad/">See it here</a>.

OCLC ILLiad is a model, implemented in software, of the Interlibrary loan process. Developed in the ILL Department at Virginia Tech, it is the only ILL product created as a result of ILL staff review of the entire ILL operation. The system environment was designed to enhance customer service while reducing costs and staff workload.

<b>Price:</b> Not specified*
* It seems to vary depending on ILL's volumes in that institution. 

<b>How it works:</b></br>
There are two major interfaces to OCLC ILLiad: the user interface and the staff interface.

The user interface is web-based and each user has a username and password to access his or her account. Usernames are unique within ILLiad and cannot be repeated. To start using ILLiad, each user must register with the system. After the initial registration, only a username and password are needed to access the system. Users can submit and review requests, change their profiles, renew items, and receive electronically delivered documents.

The staff interface is also referred to as the ILLiad Client. If you are running your own ILLiad server, this client will reside in a shared drive on your server, along with some supporting documents (Microsoft Word documents as well as some text documents). If you are having your server hosted by Atlas Systems, then all of the files (the client and the supporting documents) will reside on the local machine. The Word documents use mail merge to generate labels and pick slips. The text documents are templates used to generate e-mails to users. Staff log on to the ILLiad Client with a username and a password assigned using the ILLiad User Manager (separate and distinct from the username and password for the user interface). The ILLiad Client is where the ILL staff will do all of their work, including borrowing, lending, and document delivery.</br>

<b>Prop points:</b></br> 
The OCLC ILLiad Resource Sharing Management software (OCLC ILLiad) automates routine interlibrary loan functions. Since it is a web-based interface, users can send and track their requests electronically anywhere in the world. ILLiad processes requests and contact users when requests are completed. After completing an initial profile, users need only key in their user ID and password. Profile information is automatically inserted into their requests. Users can select the method and location of delivery of requested materials. Also, after completing an initial profile, users need only a key in their user ID and password. Profile information is automatically inserted into their requests. Users can select the method and location of delivery of requested materials. ILLiad supports all of your library's delivery modes. There is also a Resource Sharing Community specifically for ILLiad. Therefore, users can ask and share their questions and ideas to maximize its use. 

<b>Drop points:</b></br> 
It is not a drop point, but worth pointing out. ILLiad addresses many strong points in terms of interlibrary loan system use, but it seems that it does not provide totally differentiated and outstanding service than preexisting interlibrary loan systems such as Ariel, CDLC, and BCR.<br> 

<b>Final score: </b>
ILLiad is a web-based interlibrary loan system that makes it easy for both patrons and library staffs to deal with materials in need. For end users perspective, it shows work processes that they requested, so it can be said that it is more user friendly. It provides integrated interface to both WorldCat and WorldCat Resource Sharing.

Current users of the ILLiad system include: Brigham Young University, Harvard Medical School, Mississippi State University, Montana State University, Saginaw Valley State University, Tulsa City-County Library, Smithsonian Institution Library, The Ohio State University, etc.</br>
