<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I began playwriting in college. Of necessity. I needed to express something. I felt that I was making discoveries about life, needed to express them, and couldn't explain them. Theater was the only way. 
<p>
For me the theater has always been an opportunity to teach—I'm referring to the best kind of teaching. Not simply presenting facts about life, but conveying a feeling about those facts, a sense of why they're important, wonderful, etc. I feel that when a teacher presents information without conveying a sense of why you should care about the information, the lesson isn't complete. 
<p>
Anyway, the transition from theater to non-fiction writing felt very natural. My first adventure with educational writing occurred when I took a year off from drama school to do social work in the rural south. Working with a legal service for people of low income, I created a newspaper column called "Plain Talk About the Law" that taught people about their legal rights. While writing this column, I found that if I could express the facts in a creative way, with humor, I could really reach readers and make a lasting impression.  
<p>
After that I began writing science and history books for kids, and educational shows for children (PBS, Nickelodeon, Disney) and adults (History Channel, A&E). I think <a href="http://pbskids.org/peg/">PEG + CAT</a>, the PBS math show I've created with Jennifer Oxley, is the most successful educational project with which I've been involved. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> I don't know enough about the learning landscape to say how we might change it. But I do hope a lot of children watch our show and get a sense that math is empowering. And fun. And cool! 
<p>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> I don't know what will happen in the years ahead. I could complain about hi-tech devices and social media, but my kids use them all the time and they're much smarter than I am. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I'm developing new educational programs with Jennifer Oxley. And I'm anxious to start a new play.
