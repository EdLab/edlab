          <p>
            Yesterday's publication workshop was an inspiring (!) session regarding informative topics and I was very impressed by the open and interactive “community of practice” in U.S. academia as represented by the workshop.  The sessions were split into two. Early-career professors and senior professors, researchers, and journal editors in both qualitative and quantitative fields gave talks. There was a standing microphone in the middle of the audience so anyone from the audience could walk up to the microphone to ask questions. The atmosphere was very warm, informal, and conversational.

All kinds of questions from the audience were answered patiently, including how to seek emotional, writing, or career support during doctoral study/new career. I felt especially interested about how one single study can be turned into different potential journal articles. The audience consisted mostly of newly graduated doctoral students, and/or research associates, and assistant professors who had just started their careers. I seemed more like a novice compared to them.

All the supporting documents related to the workshop can be viewed<a href="http://www.education.umd.edu/EDHD/faculty2/Alexander/ARL/PubCourse.html"> <strong>here</strong></a>.

<strong>EdLab Connection</strong></p>
One speaker from a university in Europe talked about some early European journals that may be considered for publication, including the British Journal of Educational Technology, which focuses on theory, applications, and development of educational technology and communication; there is also a colloquium section (short paper) in the journal featured with work-in-progress studies/development. I felt Edlab's many projects/writings in the Development and Research Group can be further polished to pursue journal submissions. It seems that all we need to do now is putting our collective intelligence together and “push” ourselves to pursue the next level.

My pondering thoughts also arose as told <em>conference proceedings cannot be resubmitted to journals</em>: we might need to decide that some early-developed papers can be submitted to conference proceedings, while some projects with good-quality data might not be published in proceedings, instead, might go to journal submission trials directly.
