<p><i>The Education Scrimmage is a day long event that brings together ten organizations making a positive impact in their community, 80 exceptional professionals sourced from ReWork and NY+Acumen, a panel of mentors, and the ReWork team to teach Rapid Prototyping and move the needle on a problem that each organization is facing."</i>  (from the <a href="http://www.strikingly.com/theeducationscrimmage#whats-a-scrimmage"> Education Scrimmage site</a>)</p>


<b>Innovate or Die</b><br>
What do <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> and self-driving cars have in common (besides the Google connection)?  Both were developed using rapid prototyping.  Yes, that’s right, the same <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/14/how-google-venture-partners-does-rapid-prototyping-design-sprints-with-its-170-startups/">rapid-fire ideation process</a> favored by leading startups has been applied to education.  The <a href="http://theeducationscrimmage-eorg.eventbrite.com/">most recent scrimmage</a> held over the course of one day in NYC this past September, brought together ten organizations, professionals from a variety of groups including (<a href="http://ny.plusacumen.org/events/the-education-scrimmage/">NY+Acumen</a> etc. & Design Gym), a panel of mentors and a team of innovators from ReWork.  The group united around problems posed by a wide range of companies, from <a href="http://www.avenues.org/">Avenues:  The World School</a> to <a href="http://mananutrition.org/">Mana Nutrition</a> and worked-together to prototype a suite of potential solutions, from digital applications to stand-alone companies.   
<p>
<b>Ready, Set... Scrimmage</b><br>
After hosting over half a dozen scrimmages, the group has found a rhythm and process that goes beyond the typical hackathon and integrates not only rapid prototyping, but also "design thinking (learn more about Design Thinking <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8726">here</a>)."  As Socratic Labs managing director (Education Scrimmage mentor and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/805">past NLT Profilee</a>), Heather Gilchrist describes, "A typical hackathon is about quickly putting together a product prototype, but rarely do hackathons focus on process or learning… By focusing on the design thinking process, participants approached problems and challenges in a new way. Design thinking in education and edtech holds tremendous potential."  Gilchrist goes on to describe her experience as a mentor during this last scrimmage (for full NLT interview see below), "I worked with the <a href="https://teachboost.com/">TeachBoost</a> team, and I really admired the team's approach to the scrimmage. They came in with a challenge, but it wasn't something that was an immediate, pressing need. Rather, they participated in the event solely with the objective of becoming oriented to a new way of thinking and doing."  Beyond gaining a new way of thinking about process and problem solving, the scrimmage provided an opportunity for participants to iterate and evolve their ideas and preconceived notions regarding the unique value propositions of their organizations.

<b>Exclusive NLT Interview with Socratic Labs managing director, Heather Gilchrist</b><br>

<p><b>Question:</b> How was the experience unique to other hackathon / rapid prototyping experiences?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> A typical hackathon is about quickly putting together a product prototype, but rarely do hackathons focus on process or learning. Startup Weekend is somewhat about putting together a company, but it is also about doing a speedy dress rehearsal of the process so that participants get experiential education in entrepreneurship. Lean Startup Machine is also process oriented, as its focus is on getting people to work outside their comfort zones to talk to customers in order to learn lean startup basics by doing them.
<p>
The Education Scrimmage was similarly process oriented, designed to teach participants a new way to approach challenges in education and education entrepreneurship. By focusing on the design thinking process, participants approached problems and challenges in a new way.
<p>
Design thinking in education and edtech holds tremendous potential. It's an exciting time for education, as we currently have more energy, talent, and other resources joining the effort than we've probably ever had. But for too long, would-be entrepreneurs have been approaching the market in a rather one-sided fashion. By applying design thinking approaches, entrepreneurs and innovative educators can be better empowered to produce more and better ideas to tackle education's most stubborn problems with more creative and holistic solutions.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What was accomplished?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> I worked with the TeachBoost team, and I really admired the team's approach to the scrimmage. They came in with a challenge, but it wasn't something that was an immediate, pressing need. Rather, they participated in the event solely with the objective of becoming oriented to a new way of thinking and doing.
<p>
The participating teams worked with collaborators who brought a variety of skill sets, and we saw intriguing results at the end of the day. As interesting as the results were, I was even more impressed with the processes I observed throughout the day and the genuine commitment to the process that everyone I witnessed contributed.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What do I hope will happen at the next one?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The first event was a great start. I hope the next event is a little bit longer--perhaps the whole weekend--so that it might accommodate more design thinking cycles by each team. I think the highest value outcome was the learning that took place, and I hope that the participants took the new skills and approaches they learned back to their respective organizations to inform their work.
<p>
As with any new process, repetition is key to the learning process, as it allows us to make more mistakes and learn from them, improving the process each time. No doubt the next Education Scrimmage will follow the same pattern of applying learning from previous iterations!
