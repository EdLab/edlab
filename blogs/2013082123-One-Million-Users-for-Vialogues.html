          <p>
            At today's EdLab seminar, Hui Soo pointed out something that is very true. How can we get new users for our projects (e.g. NLT, Vialogues), if we don't use them regularly ourselves? I for one can admit that I use vialogues but find it very hard to find myself making a video even if I wanted to, but it is also very hard to stay on the website. I think that we can get a lot of more users for Vialogues and our other projects if we were to offer what other social networks do such as tagging a friend in a comment, liking a comment (or use an "agree" button since Facebook has the like button), being able to subscribe to someone's channel in case you like the focus of their videos. Even making a response video to a video you highly agree or disagree with can make Vialogues a very sociable site and will lead to more new users.

I enjoy Vialogues the way it currently is, but I truly believe that with a little bit of add ons, we can have a lot more users. I was able to recruit about 10 users in the past month. My method was asking these potential users what videos they would be interested in having a discussion on and I posted such a video accordingly. I included alot of questions in the Vialogue, and they actually responded to them. I feel this is one way to get new users for not just Vialogues but our other products as well.  

P.S - Lets get Hui Soo to shave his head!
