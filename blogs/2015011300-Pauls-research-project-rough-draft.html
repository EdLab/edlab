            I find it shocking that the United States has among the highest incarceration rates in the world. I’m particularly interested in exploring how racial and economic factors contribute to unfair trials, false convictions, and erroneous sentencing.

<strong>Race, incarceration, and American values</strong>

by Loury, Glenn C
The United States, home to five percent of the worlds’ population, now houses twenty-five percent of the world’s prison inmates. Our incarceration rate--at 714 per 100,000 residents and rising--is almost forty percent greater than our nearest competitors (the Bahamas, Belarus, and Russia). More pointedly, it is 6.2 times the Canadian rate and 12.3 times the rate in Japan. Economist Glenn Loury argues that this extraordinary mass incarceration is not a response to rising crime rates or a proud success of social policy. Instead, it is the product of a generation-old collective decision to become a more punitive society…&lt;

<strong>Convicting the innocent: where criminal prosecutions go wrong</strong>

by Garrett, Brandon L

Very few crimes committed in the United States involve biological evidence that can be tested using DNA. How many unjust convictions are there that we will never discover? 'Convicting the Innocent' makes a powerful case for systemic reforms to improve the accuracy of all criminal cases...

<strong>Science and the death penalty: DNA, innocence, and the debate over capital punishment in the United States</strong>

by Aronson, Jay D; Cole, Simon A

The death penalty debate in the United States has recently undergone a fundamental shift. The possibility of executing the innocent has emerged as some abolitionists' most salient argument, displacing debates over such issues as fairness, deterrence, and cost…

<strong>Exonerations in the United States 1989 through 2003</strong>

by Gross, Samuel R; Jacoby, Kristen; Matheson, Daniel J; Montgomery, Nicholas; Patil, Sujata

Gross et al provide a comprehensive study of exonerations in the US from 1989 through 2003. Therein, they discuss all exonerations that they have been able to locate that occurred in the fifteen-year period, and which resulted from investigations into the particular cases of the exonerated individuals. Details of their study are presented.

<strong>The unexonerated: factually innocent defendants who plead guilty</strong>

by John H Blume; Rebecca K Helm

Several recent high profile cases, including the case of the West Memphis Three, have revealed (again) that factually innocent defendants do plead guilty. And, more disturbingly, in many of the cases, the defendant's innocence is known, or at least highly suspected, at the time the plea is entered. Innocent defendants plead guilty most often, but not always, in three sets of cases: first, low level offenses where a quick guilty plea provides the key to the cellblock door; second, cases where defendants have been wrongfully convicted, prevail on appeal, and are then offered a plea bargain that will assure their immediate or imminent release; and third, where defendants are threatened with harsh alternative punishments if they do not plead guilty…

<strong>Rate of false conviction of criminal defendants who are sentenced to death</strong>

by Samuel R. Gross; Barbara O’Brien; Chen Hu; Edward H. Kennedy

The rate of erroneous conviction of innocent criminal defendants is often described as not merely unknown but unknowable. There is no systematic method to determine the accuracy of a criminal conviction; if there were, these errors would not occur in the first place. As a result, very few false convictions are ever discovered, and those that are discovered are not representative of the group as a whole. In the United States, however, a high proportion of false convictions that do come to light and produce exonerations are concentrated among the tiny minority of cases in which defendants are sentenced to death. This makes it possible to use data on death row exonerations to estimate the overall rate of false conviction among death sentences.

<strong>Miscarriages of Justice and the Discourse of Innocence: Perspectives from Appellants, Campaigners, Journalists, and Legal Practitioners</strong>

by Jenkins, Siôn

This article problematizes the discourse of innocence in relation to victims of wrongful conviction operating within the criminal justice system. For appellants whose convictions have been quashed by the Court of Appeal, notions of innocence are often at odds with how others perceive and understand the purpose of criminal trials and appeals. This article will examine the views of legal practitioners, journalists, and victims of wrongful conviction and their supporters regarding factual innocence and how misunderstanding can sometimes lead to miscommunication by actors operating within the same system…

<strong>The Supreme Court on trial: how the American justice system sacrifices innocent defendants</strong>

by Thomas, George C

Traces the history of jury trials, an important component of the U.S. justice system, since the American Founding. In the mid-twentieth century, when it became evident that racism and other forms of discrimination were corrupting the system, the Warren Court established procedure as the most important element of criminal justice. As a result, police, prosecutors, and judges have become more concerned about following rules than about ensuring that the defendant is indeed guilty as charged. Recent cases of prisoners convicted of crimes they didn't commit demonstrate that such procedural justice cannot substitute for substantive justice.
