          <p>
            On a more serious note, the <a href="http://cryptome.org/0001/ftc100709.htm">FTC has posted a call for input into a symposium they will have in early December whose theme is the impact of the Internet on journalism</a>. They are focusing both on the lowered barrier to entry for reporting, with the advent of Web 2.0 technologies, as well as newspapers' loss of ad revenue to online forums. These are issues I've thought about for quite some time, as I've been involved with organizations like the <a href="http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml">Independent Media Center</a>, an early effort to broaden the range of voices in reporting by using the Internet. 

I also attended an excellent conference (which approached an "unconference" in the brevity of the keynotes and the amount of participation from the distinguished audience) at the Journalism School last year on this topic. Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, the organizer, <a href="http://rasmuskleisnielsen.net/2009/02/">wrote up a summary of key points</a> made there. I'd be thrilled if we could just dump a videotape of the discussion there on the FTC, because it was a great, well-informed struggle with the difficult issues.

It's worth thinking of how these issues expand into other parts of publishing and education. Journalists are frightened at the possibility that the loss of their profession will also mean the loss of the valuable investigative skills and access they have worked hard to cultivate. How does this parallel issues faced by academia and book publishers? How can teachers explain how to read the "authoritative, neutral" tone of journalistic texts in these days when the texts themselves, and their writers, are changing so rapidly?
