            <p><b>More Money, Less Problems: Apple Enters the Content Creation Business </b></p>
<p><i>What are the implications if the most powerful tech corporation in the world starts creating content? </i></p>

<p>Making beloved, iconic devices just isn’t enough any more. It is widely expected that Apple is going to move from its main business, creating high-margin technology devices with accompanying supporting services, and pivoting to content creation. </p>

<p>It has been speculated that<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-said-to-be-in-talks-to-make-its-own-movies-and-tv-shows/"> Apple has been meeting content producers </a>in television and film regarding commissioning digital filmed content. Netflix has been the widely acknowledged market leader in the licensing and disseminating of third-party film and television on the Internet. More recently, it has even begun venturing into the business of developing its own branded content that is exclusive to its DVD/online delivery business. Some examples are completely original Netflix content like “Marco Polo” and “Orange is the New Black,” as well as revamped properties such as “House of Cards,” “Wet Hot American Summer,” and “Arrested Development.” Hulu and Amazon have followed suit with a similar mix of film and television fare. Adding to the tumult, traditional pay per view cable television networks (e.g., HBO) and even more traditional terrestrial broadcasters (e.g., CBS) are starting to put their content online through <a href="http://www.hbogo.com/#home/"> HBO Go </a>and <a href="http://www.cbs.com/all-access/"> CBS All Access </a>respectively. When a well-respected Big Four major terrestrial broadcaster such CBS starts moving its highly coveted televisual properties online, and in effect challenging their own lucrative Nielsen-based model of setting advertising revenue that has been in place since the early 1950s, you know everything is in play. In effect, they are at risk of killing their golden goose by giving away the eggs on the cheap. </p>

<p>Apple’s move into content creation looks to be welcomed by consumers—at least in the short-term. Having yet another deep pocketed technology-based organization commissioning original programming should give viewers even more choice than the low-cost riches they already have at their disposal through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, YouTube, and conventional terrestrial programming. And Apple’s long track record of success in technological innovation can’t hurt in terms of delivering this content on attractive, reliable, and robust devices. Despite any imperfections, AppleTV will only become better. </p>

<p>However, in the long-term, Apple’s move into content creation could prove problematic. A behemoth like Apple could leverage its financial muscle to broker exclusive agreements with digital producers. As part of more lucrative deals, they could demand that licensed content can only be exclusively carried on Apple devices. Think of its previous use of the FairPlay digital rights management system—music purchased through the iTunes store could only be played on iPods, effectively shutting competitors outside of its technological ecosystem. In short, Apple could use its market dominating position to bully smaller players. On a similar note, Apple could overpay in the short-term to push out smaller companies like Netflix and Hulu who do not have the same capital reserves leaving their content shoddier by comparison. After these relatively smaller companies are pushed out of the market, or even simply marginalized, Apple could abuse its de facto monopoly position to increase prices on content as well as the devices they are played on. Further, if exclusive formats are used, users may be forced to purchase multiple copies of the exact same content if they want to play their movies and television on non-Apple devices. </p>

<p>As we have seen through its nimble acquisition of small companies that make innovative products to improve its lineup of products, what Apple wants, Apple gets. Look forward to it becoming the next big content creation player in town. Or for those who want the greatest amount of content variety at the cheapest prices across the widest array of devices, maybe you can start looking backward. </p>
