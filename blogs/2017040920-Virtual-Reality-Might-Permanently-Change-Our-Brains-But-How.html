<p>Despite the fact that virtual reality (VR) is a completely immersive environment, we experience it differently than we do the real world. A lab at UCLA is currently researching this phenomenon by studying rats in fully immersive VR environments. They expected a rat’s brain to fire the same neurons as it traveled through a maze in real life and an identical one in VR. Yet instead, they found that in VR, 60% of the neurons in the hippocampus, the part of the brain most responsible for memory, shut down compared to those used in reality.</p>

<p>Although researchers believe the consistent use of VR will have long-term consequences on the brain, they’re currently unsure whether those will be more beneficial or dangerous. As VR becomes more ubiquitous, however, continued research in this area is crucial. Some speculate that in the coming decades, VR will be as important in the workplace as computers. And if people eventually do spend 8-hour workdays strapped into a VR headset, it’s important to understand how our brains may permanently change in a virtual world.</p>

<p>Do you think that VR will be as commonplace as computers and smartphones in the future? How do you think our brains perceive a virtual world differently from reality? Join our discussion on this cutting edge research <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/35536/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@03:19 RuthS:</b> I am skeptical that VR will become as commonplace as computers if only because the content currently is not there at all. Many people I know have tried VR once and feel like they never have to try it again because the content just wasn't remarkable enough and didn't provide a function that we couldn't achieve elsewhere, such as on the computer or TV.</p>

<p><b>@03:34 Joseph.Banks:</b> I thought it was interesting that the one speaker said they want to try and create a world without "digital regrets." Is this possible? Technologies move so quickly that it is difficult to know how they are shaping our connections not only in our brains but to each other.</p>
