Jonathan Dariyanani is the co-founder and President of <a href="http://bit.ly/1K2PSkq">Cognotion, Inc.,</a> which makes tablet based training solutions for high turnover, high liability, low wage workers in regulated industries. He founded Cognotion with his long-time business partner, Joanna Schneier, in 2013. Cognotion has won a number of awards, including the Revere Award and the 1776 Challenge Cup Global Finalist in 2015. He was formerly a startup attorney at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati in Palo Alto, where he represented both venture capital firms and startups. He has been an entrepreneur in the education space since 2003, when he sold his first company to LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc. and led their language learning division. Dariyanani worked with the World Economic Forum and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation to develop game changing tablet based literacy programs for undereducated girls in rural India. He was also the co-developer and Creative Director of the Middlebury/K12 language learning partnership and has served as an advisor to the United Nations on private public partnerships in education. Dariyanani attended the University of California, Berkeley and Duke University Law School, as well as the University of Paris.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>I went to 13 different schools between kindergarten and 12th grade and went to law schools at three different institutions, including the University of Paris and took classes from Yale to my local community college, so that diversity of experience really shaped my view of learning. I was also a former startup lawyer at a Silicon Valley firm and witnessed the birth of companies that developed complex, game changing solutions to difficult problems. The diversity of educational experiences of our learners and the conviction that startups can develop unique, paradigm shifting solutions drives everything we do at Cognotion. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Right now there is a professional or creative class in the West that reaps disproportionate economic rewards, while the bulk of workers are stuck at stagnant wages. We believe the opportunity to help workers increase skills on the job and increase their value to organizations, especially amongst low-wage, high-turnover employees, could be a game changer. That's why we are building products that help companies take employees from a GED to a professional credential, such as a Certified Nursing Assistant and eventually a Licensed Vocational Nurse. We are doing this first in healthcare and then in other regulated professions. We ultimately want to improve the lives and earning potential of low wage workers and improve the productivity of enterprises. We think we can do both and that will hopefully focus huge public sector and private sector dollars on workforce training.</p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Virtual and augmented reality, predictive analytics, cognitive computing, location-based learning, emotional/facial recognition, and the trend toward just-in-time and in-place learning will make huge impacts in the years to come.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>We are currently building an immersive, cinematic tablet based certification course for nursing assistants that will work in 46 states. This product will allow hundreds of high school dropouts to enter the workforce at above minimum wage and improve clinical outcomes at nursing homes.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I think the three most interesting people are <a href="http://bit.ly/1ocQhXw">Sugata Mitra</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1mibRZ6">Jon Katzman</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1KuW1pm">Jonathan Harber</a>.</p>
