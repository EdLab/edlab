">David Deblinger</a> is a teacher, facilitator, producer and director bringing the innovating force of improv and ensemble theater to the worlds of education and industry. Deblinger leads both the world-renowned <a href="http://labtheater.org/">Labyrinth Theater</a>, which he co-founded and his company, <a href="http://www.ensembleforce.com/">Ensemble Force</a>, which brings improvisation to schools, disadvantaged communities and fortune 500 companies. Through his work with both Oscar winning actors and inner city youth, Deblinger is leading the charge and making a claim that the arts are a fertile ground for fostering innovation, developing improved group dynamics and fostering new ideas across a wide range of fields and industries. Ensemble Force offers innovative professional development workshops for educators and administrators and has provided professional development opportunities to the NYC Department of Education among others. As an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, Deblinger created his own major, Education of the Urban Poor through Theater, and he continues to spread his unique model of building stronger teams through ensemble-building and improv.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Tremendously.  At New York’s specialized High School of Performing Arts I learned about the, "acting ensemble," as a place where players can feel safe to take risks… not just for the sake of the play, or just in order to act well, but in the pursuit of intellectual and personal growth… a place to feel, think, imagine, and risk to offer our authentic voices without fear.  Plays were introduced to me as vehicles to communicate and spur discussion about ideas, huge ideas, that concern all of us.  Then, at Wesleyan University I created a university major (Education of the Urban Poor through Theater) for which I did research around educational philosophy (Dewey, Holt, Rousseau, etc.) and psychology and posed the value of making the connection between "the student" and "the actor," "the class," and the "ensemble."  My thesis project had a group of local African American teens create a play with music about education.  They’d never acted and had no idea what I was doing until the one who was the biggest problem became the opposite.  Once he got excited, they all did.  I also enlisted several college classmates to act and write music. During the process the <i>Middletown Press</i> sent a reporter to one of our rehearsals.  There was one song in the show about racism.  The reporter spoke to one of the students while I was directing a scene.  I awoke in the morning with a call from the principal saying that the white teachers of the school were boycotting our play because the headline in the <i>Middletown Press</i> was something like, "Students create show about racism in Middletown High."  I almost had a heart attack because the show was not focused on that, but on education.  The students also were not activist types and became very uncomfortable. However, in the end, we played to a packed house, were a hit, and I got an A.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> From 1992 until almost 2000 I was facilitating workshops using role play, improvisation, and trust exercises with professional actors, directors, and writers of the highest caliber (e.g. Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Ortiz, John Patrick Shanley)  as well as a plethora of community groups including those at: men’s, women’s, and family shelters; senior centers; group homes; mental health and juvenile detention facilities; schools and more. In the 2000’s I started using this process of ensemble building and other theater based techniques for professional development with teachers.  My company, Ensemble Force, gave a presentation a year ago to the then Deputy Commissioner of NYC Department of Education and his senior staff.  He hired us to give workshops to teams of teachers at five schools addressing issues currently being faced by staffs in each particular school environment (e.g., bullying, staff discord, etc.)  At one, there were teachers who were at odds with one another. When they entered we had music playing and I heard one say, "I’m gonna shoot myself in the head with this professional development garbage."  Thirty minutes later, that same person, who had shown animosity to a particular teacher I’ll call Sheila, was in tears.  It was in response to hearing Sheila share a moving story from her own life as a student.  We then engaged in a quality of discussion around the issue of bullying that was both personal and imbued with compassion, not just for the children, but for one another.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I want our ensemble-building model to spread, giving more and more students and teachers the experience and the notion that creating art is not limited to those who call themselves artists.  I want classrooms to become more engaged with intellectual exploration and skill building that is enriched with the world of feelings and an emotional dynamic of support.  I’d like to see classrooms, nationwide, transform into places where children are dared to take risks and creativity is encouraged in new ways.   I hope the test and result focused culture will recede a bit, making room for teaching our children that the power of creativity, in this new world, brings exciting opportunities for those who are unafraid to be bold and take action.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The stories one hears about the values put forth for those who work at companies like Google, Apple, Pixar… I hope that the confidence in the power of creativity will continue to grow and have a great impact on learning.  I have recently studied the work of <a href="http://www.nifplay.org/institute/about-us/">Dr. Stuart Brown and his National Institute of Play</a>.  I see the value of play in a safe, structured environment becoming more and more understood and emphasized in the learning lives of not just children but adults as well.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I will be creating a theme-based show with a group of NYC public school teens as part of a program at an Off Broadway theater called, "<a href="http://www.thenewgroup.org/">The New Group</a>."  We will spend three weeks creating/rehearsing the show, and then perform it on August 2nd at the <a href="http://www.lortel.org/llt_theater/">Lucille Lortel Theater</a>.  We will also be doing more professional development with teachers, exposing them to theater-based techniques to elicit greater enthusiasm and commitment from students while increasing a team, or ensemble, sensibility with their colleagues.
