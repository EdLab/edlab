Lisa Grocott is a professor of design at Monash University in Australia and the Director of <a href="http://bit.ly/1TEu8Q8">THRVNG</a>, a design research lab. She collaborates with scientists to design research on how learners develop a sense of agency in the classroom. She is currently a co-chief investigator on a research grant at the University of Melbourne on teacher change and innovative learning environments. 

<p><b>How have your education and past professional experiences shaped your current work?</b><br>
<p>The formative experiences I had as a study abroad undergraduate in India and enrolling in a total immersion Maori language course in New Zealand shape who I am far more than the decades I put in a silly amount of formal education. Both of those transformative experiences exposed me to alternative education models that revealed what could happen if we defined success by how well we advanced the learning of others. From the outset my philosophy was a critique of my western education, a system that privileges individual success over collective thriving. As a young educator I resisted fostering a culture of competition between my students. I wanted to create a space for generous collaboration, a space where students bought their own questions and found their own way.</p>

<p>Decades later I can still trace a line between these intuitive ideas, my research work at Thrvng Lab, and my higher education classes. Luckily I got to meet some amazing educators and learning scientists who introduced me to ways of thinking about learning that affirmed and contested many of my instinctive values. If I started out as a designer first and educator second, I now see my research and practice as ultimately about learning how to learn and I just happen to use the human-centered, material methodology of designing to do that. Like all professional trajectories it is hard to imagine my practice going any other way, yet I am sure that if I hadn’t met Dominic Randolph I would not have threaded together design thinking, academic mindsets, and experiential learning. Without the support of Riverdale Country School there would have been no Thrvng Lab. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>There are so many threads to how I think of this question. I get so excited about different aspects of my practice that often pull me in different directions. Today I had an amazing meeting with Kevin Mattingly at Columbia University’s Teachers College where we are working on a model that would disrupt professional development as we know it. This work pulls me in. As broken as professional development might be, understanding the stories teachers tell themselves about learning offers us a new starting place. Kevin and I are pretty excited about what a game changer it would be if we could co-design with teacher programs driven by their intrinsic motivations to enrich their practice and deepen students learning. This Riverdale venture intersects with a research project I am collaborating on with learning scientists and architects on innovative learning environments. The shared thread between these projects is my role as the designer/researcher who works on the <i>teacher change</i> aspect at the core of these initiatives. Still, I don’t see this work as limited to teachers and am equally invested in how we develop practices for transforming student mindsets. </p>

<p>I understand my contribution across these different practice spaces as two-fold. What I love about design is that you are the person with the permission to speculatively dream of completely new ways of doing things, while at the same time being the person who is motivated to iteratively seek out real, working solutions. This speculation-driven, solution-seeking push-and-pull of designing is grounded in this idea that you start with the person you are designing for. To me this has parallels with the same way a teacher ideally begins not with what material has to be taught but what his/her students need to learn. Beyond my specific interests in the role of design in transforming learning mindsets, I would hope that my work models for learning scientists and teachers the value of collaborating with designers. Every day I witness the potential that could come from finding better ways to translate research into better learning. The gap we see between what research reveals about how students learn and what is happening in the classroom will not be solved by teachers or researchers alone (let alone policy makers!) and I’d like to think design can partner in this critical project.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I am particularly interested in the relationships between non-cognitive skills and lifelong learning, between face-to-face education and experiential learning. This is a sincerely exciting time to be shaping the future of learning. The opportunity I see is that institutions of learning will need to double-down on how we go about experiential and embodied learning in a world where we will increasingly learn new skills and content online. I recently team-taught a grad studio with the actor <a href="http://bit.ly/1THvM0j">Roger Manix</a>, where we dedicated a third of our time to beginning each class with play-based sessions. At the end of the semester the students told us how the non-cognitive skills they honed in the performative part of the class accelerated their capacity to learn. Research from neuroscience, psychology, and sociology helps us understand how teaching students to be vulnerable, creative, and take risks could prime them for deeper learning experiences—but it would upend the practice of teaching if we were to truly act on these insights.</p> 

<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>This call to deepen the impact of our teaching drives my inquiry into how we prepare students for a lifetime of learning. From the perspective of the educator I am excited to partner with Riverdale Country School on their <i>Plussed</i> venture into professional development. From the perspective of the student I am curious to what extent I can convince my colleagues in my new job at Monash to attend to the informal learning that runs betwixt and between the formal lessons. From the perspective of the learning organization I am exploring how the behavior we measure drives the behavior we reward and what that means for alternative forms of feedback and credentialing.</p>
