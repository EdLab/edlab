(Mayor Booker getting warmed-up in the Reuters TV studio)

<b>An Hour with the Texting, Tatooine & Trek-positive Mayor of Newark</b>
Yesterday I had the privilege (Thanks to the <a href="http://nyc.socialinnovation.org/">Center for Social Innovation!</a>) to be a part of a #TechTonic taping for @ReutersTV at the Reuters studios in Times Square.  (<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/9232">Here</a> is my original blog post re: this event)  

The Reuters studio was a beautiful, intimate space with room for only 20.  This "intimacy" really allowed the audience to be a part of the interview... so much so, that we were given the "spotlight" to ask questions on-camera at the end (more on this below!).

<b>So many take-aways... here are a few:</b> 

<b>Inspiration for "Edtech Takes"</b>
In light of EdLab's ongoing series of <a href="https://vialogues.com/search/general/?q=%23EdTechTake">EdTech Take/Talk interviews</a> with local "Edupreneurs" it was especially interesting to see the production/interview process (they use almost identical "yellow" chairs, abstracted backdrops!).  

<b>Humility</b>
Cory Booker is a humble, engaging and engaged speaker/interviewee. Not only does he thoughtfully respond to questions, with long-impassioned and interesting responses... but, he seems to have in-depth knowledge of so many different industries and disciplines.  This far-ranging, in-depth insight paired with the ability to laugh at himself and his personal experiences makes for a highly relatable and accessible leader. (He really likes Ben & Jerry's - I want a Booker-inspired flavor!  Booker Berry Crunch?  Newark Nibble? *maybe not the last one!) 

<b>Social Media is redefining "leadership"</b>
Technology is allowing him to be a more connected and ultimately compassionate leader.  Booker is able to respond in real-time (and often does) with real answers to his constituents needs.  From telling kids to "go to bed" who are Tweeting him late at night with questions like, "will we have a snow day tomorrow?"  (Imagine the increased desire to engage civically for these young people!) To responding to infrastructure issues in his districts as they happen, that would have been missed or more slowly addressed by the current monolithic, entrenched government channels.  Instead, this ubiquitous, unifying medium is breaking-down the traditional barrier and limits to what it means to be both a leader and to be "led."

<b>Favorite moments...</b>
-Mayor Booker speaking in Klingon and stretching his sci fi nerd legs!  He is the real-deal! 

-Having the chance to give EdLab/Teachers College a shout-out!  Mayor Booker's response was so great... he "loves Teachers College" and enjoyed meeting recently with the nutrition dept. - he joked that he should be slimmer as a result of his work with Michelle O's anti-obesity campaign/<a href="http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2012/12/cory_bookers_week_on_food_stam.html">week on food stamps</a>. 

-Watching him actively engage and inspire both the audience and interviewer... he was truly  a humble, active participant who has the ability to make you feel that he is your best friend after spending only an hour in his presence.  

-Experiencing the level of personal attention and care that he gives to his "fans" - he genuinely seems to want to "know" something personal about each person he meets.  From commenting on a well-wisher's tattoo (in memory of a deceased relative) to asking specifically what school a fellow "Jersey Boy" attended... he took REAL time to know those in attendance.   

-I was thrilled and nervous that Mayor Booker invited me to ask the last question, "What role could technology play in bridging the STEM gap for women & minorities? (he had mentioned that we are not training workers for the work we most need done)"  He jokingly commented that the "last question is often the most important" before eloquently responding and mentioning Khan Academy.  

-Although the talk was "tech" focused, Booker only briefly mentioned the startup he has co-founded, #waywire.  Instead, he mentioned the platform as a way to both inspire and engage young people as a part of a broader mission to harness the power and potential of young people. 

<b>Overall...</b>
I was completely taken with Mayor Bookers humility and entrepreneurial spirit... his approach to apply ideas and approaches embraced by private sector entrepreneurs to running a city is in a phrase... government 3.0.  I tweeted these thoughts to him right after the taping and was surprised and impressed that he almost immediately responded with the following:
