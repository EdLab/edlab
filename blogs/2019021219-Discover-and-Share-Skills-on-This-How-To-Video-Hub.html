<p><a href="https://www.jumprope.com/">Jumprope</a> is a how-to video platform that allows users to both explore videos by category and create their own videos. The video format is primed for Instagram Stories in particular, allowing you to tap through different steps for guides on makeup, cooking, crafts, fitness, parenting, and more. Results are intuitive, easy, and professional, and the app is free.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The format of Jumprope’s how-to videos is super engaging and intuitive, especially for Instagram and Snapchat users. After a short introduction by the video’s creator, the necessary equipment or ingredients are shown, often with links to purchase specific products. Then, each step of a process has its own image or video to swipe through with written instructions. It’s a beautifully streamlined experience, and the format makes all entries look professional, even if the content isn’t anything special.</p>

<p>Jumprope’s platform is a bit like Pinterest for videos; you can search videos by category, bookmark ones you like, and explore newly uploaded content. It’s nice to look at, and easy to navigate.</p>

<p>As someone who has never made a how-to video before, I found Jumprope easy and reassuring to use. You are prompted to choose your category of video, upload photos of products needed, add music, and take a series of 15-second videos describing each step of a process. This format creates some structure for novices who aren’t quite sure where to begin.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>One feature that isn’t very helpful is Jumprope’s search function. While you can search by the title of a video, by products linked to in videos, and by the name of the video creator, the algorithm isn’t complex enough to be helpful if you are searching more generally. Also, it would be easier to find what you are looking for if videos could be cross-listed in different categories, both in "parenting" and "crafts & DIY," for example, instead of being listed in a single category.</p>

<p>Sometimes the videos are a bit slow in loading. This is a minor annoyance, but might be something to work on in future updates of the app.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Overall, I was very impressed with Jumprope. I recommend this free quality platform for anyone seeking new skills or hoping to share some of their own.</p>
