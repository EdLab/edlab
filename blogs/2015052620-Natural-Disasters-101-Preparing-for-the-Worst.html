The deadly earthquake in Nepal has the world thinking about natural disaster preparedness and response. An astonishing 226 million people around the world are affected by disasters every year. While the events themselves may be unavoidable, our ability to anticipate them can save lives and mitigate damage. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is working with several nonprofit organizations to educate people on the importance of properly preparing for and preventing the destruction of life and property. </p>

<p>Educational institutions and structures often incur the worst from Mother Nature's wrath; however, they also play the most important role in preparedness training. Specialized workshops in high risk areas can turn average citizens into first responders during severe weather, earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis. Schools can introduce young learners to basic concepts early on in their curriculum to ensure they understand the causes and consequences of Earth's processes, and even administrators and policymakers can be trained to build stronger schools and policies that will withstand the next storm.</p>

<p>What other ways can governments and organizations teach people to be ready for whatever comes their way? Add your thoughts to conversation already in progress <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/22157/"> on Vialogues.</a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>01:30 kingyoussef:</b> Education for disaster preparation can provide life saving information and skills that can protect individuals during and after tragedies. </p>

<p><b>01:54 kwaku5:</b> The statistics show that natural disasters are a threat to many people's lives. However as evidenced in Japan, schools and other public facilities are built to disaster proof, saving many lives. </p>

<p><b>02:50 lassinebamba:</b> I like this endeavor by UNESCO. It is very important for schools to teach students about disasters and how to properly respond. This is very timely considering the recent earthquake in Nepal. </p>
