<p>Why are we learning this? The one question thart educators have a difficult time answering finally has a simple answer in <a href="https://www.nepris.com">Nepris</a>. The 3-year-old platform already has thousands of active users connecting schools, educators, students and industry professionals in real time. So finally in response to student protest, you can have industry experts enter the classroom and show your students how your curriculum connects to real industry jobs.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> My favorite part about this service is that unlike most edtech products, this one doesnâ€™t leave students interacting with inanimate objects, but it connects people to people. The platform uses a live video and chat system to virtually bring experts into your classroom. It has a fairly intuitive interface with a wide variety of features. In addition to the video feature, it allows users to message each other, follow general updates on the Nepris news feed, and share thoughts in the Stories Blog. Even in the free version of the app, there are plenty of opportunities to join industry chats with other schools. Students who engage with industry experts on the platform are highly attentive, asking questions and making jokes. The industry experts are all volunteers.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> Be sure to plan your lessons in advance since it can take up to three weeks from the time the request is made to the time an industry expert is matched to your needs. Nepris makers claim this wait is to ensure that you have the best expert available to you for your classroom needs. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> This platform is something simple and fun for educators, and it is no wonder that it recently received millions in funding. For teachers seeking to bring real world applications to their curriculum, the options with Nepris seem easy and endless. </p>
