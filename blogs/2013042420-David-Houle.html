<b> NEW LEARNING TIMES EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW </b> <p>
<b>Question: </b>  How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> I got my BA in Art History.  The way that it may have helped me arrive at my current work as a futurist is that phrase "life imitates art."  This of course has been particularly true the last 150 years.  Look at art and see the future of society.  The early 20th century school of futurism artists conveyed the speed of the century that followed.  The Cubist artists of the same time clearly indicated how fragmented and disorienting the century would be.  Later Andy Warhol was a precursor to the consumerism and celebrity worship of the last 30 years.
<p>
<b>Question: </b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> Most of my life I have made professional decisions that were derided at the time but proved to be ahead of the curve.  Leaving CBS to take a 50% pay cut to go to work in cable in 1980 to become part of the team that launched MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1 and CNN Headline news was derided, but what happened?  Another professional experience was being part of a company that got into distance learning and online courses back in the 1990s, again something people said wouldn't work.   Finally, giving speeches all over the world and having people tell me I give them hope, help them deal with change, help them be better parents and change the way they run their businesses is truly gratifying.
<p>
<b>Question </b>: How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Well, I wrote <i>Shift Ed: A Call to Action for Transforming K-12 Education</i> with my co-author Jeff Cobb because, as a futurist it is clear to me that America will not remain a great nation if we don't completely transform K-12 education.  Since that book came out in early 2011 I have spoken to hundreds of K-12 superintendents, principals, school boards and teachers who have largely embraced my message of creating a vision of what 21st century K-12 education needs to be.  The word reform must be dropped.  Only transformation will work at this stage.

So I hope that this book and the speeches I give all around the country will mobilize those committed educators to lead the necessary transformation.
<p>
<b>Question</b>: What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> We are no longer in a Knowledge economy we are in a Learning economy.  In K-12 it will be bringing connectivity in all forms into the classroom.  Having students turn off their cell phones and connected devices in the classroom is archaic.  How can this even be considered intelligent when the children who enter Kindergarten starting this year will have had 2-4 years of interacting with touchscreens and the Internet.  There are school districts that have admitted the fact that "Baby Boomer" teachers are so digitally behind their students that they have set up seminars where the students teach the teachers digital literacy.
<p>
The simple fact that all children now and in the future are Digital Natives and many are being taught by Digital Immigrants is a big game changer.
<p>
As for Higher Education, I have been saying that it is America's next big bubble.  First there was the tech bubble, then the real estate bubble and now the higher education bubble.  The dynamics are the same.  The buyer and the seller are both over leveraged, the price of the product has become unaffordable and the outcomes questionable.  There is more student debt in America today than credit card debt.  That might be fine if a college degree meant immediate employment at a good job that demands a college education, but that is currently not true.
<p>I think that there will be an entirely new product to go along with the college diploma, and that is the college certificate.  The great American universities such as Harvard, MIT and Stanford are putting most of their popular courses taught by their most popular professors on-line.  These MOOCs [Massive Open Online Courses] can now be accessed by anyone with a high-speed connection in the world.  What to do? Create a certificate program that will allow anyone that wants to take the necessary 124 credit hours via these video & online courses, take the exams for each course and upon successful completion, get a college certificate.  The on-campus diploma may cost $200,000 for four years.  The certificate, completed at the speed the student can matriculate costs say $20,000.  Is four years of young adult socialization worth $180,000?  Let the parents, students and more importantly the employers decide.  The business model would be fantastic for a college as it would be largely high margin incremental revenue.  Admit 1,500 students at $50,000 a year for four years or have 100,000 students around the world pay $5,000 a year with minimal costs.
<p>
Finally, it is time we admit that not everyone should go to college.  We need to make the 14-year education more exalted.  There are young people today that just want to be trained so they can have the skills to get hired.  Who is going to fix things?  I have spoken to community college presidents and CEOs of companies that tell me they graduate and hire students with a fresh associates degree for a $40-60,000 a year job.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Well, my latest and I think best book was just published in January 2013.  It is called <i>Entering the Shift Age</i> and I am promoting it and am committed to spend the next two years speaking around the world about this new, incredibly transformative age we have entered.  The speed of change has accelerated so much that we now live in an environment of change.  Change causes anxiety in most people.  With this latest book I wanted to provide ways for people to better understand the change that is and will be coming and to also provide a roadmap as to what the future might be.  
<p>
So, my next big project is to spend the next two years speaking around the world helping people understand the Shift Age.
<p>
Incidentally, I have always felt it important to "walk the talk."  Since I speak about shift and transformation I created a brand new model for the publishing of <i>Entering the Shift Age </i>called the Agile Publishing Model [APM].  What this means is that my content was shared with a large group of people in rough draft format to trigger constructive feedback.  The second step was to publish mini-eBooks before the book was published.  So, though the full book was not published until January, there were 12 mini-eBooks already available for sale, 10 at a cost of $.99 each.  This allows people to sample the book before buying, just buy the parts of the future they are interested in and read the book the way they want to. 
<p>
I think the APM will be one of the models for the book publishing industry going forward.  Just think about iTunes.  Most people buy songs not albums.  Only if they like the songs do they buy the album.   There will be books in the future that might sell say 10,000 copies, but a chapter or part of that same book might have sales of 30,000.
