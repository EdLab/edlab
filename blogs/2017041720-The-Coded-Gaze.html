<p>Joy Buolamwini, a self-described poet of code, is on a mission to explore the inherent bias hidden in algorithms. Joy uses code to make her ideas a reality but found herself faced with bias in the face-tracking software she was using. This software uses training sets to learn how to identify different faces. When there is a lack of diversity in these sets, certain faces are not recognized by the software, including Joyâ€™s. In order to continue developing her application, Joy had to test her prototype by wearing a white face mask. Bias in these shared libraries becomes built into applications that use them, extending what Joy calls <i>the coded gaze</i>.</p>

<p>Joy explains that "who codes matters." She advocates for <i>inCoding</i>, a term she uses to describe acknowledging the biases that shape software. Through this process, developers can check their inherent biases during the design, development, and deployment of systems. By <i>inCoding</i>, developers begin to ask who is not represented in their developments and can take steps to create more inclusive algorithms. To further her work she has founded the <a href="http://www.ajlunited.org/">Algorithmic Justice League</a> to document bias in systems.</p>

<p>How can we avoid building bias into computer systems? Who should be accountable for the bias that is programmed into these systems? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/35794/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:12 saraehardman:</b> Joy says in the video that the coded gaze reflects whoever creates the systems. If the people who created a software system carry biases, either unconsciously or not, those [biases] will be propagated throughout the software, unbeknownst to those who use it.</p>

<p><b>@01:59 csd2126:</b> In having more diverse software engineering teams, the applications that are developed can meet the needs of broader audiences. An example that resonated with me was how the Apple health app helps Apple users track so much health information, but <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844021/apple-promised-an-expansive-health-app-so-why-cant-i-track">completely forgot about important aspects of women's health</a>.</p>
