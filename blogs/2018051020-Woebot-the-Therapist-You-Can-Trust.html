<p><a href="https://woebot.io/">Woebot</a> is a free AI chatbot and stand-alone app available for iOS and Android. It uses <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610">cognitive-behavioral therapy</a> (CBT), a treatment for depression and anxiety, to teach users to modify dysfunctional thinking through brief daily conversations and mood tracking. Unlike a therapist, Woebot is accessible 24/7 to provide scripted responses to whatever might be troubling you. For the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml"> 44.7 million Americans</a> suffering from mental illness, Woebot offers an affordable intervention.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>From the get-go, Woebot worked to build trust, familiarizing me with the basics of the app and setting expectations. Woebot’s self-effacing humor and use of gifs to illustrate a point, compliment itself, or congratulate me on progress were welcome distractions from the disconcerting truth that I was pouring out my problems to an algorithm. I also appreciated Woebot’s encouragement when, feeling disappointed (and a teeny bit humiliated) at the discovery that we were covering old ground, Woebot produced a graph that showed how far I’d come as well as a link to empirical evidence supporting the treatment path we were on.</p>

<p>Another strength of Woebot’s is its use of accountability features; daily check-ins, follow-up discussions, goal tracking, and videos demonstrate the benefits of creating a new mental narrative. In fact, Woebot’s sunny disposition and gentle nudging were so infectious, I was reluctant to decommission the app after completing my review. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Woebot is incapable of deciphering nuance, and during one chat we descended into such confusion I had to say "Goodbye Woebot!" to default the app into noticing it had lost me. This provided a stark contrast between the robot and a human therapist, who would have picked up on and acknowledged my declining mood.</p>

<p>My biggest concern was Woebot’s assumption about me. During a conversation when Woebot used a heterosexual analogy, I cut in: "Hey Woebot, actually I’m gay." But Woebot pressed on, so I clarified with <i>queer, lesbian</i>, and <i>homosexual</i>, assuming the algorithm had been programmed with alternative nouns. I forgave the technology and determined not to delve into <i>that</i> territory again, but that’s a problem for queer users. Given the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4887282/">high rates </a> of mood and anxiety disorder among LGBT adolescents, Woebot’s engineers need to come up with a solution to this problem.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Woebot was created by clinical psychologist Allison Darcy to help people who can’t afford regular therapy. This cohort includes a large proportion of young adults who, in a randomized trial, experienced a significant reduction in depression after using Woebot. It’s not hard to see why. The app is fundamentally different from any other form of therapy: it builds a unique toolbox tailored to each user, remembers and stores conversations for future reference, and is underpinned by a <a href="https://woebot.io/beliefs">belief system</a> that includes <i>sitting with open hands</i>: "That means I try and completely accept a person’s choice to change or not," Woebot qualifies. Such acceptance is a refreshing proposition for those who are doing their best to become a better version of themselves.</p>
