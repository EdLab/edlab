            <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01930826.2011.601277">Frumkin, J. & Reese, T. (2011). Provision Recognition: Increasing Awareness of the Library's Value in Delivering Electronic Information Resources. <i>Journal of Library Administration, 51</i>(1), 810—819.</a>

This article describes strategies for bringing library tools and resources to the forefront while “discovery happens elsewhere.”  Most of the approaches outlined are nothing new: branding through database providers and on external websites, public and detailed usage reports and department-level electronic journal access lists. The two universities that mounted the study, The University of Arizona and Oregon State University, engaged library users in perception of value studies to gauge recognition of library-provided resources and the effectiveness of library statistics and branding through external websites. 

The interesting part of this study is the intensive outreach done with non-library administration. Library representatives approached departmental heads and deans with both usage statistics and targeted resource lists and gauged their effectiveness with surveys and interviews. Outside of any actual statistics-reading that may or may not have occurred in non-library departments, this seems like a proactive intra-institutional marketing campaign. The external website branding functions similarly. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The drive to provide seamless information and library marketing seem to be opposing forces in this article. A look at an electronic network like Columbia's reveals an immense system with highly subtle branding in external websites. It goes so far as to have an invisible proxy and provide on-campus access to everyone in the neighborhood. Are some of these students unaware that the internet from their house is better than the internet from the coffee shop down the street? Undoubtably. Still more must be unaware that the library is responsible for curating and maintaining the quality of these resources. Marketing resources is an excellent goal, but it's a cop out to associate quality with library. Our more important goal should be to provide information literacy training.
