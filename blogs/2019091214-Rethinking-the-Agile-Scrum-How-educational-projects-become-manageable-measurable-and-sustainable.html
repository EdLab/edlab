The target of this educational project is to support "sustained, systemic, district-wise improvement in mathematics." It seems that the </span>product manager (the Mathematics Turnaround Initiatives) made a clear and measurable goal with the support from the stakeholders (school board, parents, and even students). <span style="background-color:transparent">However, the first-year implementation of the project ended up with a disaster. Here are some reasons that Ms. Johnson (the new Turnaround Coordinator) pointed out for this failure. </span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent">"The very notion of systemic, sustained improvement ran counter to the usual cycle of adoption-and-abandonment." ==&gt; Disconnection </span>of scrum master (Turnaround Coordinator) <span style="background-color:transparent"> and development team (school teachers, external partners), lack of daily (or even weekly and monthly) scrum that provide important communication platform for the whole Scrum team to share timely feedbacks.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent">"few leaders had either the knowledge or the inclination to engage classroom instruction, and most feared a backlash from teachers if they tried ." ==&gt; lack of Scrum environment.

Similar scenarios happen every day. Even in a traditional classroom environment, disconnection also exists between students and teachers: command-and-control instead of collaborative learning.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent">Scrum is rarely used in the educational environment. Using Scrum, could this problem be fixed? Probably, yes. However, there are also many risks. How to avoid dogmatical goal from product owner killed the pluralistic interests from students? How to keep motivation during the long-term process? How to ensure communication to be thorough instead of formalistic? Scrum is simple and powerful. While, in order to apply this framework in education, we need to do more research.</span></p>
