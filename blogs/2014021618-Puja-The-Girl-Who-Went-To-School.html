          <p>
            After watching this Vialogues, I am convinced that gender inequality still exists in some countries. Here is the story of Puja, a girl from India who was sold off to marriage when she was just one and a half month old. The story of Puja depicts how many people, like the ones in her community, believe that girls are meant to stay in the home and not in school. Puja's father didn't want to initially send her to school because sending a female to school is “a complete waste.” This is the common sentiment in most of Puja's community. For this reason, boys should be sent to school while the girls stay home to do house work.

Although this has been the tradition of the people in Puja's community, I like the bold decision that Puja's mother made by sending her to school. Puja's mother's decision shows how much she cares about her daughter's future. Now that Puja is in school, I believe that she will do extremely well because with the help of her teachers, she can now read and write. Additionally, she is able to compete with her classmates, which is a good sign that she will do well. Please feel free to share your thoughts about this video.
