          <p>
            A lot was learned as three thousand papers were released today in the investigation of Jared Loughner, the accused mass shooter from Arizona. These papers describe him as a person who wasn't mentally stable. His usage of drugs and having a gun, I don't think he was always safe to be around. His parents kept his shotgun hidden  and his dad would sometimes damage the car up to keep Loughner at home. With six dead and 13 people injured, the question of gun control comes to me again. When will people stop shooting others? Why was it so easy for him to have a gun with a mother who knew he wasn't completely healthy?

Everytime you hear someone hurting so many people, it is disturbing. In my opinion, it is very disappointing to know that his mother knew he wasn't stable but didn't take him herself to get a checkup. Please see the video below about Loughner, do you have any thoughts or questions about this case? Please join the video and feel free to comment.
