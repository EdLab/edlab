This research guide is intended as an overview of library resources and services of particular relevance for Professor Ami Kantawala's Spring 2019 course <em>A&amp;HA 4085, Historical Foundations of Art Education. </em>The resources, primarily electronic but also some print, have<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/07/Art-Ed-3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17234" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/07/Art-Ed-3-300x114.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="103" /></a> been selected to support the objectives of the course, i.e., to introduce students to "the idea of 'doing' historical research and major historical events and underlying beliefs, values and practices that influence contemporary art education at all levels of instruction."  This guide also includes a section describing research consultation and assistance services and options for document retrieval and delivery available to all members of the Teachers College community.
