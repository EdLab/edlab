            A recent study on US history test scores by middle and high school students reveal a lack of knowledge about topics such as the reasons why the US entered World War I and why Abraham Lincoln is important. According to the federally funded National Assessment of Educational Progress, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/federal-report-shows-history-scores-rising-slowly/2011/06/14/AG1y3fUH_story.html">overall average test scores on US history</a> has risen slowly since 1994 but the number of students who fail to reach what they deem as “basic level” of achievement remains higher than those rated as proficient or advanced. Some experts argue the results is a clear indictment on the federal government's attention to STEM courses, much to the detriment of non STEM courses such as social studies and civics. 

The test, which has been previously given on three different occasions (1994, 2001, and 2006), saw a dramatic improvement among fourth and eighth graders as well as African Americans and Hispanics, who closed the gap on their white counterparts. The situation is different among high school seniors as their test performances rose only two points despite a record number of them taking AP history courses. The history portion of the test was given to a “nationally representative sample of students” (around 31,000) from public and private schools across the country who were quizzed on democracy, culture, technology and the changing role of America's influence in the world.
