<p><a href="http://www.icivics.org/games/peoples-pie">People’s Pie</a> is a civics game that puts learners in the driver's seat of the U.S. federal budget. At the beginning of the game, players choose their tax policies and decide the age at which citizens will start to receive benefits from Social Security and Medicare. These decisions set up initial budgeting conditions for their gameplay. Players will then review programs within ten government agencies (e.g., Defense & Military, Education, Agriculture, etc.) and consider which programs they would like to fund. As the game proceeds, they have to keep an eye on the balance sheet and monitor whether the citizens are happy about fiscal decisions.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This game introduces students to basic concepts of the federal budgeting process such as taxes, entitlement programs, borrowing, debt, and the interest rate, and helps them get a big picture of U.S. government operations. Students will experience the challenges of prioritizing resources, making tough fiscal decisions that might anger citizens, and balancing the budget. Furthermore, it allows students to experiment with different taxing and funding decisions and see the consequences immediately. Players must challenge themselves to lead a sustainable federal government.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The simplification of federal budgeting and its effects in the game helps students learn this complex topic, but it limits students' understanding of the highly dynamic fiscal decision making process to a few oversimplified factors. The indicator of citizen satisfaction plays a significant role in guiding players' funding decisions; however, people across the political spectrum might disagree with the reactions of the in-game characters For example, "the citizens" in gameplay would not be happy if one chose to cut funding for international peacemaking and would approve the decision to create free universities. In addition, the website provides a one-page teacher guide about using this game in the classroom. It might be helpful to offer more resources to facilitate teaching and learning around this complicated public issue.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Computer games are interactive, stimulating, and engaging for children and have become a popular medium for education. Many video productions aim to integrate content learning into gameplay and People's Pie is one such example. The procedural rhetoric of video games makes them a powerful and unique pedagogical tool. However, discussions around the limitations of gameplay are crucial to the use of video games for learning and it is important to help students read gameplay and their gaming experiences critically.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>People's Pie invites learners to the complex world of the federal budgeting process and lets them be the decision maker! </p>
