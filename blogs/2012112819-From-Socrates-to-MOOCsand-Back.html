<i>From the vialogue discussion:<p>
<blockquote>
<b>@01:28 MartinPaper:</b> Content is still king, but when it comes to MOOCs, people seem to be even more drawn by big names (i.e. Sebastian Thrun, Sergey Brin)<p>

<b>@2:15 MariaSanchez:</b> A traditional college professor will see 10,000 students in a lifetime as opposed to a MOOC teacher who can see upwards to 100,000 students per class!<p>

<b>@5:54 BridgetJane1: </b> Interesting to consider. When people talk about MOOCs, they often focus on the learning experience. We must remember the shift teachers of these courses also have to make.<p>

It has been said that if we don’t learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. From an educational perspective, that might not be so bad. <p>

In this vialogue, Martin Vetterli, President of the <a href="http://www.snf.ch/E/Pages/default.aspx">Swiss National Science Foundation</a> and Professor at <a href="http://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale  De Lausanne</a> (a technical institute in Switzerland), gives his TEDx audience a brief history of pedagogy. He explains its origins with Socrates and how that sneaky disciple, Plato, transcribed the dialogues so as to spread Socrates’s teachings to a wider audience. Fast forward a couple millennia, and technology has advanced this mission through innovations in publishing and communication. But, just as teachers were getting used to the idea of using technology in their classrooms, along came Salman Khan. <p>

Khan introduced the world to a new style of video lecture that lived outside of the classroom. He was soon met by other educational innovators who wanted to scale education to a never-before-seen level. Now, with open courses offered on Coursera, edX, Udacity, and others, a single teacher has the capacity to reach thousands of students with just one class. In an effort to move education forward, massive, open, online courses may in fact be moving it backwards to a time when students asked questions and engaged with their peers for the simple enjoyment of gaining knowledge. <p>
