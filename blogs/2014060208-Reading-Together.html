          <p>
            I just came across this interview of Otis and Elizabeth Khuri Chandler, the founders of Goodreads, in an older article from The Atlantic: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/02/millions-of-people-reading-alone-together-the-rise-of-goodreads/283662/">Millions of People Reading Alone, Together: The Rise of Goodreads</a>. It got me thinking about the social network-ification of traditionally solitary activities like reading. One of the stated goals of Goodreads is to make literature into a community experience. Though the idea of people discussing written works (including the literary criticism of Ancient Greece as well as modern day book clubs)  is nothing new, this particular platform has brought together readers in unprecedented numbers: Goodreads has over 25 million users who are able to catalog the books they've read or want to read, write and read reviews, and browse recommendations based on likes and dislikes.

Chandler mentions starting the site with an eye towards "real life" recommendations, i.e. using the site to find books through friends and people already known, but discovered that other communities quickly cropped up. Many users form connections on the site through the reviews feature and are tapping into a much larger (or smaller and more specific, depending on the need) network. This leads me to wonder if libraries can find a way to benefit from Goodreads. I think they can: some libraries already use Facebook to connect with patrons; it's not a stretch for a library to  create a Goodreads profile and start creating content. They could also use Goodreads to form virtual book clubs in addition to real world book clubs, and generally use it as a platform for growing their user communities or even just reaching their existing user communities in new ways. 

The interview also discusses the 2013 purchase of Goodreads by Amazon, and the subsequent backlash from some users who feared the erosion of the crowdsourced nature of Goodreads which attracted them in the first place. So far, the founders say they don't believe the nature of Goodreads has changed. But for me this raises the question, can libraries find a way to create their own version of a network like Goodreads -- one that can be equally as successful on a similarly large scale? As important as I think it is for libraries to be able to meet users where they are (i.e., reaching out into the spaces already adopted by users), I think it is equally important for libraries to lead new paths into new spaces. Recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/business/media/hachettes-chief-at-front-lines-in-fight-with-amazon-over-e-books.html?hpw&rref=books">conflict between Amazon and Hachette Book Group</a> demonstrates that, unlike libraries, providing access to information isn't exactly the main goal of retailers or publishers. Maybe this will serve as a reminder of the importance of developing the kinds of tools, services, and networks that people will want to use (like Goodreads) under the direction of libraries (or library-like institutions) rather than solely relying on tools created for commercial purposes.
