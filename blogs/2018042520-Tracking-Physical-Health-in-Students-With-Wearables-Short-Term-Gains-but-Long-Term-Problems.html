<p>Wearable fitness trackers such as Fitbits are becoming popular devices for maintaining healthy lifestyles, but there is growing concern that the simple measures counted by these wearables too narrowly reduce the concept of fitness, especially when used in an educational setting. This research looks at how students in the UK perceive and use these health-monitoring devices.</p>  

<p>The team sampled 100 teenagers from five physical education classes at two schools in the UK. These teens were given Fitbits for a period of eight weeks. They used the wearables and an accompanying phone app to self-monitor various health indicators, such as number of steps taken, food intake, hours slept, and calories burned. After eight weeks, the researchers conducted focus group interviews with the students.</p>   

<p>The team found that students were highly influenced by the 10,000 step goal, the standard setting for the Fitbits. For instance, if students realized that they had not reached this goal, they would often go for some extra physical activity before heading home for the night. Students often compared and competed against each other in terms of steps, too. </p>  

<p>While the researchers did find higher rates of exercise among the students, they also found a range of negative effects and drawbacks. First, the excitement felt by the students only lasted a few weeks, meaning the effectiveness of the wearables would likely decrease over the long-term. Additionally, participants questioned the accuracy of the system. Some students manipulated the step count through bumpy rides while others saw little gains even after rigorous non-walking exercise like rowing. Finally, the devices added a layer of distrust between students and educators with pupils generally feeling that it was not right for teachers to be able to surveil them in this way.</p>  

<p>Adding wearables to physical health education certainly provides some benefits, but this research shows that the value might be short-lived. Student engagement with the Fitbits dropped after only a few weeks. Further, the negative effects of students’ mistrust of a system that can be gamed and of teacher surveillance might outweigh the rewards of this intervention. The researchers believe that in order for wearables to be effective in a physical education setting, students must have a more active role in choosing how and why to use them.</p>
