          <p>
            There's been a back and forth between Bryan Caplan, Arnold Kling, and Tyler Cowen, with a brief comment from Matt Yglesias. 

Since we last left off with Yglesias, let's start with <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/28/256043/feminism-as-a-negative-shock-to-american-education/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+matthewyglesias+%28Matthew+Yglesias%29">his comment</a> on the debate I will inform you on: 

Yglesias simply cannot fathom the idea that people do not learn useful skills when at college. Here's where Fred and I provide a more detailed view than Caplan. Some disciplines are better at imparting highly useful skills; we give engineering as an example (and we don't mean financial engineering). Yglesias is clearly being too short-sighted to think four years spent studying art history in college is as valuable as two summers interning at an investment bank for an aspiring prop trader. That's not to say skills were not gained in college studying art history or that valuable connections and credentials were not garnered, but compare what was gained in those four years to two summer internships as it pertains to the job the student ultimately seeks. Rounded-ness is a nice bonus and a noble luxury good, but that cannot be seen as a key input to producing value for society.

This brings us to Tyler Cowen's view, that college can be super valuable to all students, just by looking at the returns to schooling literature (see <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/06/natural-experiments-and-the-return-to-schooling.html">here</a>, <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/06/more-on-the-returns-to-education.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/06/does-the-returns-to-education-literature-really-test-the-signaling-model.html">here</a>. His view states that signaling cannot exist because if a person has signaled a wage higher than his actual marginal product, the market will soon find him out and his wage will fall. The evidence shows that the wage differential between those with bachelors degrees and those without widens as time goes by.

Arnold Kling's view can best be summarized that college serves as a credential (see <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2006/02/credentialism_t.html">here</a>, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_cutting-roo.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/college_returns.html">here</a>. It sifts out the cream from the rest of the crop and this process plays itself out in the labor market thereafter. He also notes that there is bound to be bias against publishing evidence that downplays the impact of universities. It's an interesting view that gives a little more credit to colleges than the following perspective:

Bryan Caplan's own view is the one that I think I (and probably Fred) identify with most (see <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/09/educational_sig.html">here</a>, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/me_and_the_retu.html">here</a>, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/ability_bias_vs.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/four_unrelated.html">here</a>. Caplan believes in the signaling model, which essentially claims that employers will always pay Harvard grads well, not because Harvard does a great job educating their students, but because it takes great ability to get in to Harvard. Signaling is consistent with the fact that college can yield great private returns but zero or negative social returns. While I think Caplan ought to refine his viewpoint, I think signaling plays a larger role than most are unwilling to recognize. Remember also that proponents of the signaling model do not say that signaling is not valuable. Elite colleges are great at picking out top-notch talent, and that is helpful for employers. On the other hand, Fred and I are skeptical of what colleges manage to do in developing that talent beyond peer-quality effects over four years. 

Ultimately, this ought to be solved by measuring student's ability before entering and after graduating from college. My hunch tells me that certain disciplines will be better at imparting knowledge in their majors than others.
