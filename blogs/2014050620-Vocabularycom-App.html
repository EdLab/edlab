There are two kinds of people who actually want to consciously improve their English vocabulary: English language learners, and high school juniors preparing for the SAT. The vocabulary.com app, through its design and interface, places itself very squarely at the service of the second camp. </p>

<p>The meat of the app is simply a never-ending series of multiple choice questions, where the user is asked to define various vocabulary words and then, upon answering correctly (either immediately or after several false guesses), is provided with a full definition of the word. The difficulty of the words provided automatically adjusts to past performance, and the device quickly finds your level, with a database extensive enough to suit those with limited or latitudinous vocabularies. The user also has the option to choose more specific (user-provided) lists to draw from, often involving academic subjects.

<p><b>Pros:</b> 
<p>
The system is fairly clever at adjusting its questions based on your performance, and will often return to words that have given you trouble, to aid in lasting retention. There’s a decent database of user-developed lists, and the definitions provided are fairly thorough.
<p>
<b>Cons:</b>
<p>
The use case for this app is more limited than it would seem.  Teachers and students in specific courses might generate and use lists tailored to their needs, but it’s rare that a course would require intense training in specific vocabulary divorced from the rest of its material. English language learners will be put off by the extensive, complex definitions provided, and often find themselves lost without more of a scaffolding structure to aid them.
<p>
<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
<p>
If you’ve always felt that you should have a larger vocabulary, without quite knowing what use it would be, this ($2.99) app might be right for you.  Or if you’re cramming for the SATs and want to make use of every free moment, give this a try. Otherwise, look elsewhere.
<p>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>
<p>

Caviar to the general, there may be a market somewhere for this app.
