Recent research focuses on gamification for students, but what about gamification for pre-service and in-service teachers? <a href="http://quest2teach.strikingly.com/#home">Quest2Teach</a> aims to help future educators bridge theory and practice within instructor-led courses in an online environment. In this game, which uses a "small game" (i.e., containable and personalized) framework, teachers develop an avatar that they use to engage in learning virtually across semesters. The 3D, virtual reality platform allows teachers to "learn through doing," experimenting, and practicing before entering a real classroom environment. Quest2Teach, in the spirit of John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, sees experiential learning as essential to education, whether the learner is a teacher or student.<p>

The game is the product of an innovative collaboration between ASU’s Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, the Center for Games & Impact and the university’s partner game-design studio, E-Line Media. The <a href="http://quest2teach.strikingly.com/#about">aim of the game</a> is to collapse the divide between theory and practice and allow for learning personalized for each student. In order to achieve this, Quest2Teach offers a variety of features, from data analytics to discussions by way of social media platforms, to promote a sense of community. Within these frameworks, diverse tools, theories, and assessments can be accommodated and the game can be manipulated to ensure growth. <p>

Do you think this game could revolutionize how teachers prepare to teach? Share your experiences <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18161">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<p><b>@0:58 Sappho:</b> Is the purpose to teach teachers about teaching with games OR to prepare them to use games with their students as part of their teaching? These seem different.</p>

<p><b>@1:02 MartinPaper:</b> The Sanford Inspire Program puts a lot of emphasis on teaching and learning through games. I just saw kids playing with cards in the video... I wonder what lesson was being taught with them!</p>

<p><b>@02:55 MartinPaper:</b> A game is not a cure-all. It should be used in addition to other teaching methods.</p>
