Here's a snippet that <a href="http://teachinglikeits2999.blogspot.com/p/who-is-ms-magiera.html">Jennie Magiera</a>, a 4th and 5th grade teacher and a math/technology coach in Chicago Public Schools, wrote on her blog,<a href="http://teachinglikeits2999.blogspot.com/"><i> Teaching Like It's 2999</i></a>: 

<i>"Technology + Education + Passion = Wow. Education without technology is so 1979. Technology without passion is a waste of money. Education without passion is a waste of everyone's time. Technology without education... well, that can be okay but weaving the two together can lead to bigger and better technology for tomorrow. I believe that the classroom should reflect the world for which we are preparing our students. If we are asking them to create, innovate and be outstanding as graduates entering a terrifying job market, then our classrooms should be creative, innovative and outstanding places to learn. Everyday. Period."</i>

I agree with her wholeheartedly. In places like EdLab, we emphasize the future of education and technology-infused classrooms. The vision of this idea is what drives companies and labs to create products, tools, and resources that will bring us closer to that future. And teaching pioneers like Ms. Magiera are those ones bringing those resources into real classrooms and to real students. I sincerely want to believe that there are many other teachers out there that are just as passionate about the transformation of the traditional classroom and how technology is becoming increasingly inseparable from education.

However, as I am going through a K-12 teacher education program here at Teachers College (TC) and also being down in the trenches of public schools with overextended budgets and overflowing classrooms, I feel even more of an urgency to make this idea into a reality. Going back and forth from EdLab to my graduate classes and then to my placement high school in the Bronx honestly feels like time travel. One is an environment where innovation is the norm and the others have been left behind in an age where the future is still pretty far away. In my Technology-Based Language Teaching and Materials Design class, we were taught how to use gchat. I was stunned at how many of my peers were unfamiliar with it or any other Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC) tool. It reminded me of a passing comment by Thomas Suarez, a 6th-grade iPhone developer during his <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2146">presentation at a TED conference</a>: <i>"These days students usually know a little bit more than teachers about technology... sorry."</i> I didn't know how great the disparity really was until I sat in my 2-hour long class and watched my fellow colleagues learn about gchat and open gmail accounts for the very first time ever. Talk about an achievement gap.

I understand that using digital tools and media in the classroom is still a debate amongst educators and some teachers are uncomfortable including them heavily in their classrooms. However, we cannot stop  students from growing more and more familiar with technology and having it part of their everyday life. As teachers, don't we want to make sure that it's part of their classroom and academic life as well?
