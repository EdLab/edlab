The idea behind <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> is that human translators are more accurate than computers. So why not crowdsource translations and harness the power of the masses? To further increase the pool of available translators, Duolingo also offers interactive language lessons, currently in Spanish, German, French (still in beta), and English (for native Spanish speakers). It's an interesting concept, brought to us by Luis von Ahn, the man behind ReCaptcha.

(For more of an overview, the New York Times<a href=”http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/a-computer-scientist-banks-on-human-superiority-over-machines/?smid=pl-share”> featured a story about Duolingo</a> a few weeks ago.

<b>Pros:</b>

<li>The lessons are interactive with a variety of tasks, including translating, listening, speaking, and identification.</li>
<li>There is a strong element of gamification, designed to keep the user engaged.</li>
<li>Having real-life examples to translate adds a practical application to language acquisition.</li>
<li>There are discussion boards available to discuss questions about your language of choice amongst the community.</li>


<b>Cons:</b>

<li>The order of items in a given lesson is randomly-generated, meaning sometimes exercises appear out of logical order. (For example, I was asked to translate a phrase containing a word I hadn't encountered yet in German. On the next screen, I was “introduced” to the word in question.)</li>
<li>Some of the source materials available to translate are strangely segmented, leading to bizarre translations. In other cases segments to-be-translated are already in English, making their translation pointless. There is no way to provide feedback on individual segments of the source translation, only the translations themselves.</li>
<li>The “best translation” is decided by the crowd. If the same translation is given by the majority of translators, it is deemed the “best”, even if that translation is not in idiomatic English or contains other errors.</li>


<b> EdLab Relevance</b>
While it seems that Duolingo's primary focus is on providing crowdsourced translations, with its substantial educational component it is certainly a tool designed for those of us who might like to pick up some more language skills. The way they structure their lessons is quite interesting, and even for that reason alone anyone looking to develop online courses may want to check it out.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
The language lessons are probably more of a draw than the translation exercises for the majority of users. There are certainly kinks that need to be worked out, but if you can handle some frustration it's worth playing with.
