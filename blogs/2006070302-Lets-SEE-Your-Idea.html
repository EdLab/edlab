            I was sad to hear the new library website would taste like vanilla.  I'd hate to see a self-proclaimed locus of innovation just do the same old thing; so what to do?  My first thought was another timeless seminar (that's the thing on the enormous curved whiteboard by Gonzalo's desk), but the prior one was rather unsuccessful (maybe we just don't like archiving?).  Then I thought: we'll have another meeting!  Sure, they're great for avoiding work and usually involve a laugh or two, but it seems we need less talk and more walk.  So I'm back to “What to do?â€?

There's often a great deal of feedback when designing websites, but most of the talk is in abstractions.  It's a difficult process to take these abstractions and create a working site.  It's even more difficult when there is only a 2 hour formulaic event to air these ideas; and again when most of the ideas are without context.  Web designers work in context, programs work in context, comments like "it's hard to see the search box" are without context.  It leaves too many open solutions and we need something deterministic.  We need a picture...<!--break-->

Adobe Illustrator!  AI is a nice product for making pretty shapes and text that even a poorly trained monkey could use.  I had never used it prior to working at the EdLab and became comfortable with the basic features within 10 minutes.  And the beauty?  Pretty shapes and text == WEBSITE!  So it seems reasonable that any member of the EdLab could present his or her ideas for the library website, PK, TCR, etc. with AI.  It doesn't have to be perfect, what is important is that it clearly designates a possible solution.

Just to put myself on the chopping block, I spent a little while playing with AI and the library website.  I thought of a few features I like and a rough sketch of a layout.  You'll find it <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/download/937">here</a> on PocketKnowledge.  I got annoyed with the layout halfway through, but the idea is there and recognizable.
