<b>Inspiring Today’s High School Students</b><br>
<a href="http://educurious.org/">Educurious</a> is dedicated to combining "project-based learning, technology, and connections" to inspire high school students across America.  Funded by the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, this non-profit educational organization focuses on reinventing the learning landscape to enhance the student experience by connecting what they learn in school to real-life.  <a href="http://educurious.org/about/founders/">Founders</a> Stephen Arnold, Michael Golden, Phillip Bell, and Patricia Wasley created Educurious to accomplish this goal for high schoolers and their often lack-luster curriculum through an online social networking platform.  By providing engaging educational tools, Educurious is able to offer students and experts alike new ways to connect and turn real-life problems into real-life solutions.
<p>
<b>Three Core Tools</b><br>
Educurious aims to equip teachers with technology and educational tools that are in-line with the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">Common Core</a> and <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/">Next Generation Science Standards.</a> The goal is to inspire students to not only stay in school, but to enjoy the process of learning. Three core tools Educurious provides to reach this goal are: online project-based courses so students can develop problem solving skills and learn different approaches to mastery of a skill or lesson; a network of more than 500 experts to collaborate with and gain insight into possible careers (Learn more about the <a href="http://educurious.org/products/">Educurious Expert Network Expansion</a> tool); and an online social media platform that can be used by students, teachers, and faculty to communicate and collaborate.  In addition, there is a <a href="http://educurious.org/products/">New Course Authoring Tool</a> that teachers and institutions can use to create their own online courses.</p>
<p>
<b>Decreasing Drop Out Rates</b><br>
With these tools available for students, teachers, and experts to use, people have the opportunity to learn in new ways. As the name suggests, Educurious aims to inspire curiosity within students to gradually reduce high school drop out rates across the country.  Students are able to connect with experts who serve as mentors. Not only do students learn how to simply connect with others and gain vital communication and collaboration skills, those who use Educurious’ tools have the opportunity to learn about technology and apply this learning to real life.</p>
