<p>Games are used increasingly as learning aids, but are they as effective as books? Obviously game designers seem to think so. In fact, the designers featured in this video argue that games are comparable to major works of literature, and are just as essential for the learning process. </p>

<p>Games can transport a student to another time or place where they are completely immersed in a story and an experience, which is naturally more interesting than sitting through a lecture. Students become part of the story—not just passive observers, but active participants. Games evoke emotion and allow for deep connections with the audience. </p>

<p>Of course, both games and books (and <i>any</i> media used in the classroom) are only beneficial when they are chosen carefully and deliberately; it's important to determine what is educational and what's a distraction. A curriculum that takes advantage of both books and video games might lay down a theoretical foundation through a text and then incorporate games as an application of knowledge. </p>

<p>What do you think is an appropriate balance between books and games in the classroom? Is there room for both? Let us know by joining the conversation <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23400/">on Vialogues</a>.<p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:28 Kafou:</b> I think some video games are very educational because they help you think outside of box and adopt different strategies to overcome a challenge.</b></p>

<p><b>@01:00 yaotse:</b> Even though video games can be essential for education, students cannot continue spending hours playing these games because it can be very addictive. There should always be time spent on getting work done. </p>

<p><b>@02:00 melAIL8:</b> I don’t think you can really merge textbooks and games together. Games makes you feel like you are really in it and solving problems but textbooks you are outside and just watching and executing what’s going on.</b> </p>
