          <p>
            Recently, I attended "It's Worth How Much? - Technology Licensing Demystified," an event hosted by <a href="http://www.stv.columbia.edu/">Columbia Technology Ventures</a>, the technology transfer office of Columbia University. The event's speaker, <a href="http://stv.columbia.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=46&Itemid=66">Dr. Daniel Abraham</a>, discussed overvaluation and undercapitalization of early stage inventions as the "Valley of Death" that innovators like us face on the path to commercialization. A former VP and Chief Technologist for The General Electric Company's Technology Licensing Group, Abraham outlined the major components of a University technology license such as: term of the license grant, scope of the license grant (i.e. exclusive versus non-exclusive), field(s) of use, royalties and other payments, sublicensing, US or worldwide IP protection, disclaimers of warranties, and indemnification.

He also discussed other factors the University considers in formalizing a licensee-licensor relationship such as technology assessment, market potential and the commercial plan (aka technology roadmap). He reduced the stages of development for an early stage inventions down to "in the head," "in the lab," or "in the fab[rication]."

Most useful in understanding the University's goals in licensing faculty and staff inventions was a radar plot that Abraham provided, which included several axes for categorical data such as:
<li>equity in the venture</li>
<li>upfront costs</li>
<li>milestones such as alpha and beta testing, patent issuance, and FDA approval</li>
<li>fees such as license issue fee</li>
<li>expenses such as patent prosecution</li>
<li>annual minimum payments</li>
<li>earned royalties such as % of net sales or $ per product sold</li>
<li>sublicensing</li>

A few relevant statistics on commercialization, according to the Columbia Technology Ventures website are as follows:
<li>Columbia University has been responsible for 102 start-up companies.</li>
<li>13 of those start-ups have been acquired either by private sale or by publicly-held entities and nine have gone public in their own right.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://stv.columbia.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=27&Itemid=55">Columbia portfolio companies</a> have raised in excess of $1 billion in venture and public market financings.</li>
<li>To date, the Columbia portfolio companies have generated more than 1,500 jobs.</li>

The D&R team at the EdLab is currently working on a proposal to educate the TC community about social entrepreneurship and commercialization via a venture competition. If you haven't done so yet, please review and comment on the EdLab Social Venture Competition proposal <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3355">here</a>.

And for those of you who are curious about the market potential in your own work, throughout the year, Columbia Technology Ventures hosts a variety of events relating to technology, entrepreneurship, and intellectual property. To join their mailing list, visit their <a href="http://www.techventures.columbia.edu/">website</a> or send an email to techventures@columbia.edu.

Of particular interest to those of us in the EdLab, on December 2nd, Columbia Technology Ventures, together with Columbia's Copyright Advisory Office, will be hosting another event entitled,  <b>"Protecting Your Scholarship: Copyrights, Publication Agreements, and Open Access."</b> For registration information, click <a href="http://actevarsvp.com/event/a0E60000000uHvA">here</a>.
