            One of the recent discussions we've had in my business class concerned employees who are forced to stay in their current occupation even though they do not enjoy the work. This is largely a result of lack of other employment opportunities. 

The professor offered some insights and advice on how to avoid been such an employee in the future. First, create a chart with the one side having a what I like to do section, and the other with a what I don't like to do. Also create a different chart to show weaknesses on one side, and strengths on the other. This will eventually determine what kind of job is right for me. I feel that this strategy should be taught as early as high school. If this was taught in school, one will know what they want to study in college and will probably have a better idea of where they want to go. 

This <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/12/06/how-to-choose-a-career-thats-best-for-you">article</a> provides more advice on how to choose a career. Was any strategy taught to you on choosing your career/job? If so, was it different from the one aforementioned? Do you wish you were taught some techniques on how best to pursue your dream career?
