          <p>
            Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending a Google Tech Talk on Rich Media Strategies for the modern web. Advertising, being Google's favorite cash cow, enjoyed the spotlight for much of the presentation. The engineer/intern pair that were presenting described some of the criteria that determine an online media viewers' ad experience:

Podding: a term used to describe when and how ads should be grouped. You know when you're browsing YouTube and all of the sudden both the bottom portion of the video and the right side of the screen want you to buy delicious Chicken McNuggets? That's podding at work.

Typing: delineates what sort of ad overlay is created. Customers react differently to bottom bumper ads than they do a sidebar.

Loading: defines different experience for customers based on different customer profiles.  As Amazon can verify, a good recommendation is a powerful sales tool.

The team went on to illustrate a graphical application for associating advertisements with videos. Such a tool allows content publishers that have commissioned ads through Google greater control over the ultimate end-user experience. By simplifying the process of ad placement, Google enhanced both the attractiveness and viability of its ad service. Perhaps here is where we can take a major queue from Vialogues. Users that are uploading videos for pedagogical purposes may have very specific ideas about what commentary they'd like to include and where they would like to include it, and as we all know, sitting through a video on Vialogues just so that all your initial questions have the proper timestamp can be a bit of a pain. Ideally, a tool for seeding a Vialogue with initial comments would allow for both easier control over content placement, as well as more flexible options for content display and duration.
