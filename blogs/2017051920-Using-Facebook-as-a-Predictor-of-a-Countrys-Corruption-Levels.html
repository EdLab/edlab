<p>Corruption is a global problem, yet studies have previously shown that internet use helps combat it. The greater the internet use in a country, the lower the levels of corruption tend to be. A new study tested this relationship, but with social media use, focusing on Facebook specifically. It asked, if internet use combats levels of corruption in a country, does Facebook do the same?</p>
 
<p>Researchers examined corruption levels and social media use in 150 countries to answer this question. In particular, they collected the corruption data from the World Bank’s 2012 <a href="http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#home">Control of Corruption Index</a>. They also analyzed what percentage of the total population of each of these countries used Facebook via an analytics company called <a href="https://www.quintly.com">Quintly</a>.</p>
 
<p>Overall, they found a significantly strong negative correlation between corruption and Facebook use. In other words, countries that had more Facebook users had lower levels of corruption, and countries with fewer Facebook users had higher levels of corruption. The researchers also found that this negative relationship was particularly strong in countries where the press in general is more repressed.</p>
 
<p>The researchers believe this could be the case for several reasons. For one, Facebook allows news of corruption-related events to spread quickly and to reach a large audience. In countries where the press is repressed, Facebook could allow users to share leaked stories and their own personal experiences with corruption. In interpreting both results, the researchers assume that awareness of corruption (such as through news articles) helps reduce that corruption overall.</p>
 
<p>While corruption is certainly greater in some countries, the study notes that all countries (even the least corrupt) have some corruption. While Facebook has been criticized this past year for its connection with filter bubbles, it’s important to remember studies like this, which suggest that Facebook has overall positive benefits on the freedom of press in any given country. Of course, it’s way too simple to suppose that world corruption could be solved with more Facebook use. But this study shows that freedom on the net and on social media is important to fight for and preserve.</p>
