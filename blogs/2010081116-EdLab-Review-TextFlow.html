<p><b>[Pros]</b> This software does one thing really, really well; it provides a dynamic way to collect and review changes made in different versions of a Microsoft Word, Open Office, or Google Apps document, allowing you to make decisions on what changes go into the next version. If you ever need to incorporate changes from multiple friends, colleagues or teachers into your word document, this application will save you a significant amount of time since you can compare and merge document versions all at once.</p>

<p><b>[Cons]</b> Sometimes seeing all different edits at once gets confusing, especially if many different edits exist. Also, figuring out how the right sidebar works may take a few minutes.</p>

<p><b>[The Bottom Line]</b> TextFlow is great software, helping to increase your productivity. Instead of having to look through all editors' versions of your document individually - and many times figure out how to merge MS Word's track changes - you can simply view all changes side-by-side or directly in your document and quickly and easily finalize each decision on content changes in order to produce a better document with TextFlow.</p>



<p><b>Recommended Uses:</b> Teachers, students and business professionals needing to merge many document edits into one version easily and quickly.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger">Full Review</p>
    
<p>Have you ever found yourself working on a team where all members edit a document and send you their revisions? Was sorting through each member's revisions both time-consuming and frustrating given that you needed to decide how to merge all changes into a final document? If so, TextFlow by Nordic River is for you!</p>

<p>TextFlow allow you to collect each group member's revised document and view all changes at once in order to quickly decide what to include in your final document. The software even shows which person made each particular change.</p>

<p><b><u>Usability</u></b></p>

<p>TextFlow is fairly simple to use. After downloading and installing the desktop client, you can then import your original document along with the many edited ones. The first document you import defaults to be the original, non-edited version. All documents imported thereafter initially get compared automatically to the first document.</p>

<p>To change the original document to which all others are compared, simply click on the document you want on the left hand panel. To show edits made from one or more particular versions, click the arrow button to the right of the documents you would like to view changes from.</p>

<p>To accept a change, simply click the checkmark when scrolled over the track change you would like to add. To not accept a change, click the X symbol. To hide a change, click the arrow. To move the change to your “scrap board” to view, drag it to the right hand side of your screen.</p>

<p>The program also provides you with a simple formatting menu on the top including basics such as Bold, Italics and Underline.</p>

<p>Because this program focuses solely on document merging, everything is very simple to use.</p>

<p><b><u>Features:</u></b></p>

<p>This program has one main feature - the ability to combine many edits into one final document. Although no other features exist, this main one works very well. In addition, the software also retains the original document layout including document images and tables before merging all documents into a final one.</p>

<p>One last great feature of this is that you can use TextFlow both as a standalone desktop program, or you can incorporate it with Google Docs or Box.net. All versions are mostly flawless — sometimes delays happen.</p>

<p><b><u>Innovation:</u></b></p>

<p>While other software packages exist assisting with editing and storing documents collaboratively, no other package allows a user to merge different versions of a document together that is as powerful as this TextFlow. Amazingly, Nordic River (TextFlow's creator) even integrated this into Google Docs and Box.net!</p>

<p><b><u>Value:</u></b></p>

<p>Price-wise, you can use TextFlow's desktop version for 14 days free of charge, but after that you need to shell out $99 for a license.</p>

<p>For its Google Docs version, TextFlow is free for light usage (max 10 saves per month), $29 per user per year for the full version, 50% off for academic institutions, and free for undergraduates.</p>

<p>For its Box.net version, it costs $9.95 per month for an individual user and $15 per month for a business user.</p>

<p>As far as productivity is concerned, using this goes without question if you need to collaborate with others on document creation.</p>


<p><b><u>Conclusion:</u></b></p>

<p>TextFlow does one thing really well; it allows for productive, timely collaboration in document writing and editing. For those needing to go over edits from multiple individuals, this program is for you and come highly recommended!</p>
