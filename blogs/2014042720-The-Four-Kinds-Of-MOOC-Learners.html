<p><b>Title:</b> Deconstructing Disengagement: Analyzing Learner Subpopulations in Massive Open Online Courses (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ren√© F. Kizilcec, Chris Piech, & Emily Schneider</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2460330"> Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge</a></p>

<p><b>Research Questions:</b> What are the different types of learner engagement trajectories in MOOCs? How do different types of MOOC learners respond to various course structures or instructional approaches?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> MOOCs have become one of the most popular online learning resources in the past few years, but recently they have been criticized for the low completion rates of learners. Given the comparatively open nature of MOOCs in registration and attendance, some scholars, including the authors of this paper, have started to challenge course completion rates as a valid indicator of students' learning in MOOCs. </p>
 
<p>Drawing on data from three computer science MOOCs, one at the high school level, another at the university level, and the third at a graduate level, and survey data about learners' demographics and MOOC learning experiences, this study aimed to identify different trajectories of learner engagement and explore how different types of learners interact with various MOOC course structures. </p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b> Using a clustering algorithm, four learner engagement trajectories (completing, auditing, sampling, and disengaging) were identified in this paper. While learners in disengaging and sampling groups reported lower levels of satisfaction with their MOOC experiences, the auditing group reported similar levels of satisfaction to those in the completing groups in two of the three courses. Auditing thus appeared to be an alternative learning pathway that met learner needs. In addition, across these three courses, many learners were not only taking MOOCs for credential or job training purposes, but for intellectual stimulation.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The technologies and big data behind MOOCs have enabled exciting analysis and experiments for better online learning and teaching practices, and a more nuanced understanding of online learning that is critical for more effective course design. MOOC participation is not limited to a single type of learner and achievement does not need to be measured in traditional ways. For instance, MOOC instructors are able to provide a variety of assessment options to accommodate the different needs of each learner group and offer various types of completions and achievements that all signify deep learning. Findings from this study provide a great starting point for such efforts, but more research and analysis is urgently needed and will be extremely helpful in building a more effective and efficient model of online education.</p>
