            In the meeting today, I got caught up arguing that some decisions must be made even for the most extreme versions of the reSEARCHing methodology.  I really do love the idea, and I'm happy to be working with people who believe that identifying new patterns is both possible and relevant.  What I was trying to point out is that we necessarily have to limit our views and thus our “dataâ€? when choosing the SEARCHing environment.  For example, if we video tape little kids playing baseball we shouldn't expect to learn much about how Newton obtained his theory of gravitational pull.  I believe the following quotes capture the idea better than I am expressing it.  The first is from an article by Paul Thagard which I will post about later.  The second comes from a decent piece on paradigm analysis.  It's from Illinois' School of Education and is relevant to the framing of our discussions.  <a href=http://www.coe.ilstu.edu/rpriegle/wwwdocs/paradigm/analysis.htm>Paradigm Analysis</a>

<cite>
One fruitful characterization of scientific discovery is to view it in terms of search in two problem spaces: a space of hypotheses and a space of experiments (Klahr & Dunbar, 1988; Simon & Lea, 1974). ... In [Schunn and Klahr's] new framework, what has been previously conceived as the hypothesis space has now been divided into a data representation space and a hypothesis space. In the hypothesis space, hypotheses about causal relations in the data are drawn using the set of features in the current representation. Similarly, the old experiment space is now divided into an experimental paradigm space and an experiment space. In the experimental paradigm space, a class of experiments (i.e. a paradigm) is chosen which identifies the factors to vary, and the components which are held constant. In the experiment space, the parameter settings within the selected paradigm are chosen.</cite>

<cite>First, like any analytic method paradigm analysis should be considered a heuristic set of recommended guidelines, not a rigid set of immutable laws. Good paradigm analysis requires judgment and intuition; it is the height of folly for an analyst to expect success merely by following a recipe or a set of well defined methodological rules. Slavish devotion to any methodology is counterproductive for both the method and the analyst. Successful paradigm analysis depends more on the skill of the analyst than on the method itself.</cite>

I'd be interested in hearing everyone's ideas for not just research questions but also for research environments if we were to take up the reSEARCHing method.  I think there are infinite directions to play in but a real difficulty in narrowing the scope to one which fits, say, TSI's interest in the design approach for software development and Christine's linguistic research.  Which leads me to another question: can someone clarify the research goals?  Is it one research project at a time?  Many?  Small group research under a single EdLab declared topic or environment?
