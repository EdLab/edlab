          <p>
            I thought to bring attention to the goals, directions, motivation and context of the EdLab in the midst of our discussions on research as below:

-	The Edlab fulfills a service mission within the Gottesman Libraries by designing, developing, and delivering new knowledge services for the Teachers College Community.
 
-	The Edlab is a site that supports the learning of Teachers College students in any field of study with an interest in educational innovation and entrepreneurship. 

-	The Edlab pursues an independent research and action agenda that focuses on the future of education in light of new social and technological options for organizing and delivering knowledge. 

In particular to our discussions on research, "the role of educational researchers will be to design and deploy the data gathering entities, the data analysis entities, and the entire data-action network within the reconfigured education sector. Through this work they will influence the behavior of educational systems, not the behavior of educators. Social science researchers with an interest in education will continue to engage in research of various types designed to provide theoretical perspectives to orient the work of educational researchers."

With the above goals and context in mind, the following questions came to mind:

1) Is there anything we can learn from the various past and existing research paradigms? My personal opinion is that we do have a lot to learn. Without "standing on the shoulder of giants" and knowing the strengths and limitations of existing research paradigms, I am doubtful if we can see much further beyond. For this purpose, I am sure that Gary's wisdom and knowledge as an experienced researcher will be of tremendous help.

2) What is more important -- content vs. medium, content vs. form, content vs. method? A medium, or form, or method in one context may be the content in another context. For instance, a movie/video is medium of a story, but is content of the field of movie studies. With this in mind, I think that we need to situate our research discussions in the context of various fields of studies while purposefully experimenting and integrating methods across disciplines to break the boundaries. We want to be innovative, but I think we also would like, if possible, to be recognized sooner than two hundred years later.

3) Where do we start? Where do we end? How do we provide resources to support individual creativity and collaborative motivation in the process? 

I have many more questions without answers, so I'll stop here.
