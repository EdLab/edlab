            Books tell stories. An obvious statement. The actual words strung together by an author into sentences to form a verbal structure that says <i>something</i>. That's why we read books. 
 
Books are also material objects, at least traditionally. A "book" means more than the text printed inside the covers. There are myriad design decisions made in the publishing process: size and shape, typeface, paper weight, cover design, color, overall feel, and other factors. Additionally, considering a book-as-object means thinking about how a person interacts with a book. As <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/05/what-books-mean-as-objects/">an English professor at Harvard</a> states:

<blockquote>It can hide your face on the subway. It can decorate your coffee table. It can be burnt by political opponents. And it can establish relationships between two successive readers, as when [Barack] Obama was sworn in on [Abraham] Lincoln's Bible.</blockquote>

I'm not sure how ebooks fit into the "book-as-object" conversation. Since I'm already overreaching my philosophical limitations, I won't address ebooks just yet. 

Lately I've been thinking about the stories that can be told through books as objects, when books become the "paint" and not just the "canvas." Several different artists are trying to say <i>something</i> using books as their medium. Let me give you some examples. 

<b>aMAZE me.</b> I recently read an <a href="http://inhabitat.com/amazeme-book-labyrinth-completed-for-the-london-2012-cultural-olympiad/">article</a> about the <a href="http://festival.london2012.com/events/9000965121">aMAZE me</a> labyrinth, a giant art installation built from 250,000 books. Conceived by two Brazilian artists, Marcos Soboya and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/southbankcentre/amazeme">Gualter Pupo</a>, 200 volunteers <a href="http://vimeo.com/46750756">built the maze</a> last week for the London 2012 Festival. It is designed in the shape of the fingerprints of the Argentine writer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Jorge Louis Borges</a>. An audio tour guides visitors as they wander through the maze of books.

<b>The Joy of Books.</b> A beautiful stop-motion animation film by <a href="http://www.ohkamp.com/">Sean Ohlenkamp</a> set in a Toronto bookshop called <a href="http://typebooks.ca/">Type</a> that went viral earlier this year. Ohlenkamp and a team of volunteers worked to create this film while the bookshop was closed during four consecutive nights from 6p.m. to 10a.m. The video has over 3 million views on YouTube. Here is an excerpt from an <a href="http://www.toronto.com/article/709475?bn=1">interview</a> with Ohlenkamp on why he thinks the video struck a chord: 

<blockquote>I think that they like that it's very positive. I think that's pretty refreshing, to see something that's not sarcastic... I think we're living in a time that's volatile right now for these brick and mortar business as well as things like physical books, with everything becoming more digitized and moving online. So I think this is a little bit of a rallying cry. It can remind people that while the Kindle is coming, books aren't going.</blockquote>

<b>The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore.</b> This poignant and humorous film about <a href="http://morrislessmore.com/">Morris Lessmore</a> and his flying books won 14 awards this year, including the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. The animation technique is beautifullly done - watch out, Pixar! The Louisianan creators, William Joyce and Brandon Oldenburg, describe their film:

<blockquote>Inspired, in equal measures, by Hurricane Katrina, Buster Keaton, The Wizard of Oz, and a love for books, “Morris Lessmore” is a story of people who devote their lives to books and books who return the favor.</blockquote>

These works of art all communicate something about the power of "real books" to move people. Like I said earlier, I'm not sure how this fits into the sometimes heated conversation about digital books vs. real books. Frankly, there seem to be clear benefits for both kinds of books, and I believe ebooks and material books will coexist for a while longer (probably for the rest of our lifetimes). But ebooks are definitely where we're heading. So are these works of art are simply nostalgic for the way things were? Or is there something to be learned about the way people respond to physical books? What do you think? 

I know this topic a little old school, but I also know that there are lots of book lovers here at EdLab, so I'm curious to get your feedback. This isn't just about good, old-fashioned books, it's also about imagination, storytelling, creativity, technology, and design.
