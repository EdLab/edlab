<p><b>Title:</b> Writing, Citing, and Participatory Media: Wikis as Learning Environments in the High School Classroom (2009)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Forte & Amy Bruckman</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/ijlm_a_00033#.U8A7bo1dWb9">International Journal of Learning and Media</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do students write and reason about information when constructing an information resource for others? What role does the wiki medium play in shaping their writing and information-related practices?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The popularity of Wikipedia as a crowd-sourced encyclopedia has illustrated the great potential and power of wikis as collaborative media. The authors of this study wanted to explore participatory media for education, and were particularly interested in understanding how academic writing practices could be supported and mediated by wikis in high school science classes. They explored the use of the <a href="http://scio14.wikispaces.com/">Science Online wiki</a> for students to share their research paper assignments online as information resources for the public in two science classes. Data were collected through classroom observations, pre- and post-tests on students' information assessment strategies, and in-depth interviews.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The science teachers framed the writing assignment for the wiki as a traditional research paper, but students felt that the openly accessible class wiki changed the purpose of the format as they used to understand it. They engaged more deeply with other online resources and simplified their writing to optimize it for web audiences. Although the nature of the assignment was individual work, they used the features of the wiki (e.g., revision history, review other contributors’ work in progress) to collectively construct their understanding of the unfamiliar web publication task. Analysis also revealed that students tried to meet two distinct communication goals in their wiki articles: meeting class assignment criteria and creating a public resource, and they used different strategies of finding, crafting and sourcing content to meet these two goals.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Participatory media are an important part of many students’ daily social activities. Using social software for academic writing and understanding holds great potential for more efficient and effective collaborative learning in classrooms.  This study reveals an interesting case of integrating science assignments into a wiki publication project that is accessible for an online audience. More studies along this line would help educators design innovative and authentic social learning experiences in their classrooms.</p>
