            Some of you here at the EdLab might have noticed there was a tall man following me around with a camera all day. The tall man, Alexander Klosterkemper, is currently a film student here in New York City. He was head of film and media services for FIFA and was an influential member of the FIFA team that broadcasted the past two world cups. I met Alex earlier this summer when <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4717">I attended the Urban Soccer Collaborative in Cincinnati</a>. Through various interactions, he decided to include my clubmate, Christstely, and I as two of the primary subjects of his master thesis film aptly titled <i>Football for Social Change.</i> 

As the title suggests, the movie is about football (soccer) programs in urban inner cities that is geared towards helping the players in such programs prepare for college, and career goals. My current team, South Bronx United (SBU), is a perfect example of a soccer program that is for social change. It is funded largely on sponsorships, donors and grants and serves over 400 children of all age and ability levels all throughout the Bronx. It is also worth noting that SBU also serves several players who live in Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn. <p>

My day with Alex was very interesting. He filmed me in my various capacities here at the EdLab: scanning over 100 year old curriculum materials to upload into PocketKnowledge to enhance student and faculty research, posting to the blog, and attending the weekly Development and Research meeting. I even showed him how to upload files into PocketKnowledge. After work, he followed me to practice at Macombs Dam field in the Bronx where he shot footage of my team as we prep for our annual preseason Labor Day tournament this coming weekend. 

I have given the film and its message my full blessing. I am even overwhelmed by the attention and hope that the documentary comes out exactly as Alex envisions as it will not only help promote SBU but promote Football for Social Change and make it a movement that catches on in other inner cities. Below is a rough cut of a video South Bronx United is submitting as part of the Pepsi Refresh challenge and offers a glimpse into how SBU is using football for social change. I even make a guest appearance in the video as well as Christstely, the other subject in the film Alex is shooting.
