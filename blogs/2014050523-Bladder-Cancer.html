            Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells divide without control and have the ability to invade other tissues. There are over 100 types of cancers and it can affect any part of the human body. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States behind heart disease. It accounts for nearly one in four deaths. One of the most common is bladder cancer. More than 70,000 Americans are diagnosed every year with bladder cancer. Bladder cancer often begins in the cells that line the inside of the bladder. Though it can occur at any age, it is more common and most likely to happen to older adults. There is currently no exact cause for this type of cancer. However, doctors have come to discover some risk factors that can lead to the disease such as the environment and smoke. They have also discovered some symptoms.
<p>
According to this <a href=" http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/daily-checku-beating-bladder-cancer-article-1.1479595">article</a>, in order to avoid or even prevent bladder cancer, don't ignore any signs that show that you may have the disease even if it is a false alarm. Quitting smoking or even staying away from excessive smoke can also decrease your chances of having bladder cancer or any type of cancer. Additionally, doctors advise their patients to stay hydrated as it helps flush the toxins from the body rather than having them sit in the bladder. If you notice dark urine, it may be an indication that you may not be drinking enough fluids that the body needs.
