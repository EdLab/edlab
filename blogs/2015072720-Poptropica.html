<p>From the <a href="http://fen.com/">Family Education Network</a> comes this vibrant game designed to get kids to learn as they play. <a href="http://www.poptropica.com/">Poptropica</a> allows kids between the ages of 5-15 to create a Poptropican character and navigate the different islands of the land via virtual hot air balloon. Players can choose any individual quest from any island they would like to tackle, and embark on a strategic adventure. Once a quest is started, players are given clues that they must piece together as they work through solving a mystery or completing a mission. They can interact with characters in the game and even with the avatars of other players, since it is an online and connected universe. As they bounce around and tumble through the landscape, players and their fellow Poptropicans remain actively engaged and entertained as they hone their reasoning, creativity, and critical thinking skills. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Poptropica is a safe game for kids, since they can only communicate to other players by selecting pre-scripted chats. Parents need not worry about their children giving out any private information either, since there is no point in the game or in the creation of a log-in that asks for anything that may be used to personally identify a player or their location. When creating a character, players are asked for their age, and the speed of the in-game dialogue text slows or speeds up accordingly. The freedom to choose any quest at any time without having to complete a previous mission first ensures that kids will stay interested in the game and not be frustrated if they have difficulty advancing. Finally, the game is available on many different platforms.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The biggest disappointment with Poptropica is the huge ads that are located throughout the actual world of the game. Although they are advertising various Poptropica mini games and additional levels that can be accessed in the game or through the website, they are distracting and play no role in the current mission. There are plenty of cool mini-games to be found when players explore the realm, so these ads are really just distractions.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Poptropica is an awesome game for learning at any age. Players may not even be aware that they are playing a game designed to educate them! This bright and colorful game could be a great way to get students more comfortable with technology and to encourage them to practice problem-solving. Poptropica is a promising start for educational gaming in K-8 classes. Students will enjoy travelling from island to island and completing quests, and parents and teachers will know that children are having fun while learning in a safe virtual space.</p>
