CLIMATE FOR UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING AND LEARNING IN STEM FIELDS, 19-32</a>

In my ongoing research for everything STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) related, this article stood out for me because it begins by stating what I think is a big problem in STEM education: many students who begin with a STEM major as undergraduates switch to a non-STEM major before graduation for varies reasons . The author says that one reason is that there is a “chilly climate” and poor-quality learning environments. As someone who has experienced the STEM classroom, I agree with this statement. Back in college when I had to take engineering courses for my major, some of my professors only seemed to care about moving on to the next lesson as quickly as possible, instead of making for engineering was a bit better in that we had a more hands on approach to the subject but in the end, it was about answering the lab questions before the end of class. Since we will be needing more STEM majors in the future, we need to change the climate for STEM majors from “chilly” to “super hot”.

<b>Description:</b> The paper initially discuss how people learn and introduces the teaching strategy called the “Backward Design Process”. This strategy is to first identify what exactly you want your student to know, then assess whether they have met your learning goals, and to plan the instruction accordingly. The author then goes into greater detail about implementing cooperative learning. First he notes there is active learning, which is where during the middle of a lecture, students turn to each other and explain to each other what they have learned so far in the lecture for about three to four minutes. The one technique that is most interesting and one that I would do is the “Implementation of Cooperative Base Groups”. This method has students in a group for along termer and can even go beyond the completion of a semester. This cooperative learning is where students meet and exchange contacts so that they can continue to support each other after school. These students  can work on long term projects or lab assignments after school and online through several kinds of websites (Google+ or Edmodo for example). STEM majors are difficult for most students to stick with for many reasons, so having a social kind of environment in and out of the classroom would keep the students interested enough to stick with their STEM major through the four years of undergraduate studies. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> The “Backward Design Process" is going to be a strategy I'll be thinking about while I draft my UFR Network site lessons (my lessons involve lots of math). I will also try to incorporate more cooperation activities in the lessons as well to keep students interested. This cooperative learning can better be applicable in other projects that we have too such as Vialogues. People learn much more in a social setting and in a perfect world, it would be great to see this type of learning consistently in today's schools.
