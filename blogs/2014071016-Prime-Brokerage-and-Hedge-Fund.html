            A recent articleb on prime brokerage and hedge fund emphasizes the importance for hedge fund managers' careful y selecting prime brokers for their company and weather they actually need a broker at all.  Many hedge fund managers across the board rely very much on their prime brokers; it is essential for the manager to have a good relationship with their prime brokers mainly because the brokers provide them with a lot of services. Hedge Funds are investment companies for the super rich investors. In the United States all investors in any hedge fund must earn a $1 million dollars or more annually. Hedge fund managers are interested in investing the money they acquired from their investors in order to make profit.  The managers are responsible for administrating services such as providing leverage, settling trades and lending securities. However, managers usually need assistance from prime brokers in order to complete their task. 

Prime brokers are vital in the long term success of a hedge fund. Prime Brokers act as an intermediary between banks who are supplying securities and hedge funds who are demand for securities.  Prime brokers in big banks such as JP Morgan and Citigroup use their influence to acquire securities from banks and other securities holders in order to service their hedge fund clients.  At the end if the broker can support a hedge fund client with their needs a good partnership usually equals success.
