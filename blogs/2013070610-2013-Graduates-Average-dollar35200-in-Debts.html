          <p>
            There has been numerous amount of issues with students regarding their student loans after graduation. I came across this <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/17/pf/college/student-debt/index.html">article</a> that had a fidelity survey of 750 college students asking them the reasons for their debts, what they should've done and their plans for paying it off. Most received the average debts from the students loans, credit cards and money owed to family members. Most of the 2013 debts are from the government loans; with graduate averaging $26,000 in that and $19,000 in private loans, $18, 000 in state loans, $13,000 in personal loans and $3,000 in credit card loans. 

After they were asked what they should have done better, 39% said they would've done things differently by saving earlier, doing more research on financial aid and what it will lead to in a long run and spending less money while in school. Another 12% said that the education they got in college didn't justify the debt they owe. Mostly half of the students stated that paying off their debts is their financial priority and also said it will take them approximately nine years for them to finish paying off their debts. When they was asked on how they pay it back, 92% said they will pay it back with their income, 25% said they will use parental help, 24% will use their savings, 21% will get a second job and 7% said they don't think they will ever pay their debts off.
