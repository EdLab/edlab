<a href="http://www.english-attack.com/">English Attack!</a> is a 100% entertainment-focused online resource for improving English As a Second Language skills, and is designed with the teen and young adult (15 â€” 25) ELL learner in mind. It focuses on video exercises using clips from movies, tv shows, music videos, and the news.

<b>Pros:</b>
The content is updated daily, featuring online video clips from the latest global news clips, recent tv shows, and the latest chart-topping music videos (Who knew Lady Gaga could be used to teach English?). The actual application of the website itself just seem super fun. The front page shows how many points a user just won from a word game and who just earned the next level of badges (Reminds me of gaming community websites like NeoPets, but the educational version) Also, there are social networking functionalities like wikis, forums and messaging.

<b>Cons:</b> 
I was disappointed to find that the whole website was just like a big pothole for advertisers. Basically, in order to unlock more videos, photo vocab, and practice games, you need to earn "booster coins". In order to earn more booster coins, you can either pay for it ($1.99 for 440 coins) or you can earn them for free using a SponsorPay system. You have to click on an offer by all these advertisers and sponsors and complete the required actions as described in the offer. 

Some of the offers and advertisements are so random and have nothing to do with ESL or education at all <b><i>("Don't let Osteoporosis slow you down!", "Are you a Vampire?")</b></i>

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
I don't think this will ever be a problem for Edlab, but as we find ways to promote our products and charge our users, I hope we can approach it with integrity :)

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
I think the makers of this program really did try to focus on the proper pedagogical principles and they make it clear that they genuinely want to bring language learning into the 21st century. The idea of entertainment-focused english education is still hotly debated amongst TESOL nerds, but I think if properly utilized (without the random osteoporosis ads), it can really benefit ELLs.
