By now you have probably guessed that the EdLab is going through a major transition as we seek to develop new capacities and as we contemplate the addition of new full-time and part-time team members.  We will be talking more about all of this in the weeks ahead.  This is the first of a series of posts on the transition.  This post focuses on something relatively concrete - workgroup tools.

Among the goals of the EdLab transition is enhancing the level of cooperation and collaboration among all of those participating in EdLab projects, including a new group of those not physically located on the fifth floor of Russell Hall.  We would like to have a single well-integrated team, and to do this we will need a set of communication channels to manage and share our project work.

I have been investigating some online project management tools that might serve as a backbone for the new integrated team approach.  I began by considering several tools from  <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, most notably <a href="http://basecamphq.com/"> Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://campfirenow.com/"> Campfire</a>.  From there I was led to <a href="http://www.opensourcerails.com/projects/111"> RailsCollab</a> an open source product based on Basecamp.  This, in turn, led me to <a href="http://teambox.com/tour">
Teambox</a>, a related product available both on a subscription and in an open source version installed on our own servers.

These are only a few of the large number of group project management tools available.  There are any number of reviews of these products, such as <a href="http://www.graphicrating.com/2010/05/06/10-free-project-management-tools-to-fit-your-needs/">this one from Graphic Rating</a>.

So, I am interested in ideas that anyone has for a group project management tool or set of tools.  I am particularly interested to know about any direct experience that anyone may have had with these kinds of tools.  

The features that seem important include:

a) ability to track multiple projects with tasks assigned to individuals and groups
b) ability for all members to have accounts
c) easy to use communication tools
d) capacity to archive key documents and other project resources
e) ability to work with other tools that we currently use and value, e.g., email, TRAC.
f) ability to provide controlled access to clients
g) high visibility to allow all team members to have an understanding of the overall workflow of the more integrated EdLab

There is no perfect tool, and whatever tool we eventually select will be only one part of a set of communication strategies (e.g., work meetings, seminars, etc.) that will be necessary to achieve closer integration of efforts.
