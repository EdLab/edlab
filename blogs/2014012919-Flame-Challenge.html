<i>I hope that what scientists do is not take it as a challenge to explain the inexplicable but to explore the mysterious.</i> (Alan Alda on the <a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/the-flame-challenge-2/about-the-challenge/">Flame Challenge site</a>)


<p>
<b>Igniting the Flame of Curiosity</b><br>
Held for the past few years in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/">Alda Center for Communicating Science at StonyBrook University</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda">Alan Alda's</a> "<a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/the-flame-challenge-2/about-the-challenge/">Flame Challenge</a>" is an innovative contest meant to foster a greater awareness for both science education and science communication.   With both a written and visual category, the contest is open to working and retired scientists who compete to present the most direct and engaging answers to complex scientific phenomena.  This year’s contest posed the question, "What is Time?" and 20,000 young people from around the world judged the entries with the winners announced at the <a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/">World Science Festival</a>.  Nicholas Williams, a retired scientist and prior winner, says of the contest, "Presenting a science program, or science topic, to students in very early school years is definitely a challenge. I have witnessed very, very intelligent scientists try, and fail…My hope is that the Flame Challenge will reinforce the concept that science must be understood, by all, no matter what the age."
<p>
Alda’s own inspiration for the Challenge reaches back to his interest, as an 11-year-old, in the origin of a flame (hence the name of the challenge).  Alda’s interest in science continued despite the end of formal science training in college when he embarked on his fine-arts-focused studies, "Unfortunately, I guess I was a victim of what C. P. Snow called the two cultures because when I got to high school in the 1950s I thought you had to choose between an interest in science and an interest in the arts."  Alda has spent the rest of his life making-up for lost time and began reading "every article" in <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific American magazine</a> in his 20’s.  It was this yearning to bring science into his own life that led him down the path of science advocacy and journalism.   
<p>
<b>More Improv Please</b><br> 
Alda, who in addition to founding the Flame Challenge and starring in such hits as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068098/">MASH</a> as well as countless award-winning movies and plays, is a pioneering science-focused journalist and long-time host of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/saf/">Scientific American Frontiers</a>.   Alda feels strongly that scientists need to learn how to improvise when presenting complex scientific concepts to an audience.  Through innovative workshops and programming <a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/improvisation-for-scientists/"></a> the Alan Alda Center is well on its way to teaching working scientists to bring improv to their presentations.  Through these out-of-the-box programs that unite science, journalism and theater training, Alda is not only helping young people to feel more connected to science, but he is also helping scientists to better entertain and engage with their audience.
