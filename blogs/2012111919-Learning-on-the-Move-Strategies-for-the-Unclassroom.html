<p><b>Title:</b> An Adaptive Navigation Support System for Conducting Context-Aware Ubiquitous Learning in Museums (2010)</p>

<p> <b>Authors:</b> Chuang-Kai Chiou, Judy C.R. Tseng, Gwo-Jen Hwang, Shelly Heller</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The researchers behind <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131510001016"><i>An Adaptive Navigation Support System for Conducting Context-Aware Ubiquitous Learning in Museums</i></a> aimed to examine student learning during a simulated field trip to a museum. The study was grounded in a concept called context-aware ubiquitous learning, which means that learning takes place in a specific context (in this case a museum) with personalized support from learning software. The authors tested navigational support technology that previously had been used in online learning, but never in the context of a museum. The purpose of the study was to detect the learning behaviors of students in real world settings.</p>

<p>For the study, students were separated into three groups to test different strategies for learning. The first group was given a guide with randomly suggested exhibits, the second group was given a list of exhibits to visit and a time for each exhibit that had been generated by an algorithm, and the third group was given a mobile "maximized objective navigation support system" that would tell them the best exhibits to visit based on their location and the number of other learners detected at that location.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The three processes were tested for learning effectiveness and efficiency. The first group was used as a control. Since they roamed naturally through the exhibits, they were intuitively efficient and avoided exhibits that were too crowded. The control group browsed on interest and didn’t maximize their visits based on location, so their measured learning results were moderate. The second group, which was given a prescribed list of sites to visit with time to spend at each site, did well for learning but movement in this scenario was not efficient and resulted in crowding and unnatural time allocation. The third group used the adaptive process with the navigation guide. This group did better than the control group on learning and about the same as the control group in exhibit-visiting efficiency. Overall, the authors thought that the third group, which used the context-aware ubiquitous learning strategy, offered a good combination of efficient movement and quality learning.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The ability to track learning behaviors in specific settings has implications for libraries, museums, and other non-traditional learning environments. The rise of mobile learning apps and increased participation in online programs means that learning can happen anywhere and will often happen outside the classroom and without a physical teacher. The context-aware ubiquitous learning strategy used in this study is not yet available to the public, but it’s not much of a stretch to imagine museums and other active learning environments incorporating this technology into their mobile apps.</p>
