As you can see, I tend to take a lot of inspiration out of TED Talks (except for that Ken Robinson one). While there are many themes in her talk, many of which are controversial, I want to focus on her analysis of educational computer games. Too often they are precisely flashcard games slapped onto some "game" context. Think back to what Ryan Baker presented at the EdLab seminar; when the questions posed are formulaic word problems, students try to game the system. But when students are given a lot of context and background, the students are more likely to work through the problem without gaming the system. Simply put, there needs to be more emphasis on developing context and background for the learner. Only then will enough learners have a real incentive to engage with the given concepts that underlie the problem or application.

Over the weekend I thought about what kind of game could actively involve math without coming off as superficial and well...lame. Being a math and econ guy, I started thinking about the applications of game theory to (American) football and how this could be harnessed to teach probability and other mathematical concepts. At least when playing Madden (although I suspect true for the NFL as well), I have to choose from a selection of plays based on the my best estimate, or expectation to use probability-speak, of the opponents' play. Since I get to see what plays the computer is choosing from, it makes my decision of which play to choose purely based on probability, although I have to set the probabilities myself. To get a simplified idea of this, I have to think about what are the likely outcomes of plays A & B if the computer plays C; what are the likely outcomes of plays A & B if the computer plays D. If probabilities were given to me while I was playing, it would make my play-selection more rigorous, yet enough uncertainty can be remain in the game (since we are dealing with probability) to keep it interesting for the person playing the game (at least that's my suspicion). 

I'm curious to know where this idea could go or of other ways to better integrate games and educational concepts. Feedback please!
