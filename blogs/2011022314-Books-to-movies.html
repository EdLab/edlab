            There is a rule in my house - you cannot watch a movie that is based on a novel or short-story without having read the text first. Initially it was so that my kids would read, and would put reading first-  so that it inculcated them with the idea that text allows for it's own interpretation. With books your mind expands and creates scenes and images and visions in your head - and it is an always interesting discussion after such a movie, where there is a comparison of how you imagined a face or a character or a scenario with how it was portrayed on the screen.

Also - there is the outrage of how film directors have taken license and changed the script of the book to make it more their own interpretation.

Some of my favorite adaptations have been:

The Harry Potter series.

The importance of Being Ernest

The English Patient

The Color Purple

The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo

And yes...the Twilight Series!

I must admit that I have not always been a follower of my own rule - because as an avid movie goer, I just don't have the time to read everything first - but I try. Or I try to make my kids follow the rules!

As an educator, I am afraid that young children don't read as much as they should and could and that they are overrun by film and movies and youtube clips. And for that reason I feel my house rule is justified.

This year I look forward to the screen adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's <em>Jane Eyre,</em> and the Manga graphic novel <em>Priest.</em> Can't wait! 

What are some books/ novels/graphic novels you would like to see adpated to the big screen?
