            <a href="http://edpro.stanford.edu/hanushek/admin/pages/files/uploads/economics%20of%20schooling.JEL.pdf">Hanushek, E. (1986). The Economics of Schooling: Production and Efficiency in Public Schools.  Journal of Economic Literature, 24(3), 1141-1177</a>

This post kicks off a series that Skanda and I will be posting on the work being done in evaluating schools and teachers.  For the first paper, I thought I'd pick something basic, both to introduce the series and so that Skanda (who actually knows something about economics) won't knock me around too badly in the comments.

Review:
Hanushek's paper, from 1986, is a review of the factors affecting student achievement, limiting its data to public schooling in America.  He states boldly at the outset that differences in student quality “do not seem to reflect variations in expenditures, class sizes, or other commonly measured attributes of schools and teachers.”  On the other hand, he's not quite at the “bad students, not bad schools” level, instead placing most of his focus on teacher quality, albeit of a kind difficult to measure.

To begin with, Hanushek charts the enormous increase in public-school expenditures from 1960 to 83 (and concomitant decline in pupil-to-teacher ratios).  The puzzle of his paper is that this increase in the quality of “inputs” was not matched by an increase in output (as measured by test performance, which rather dipped during that period). 

For in-depth evidence, Hanushek reviews 147 previous empirical studies.  He finds that there is no expenditure related input (class size, teacher experience, education, or salary, total expenditure per pupil) that, in the majority of studies, is found to have a statistically significant positive impact on student test scores.  Of course, he is careful to emphasize the provisional nature of this examination, but concludes that the only input that can be manipulated to produce better outcomes is teacher skill.  Our current obsession over “merit pay” and teachers unions seems like a natural result of this conclusion, although others have certainly criticized these findings since the publication of this paper.  

Relevance:
Any claims made in a paper 25 years old, particularly in a contentious field like education, must be taken with a grain of salt.  It is better to view these results as provisional, and I am confident that after a few more papers in this series we'll have a much better understanding of the science of education.  That said, this can stand as a warning that many you things you would intuitively think are very important in education, and necessary for learning, may not be so.
