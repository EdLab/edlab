          <p>
            There has been a push over the last several years for 1:1 laptop programs in schools. Six papers in the most recent issue of <a href="http://escholarship.bc.edu/jtla/"><i>The Journal of Technology, Learning and Assessment</i></a> compare the effectiveness of different laptop programs. Some of the research focused on standardized tests while other focused on teacher and student self-reported data. A brief summary of the results is provided below and the full reports are available after the <a href="http://escholarship.bc.edu/jtla/">jump</a>. <br>
<li>It is very difficult to compare laptop programs across schools. There is great variation in training, implementation, subject area use, goals of program, software, and hardware access (in school or after hours). 
<li>One study in Texas showed virtually no improvement in test scores as a result of laptop use  in school. Home use, however, could be credited for improvement in reading and math scores. 
<li>In California, students performed best on areas of the standardized tests that were specifically targeted by the laptop program. If the standardized content was not explicitly addressed by the program, there was no effect on test scores. Laptops did not help improve learning in general, just the targeted learning goals. 
<li> The quality of use of laptops varied dramatically from school to school. Some schools simply replicated the traditional curriculum in the digital environment while other schools used laptops as an opportunity to explore new teaching and learning methods. </li>
<br>
Having taught in a middle school computer lab for several years, I am not completely convinced that 1:1 is the ideal ratio for laptop programs. When I had a computer for each student in the classroom, I noticed the students were less willing to engage in group work because they didn't see the need to share their computer with other students. (They each had a computer so why should they have to work with someone else). One year I opted to remove half of my computers from the lab and assigned two students to each computer. I noticed an immediate improvement in their willingness to work with another student. Working together on a computer also provided opportunities for the students to discuss the material and rely on each other for information (instead of immediately asking the teacher for help. . .a common occurrence when the ratio was 1:1). Of course this information is purely anecdotal, but it does raise potential research questions: <br>
<i>Are 1:1 laptop programs the best solution? If not, what can we do to determine the best ratio for collaborative learning?</i>
