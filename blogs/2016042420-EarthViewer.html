<p>The Earth’s history recedes so far into the past that it can become lost in the horizon and make a single human life seem like a small instant. How do we unravel the mysteries of the planet’s lengthy lifespan so students can begin appreciating the expansive place we all call home? <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/earthviewer/id590208430?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8r">EarthViewer</a> is an iPad app that helps young earth scientists appreciate the world in a whole new way by providing a series of geological markers that divide the globe’s seemingly infinite history into more digestible nuggets. </p> 
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>EarthViewer allows users to revisit the world’s continents and oceans as they changed across three major time spans, from 250 million, to 1 billion, and even 4.5 billion years ago. Users can layer on a variety of data including atmospheric conditions, biodiversity, day length, solar light, and temperature. The app allows users to dive into the depths of the seas and climb to the peaks of mountain ranges providing a first-person look at our fragile home. </p>

<p>EarthViewer’s interactivity is first-rate. You can zoom in on the earth’s surface with a pinch of your fingers in real time. Rotating Earth around to see far flung parts of the globe is as simple as twisting your fingers around the screen. Major cities are represented with trusty icons so you never lose your balance when your world spins upside down. The ruler-like dateline lets you timeshift among different geological eras quickly, simply, and logically. Layers of information can be added or removed in a snap. For those of you who aren’t hardcore Earth scientists, EarthViewer presents interesting factoids on the Lucy fossil, La Brea Tarpits, and other ancient phenomena. In short, EarthViewer accomplishes a lot in a little space in an interesting way.  </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>At first glance, EarthViewer can be a little intimidating. There is <i>so much</i> information that you can become overwhelmed. Layer upon augmented layer of data could make you confused about what you want to know and where to find it. This app’s embarrassment of educational riches makes the choice of where to spend your valuable time a dilemma. The menu lining the bottom of the screen is also not as intuitive as it could be; for example, switching between the three major eras should be easier to accomplish. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>EarthViewer breathes life into the history of the planet in a dynamic manner that makes geology, climate change, meteorology, and other subjects interesting for youth. It is a highly informative, deeply functional app that shares an incredible bounty of information about our precious world. But like a precious nugget buried beneath the surface, you may have to dig a bit to find that rich vein of golden knowledge. </p>
