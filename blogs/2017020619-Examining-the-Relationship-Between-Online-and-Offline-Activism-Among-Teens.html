<p>With more activism taking place online, some scholars are concerned that digital actions will undermine in-person activities. They believe that since signing a virtual petition and attending a virtual event is easier than engaging in these activities in person, people will not be compelled to leave their homes to participate in activism and will instead receive a false sense of making a difference from their digital actions alone.</p>
 
<p>In light of this concern, researchers interviewed over 1,000 teens from five Balkan countries to measure the relationship between their online and offline civic activism. The surveys asked the teens whether they had participated in activism in any of eight different domains (e.g., animal rights, politics, education). The surveys also addressed how many actions each teen had participated in online (e.g., sharing their opinion on Facebook or volunteering in an online group), as well as how many they had participated in offline (e.g., attending a rally or wearing a shirt supporting the cause). In each category, there were 48 listed activities.</p>
 
<p>After collecting the questionnaires, the researchers found that more teens had taken part in an offline action than an online action. In fact, 87% had completed at least one action offline and only 76% had completed at least one action online. This result surprised the researchers; despite the fact that they interviewed adolescents, the demographic group with the heaviest internet users, offline activism was still more popular than online activism.</p>
 
<p>The researchers also found that offline and online activism were positively correlated, meaning that the teens who had engaged in offline activism were more likely to engage in online activism and vice versa. Because of this, the researchers propose that instead of thinking of online and offline activism as separate, we should view them as a combined model called <i>hybrid activism</i>. According to this study, the skeptical scholars have nothing to worry about because instead of undermining traditional activism, online activism actually fuels offline actions.</p>
