            The suicide of a Rutgers University freshman Tyler Clementi last month has thrust cyberbullying firmly in the limelight. The outrage and shock of Clementi's suicide and recent cases have turn cyberbullying into a national discourse on cyberbullying with activists, school administrators, and counselors, among others all weighing in on the debate to effectively combat an increasingly growing problem among young people. Incidentally, October is also National Cyber Security Awareness Month and National Bullying Prevention Month. A <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-internet-empowers-weak-tyrants-104273753.html">recent study</a> by the youth research firm TRU sheds light on the extent of cyberbullying among teens. According to the study:

<blockquote>64% of teens say bullying is a problem in their own schools and communities. The ubiquity of social media has turned what was once a community issue into one of worldwide scope. More than half of teens (52%) know someone their age who has been the target of hateful or hurtful electronic communication, while three in 10 (29%) admit to having suffered such intimidation themselves.</blockquote>

Cyberbullying and young people using the web as a platform to air secrets and spread rumors is also becoming rampant across college campuses and a recent <a href=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2010/1008/Report-One-third-of-US-teens-are-victims-of-cyberbullying/%28page%29/2">Associated Press-mtvU poll</a> of 2,200 undergraduates at 40 randomly selected four-year colleges, revealed that 68% of college students felt a friend was seeking help through their online posting.

In the midst of a fierce election season and widespread media coverage on cyberbullying, politicians have been rather mute on the topic. There are no specific laws on cyberbullying and charges for those accused of cyberbullying are usually ambiguous. As such, the fight to really combat cyberbullying starts the day perpetrators are subject to face some sort of consequence.
