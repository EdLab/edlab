<p>
<a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">TreeHouse</a> is a platform that enables users to learn and practice writing code. Lessons are organized in projects such as building an app or designing a website. Learning to code in the context of these projects makes it easy for students to apply what they have learned to start their own online project. Users can also take courses on TreeHouse that teach them how to start their own business, something useful for anyone who wants to launch a startup idea. There are also intermediate programs for some languages such as HTML, Ruby, and JavaScript. Each course includes videos lessons, quizzes, and an interactive space to write and run code.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Students can practice coding what they have learned in the video lessons through challenges. These activities require a bit more thinking and problem solving than those offered by similar sites. Instead of simply re-creating code from an instructional video, a challenge on TreeHouse could involve analyzing a piece of code and making corrections. Each lesson provides all the resources needed to complete the challenge. For example, if a user is learning how to build an Android app, an Android development folder will be available for download containing all applications needed for development.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The puppet frog mascot may not appeal to some older learners but is perfect for younger students. One minor complaint would be that the size of the lesson is large and the size cannot be adjusted. It would be beneficial for users to be able to shrink the video so they can move it to a corner of the screen and perform the actions depicted in the video while watching.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>TreeHouse is project-based learning for aspiring coders. The interesting thing about a project-based strategy for programming is that users produce a learning artifact when they complete a course and produce a portfolio of concrete learning examples. The site boasts that it can give its users the technology skills needed for a job or to build a startup idea. It provides the resources needed for users to learn how to start their own business. TreeHouse teaches programming with a hands-on approach that gives users the skills needed for future jobs and careers.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>TreeHouse gives users the tech knowledge needed to create.</p>
