<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/froggipedia/id1348306157?mt=8">Froggipedia</a> presents an exploration of a frog in AR, from its life cycle to its anatomical systems, complete with a virtual frog dissection. After observing the complex internal organ system of the frog, a quiz tests your knowledge. The app is available on iOS devices and costs $3.99.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The AR used by Froggipedia is impressive. Often even high quality AR is a bit buggy or sensitive, but my frog was displayed reliably; I moved around a lot and manipulated his size and position with no trouble at all. The AR was especially effective in demonstrating how a frog grows from an embryo to a full-grown adult, with a function that allows you to view benchmarks in a frog’s development or slide through the entire life cycle to see bodily changes.</p>

<p>The dissection portion of the app felt like a clever way to go through the steps of dissection without having to do it yourself (or hurt a frog). For the more squeamish, an animated frog is much easier to cut apart. Descriptions of each organ and system are straightforward, and directions are clear.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>My concerns with Froggipedia are not in what it offers, but in what it doesn’t. In general, the information given on internal organs, external features, and anatomical systems is limited to short blurbs, which could be expanded to create a more robust learning tool. Additionally, to keep users engaged longer, additional functions or activities could be added, such as introducing food or predators into the life cycle section to illuminate environmental factors.</p>

 <p>While the dissection is fine, it is minimal in what it offers. While you follow the steps of a true dissection, the procedure is pre-set and leaves no room for unstructured exploration. Therefore, while I think it would be a good tool to prepare students for a dissection, I would not be comfortable saying it could function as a replacement.</p>

<p>Another flaw in the dissection portion is the inability to zoom in. If you’re using a tablet and stylus, this might not be a problem. If, however, you are using a smartphone to conduct your dissection, it can be much trickier to move with precision and see frog organs up close.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While I appreciate most of what Froggipedia has to offer, I think it still has some room to grow. As a companion tool in a biology classroom, I can imagine its benefits, but it isn’t yet ready to be a dissection alternative.</p>
