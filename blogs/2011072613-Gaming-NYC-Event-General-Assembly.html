          <p>
            As I mentioned in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6212">my blog post last night,</a> I attended the monthly NYC Gaming event at <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/a-place-for-techies-to-gather/">General Assembly</a>.   It was my first time at the "Assembly" and I was impressed by the open workstations and glass-walled meeting rooms.  My only critique would be the WHITE WALLS... they seemed a bit ominous and unfriendly, almost as if I were in a sterile idea hospital, instead of an idea incubator.   

<b>The presenters and games included:</b>
Nicole Leffel - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=206676559344337">Dreamland</a>
Richard Talens - <a href="http://www.fitocracy.com/">Fitocracy </a> 
USA Networks - <a href="http://www.characterarcade.com/games/">Character Arcade</a>
Matt Edzenga - <a href="http://www.BlastZone2.com/">Blast Zone 2</a>
Julian Volyn - <a href="http://redcandygames.com/tic.php">Red Candy Games</a> 


<b>Here are my top 3 from the evening...</b>

<b>Dreamland</b> is a roleplaying-style FaceBook game.  You move through a board of quests and challenges by rolling dice and leveling-up.  You can make in-game purchases to furnish a virtual room.  The premise of the game is that you have these adventures only while sleeping.  The team initially thought that the demo would be young men, while in fact women in their 20's & 30's are the largest users.  "Shame" tactics are employed and a message appears that "your friends will laugh at you" if you don't meet a challenge.  I wonder if this last aspect is really a successful game dynamic?  Otherwise, classic "level up" & leaderboard tactics are used.  The customization of your room and characters etc. is compelling.  The game has an overall cartoonishly "scary" feel and seems addictive and fun to play.  When asked the team mentioned that the whole game cost over $200K to build and design and a small team of only a handful of people. 

<b>Fitocracy</b> seemed most applicable to our work at EdLab, with clear goal-setting, an informative, highly granular dashboard and a simple, modern design.  The overall goal as stated by the founder is to create an, "addiction to exercise via social gaming."  Users have profiles & share fitness goals with each other while completing fitness "quests" and receiving points and level-ups for successfully meeting these goals.  Users can give each other "props" similar to "likes" on Facebook.  The dashboard is similar to Twitter and seems attuned to users needs and comfort with existent social media platforms.  This is an important aspect of the site's success, that while they are creating something new to the market, there is also an immediate comfort for new users in this familiar design.  

The granularity of the dashboard and tracking page seems almost to be overkill, but for a serious exercise enthusiast, I am sure the ability to distinguish the terrain conditions of a run is valuable & in the case of many NY'ers worthy of extra "props" from peers.  I wonder if "urban jungle" is an option?  Another effective UI/UX element is the "clip board" where you input your data, this simple addition feels like a fitness center training element and really ties the theme to the user experience. 
Speaking of user experience, the founder really emphasized the role of iteration in their process and that they rely HEAVILY on user feedback to inform their iterative process!

<b>Red Candy Games</b> (aka a small group of computer science students at  <a href="http://rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>) blew everyone away with their 3 level, $3 game for the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Search?q=tic#Games">Xbox Indie</a> market, <a href="http://redcandygames.com/tic.php">Tic</a>.  They built their own game dev engine and created quite possibly one of the most visually interesting games I have ever seen.  Rendering both 2D & 3D primitives and employing multiple camera angles, this three-level game, while short, will knock-your-socks-off.  In the style of <a href="http://www.littlebigplanet.com/ ">"Little Big Planet"</a> and even borrowing from Children's book illustrator  <a href="http://www.eric-carle.com/home.html">Eric Carle</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">Steampunk-style</a> pre-industrial revolution design elements, Tic takes gaming to a new level... all while the lead character rides a unicycle!  This is a game design group to watch.  Investors take note... I am sure any angels in the audience last night already have.  The team has plans to open-up their engine to the world, for a fee on Xbox live.  PS. the game cost the team $100 to build & they worked together remotely via Skype.
