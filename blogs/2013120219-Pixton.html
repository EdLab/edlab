<p>Educators who are looking for an exciting way to motivate and engage their classes should consider a medium that students would probably rather spend time on anyway: web comics. Adventurous teachers should look to Pixton, a sophisticated and easy-to-use online platform that allows anyone, regardless of artistic ability, to quickly author colorful personalized comics. This award-winning "click-n-drag comics" tool could be useful in multiple industries, but the carefully designed educational edition specifically caters to teachers and students.</p>

<p>In addition to the obvious appeal of cartooning in class, Pixton offers a persuasive pedagogical justification for use; it facilitates the development of specific skills, including conveying precise ideas, telling stories in a logical sequence, and collaborating and communicating with others. It is especially ideal for language classes, because it fosters the type of creative interactions necessary for language acquisition and tools like voice recording allow for listening and pronunciation practice.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The thorough and thoughtful development of Pixton makes it simple to incorporate into the curriculum. Multiple how-to videos demonstrate navigation tools; premade options make it easy to add characters, background, and props; the tool works in all browsers; comics can be downloaded, printed, embedded, and shared; it is available in eleven languages; and it is compatible with interactive whiteboards and course platforms such as <a href=" https://moodle.org">Moodle</a> and <a href="http://www.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a>. Teachers can also see dozens of example lesson plans, sortable by subject, grade level, and rating.</p>

<p>The education edition is intentionally adapted to encourage group collaboration among teacher and student accounts, allowing teachers to receive submissions and share them with their classes, complete with comments and grading rubrics. Teachers who praised the site for being user friendly were also impressed by "how much effort and creativity [students] put into these comics" and testified that Pixton allowed students to demonstrate their literary skills.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p> 
<p>Unfortunately the free trial version is limited to a maximum of 50 students for 30 days. For access to more student accounts as well as a bevy of customizable features, users must sign up for a paid account. The <a href="https://www.pixton.com/schools/license/purchase">pricing plan</a> is scalable and calculates a per student cost depending on the number of total students and the duration.</p>

<p> As with any education product that seeks to be an effective teaching tool, it would be valuable to see validating research that confirms students who use Pixton perform better compared to those using other tools. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>There are many education products that aim to promote student-centered learning activities, but not many that are as fun as Pixton. Authoring comics quickly provokes a sense of imagination and possibility that can lead to hours of creation -- time that feels more like producing something of value and like less like learning or working. It is a simple activity that allows students to quickly become invested in their work.</p>

<p>It is also part of the larger movement to encourage learning by doing, one that has seemingly grown in size and momentum within the past year. While online platforms and maker activities can appear to be distinctly different approaches to learning, Pixton is a clever combination that artfully empowers students to make online.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p> 
<p>Pixton has the potential to transform any lesson into a creative, engaging, student-centered, task-based learning activity.</p>
