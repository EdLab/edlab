<p><a href="https://www.waypointedu.com/">Waypoint EDU</a> is a free, educational AR geocaching game for classrooms and families. A parent or teacher can use their own ideas or curriculum to set up a <i>hunt</i> or utilize one of the <i>official hunts</i> that are already installed on the app. These pre-programmed hunts allow users to learn about monuments and wonders of the world (waypoints) as they discover them right in their own neighborhood.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Waypoint EDU really responds to the demand for edtech to help teachers and students expand learning beyond the confines of the classroom. I appreciate an app that requires engagement in the outside world; after Pokemon Go demonstrated the effectiveness of apps that take scavenger hunting to the next level, Waypoint EDU definitely has the potential to add an educational element to the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The AR is reliable, detailed, and high quality, and the interface is intuitive. As an adult creating hunts as well as a participant in the hunts myself, all instructions and functions were straightforward and extremely easy, which is important for teachers whose time is precious and for younger students who might be short on patience.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While the two pre-programmed hunts are excellent, the ones users create themselves simply cannot compete because they lack the AR component. I enjoyed seeing the Colosseum and Machu Picchu around my neighborhood in th pre-programmed hunts, so it was a disappointment to not also see the Lernaean Hydra or Cyclops I included in the hunt I designed for Greek mythological figures. I can see this being a huge let-down for users who have high AR expectations for the experience.</p>
 
<p>Another weak point is that, because only one question is associated with each waypoint, the quizzes hardly seem worth it. If there was the option to add more questions, this resource could be a better supplement to classroom learning. Even just a list of simple facts about each waypoint could make this app significantly more educational.</p>

<p>It's also important note is that while this app allows you to designate where the hunt will take place, you aren’t able to pinpoint exactly where you’d like the waypoints to be located. Because of this, the app really only works in parks and other wide open spaces, since Waypoint EDU’s map function doesn’t recognize buildings as places to add waypoints.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While the pre-existing hunts on Waypoint EDU are definitely worth using on this free app, it disappoints in terms of personalization capabilities and educational merit. </p>
