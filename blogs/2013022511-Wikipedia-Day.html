          <p>
            Saturday Feb. 23 was Wikipedia Day and the Seen in NY team went to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference </a> sponsored by Wikipedia Meetups in NYC at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. I would sum up the event as "GREAT SUCCESS" and "SUPER FASCINATING!" 
<p>
One thing that surprised me was the social component that Wikipedia played for many Wikipedians. For example, one participant said that he loved the love fact that he could look up/write about any topic, no matter how obscure, on Wikipedia and reach out to other community members writing on the same topic. He said that it had opened up a global network to him. In fact, he had just returned from Northern India and Bangladesh where he met up with a network of Wikipedians. 

<p> 
I also really enjoyed a talk by Dr. Nelson of SIPA, who described  how Wikipedia plays an important role in international development and human rights issues. She explained that in one of her classes, students must publish their research on Wikipedia.  One of her students had done research on how women in Indonesia had been victims of rape during a time of war, but that over time they had been portrayed as prostitutes in history texts. Through the student's Wikipedia page, which was grounded in rigorous research,  he was able to contest the aforementioned history books and offer a  different perspective. Her talk brought to light a handful of fascinating questions regarding how Wikipedia and other open-source outlets can play a critical role in the world of international development.
<p> 

All in all it was a great event and I admire the dedication of this group of Wikipedians to make information more accessible, as well as encouraging  today's learner to not only consume information, but also create it in a responsible manner.
