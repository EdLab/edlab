<p>With more courses heading toward a blended learning model or moving online entirely, many critics are concerned that students will lose the opportunity to work collaboratively with their peers—an important component of effective learning that can lead to closer emotional connections among students. With this in mind, the authors of this article conducted a study of 23 in-service teacher education students in a Korean university who were participating in a blended course on web tools in education. The researchers hoped to determine whether blogging and online interactions affected peer relationships over the trajectory of the course.</p>
 
<p>The students in this course were asked to create a blog, where they would write weekly reflection posts. They were then asked to subscribe to and comment on each other’s blogs. The researchers then had the students answer two surveys. The first survey collected student demographics and their perceptions of closeness among peers. The second survey evaluated the degree of student participation in blogging, as well as how much they believed blogging increased learning and emotional closeness.</p>
 
<p>One of the biggest concerns about isolation in this course was that students might only feel connected to others with the same disciplinary major. However, the results of this study showed that students felt an increased sense of community after the course was over, regardless of their majors. In addition, the researchers found that the more frequently the students interacted with each other online, the more centrally they appeared to be positioned in the social network of students.</p>
 
<p>Ultimately, this research study revealed that blogging may be able to help online course participants overcome isolation and develop a class-wide community. This is useful for non-online courses as well, as students can often feel isolated due to the limited number of class hours they spend with their peers each week. However, the researchers emphasized that this study did not consider the actual content of the blog comments—for example, their wording and implications—which could be the focus of other studies. Future research may also choose to expand the sample size and analyze other connections among online coursework, learning, and social interactions.</p>
