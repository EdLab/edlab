            An <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2011-01-18-littlelearning18_ST_N.htm">article in today's USA Today</a>, highlighting the book <i>Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses</i>, notes most undergraduate students don't make any meaningful gains in their academics during their first two years in college. The results are from a survey, of more than 3,000 full-time traditional-age students on 29 campuses nationwide and included transcripts and scores of the Collegiate Learning Assessment, a standardized exam which tests critical thinking, analytic reasoning and writing skills. The reason? Colleges just don't make academics a big priority. Other major factors affecting the lack of progress during students' first two years in college include instructors devoting more time to their research and students being more in tuned with their social lives.

According to the study:

-	45% of students showed no significant gains in learning during their first two year and after four years, 36% showed little change.
-	Students also spent 50% less time studying compared with students a few decades ago
-	35% of students report spending five or fewer hours per week studying alone
-	50% said they never took a class in a typical semester where they wrote more than 20 pages
-	 32% never took a course in a typical semester where they read more than 40 pages per week.
