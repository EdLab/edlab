<strong>From the publisher:</strong>

"With few exceptions, scholarship on creativity has focused on its positive aspects while largely ignoring its dark side. This includes not only creativity deliberately aimed at hurting others, such as crime or terrorism, or at gaining unfair advantages but also the accidental negative side effects of well-intentioned acts. This book brings together essays written by experts from various fields (e.g., psychology, criminal justice, sociology, engineering, education, history, and design) and with different interests (e.g., personality development, mental health, deviant behavior, law enforcement, and counterterrorism) to illustrate the nature of negative creativity, examine its variants, call attention to its dangers, and draw conclusions about how to prevent it or protect society from its effects."

“An intriguing intellectual journey into the mad genius and sometimes psychopathically deviant roots of creativity.”
<strong><em>– J. Reid Meloy, University of California, San   Diego</em></strong>

<strong><em> </em></strong>

“This is one of the most important books on creativity to be published over the last twenty years; its list of editors and contributors stands for high-quality chapters. With the ‘dark side’ illuminated from many different facets, a vastly neglected aspect of creativity has been opened for scholarly discussion. The volume offers an inspiring source and starting point for further research, bringing together a still much broader range of disciplines – since all realms and areas of human thinking and acting owe their benevolent, and malevolent, progress to creative persons, be it scientists, artists, politicians, or engineers, etc. Deep insights and knowledge about the ‘dark side of creativity’ as provided here may help to generally develop more responsibility and more wisdom in dealing with creative motives, actions, processes, and products in the interest of a more humane human cultural evolution.”
