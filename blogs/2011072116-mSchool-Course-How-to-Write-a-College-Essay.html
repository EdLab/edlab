          <p>
            As per request, I'm working on a course on how to write a college-level essay (not a essay for getting into college).  I'm not sure I've pitched it exactly right, and it's still under construction, but I've copied the "Make a Plan!" part of "What's the Assignment" so you guys can get a sneak peak.  Also, if I have time after I finish this, I'll put up an even cooler and more secret course...

Make a Plan!

Before you do anything else (research, writing, bugging your parents/roommates for help), take a look at the assignment.  Read it over.  And again.  The worst feeling in the world is to have poured your heart out into an essay only to discover it was on the wrong topic, or 12 pages below the minimum required length. 

Things you need to know:

1. How long does it need to be? 

This may not sound like the most important part, but knowing your prospective length will help you plan out your research program, and block the appropriate time to get the essay written and edited.  In the humanities papers usually fall into the 4-6 pages or 10-12 pages categories.  For the sake of this brevity, we'll stick to those two possibilities, although it can get more complicated.

2. How creative do you have to be?

Essay assignments vary in their structure.  Sometimes the professor will simply have you interpret or expand on a quoted passage.  Sometimes he or she will ask you simply to write something about one of the assigned books.  If creativity is required, you're going to want to give your subconscious some time to mull over the problem before you start writing. 

3. How much outside research will it require?

Creative essays can be written just by sitting and thinking, but most of the time you're going to need to some outside reading.  Often this just means an assigned book that you're already expected to have read, but occasionally you will have to take a trip to the library.
