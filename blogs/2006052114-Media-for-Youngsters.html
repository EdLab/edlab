          <p>
            The appearance of BabyFirstTV, a new TV channel <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/arts/21itzk.html">noted in the Times</a> is sort of like the appearance of a smaller, more powerful iPod—inevitable. What I find fascinating is how the producers of content for the network pitch everything as educational. Is the population of educationally-minded parents still growing? Or is TV a way for lazy parents to feel slightly better about ignoring their children for a while? <!--break-->

OK, forget those questions. The question that interests me most from the perspective of design: How does one set out to make educational content? There are no ads on BabyFirstTV. The programming is arguably "slow" ("when a cartoon jigsaw puzzle assembles itself, you'd better believe its pieces will try every possible configuration before the picture is complete"). Is this really educational? The Times article says that the producers have lined up approving pediatricians, psychologists and educators. But we know that's probably not too hard.

When I watch TV, I don't find the slow parts particularly educational... though I'm not sure what I want to count as educational, philosophically speaking. Nor do I feel dumbed down by ads (though I tend to ignore the painful ones). My point: should we still feel the force of the intuition that "TV is bad for us"? Obviously it's bad for us when it keeps us from doing things we would otherwise care about (the same force that addictive drugs have). But we can learn loads of stuff from TV—it just might not make us "better."

And at what point do we get to kick back and enjoy a little downtime? (Note that it would be unfair to say "cognitive downtime.") That's a very personal ("moral") question—it's about finding a balance in life between our physical and social natures.

Good luck. But while you're figuring that out, what not let the kiddies watch a little ESPN?
