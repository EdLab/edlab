          <p>
            London, UK–CIBER research group at University College London issued the final report for its global library survey that concerns challenges, trends, and best practices during tough economic times. The global survey, which involved 835 libraries around the world, was sponsored by Charleston Conference, Baker &amp; Taylor's YBP Library Services, and ebraryÂ®, a leading provider of digital content products and technologies.
<blockquote>* The current financial year is a tough one for academic libraries, with 34.7% of institutions receiving a total library budget that is at least 5% smaller than the previous year (excluding inflation).
* The outlook in two years' time is mixed, with 31.4% expecting their total library budget to be smaller than in the current financial year, 40.1% about the same, and 28.4% expecting an increase.
* Overall, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">resource budgets are more vulnerable than personnel, services or infrastructure, with monographs and print journals being the most vulnerable to cutbacks</span>.
* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When trimming their resources budget, libraries were least likely to cut e-books, followed by electronic-only serials and database subscriptions</span>.
* 52.5% of libraries view the acceleration of print to digital as the most effective option for balancing their budgets, with subscription as the most popular method.
* Just under half of all libraries see the demonstration of value through usage and outcomes data as the smartest way to manage the cost of resources.</blockquote></p>
