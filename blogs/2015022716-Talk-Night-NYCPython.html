            **Private**

After playing with the <b>Leap Motion</b> I borrowed from Zeph and Pranav (thanks!), I was invited to give a little informal talk at the <b>NYCPython</b> meetup's event last night at the Ladders down on Varick and Spring on using Python to play with the sensor.

It was the second public talk (in english) I have had since my time in the US. This time, I actually did the opposite of what I always do--I slept right away on the night before, woke up early at 3 am, prepared the slides roughly, made them so that they work more like a reminder of things to talk about for me than a presentation for others, and got back to bed without rehearsing at all.

It turned out to be a better one. (Most) people were listening and interested, and many have never even heard or seen the sensor at all. It was an eye-opener for the crowd, especially when most of them were data scientists and analysts crunching away numbers and strings, not interaction designers. A lot of questions were asked, of which some of them I didn't know. Afterward, a few people approached me to let me know how excited they were about my presentation and told me about ideas they have come up with, and some even asked about what we at Edlab were doing (I said something very cool about us by the way).

<b>Some key takeaways (some from James Powell, the NYCPython organizer and frequent speaker):</b>

<li>It doesn't matter if you're good. You probably know what others don't.</li>

<li>It's actually about sharing what you've discovered, not what you've accomplished. I think people care more for what you've done and learnt than about your success.</li>

<li>Being early helped me a lot.  I had a chance to know my playing field and adjust to it before others.</li> 

<li>I spent as much time before the event talking to people in the room. When they became the crowd I was already their friend. Sweet.</li>

<li>I talked slower and in lower tone than usual. It helps especially when you're not a native english speaker like me. I found that remarkable speakers like Barack Obama, Martin Luther King and Steve Jobs speak clearly at a rate slower than an average American (and also lower, except Jobs) and they were selective in using simple, concise and inspiring everyday words. ("change" in favor of "transform")</li>

<li>Plan at least one interaction for the crowd. For me it's having them to raise their hands to a question I've already comtemplated with--"Who have never known OR seen a Leap Motion before?" (with OR I got more hands raised)</li>

<li>What matters is the crowd, not a person. I tried to turn away asap when I saw a person who was doing something discouraging.</li>

<li>People bore out very fast. There were this guy who was really great and he was presenting how to make Angular.js and Django dance together, but he used up twice the time given and was walking through every step of unnecessary code to the point that audiences were sleeping! Balancing between the depth and the breadth while not doing the same thing more than 3 minutes in duration seemed to keep people awake.</li>

<li>Use text to help is ok. We all heard about using images in slides. Well, images without context or descriptions are misleading, but too much text is even worse. My personal trick in slides is if a text is less than a smallest heading, don't include it.</li>

<li>Be yourself. It's very important, or people will know that you're faking it. If you're not a smiley type, don't try.</li>

The whole night I was carrying a "I want to share this new cool toy with anyone" mentality, and it did me better than a "I'm presenting in front of a crowd" one.

If you have had a lot of public speaking experience, please share your helpful tips.
