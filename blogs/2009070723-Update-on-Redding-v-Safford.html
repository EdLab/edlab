          <p>
            The U.S. Supreme Court recently handed down its decision in the school strip search case <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2380">I blogged about a few months ago</a>. The case, <a href="
http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=000&invol=08-479">Redding v. Safford</a>, involved a then 13-year old student in Arizona who was stripped search by school officials looking for the painkiller ibuprofen. The student, Savana Redding, sued the school board for violating her fourth amendment's protection against illegal searches. 

The Court, in an 8-1 decision (Justice Thomas being the lone dissenter), held the search violated the fourth amendment's protections against unreasonable search though the school official who administered the search is immune from liability. In his final opinion on the Court, retiring Justice David Souter wrote: 
<blockquote>The issue here is whether a 13-year-old student's Fourth Amendment right was violated when she was subjected to a search of her bra and underpants by school officials acting on reasonable suspicion that she had brought forbidden prescription and over-the-counter drugs to school. Because there were no reasons to suspect the drugs presented a danger or were concealed in her underwear, we hold that the search did violate the Constitution, but because there is reason to question the clarity with which the right was established, the official who ordered the unconstitutional search is entitled to qualified immunity from liability.
</blockquote>

Since the case essentially immune school officials from punishment for illegal searches, it will be interesting to see how it will affect school policy regarding searches on school grounds. Was the Court right in its decision to immune the school official from liability?
