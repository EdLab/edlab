            Tony Karrer, a technologist in e-Learning, published <a href=http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2009/01/12-elearning-predictions-for-2009.html>12 eLearning Predictions for 2009</a> to share his insights about the direction that learning technology industry is headed. Karrer is currently the CEO/CTO of TechEmpower, a software, web and eLearning development firm based in LA, and in the past has been the CTO for several start-ups, most notably eHarmony.

See how his forecast — from an entrepreneur's point of view — matches up with yours:

<b>1. "Self-Directed Learning" increases</b>
As the recession continues to deepen, companies will reduce investment in creating contents on marginal topics. This will leave us to take on the business of learning into our own hands, with minimal guidance and support.

<b>2. eLearning 2.0 grows  as "eLearning 2.0 Strategy" fails</b>
While eLearning 2.0 will continue to show growth, the organizations that try to create large-scale eLearning 2.0 strategies will move much slower. Those who adopt easy, user-friendly tools will however be better off. 

<b>3. Increase in Consumer/Education Social Learning Solutions = Increased Pressure for Social Learning Solutions in Corporate Learning</b>
2008 was an interesting year with the outburst of social learning/social homework help solutions such as <a href=www.cramster.com>Cramster</a>, <a href=www.campusbug.com>CampusBug</a>, <a href=www.grockit.com>Grockit</a>, <a href=www.tutorvista.com>TutorVista</a>, <a href=www.edufire.com>EduFire</a>, <a href=www.englishcafe.com>English Cafe</a>, and etc. Teenager or college kids' stories told at home are likely to make some of their VP/C level executives to ask, why they aren't doing something similar. 

<b>4. Quick Wins & Toolkits</b>
Again, “with the tough economy, everyone will be looking for quick wins,” says Karrer. <i>How can you improve performance quickly and at low cost? The answer for many organizations will be less training and more performance support in the form of toolkits.</i>
 
<b>5. Virtual Classroom Tipping Point</b>
Karrer believes that we've reached a point where virtual classroom training is no longer seen as “inherently inferior and a lower value.” So in 2009, people will be, almost, forced to begin justifying any in-person training as the cost for virtual classroom training will begin to be virtually the same as in-person classes. Note however that the demand for virtual classroom translates to a greater demand for effective help in virtual classroom training as well as help for those creating remote experiences.

<b>6. Greater Domination by Leading Tool Vendors</b>
Karrer evaluates that Captivate 4 is going to be a great tool; Articulate has a great tool set; Lectora is great at packaging; and Camtasia is good at screencasting. It's going to be tough for to push out these players in the corporate market, he predicts. In some settings, free authoring tools may do better, but they probably won't get much traction in workplace/corporate training. 

<b>7. Niche Tools Emerge and Get Traction in Niches</b>
We are going to see more and more niche tools get traction. Some good examples of those tools include <a href=www.learningware.com>LearningWare</a> and <a href=http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2007/11/flash-quiz-tools.html>Flash Quiz Tools</a>. These things fit into a wiki page and can create fun interactions that easily fit into a course built with one of the above tools as well. 

<b>8. More Wiki Pages - Same Authored Minutes - Less Classroom Minutes</b>
A little repetitive but, the above trends around eLearning 2.0, self-directed learning, quick wins and toolkits all suggest that more web pages - authored via wikis - will be <i>THE games</i> in 2009. The goal of keeping the cost at minimum will continue the transition of eLearning from classroom to courseware.

<b>9. Knowledge Worker Skills</b> 
In 2007, Karrer saw that <a href= http://www.workliteracy.com/work-literacy-gap>Knowledge Worker Skill Gap</a> emerged. In 2008, he felt compelled to launch <a href= http://www.workliteracy.com>Work Literacy</a>, and help people and organizations upgrade skills like <a href= http://www.workliteracy.com/network-key-skill>Leveraging Networks</a>, <a href= http://learningcircuits.blogspot.com/2008/11/network-feedback.html>Network Feedback</a>, <a href= http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2008/09/linkedin-for-finding-expertise.html>Finding Expertise</a>, <a href= http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2008/09/know-where-you-can-find-anything.html>Using Social Media to Find Answers to Questions</a>, <a href= http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2008/10/conversation-learning.html>Learning through Conversation</a> and searching, scanning, etc. In 2009, workshops like <a href= http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2009/01/work-literacy-skills-new-workshop.html>Work Literacy Skills Workshop</a> will gain more attention than it has before, especially more so as employers move more towards self-directed learning.

<b>10. Mobile Learning Niche Growth</b>
While mobile learning will see a relatively small percentage of activity, we will see a continued increase in the amount of people with mobile web access. This will eventually have a growing effect on a) real-time polls, b) job aids (e.g. people will be asked to make your content viewable on an iPhone), c) Podcasts/Vidcasts targeting mobile professionals (i.e. sales people), and d) sales challenge scoreboard through which sales challenges will be delivered through mobile solutions.

<b>11. Micro Virtual Conferences</b>
Acceptance of virtual classroom ïƒ  slowly but surely ïƒ  acceptance of virtual conferences. Conferences will face this trend also because their other alternative is cancellation of the entire event due to people and organization's reluctance to cover the travel cost. 

<b>12. Data Driven</b>
Who wouldn't want measurable results? But given the current economic situation, there will be a <i>greater</i> demand for results and thus more interest in <a href=http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2008/12/data-driven.html>data-driven performance solutions</a>.
