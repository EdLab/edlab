<p><b>Title:</b> <a href=" http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1013937">Second Life, First Experiences: Using Virtual Worlds in Teacher Education</a> (2013)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Judith L. Wilks & Lisa Jacka</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> Australian Journal of Teacher Education</p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do student teachers perceive their learning experiences in Second Life?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The authors piloted the use of Second Life as a venue for preparing secondary visual arts teachers in Australia. The method of instruction alternated virtual world experience with face-to-face sessions. Specifically, the authors designed simulated "real-world" experiences for twenty student teachers in Second Life, ranging from museums to shopping centers to art studios; students could use their avatars to paint 3D artworks and communicate with in-world artists. The experiences and perceptions of the participants were examined through a ten-week virtual ethnography and two surveys.</p>    

<p><b>Findings:</b> There was a lack of deep student engagement in Second Life, as represented by negativity and frustration from the majority of participants. Learning in Second Life was experienced and viewed as isolated, unguided, self-paced, and/or impractical. Student teachers were not willing to reflect on the possibility of incorporating virtual worlds into their future classrooms. The authors concluded that lessons learned include the need to prepare students before delivering a course in a virtual environment and to provide clear strategies for connecting new technologies with classroom scenarios. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The study poses challenges for universities that intend to experiment with virtual components in teacher education programs. In addition to technological readiness and clarity in online instruction, more interactive elements might need to be considered when building a virtual teaching environment. In addition, rather than giving students the freedom of self-paced learning, more guided, demonstrative teaching scenarios might need to be designed to connect studentsâ€™ virtual learning with actual classroom experience.</p>
