Known by the name of her award-winning blog, "<a href="http://coolcatteacher.blogspot.com/">Cool Cat Teacher</a>," high school educator and IT Director, Vicki Davis, is a major force in the growing "flat" classroom movement.  Davis co-founded the global collaborative, wiki-based, <a href="http://www.flatclassroomproject.net/">Flat Classroom® projects</a>, and is the co-author of <a href="http://www.flatclassroombook.com/"><i>Flattening Classrooms, Engaging Minds</i></a> and an upcoming book <a href="http://writinginthecloud.wikispaces.com/"><i>Collaborative Writing in the Cloud</i></a>. 

<p>
<b>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NEW LEARNING TIMES</b><br>

<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> As a graduate of Georgia Tech in Management and General Manager of a 13 county cell phone market, I never pictured myself as a teacher, but I always taught. When I became a stay-at-home mom, for a while, it was natural for locals to ask me to teach them to use technology, and after teaching some adult courses, the principal where I teach now sat me down and told me I'd make a great teacher. Coming from the business world, I know where these students are heading and always keep in mind "what are the things that someone is going to wish these students were taught?" I want them to be successful in academics and business, but more importantly, in life. Passion-based, authentic learning with a global audience is a hallmark of who I am and what I try to bring to both my students and the<a href="http://www.flatclassroomproject.net/"> Flat Classroom® projects</a>.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> Co-founding the Flat Classroom® projects with Julie Lindsay in 2006 has to be a key linchpin of my life and career. We were just two teachers, one in Camilla, Georgia and the other in Dhaka, Bangladesh who decided to see if we could merge our classrooms together as the students wrote about the trend in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-World-Is-Flat-Twenty-first/dp/0374292884">Thomas Friedman's book The World is Flat</a>. The experience transformed our students and we won <a href="https://www.iste.org/"> ISTE's</a> Online Learning Award for it the next year. During the first weeks of the project, Friedman found out what we were doing and included us in an update to the book. Since that time, we have 7 projects from kindergarten to college, a nonprofit, and a conference, and thousands of students and hundreds of teachers collaborating and co-creating. Most of us involved consider ourselves to be part of a movement and somehow, the projects have attracted the sharpest, most professional teachers I have ever met. It is like a "think tank" that actually does something with what they think - the implementation of new ideas and best practices is so rapid. My involvement there and the creation of the Cool Cat Teacher Blog in 2005 have linked me with other teachers around the world. I'm influenced daily by teachers everywhere through comments, tweets, emails, and working alongside them. It is truly a great experience and high-powered learning environment.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> My work and purpose is to inspire teachers wherever they are with the motivation, know-how, and best practice examples. My blog, The Cool Cat Teacher Blog, show on <a href="http://www.bamradionetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=91&layout=blog&Itemid=259">BAM Radio, Every Classroom Matters</a>, and first book,<i> Flattening Classrooms, Engaging Minds</i> are all directed towards that end. If I can help teachers see their purpose and unleash a passion for learning and for caring about each individual student, then teachers, one at a time, will change the world. I wouldn't pretend that I'm anything but an average teacher with a lot of exceptional friends, but sometimes those friends need someone who can clearly see and point out the greatness of what they do and how they are doing it, so they can hold their heads high against a media that is floundering and only reports negative news about teachers in order to get people to watch. If anything, I want to counter the impact of negative media and tell the stories that need to be told: excellence IS happening and there IS hope for education and educators to have a meaningful career changing the lives of students. Teachers are noble and I hope anyone reading this will help change the learning landscape by sending that message far and wide to restore respect to a profession that has been disrespected for far too long by far too many.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> Personalized learning, epaper, augmented reality, and connected learning are making Massive Open Online Courses, and projects like we run in the Flat Classroom® projects possible. Every school is now "bricks and clicks." Competition to foster active learning environments as cost effectively as possible via any means necessary means that an ineffective school in the middle of a barren wasteland now has competition. In fact, the homeschooling movement is largely a personalized, elearning movement. Parents have choices and good parents will no longer settle on the school down the street. The lifelong learner who knows how to build a PLN (personal learning network), how to be part of a community and create them, and how to have a "personal brand" now has the world at their fingertips. I'm a teacher at a small school in a small town and because I've been able to network with the world's best teachers, I'm a better teacher and help share that knowledge. We can all learn. The divide is not only digital, it is mental. People who need to be told and lack curiosity may find themselves lacking a job.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I'm finishing my second book <i>Collaborative Writing in the Cloud</i> to help teachers know how to harness the power of community to teach excellent writing aligned with Common Core Standards. My next big project is under debate, I want to publish an ebook this summer either on ClickSmart, an intuitive method for learning new software that I invented sometime back that I think would revolutionize technology education, or a book on productivity which is something I'm getting emailed about daily. Flat Classroom® continues to take a lot of my time and we have a conference coming up in Hawaii this summer. I also have daily responsibilities at my school and we're going to overhaul the network this summer to prepare for a BYOT (Bring your own technology) program in the fall. Lots to do, but it is a worthwhile way to earn my sleep every night!
