          <p>
            Welcome to the second post of the SMM Series! Today's topic will be on some of the problems that come with Twitter and some solutions for them.  We use multiple Twitter accounts here at Edlab (Vialogues, TCRecord, NLT), so I really hope that these will help you learn more about Twitter; you can also use these same solutions for your own personal Twitter account.  There will also be a SMM series in the near future on “Personal Branding!” Here are the 5 main drawbacks + solutions: 

1. <b>Not Interacting with your Followers</b>
Many Twitter users simply tweet and that's all. However, you need to interact with others to gain their interest and satisfaction with your company. You can be active by following other companies similar to yours or influential people that interest you. Or you can ask questions in your tweets and start a conversation by also responding to their questions and tweets by retweeting. Retweeting can also build connections/followers with other users (Rule 5 from the 10 Rules to Follow).  If they are responding to you and you are not, it is a one-sided conversation that will NOT give you the results you want.

2. <b>Unread Tweets</b>
Though you may be active on your account by frequently tweeting, this doesn't mean that your followers are reading your posts.  Most Twitter users follow a number of people, so their news feeds will be always filled with tweets from different people. Thus, the majority of your tweets will not be read by every single one of your followers. Though this is a problem seems unavoidable, a tip is to make sure you continue to consistently tweet engaging content; hopefully this will increase the chance of it being read amongst an entire news feed of tweets.

3. <b>Tweeting Limitations</b>
Unlike Facebook posts, Twitter has a limit of 140 characters for each tweet. If you are posting links to articles or events, the 140-character limit can seem very restricting. In order to combat this, most users use a bit.ly link, or a shortened URL link.  This is why it is important to keep your tweets, including your hashtags, short and concise.

4. <b>Messaging Limitations</b>
While Twitter users are allowed to send messages privately to another user, they are unable to send messages to more than one user at a time. This makes it less convenient for Twitter users, compared to Facebook (where people can send messages to an entire group of people). Because this is also unavoidable, it is best for businesses to use this direct messaging to their advantage, by trying to create genuine relationships and connections through their messages.

5. <b>Random Followers</b>
As discussed earlier, your followers can be anyone. This means that there is a certain safety precaution people must take when tweeting out specific details such as their current location.  You never know who may try to find you.  They could be loyal fans, or they could be people that may put employees in some form of danger. For this reason, it is best to be wary in tweeting specific details that you may put you and your company in danger.
