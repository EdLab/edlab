<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> In high school I worked on the student newspaper, which sparked my interest in studying journalism during college (I earned a double major in journalism and political science with a minor in Spanish from the University of Miami in Florida). My path in journalism initially focused on writing and reporting, but along the way I've always branched into other parts of journalism, such as page layout in high school or video in college. As a college junior I started learning HTML/CSS on my own and soon applied to it a class web design project that didn't require using code. I later took a web production class that strengthened those skills before teaching myself other languages like JavaScript, PHP and Python.
<p>
Because my passion for journalism always spanned beyond one area, I eventually began looking at fields outside of journalism to inform my perspective and the work I do. I try to bring that wider view when <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2013/05/teaching-a-new-web-development-for-media-class-at-georgetown-this-summer.html">teaching web development</a> to journalism and public relations grad students. For example, asking them about their passions outside their profession to find ways to connect <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2010/04/rethinking-our-thinking.html">fundamental</a> <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2010/05/computational-thinking-and-the-new-journalism-mindset.html ">programming concepts</a> with those interests -- whether it's dancing, music, cooking, sports, art, etc.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The first websites I made in high school laid the groundwork for leading my college paper onto WordPress. Being very <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2008/09/how-we-did-it-moving-the-miami-hurricane-from-college-publisher-to-wordpress.html">open and public</a> during this process connected me with other student editors around the country, which led to our co-founding a startup called <a href="http://www.copress.org/ ">CoPress</a> during my senior year. We aimed to help other college news organization thrive online, an experience that helped me land a job at another <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2009/04/23/joining-publish2-ryan-sholin-greg-linch-and-howard-weaver/ ">journalism-tech startup called Publish2 after graduating</a>. Working with both the product team and users at Publish2 added two important pillars to my journalistic toolkit, which I then brought to The Washington Post.  <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2010/11/joining-the-washington-post-as-a-web-producer.html">Initially hired as a producer</a>, I also worked on side projects to help improve certain production tasks and make them more efficient. These formed the basis of a pitch I made to spend <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2012/05/new-role-at-the-washington-post-special-projects-and-news-applications.html">six months on the newsroom development team</a>. Steeped in a primarily technical role, this period brought my skills and my relationship with that team to the next level. Both skills and relationships are critical to my <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2013/01/new-role-at-the-washington-post-editor-local-projects.html">current role working on data and technology projects</a> for the Post's local desk. Possessing those skills, along with two fall quarters’ worth of experience adjuncting at Northwestern's Medill D.C. campus, helped prepare me for my current adjunct position teaching a <a href="http://webdevclass.greglinch.com/ ">Web Development for Media class at Georgetown</a>.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Although I'm certainly not the first instructor to use <a href="https://github.com/ ">GitHub</a>, I hope more courses -- even ones that don’t involve web development -- similarly take advantage of all the platform has to offer beyond storing, versioning, and sharing code. My students used it for all three of those things, primarily using the native GitHub GUI app. But they also utilized the GitHub Issues feature to note bugs or offer suggestions to improve their peers’ final projects. I made this an option alongside submitting anonymous feedback through me, which only one of 10 students did initially before he later added his comments as issues. Using this feature kept the conversation in the context of the code that controlled the design and functionality of the sites, helped avoid duplicate comments and offered an easy way for conversations to form around issues -- instead of just a one-way flow.
<p>
Other goals involved applying technical skills to other fields and specific uses -- not just teaching the tool themselves or technology as an ends. Granted, most students probably weren't going to switch paths and become full-time software engineers -- although they might! -- but all of them will work in jobs that involve web development and working with developers.
<p>
Finally, the blend of conceptual knowledge and practical skills is another area that I hope more courses adopt. Concepts (like abstraction and automation) and practice (like building a working website) each inform the other. And I always tried to be sure students -- above all -- understood the core concepts and big-picture takeaways of the class. We used WordPress, but the point was not to learn WordPress. The point wasn't even really to "learn to code." The point was to learn a new way of thinking (like a programmer) in tandem with the skills to build the ideas they conceive, solve real problems and learn how to learn things they previously might have thought they couldn't teach themselves.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> For a while, it seemed like the obvious answer was MOOCs. Now we're seeing more of the reality set in after the initial hype and excitement. The technology is basically there -- it's not a technical failure, although better technology could help ameliorate some of the issues (low participation/completion rates, not actually learning or retaining the knowledge, etc.). It's more of a cultural, individual issue meshing with that style of learning and learning in that more independent context. Some people prefer that mode and thrive; others need the traditional classroom setting. 
<p>
Generally speaking, students are accustomed to traditional forms of pedagogy. Instilling the habits needed to learn with MOOCs takes time. Using these courses as complementary to more traditional classes seems like a good way to move forward. It's also worth considering how broader the audience is beyond students enrolled in educational institutions. Maybe those students just wanted a taste of a course to see if they're interested. Maybe they started, but bought a book instead.
<p>
A less obvious answer are non-education-specific platforms like GitHub, a model I hope will expand to more areas, that are applied to education -- á la the above mentioned idea of applying coding concepts to fields beyond programming. One of the biggest areas of opportunity, which I've been interested in for several years, involves concepts from version control in general and GitHub in particular to writing (<a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2010/07/quick-thoughts-on-journalism-and-version-control.html ">and journalism</a>!). 
<p>
Overall, I’d say education should look for ways to take advantage of digital tools and technology while focusing on what in-person, group learning does best. For the web development class, I would give an overview of a language or tool before having students go off on their own and use <a href=" http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy </a>, tutorial articles or documentation to learn and reinforce those lessons. Finding the right balance of what’s best for the classroom and what’ best for individual learning is key.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> For the web development class, nothing currently because the class isn’t offered this semester. The next time I teach, I plan to tweak some things based on feedback. For example, I might have students start learning more things on their own and then focus on answering questions or working through problems in class.
<p>
For my day job, my main project involves replacing a manual process involving unstructured data with an automated process that uses structured data. Besides that, there's always another local election on the horizon (the D.C. mayoral primary next), plus occasionally working with reporters on specific stories or helping with big breaking news.
