<p>David Comisford is the founder of EduSourced, a platform for educators to manage and track industry-sponsored learning projects. Comisford was recently named to the 2016 Forbes 30 Under 30 in Education for his work on <a href="http://www.edusourced.com/">EduSourced</a>. Prior to this work, he founded Frewg, an online textbook service. Comisford is a graduate of Capital University. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>Like a lot of college grads, I don't feel like my education did much to prepare me for my career. I take some blame for that outcome since I chose to study business at a liberal arts school which had just launched its business program two years before my arrival. I started a small business as a student and it turned out to be a transformative experience for me. It taught me the value of learning by doing. A few years later I found out that learning by doing—experiential learning—is a huge trend in American higher education and I launched <a href="http://www.edusourced.com/">EduSourced</a> as a result.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I think most people intuit that we learn best by doing. Higher education has been quietly shifting toward a more real-world learning approach for the past 20 years, and especially the past five years, in an effort to drive better employment outcomes for graduating students. Internships are one approach to real-world learning but client-based experiential projects are different because they integrate the real-world approach with curriculum and faculty guidance. Students are working on teams to solve real business challenges with faculty oversight and graduate with more industry connections and experience as a result.</p>
 
<p>A single experiential course could have 10 separate student teams with 10 different clients (the employers) with each solving a different business challenge. A single business school often has many courses and programs running these projects. They could have over 100 projects each year with no single person or record to keep track of it all, let alone formally measure the enormous impact these projects are having on both students and employers.</p>
 
<p>Our goal is to help schools support and grow their experiential programs. EduSourced is a software platform designed to help schools keep better records, measure the impact for students and employers while providing a secure collaborative environment for both. Ultimately they can tell the story about their experiential programs to prospective students and the employers who recruit them.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>In the long run I think a liberal arts university education will return to its historical standard as being impractical for all but the wealthiest people. The rest of us will need to make sure our degrees can create a return on investment by directly supporting our careers and not just as a tool to weed us out from people without degrees but by giving us a head start because our degrees actually drove our professional development.</p>
 
<p>Changes that will drive this shift: micro-certifications based on very narrow competencies, employer-developed curriculum where employers are educating future employees themselves, and client-based experiential learning in traditional higher ed.</p>
 
<p>I think the impact of online mass delivery of education like you see with MOOCs continues to be overstated. I expect MOOCs to become one leg of employer-developed curriculum but as a standalone product, MOOC providers will continue to serve hobbyists more than people looking to replace a traditional degree.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>When we first came up with the idea for EduSourced, we did not plan for students to engage with the software platform at all. This was a really bad assumption on our part. Students are now our biggest user group followed by corporate project sponsors and we're working to improve the experiences of both. We work on things like real-time collaborative editing and longitudinal surveys to identify if the student ever applied lessons learned from their project in their career years after graduation.</p>
 
<p>Our next big project is tying our dozens of top business and engineering schools together as a network of experiential programs where employers can submit projects into multiple schools as easily as they recruit interns. We want to make these employer-sponsored projects integral to how companies recruit students out of college.</p>
