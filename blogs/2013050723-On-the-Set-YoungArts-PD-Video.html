          <p>
            Yana, Wan, Joe and I visited a dance class at Riverdale Country School earlier today to capture the YoungArts MasterClass study guide in use as part of a set of professional development videos we are creating to help educators teach the study guide. After a short 15-20 ride to the posh campus, we were welcomed by Anna Farkas, a yoga and dance instructor who had agreed to do a session about <a href="http://youngartsmasterclass.org/lessons/how-can-balance-the-influence-of-a-mentors-techniques-with-creation-of-your-own-techniques/">mentorship</a> from the study guide. There are only 13 students (all female) in the class and 10 were there for this session.

The entire session lasted about 40 minutes and the students had a very spirited discussion about the role of mentors as it relates to the activity in the study guide, the video clips they watched of Bill T. Jones in his MasterClass episode and more importantly, in their lives. Since the bulk of their work in that class is focused on perfecting their dance and yoga techniques, today's discussion only session was very welcomed by both students and teacher. We ended with follow up interviews with several of the students and the teacher. The students and teacher will visit EdLab in the coming weeks to complete their reaction videos.
