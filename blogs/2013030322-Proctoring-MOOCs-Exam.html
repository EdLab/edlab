            The advancement of technology has greatly impacted many aspects of our lives, including academics. Students are now able to receive the education provided in a classroom in the comfort of their own homes. MOOCs, massive open online courses, are free web based classes that allow millions of students from all over the world to sign up. As time passes, more and more students are registering for these courses and with the growing number of participants, colleges are beginning to doubt the integrity of students with the nearly limitless resource of the internet when it comes time to take exams.

How can proctors be sure that their students aren't cheating on their exams when separated by the vast distance? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/technology/new-technologies-aim-to-foil-online-course-cheating.html?ref=technology&_r=0">Several solutions</a> have been proposed to tackle this issue. One solution is that students travel to regional testing sites during the time of exams and another is that special eavesdropping technologies be administered to allow the remote tracking of every mouse click and keystroke of test takers. ProctorU, a remote proctoring company, monitors test takers using screen sharing at offices in Alabama and California. It has signed an agreement to proctor MOOCs from Coursera and charges students a proctoring fee of $60-$90. Another service offered by Coursera is Signature Track, which allows proctors to analyze the rhythm and style of a student's typing in order to confirm a student's identity.

 

It is clear that colleges are going above and beyond in order to make sure that students are taking these exams fair and square. Remote proctoring is nothing new, but for example, with as many as 47,000 students enrolling in human nutrition, a MOOC offered at the University of Florida, it is safe to say that remote proctoring will be needed more than ever to ensure academic honesty.
