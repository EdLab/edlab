In recent years, maker culture has emerged as an all-ages movement, marked by a DIY ethic and communal sharing of resources &amp; knowledge. Makerspaces have <a href="https://www.nexttopmakers.com/maker-map" target="_blank">popped up all over</a> as centers where people come together to share resources, knowledge, and ‘stuff’<a href="#citations">*</a> in their creative pursuits. This is an intriguing concept to a lot of librarians because many libraries are mandated to do exactly that for their patrons - act as community centers for shared information and resources. More and more libraries have begun rolling out services and programs inspired by maker culture to their patrons, from isolated <a href="http://siue.libguides.com/3d" target="_blank">3-D printers</a>, to <a href="http://www.chipublib.org/hwlc-youmedia/" target="_blank">video production labs with cameras and lighting equipment</a>, to <a href="http://www.watertownlib.org/hatch" target="_blank">workshop spaces equipped with sewing supplies and rotary tools</a>, and beyond.

One of the most common conversations revolving around this is about the justification for makerspaces and encouraging maker culture in libraries at all; the idea can be jarring at first, and we really do need a more substantive argument than "it'd be so cool!" when we try to get <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2014/04/featured/library-makerspaces-go-statewide-new-jersey-librarians-receive-116000-makerspace-grants/">funding</a> for maker initiatives. In many ways, arguments for and against library makerspaces are really arguments about what libraries <em>are</em>. If libraries are purely physical repositories for books and other print materials, and their purpose is to be places where books “live,” then it’s hard to justify having makerspaces in them. However, most libraries have always been more than just places where patrons come to consume information. Plenty of libraries have, for quite some time, also provided resources for their patrons to <em>create</em> information<a href="#citations">°</a> including <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/services.php">computers</a>, <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/printing.php">2D printers</a>, and <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/printing.php">copiers/scanners</a>. If we look at libraries as centers of shared resources where people can come together to collaborate on everything from research to art appreciation, then <a href="http://www.chipublib.org/maker-lab/">library makerspaces with shared 3D printers and milling machines</a> really aren’t so weird.

While I wouldn’t say that every library needs a 3D printer, I do believe that embracing the maker culture movement can help libraries meet many community needs across different audiences. In universities with distance learning contingents, for example, video production equipment and software in the library can be a boon to instructors teaching online courses. In public libraries, equipment that helps local entrepreneurs prototype their innovative ideas can be a great way to fulfill library missions of community involvement. In <em>this</em> library, which already has a robust collection of curriculum &amp; teaching materials to support policymaking, field activities, and research, education-focused hardware and games have an unusually well-fitted niche. Dozens of kits and games inspired by maker ethics for kids exist and can be used to support engaging STEM and arts curricula<a href="#citations">^</a> and, more broadly, teaching in the 21<sup>st</sup> century classroom. I think that our patrons could do a lot with a couple of <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/">MaKey MaKey</a> kits or some <a href="http://www.modrobotics.com/cubelets/">Cubelets</a>, and even more with an engaging space to tinker with them in. What do you think?
