A friend of mine recommended this interesting paper and after reading, I thought I share with you. Since I talked about <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/9085">Predicting Website Aesthetics is Possible</a>, why not talk about other computational aesthetics methods :)
 
Kao, J.T. & Jurafsky, D. (2012). <b><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/kaojurafsky12.pdf">A computational analysis of style, affect, and imagery in contemporary poetry</a></b>. NAACL Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Literature. 

<b>What makes a poem beautiful?</b> The authors use <b>computational methods</b> to compare the stylistic and content features employed by award-winning poets and amateur poets. Building upon existing techniques designed to quantitatively analyze style and affect in texts, they examined elements of poetic craft such as <i>diction, sound devices, emotive language, and imagery</i>. They constructed a logistic regression model: poem type (professional or amateur) is significantly predicted by eight different variables: <u>token ratio</u>(the ratio of total word types to total number of words in order to evaluate vocabulary sophistication & diversity), <u>perfect end rhyme frequency</u>, <u>alliteration frequency</u>, <u>positive outlook words</u>, <u>negative emotional words</u>, <u>concrete object words</u>, <u>abstract concept words</u> and <u>generalization words</u>.

Results showed that <b>the most important indicator of high-quality poetry</b> was <b>the frequency of references to concrete objects</b>. This result highlights the influence of Imagism in contemporary professional poetry, and suggests that concreteness may be one of the most appealing features of poetry to the modern aesthetic. The authors also report on other features that characterize high-quality poetry and argue that methods from computational linguistics may provide important insights into the analysis of beauty in verbal art.

My first thought was that dissecting ART in this quantitative way may not sound <i>romantic</i> at all. After all, there is indeed a significant proportion of subjectivity in evaluating and it varies from people to people. But you know, such techniques and analysis can really challenge and perhaps help literature in several ways, i.e. diagnosed styles may help amateur poets to learn; provoke breakthrough or new styles; in a practical sense, it can even be auto grading or feedback providing for a large online course like Coursera and help readers digest and appreciate the material, among others. 

Brown Penny by William Butler Yeats (1910)
<blockquote>
...
O love is the crooked thing,
There is nobody wise enough
To find out all that is in it,
For he would be thinking of love
Till the stars had run away
And the shadows eaten the moon.
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
One cannot begin it too soon. 
</blockquote>

Note: in the fragment of poem that I included (it's one of my favorites), there is a frequency of references to concrete objects - <b>brown penny</b>
