As Founding Director of the <a href="http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/"> Joan Ganz Cooney Center</a>, located independently at <a href="http://www.sesameworkshop.org/">Sesame Workshop</a>, Dr. Michael Levine serves at the nexus of research, innovation, and transformative partnership-building. With a distinguished career as an agent of change in the nonprofit world and an advocate for digital learning, Dr. Levine’s history of impactful work is demonstrated in his past roles as Vice President for the <a href="http://asiasociety.org/">Asia Society</a>; head of <a href="http://www.carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corporation of New York’s</a> early childhood initiatives, education-focused media, and primary grade reform; as well as in his role as Senior Advisor to the New York City Schools Chancellor. Dr. Levine is a recurring advisor to top government officials on the topics of education, technology, and early childhood and has contributed to a variety of online and print media outlets, while being regularly chosen to headline conferences focused on early childhood, education policy, and digital learning. Dr. Levine received his Ph.D. in Social Policy from Brandeis University and his B.S. from Cornell University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am fortunate to have had fabulous mentors who have helped guide my career trajectory. To start off, my parents were both activists—my dad a civil rights organizer and an expert on intergroup relations, and my mom a mental health leader, concerned with the rich dynamics of children and family life. I studied with the great developmental psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner as an undergrad at Cornell, along with an amazing group of young scholars such as Dr. David Olds and Dr. Laurence Steinberg.  The perspective I gained on cross-cultural research that led to policy reforms shaped my professional passion for creating lasting change on behalf of vulnerable children globally.  Finally, the work I did at Carnegie Corporation on the importance of school reform, early development, and action-oriented philanthropy was central to my interest in "field-building" and making tighter connections between research, practice, and policy.
<p> 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My early work in public policy—working first for the Mayor of NYC Ed Koch and Schools Chancellor Richard Green—shaped my concern for underserved kids.  I learned a great deal about the importance of framing key issues through strategic communications techniques in a way that would build public support for new investments in children.  Frankly, I also learned just how hard it is to effect changes that have the intended impact.  I was fascinated to see how difficult it is to take research findings or "best practices" established in model programs serving families and actually translate them into coherent policies that would drive scalable change.  While at Carnegie Foundation I also learned about the value of "thinking and doing," that is, we were able to convene and support the very best minds in the world to analyze and dissect a problem and, then invest in the creative solutions we had designed together.  That was a special privilege!

<p>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Digital media and technology are changing every sector of the economy and influencing patterns of family interaction in both subtle and more dramatic ways.  The national conversation tends to distort the potential of media to change the learning landscape—ranging from the "alarmists" who fear rampant commercialization, conspicuous consumption, and a coarsening of dialogue within families and school environments, and those who have passionate, but unrealistic, expectations for the transformative potential of digital media.  Our work attempts to take a middle ground between the two positions. We seek to be an honest broker by conducting our own original research and creating actionable advice for developers, investors, practitioners, and parents.  But perhaps more importantly we are organized as a new type of organization—a "collaboratory" that is intentionally positioned as a catalyst, creator, curator, and publisher of others’ great work.  We really want folks to come to us with new ideas, new products, and research experiments—and then help them get these innovations out!

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> When I was growing up, a very popular movie was "The Graduate," in which Dustin Hoffman is famously counseled to enter the field of plastics. I have three young adult children whom I counsel to be engaged in the two megatrends of our era: to learn digital skills and to think global. The biggest opportunity and challenge of the current age is for young people to gain mastery over new tools for their own productivity and collaboration with peers. That mastery will help this generation transform the deeply imperfect world that they will inherit. In essence, my concern is that education be more explicitly focused on the skills, knowledge, and perspectives needed to build a healthy and productive "shared future." So, in sum, every young person now needs the capacity to enter a path of lifelong and deeper learning.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Our work at the Joan Ganz Cooney Center is focused on four big areas:
<p> 
<b>1.</b>   How are media and technology affecting family interactions focused on learning?<br>
<b>2.</b>  What role might digital games have as a potential positive force in bridging informal and formal learning?<br>
<b>3.</b>  In an age where consumption of media is growing across all age groups, what is the future of reading?<br> 
<b>4.</b>  How can we design new learning programs for underserved families?<br>  
<p> 
We have a particular interest in designing new products and models for Hispanic-Latino families, whose digital communication patterns have often been either misunderstood or marginalized by professionals and policymakers. In terms of a next big project: we are working on two: first, we are writing a new book with <a href="http://www.newamerica.org/">New America</a> on the future of reading that will sum up research on new technologies in a very accessible way for both teachers and parents, and second, we are planning to build a more global digital media and learning community to focus on the role that new platforms and content development can play across world regions, languages, and cultures.
