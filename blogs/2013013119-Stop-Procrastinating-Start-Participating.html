<p><b>Title:</b> Procrastination, Participation, and Performance in Online Learning Environments (2011)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Michinov, Sophie Brunot, Olivier Le Bohec, Jacques Juhel, & Marine Delaval</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
There’s a clear, albeit anecdotal, connection between procrastination and online learning. Undertaking an online course of study takes discipline, motivation, and steady contribution to course work. Procrastination, defined as the tendency to delay initiation or completion of important tasks, occasionally lures away even the most devoted online student. Researchers have examined the relationship between procrastination and academic outcomes, but these studies have yielded mixed results. Most research indicates negative correlations between procrastination, grades, learning, and completion of coursework. The tendency to procrastinate is often related to poor self-regulation skills. Some research has demonstrated that self-regulation processes may explain the relationship between procrastination and learning outcomes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131510002204">Procrastination, Participation, and Performance in Online Learning Environments</a> used 83 students in a Moodle-based online learning program to test the real world effects of procrastination in an online course. At the beginning of the course all the students completed a web questionnaire that included a procrastination scale and socio-demographic measures. The instructors were available for student contact throughout the course to supplement self-study materials, clarify misunderstandings, suggest sources of information, help the learners achieve their learning goals, and perform assessments. There were also social components to the course, such as a discussion forum around each assignment. The evaluation of students considered the survey, their work in the Moodle module, and the report and case study assignments they completed for class.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
As predicted, the results showed a negative relationship between procrastination and performance, and this relationship was mediated by the level of the learners’ participation in discussion forums. The authors also found (no surprise to online course veterans) that offering asynchronous discussion forums in online courses does not necessarily generate more student interactions. Participation in the forums depended partly on the learners’ self-indicated procrastination tendencies. The authors suggested that methods like applying specific learning and motivational strategies, scaffolding, establishing regular deadlines, and giving regular feedback could prevent procrastination behaviors in online courses.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study examined the relationship between online participation and success in an online course, and the educational community might consider the applications of this idea. Are particular people and behaviors more successful in online learning environments? If so, what can we do to promote learning and make it more equitable in these environments? If participation is the key to engagement and success, online course design should diversify channels for participation and work to increase engagement. This study looked at college students, who likely first came to online learning as adults. Further research may be needed across age groups to explore whether digital natives experience procrastination and multi-tasking differently.</p>
