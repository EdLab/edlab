<p>Remember when Luke was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owvpRNzoaVU">training with his lightsaber and the little floating ball</a> on the Millennium Falcon? NASAâ€™s newest robots geared for work aboard the International Space Station in 2019 were inspired by this sci-fi tech. These Astrobees have been equipped with tiny fans that allow them to whiz around zero-gravity environments, assisting with research, ship diagnostics, and even basic housekeeping.</p> 

<p>NASA scientists believe that Astrobees and future iterations of these robotic personal assistants will be key for human survival during future missions to Mars or even further in deep space. At such incredible distances, communication to mission control will be hobbled, so the bots will provide a multitude of automated functions using their cameras, lasers, or mechanical arms, among other tools. These Astrobees may become more comparable to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLmOteqmDYc">R2D2</a> as the technology advances.</p>

<p>NASA is once again pushing the limits of our imaginations through ingenuity, engineering, and genius. Will these kinds of robots completely replace astronauts in the future? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44461">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:36 Sara Hardman: </b>I think robots probably will be able to complete all the mechanical and technical duties of flying and maintaining a space shuttle in the future. But I don't think they will ever completely replace astronauts for the simple reason that robots will never be able to tell us what space was like; they will never be able to tell us how they felt when they viewed Earth from the moon. Part of our space exploration is the desire to know from a human perspective what it actually feels like to be there, and that will always remain a human endeavor.</p>

<p><b>@00:36 Dallas Milanovich: </b>I agree with Sara - also, a lot of our space robots have kicked the bucket or become unresponsive while up there because space is so unpredictable - that lack of communication and unreliability is something that happens a lot less with human astronauts.</p>
