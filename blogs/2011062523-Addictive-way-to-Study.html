          <p>
            I just read an article about Examville. It's one of the finalists for startups of the year based in NYC. So I couldn't help digging into its' site and checking it out. 

Here's a little introduction about <a href=”http://www.examville.com/examville/start.html”>Examville</a>.

Intuitively, we would associate Examville with Knewton and Grockit (maybe some other more, but the core ideas are similar). So let's talk about the similarities and why they are so popular and successful.

The three sites are all collaborative, rich in content, and personalized learning. The most important common features among these three would be that they all utilize “social” features. Tweet it away, update facebook status, let your friends know you are studying, your status/levels… 

If we simply break into 3 stages of these kinds of sites, publishing (where experts, students contribute their work, could be questions, could be answers), collaborating (all sorts of tools to facilitate the “studying” process), and consuming (where students actually study and perform, provide feedback to update their profile). 

The major but yet subtle differences among these three would be the adaptation.

-Knewton does a good job in knowledge adaptation. They obviously have experts work on fine graining the content (especially concept level, aka domain ontology) to profile each student's knowledge. Knewton is essentially a broader educational platform. It covers wider domains, assignments, exams etc. So it must capture wider prospects for the users too. So the adaptation must have acquired collaborating & consuming components, to understand the students better. (eg. user is bored during collaboration, a challenging problem must be presented following, to excite the user) 

-Grocket almost does the same thing. It's just more exam focused, which technically should be easier to model such as using item response theory to profile a user and generate series of difficulty levels GRE questions etc. 
Compared to Knewton, Grockit focuses on study and ACE the exams. Grockit's adaptation stresses on consuming stage. Provide a good next level of questions to the user and help them to progress.  Publishing, collaborating aren't the issues.

-Examville is a comprehensive site (they said).  It aims to achieve all three, for the supposedly best of the best adaptation. But I haven't tried the online tests, and there aren't any demos. So which I doubt they could do better than either Grockit or Knewton. The specialty in Examville, would be the recommendations.  Since it stresses equally on publishing as well as collaborating and consuming, it means it encourages contributing more items. More items and users + well modeled profiles, it gets higher chances to have good recommendations. 

Oh, all three have user analytics. I guess, having good adaptation, meaning good profiles, providing analytics is a no brainer. Some charts, visualizations, numbers, will just be sophisticated enough to dazzle the users :p

So, what are the lessons learned? 

I think, 2 things.

1.	Capitalizing Twitter and Facebook and any other viral social networking tools is a MUST. 

2.	Define which stage we want to model for adaptation. I personally think it's super time consuming to model each domain knowledge, considering we talking all domains. It's pretty much no way. (Even Knewton, I'm suspicious that they may just have experts in some key domains, such as Math and Physics). But, a coarse-grained modeling could be a go. It means, we do not need to model into detail down to concept levels, but we can do topic level modeling. 
 
Addictive way to study? Networking with people & adaptively guiding users to stay in the system.
