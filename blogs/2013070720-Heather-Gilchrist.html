Heather Gilchrist is an edtech revolutionary.  As the Founder and Program Director of <a href="http://socraticlabs.com/Welcome.html">Socratic Labs</a>, she has created not only an edtech accelerator, but a collaborative campus and community to support "all stakeholders in education."  Heather’s interest in helping to revamp the education landscape has deep roots in her own love of learning, extensive work in the field of "test prep" and experience as Founding Director of Academics for the Edtech company, <a href="https://grockit.com/">Grockit</a>.  Heather has also led investments for <a href="http://raktechfund.com/Home.html">RAK Tech Fund</a>, advised a number of early stage startups and currently helps organize and facilitate Startup Weekend EDU, contributes to Startup Digest EDU and is a charter board member for the Georgetown University Entrepreneurship Alliance.  Heather is currently on break from studies as a JD/MBA candidate at Georgetown University.


<p>
<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> Interesting question, and somewhat difficult to answer. My educational background had little to do with me directly starting my career in educational technology. I was "into" school and was a good student when I was younger and in undergrad, but I started working for Kaplan almost on accident, and that I can only attribute to having done well on standardized tests and having been SGA President in undergrad.
<p>
Someone came to our SGA office and asked whether she could post flyers for part-time tutoring gigs for Score!Prep, a (then recently acquired) Kaplan subsidiary. I gave her the okay and we struck up a conversation, which ultimately led to me starting as a tutor. Years and many miles later, I had moved up the Kaplan ranks and was working with Farb Nivi. We talked often about how Kaplan was really missing opportunities to use technology effectively and how we both loved teaching, but preferred teaching in more meaningful contexts than the generally privileged world of test prep (I taught several programs in low-income neighborhood high schools in Los Angeles and loved that work). I knew nothing about startups or venture capital, but Farb did. He ran some early tests a la lean startup (before it was a thing), raised some money, and <a href="https://grockit.com/">Grockit</a> was born.
<p>
As the founding Director of Academics, I learned a ton. The experience got me really excited about education, educational technology, and venture capital, but I didn't think my humanities degree was going to grant me too much longevity in those worlds, so a few years in, I decided to return to grad school.
<p>
Knowing that I didn't want to practice law and that nobody technically needs an MBA (there's no certification exam like the bar), I thought the two programs would give me a grounding in two practical disciplines, so I pursued my JD/MBA. I experienced a sort of reverse culture shock in going back to school after living in the exciting, hands-on, fast-paced startup world. Nonetheless, I did my first year of law school, then my first year of business school, and came to New York almost on accident (again), intending to stay just for the summer.
<p>
I moved here  to launch and run a seed fund with a real estate investor who was new to technology. We made very early stage investments and I really enjoyed working with early stage entrepreneurs, so it wasn't terribly difficult for my investing partner to talk me into taking a year off from grad school. Pretty soon, however, I began to really miss education. Luckily, I'd never really disentangled from Grockit, and when Grockit helped launch the Startup Weekend EDU vertical in the second half of 2011, I got involved, too. It was in the mentor room of one of the earliest SWEDU events that the idea of Socratic Labs was born, and I haven't looked back since.
<p>
All of that, I suppose, is just a long-winded way of answering the original question:<br>


Indirectly, or in somewhat surprising ways:<br>
•	my education through undergrad (particularly extracurricular) indirectly led me to my first teaching experiences, <br>
•	my experiences there pointed me toward educational technology,<br>
•	my experiential education in startups led me back to grad school, and <br>
•	my grad school experience facilitated my return to my roots in the startup and edtech worlds.<br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> My time at Kaplan inspired my love of teaching, helped me to identify a problem, and led to the creation of Grockit. Grockit quite honestly changed my life. It opened up my eyes to the great potential for innovation in education and the power of technology to knock down barriers to learning.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I work with absolutely brilliant founders who are incredibly passionate about solving real problems in education and learning. There is a real need for (and strong movement toward) new models of learning, both in schools and beyond school walls. I hope–and believe–that the learning innovations being created by the companies we work with will enable new learning models to emerge and help all students access learning in ways that are relevant, impactful, and effective.
<p>
More immediately, our goal is to create meaningful connections between the technology and learning communities. We are working hard to engage all stakeholders in education/learning (teachers, students, parents, administrators, policymakers, researchers, and strategic partners) and to help foster a healthy dialogue among them, the technologists who can facilitate next-generation learning models, and the funders who support the development of new tools and services.
<p>
We're definitely taking a non-traditional approach to the accelerator model, but the old model just wasn't adequate for most educational technology companies and the communities they aim to serve. We've curated a really inspiring community of collaborators to help change the dialogue and the trajectory of edtech startups, and we've formed Edtech Passport, a network of partner programs around the country and around the world who agree with us on our philosophy that real change in education requires a richer dialogue and a more robust ecosystem of support. I hope that as we stumble through new relationships and new models, we find some great new models of collaboration that others can copy. I think we have the best partners and collaborators in the world to do so, too.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am really excited about the potential for educational data to help us understand teaching and learning in ways we couldn't even fathom just a few years ago. The technology is falling into place, but now we have a lot of policy work to do to ensure we leverage the power of student data responsibly.
<p>
I am also really excited about the potential for technology to transform the concept of "school" from a building into a mindset that involves learning anywhere, everywhere, and always. I think the Maker movement is a big step in this direction: it embodies so many of the "21st century skills" (pardon the buzzwords) that today's students will need to thrive in a future that we can't confidently predict.
<p>
I really believe the next decade in education is going to be absolutely fascinating to witness, and even more exciting to be a part of.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> We've just wrapped Alpha cohort. We fell in love with our Alpha cohort companies and their founders, and we learned so much from them during our first cohort. On our brief break between cohorts, we're ramping up the "persistent ecosystem" and network collaboration pieces of the grand Socratic Labs and Edtech Passport visions. We're fleshing out a much more robust curriculum and we've already dug in with our partner programs and devised really cool ways to create impactful international collaboration in "Socratic Labs v.2." Next up: continuing to help our Alpha cohort companies grow, fleshing out our new curriculum and international collaborations even more, and searching for amazing Beta cohort companies.
<p>
I love learning and I love starting things, so this is the perfect role for me: at the start of every cohort, everything is new again. It's another opportunity to do better than we did before, a chance to "make better mistakes" than we did the previous round. As ridiculously effusive as this must sound, I love what I do and the folks I work with, and I can't imagine anything better!
