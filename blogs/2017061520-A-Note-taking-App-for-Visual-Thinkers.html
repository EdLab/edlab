<p><a href="http://www.qrayon.com/home/inkflow/">Inkflow</a> is a note-taking app for tablets and smartphones that hails itself as the "word processor for visual thinking." Taking notes is notoriously difficult on a touchscreen, but Inkflow allows users to digitally draw images, insert text and pictures, and move and scale pieces around the page.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Inkflow Plus provides notetakers with a gamut of artistic digital tools, including pens, paintbrushes, multicolored ink, highlighters, and erasers. It also allows you to insert typed text and images from your photo library. For me, however, the most exciting feature of Inkflow is the ability to circle chunks of words or images, scale them, and move them around the page. This added a flexibility to my note-taking that regular pen and paper doesnâ€™t allow; it makes note-taking a design experience rather than a fill-the-page-and-organize-later task.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some of the features on Inkflow are more cumbersome than they are on other note-taking apps. This includes the delete feature. For instance, instead of being able to tap on text or an image to highlight and delete it, you must drag the select tool around the object then delete it from there. This makes a simple function more complicated and time-consuming than it needs to be. Also, Inkflow does not allow users to import PDFs to the app, which would make the platform more accessible to academics and college students.</p>
 
<p>In addition, the free version of Inkflow is quite limited, meaning that only the plus version is really worth having on your device. Yet Inkflow Plus is more expensive than some note-taking apps at $9.99, but still less than a stack of paper notebooks.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Inkflow makes the task of taking notes on your device easier and more enjoyable than typing them out in Notepad, and the flexibility it allows will leave visual thinkers happy. For basic note-taking and design, Inkflow works well, but even the plus version is limited by not allowing PDF imports and by having some tools that are a bit more cumbersome than they ideally would be.</p>
