            <b>Introduction and Context</b>

<i>Blackboard</i> is one Teachers College's LMSs, and has been in use since the summer term of 2002 as a platform for the delivery of fully online courses, and for supporting hybrid and face-to-face courses. Over the years however, Blackboard adoption and usage be faculty members and instructors has stagnated (after a steady increase during the first 3 years), and is therefore now only being used by the same group of persons semester after semester. In the meantime the college is making a lot of investment to keep this technology running and supported, calling into question the effectiveness of the current installment of <i>Blackboard</i> as a resource for promoting and enhancing teaching and learning at the College. 

As the EdLab has the responsibility of administering Blackboard, it behooves on us to ensure a much higher ROI by exploring innovative ways of not only increasing Bb adoption and usage among faculty, but also how the resource can be used optimally to promote learning in both the cognitive and affective dimensions. 

In this regard, and given the fact that Blackboard Inc. is introducing a Bb mobile platform, we are proposing a project that will work towards deploying Blackboard Mobile and also making TC's blackboard courses mobile compliant. Mobile learning (or learning through mobile electronic devices) promises ubiquitous, pervasive, personal, and connected learning as it can respond to on-demand learning interests of learners, connect formal with informal educational experiences and facilitate situated learning (e.g. receiving performance support while on the job). Mobile learning thus represents the next step in technology-mediated learning, and its success will require new strategies, practices, tools, and resources. 

<b>Blackboard Mobile Learn</b>

According to Blackboard Inc, <i>Blackboard Mobile Learn</i> is a product that extends and enriches the course experience of Blackboard Learnâ„¢ in native mobile applications built for the Apple iPadâ„¢, iPod touch and iPhone as well as select Android devices, BlackBerry and the Mobile Web. "With Blackboard Mobile Learn, students will be able to check grades and assignments, add comments to discussion boards, email instructors and classmates and post comments on blogs - all from their mobile devices."

<i>Blackboard Mobile Learn</i> will be available through an annual license, will be branded under the school's name, and can be downloaded by students and faculty at mobile application stores.  However, institutions that are interested in experimenting with mobile learning on their campus for no additional charge can enable Wi-Fi access to Blackboard Mobile Learn on devices such as the iPhone and iPod touch etc.


<b>Proposed Plan of Activities</b>
<!--break-->

May - June 2010: 	
<ul><li>Investigate and work on the technical (and financial) issues pertaining to the deployment Blackboard Mobile on a test basis</li>
<li>Research into best practice instructional design and pedagogical strategies for Bb mobile learning</li>
<li>Design and test run a week long course and gather feedback (mostly from library staff)</li></ul>

July 2010:
<ul><li>Design a tutorial or training module for both faculty and students</li>
<li>Carry out outreach activities by meeting faculty and instructors to introduce Bb Mobile</li></ul>

August 2010:
<ul><li>Deploy Bb Mobile in TC</li></ul>
