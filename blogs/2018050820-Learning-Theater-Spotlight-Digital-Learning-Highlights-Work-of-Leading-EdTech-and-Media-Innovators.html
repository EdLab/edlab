<p><a href="https://digitallearning.website">Digital Learning @ TC</a> took the spotlight at a <a href="https://lt.tc.columbia.edu">Smith Learning Theater</a> event in early April. The interactive exhibit featured six modules focused on different areas of innovative digital learning that Teachers College (TC) faculty, students, and trustees have been working on. The exhibit was sponsored by TC’s Office of Digital Learning and curated by the <a href="https://masclab.org">Media and Social Change Lab</a> (the host for this past year’s <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5071/podfest-the-media-and-social-change-labs-first">Podfest</a>). Around 200 participants from the TC community participated in Digital Learning @ TC, with activities ranging from virtual reality to augmented reality to videos to research findings.</p>

<p>Lead curator of the event and Communication and Education doctoral student Kyle Oliver says that one of the event’s goals was to show teachers and learners new ways technology may inform or supplement their current projects, or inspire them toward fresh ideas never before considered. Passionate about digital learning communities, Oliver studies the intersection between technology and learning groups in his personal research, which focuses on using learning innovation and technology to support and grow faith communities.</p>
 
<p>In a <a href="https://masclab.org/2018/04/11/wrap-up-digital-learning-tc/">video tour</a> of the event, Oliver gives viewers an inside look at the innovative exhibits found at the Digital Learning @ TC event. These include a virtual reality chemistry experiment created by a TC student, an augmented reality art project created by a preschool teacher, and a display on the benefits of multimodality by the Media and Social Change Lab. These, along with several other exhibits, conversation sessions, and lectures, not only showcased the current work and research in digital and innovative learning, but shed light on the future of education and the role technology will play within it.</p>
