<p>Retirement certainly didn’t slow down this 89-year-old engineer. Max Schlienger has been obsessed with trains since he was a young boy and has spent about two years creating an elaborate train set that runs through his Mendocino, California vineyard. This train set, called the Vectorr system, is a working model of a decades old concept. This idea was first proposed in the Victorian era as an alternative to noisy locomotives.</p>

<p>Max’s Vectorr system depends on magnets and is pulled along by a pressurized vacuum tube. Though it sounds complicated, there are really only two parts to the train: an interior passenger car and an exterior thrust carriage. These two pieces are coupled together by very strong magnets. An advantage of Max’s system is that the train can climb significantly higher hills than a traditional train. Max’s keen engineering mind applies an historical lens to model a solution to present-day transportation engineering design problems.</p>

<p>The original idea for an air pressure locomotive was proposed to solve noise problems. In the present day, how could an engineering design like the Vectorr system, built to scale, potentially solve energy our transportation problems?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:10 Claude.Bosse:</b> As Max did, he explored ideas that were only hypothetical when they were proposed, but thanks to advances in materials are now able to be explored by engineers—especially one with lots of time and space to create a giant model train!</p>

<p><b>@02:22 Caitlin.Davey:</b> An air-pressure powered train system can, as this model does, more easily run on electric power as opposed to other fuel sources. This could have significant environmental impacts on transportation.</p>
