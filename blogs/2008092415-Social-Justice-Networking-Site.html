          <p>
            After the meeting today, Laura, Faisal, Hui Soo and Jacklyn and I talked about our ideas for grants. We discussed the idea of visually mapping communities and social justice. 

Basically the idea is to create an online space where students can come to learn about social issues and to network with their peers. The learning would happen through various Google maps. For example, Alex Epstein, a member of NY2NO, shot over 30 hours of footage while he was in New Orleans this summer. Ideally he would edit several videos and upload them to a Google map. Along with some of my footage a viewer could experience New Orleans. They could compare the simple levee in the 9th Ward to the elaborate levee system in the French Quarter. Or another map might explore residents' opinions on rebuilding New Orleans. What do residents from different neighborhoods think? Is there a pattern?  

Other students could create their own maps using video and Google. Hui Soo mentioned that it would be interesting to "suggest" videos to viewers. Something similar to what Amazon does with books. If you like this video on gentrification, then check out this video from Brazil that deals with similar issues.

Ideally this website would be a place for students to come and network with other students who are interested in social justice projects. If we make this easy to use and a tool for students to keep their group organized it would constantly be used. Having NY2NO as the first organization will really help get traffic to the site. Laura also has a connection to students in Brazil, a media literacy organization called Cinema Nosso.

Faisal is thinking about ways to use Google Maps for the HBO Little Rock project, so we might be able to see how it could work for this grant. NY2NO is on board. I think the biggest challenge is making this site useful for students who do not have experience in organizing social movements. 

Does anyone have any other suggestions? Or if anyone in the group thinks I missed something in the description please add!
