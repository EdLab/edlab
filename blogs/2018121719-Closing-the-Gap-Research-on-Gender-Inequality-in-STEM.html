<p>Despite various programs and efforts, gender inequality in STEM remains persistent. Last year, researchers examined this problem from different angles, employing new strategies to address it. Here are some of the findings we found most intriguing:</p>

<p>1. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5377/the-gender-gap-in-stem-might-not-be-what-it-seems">The Gender Gap in STEM Might Not Be What It Seems</a></p>
<p>A study of 500,000 students from 67 nations or economic areas found that places with higher gender equity display larger STEM gaps. Boys display higher degrees of interest in STEM subjects compared to girls, especially in nations that were more gender equal.  </p>

<p>2. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5520/the-leaky-pipeline-for-women-in-stem-starts-way">The Leaky Pipeline for Women in STEM Starts Way Before University</a></p>
<p>This study examines several hundred studies on the gender divide in STEM and found that once people reach graduate school, there is gender equity in interviewing, hiring, funding, and publishing. This suggests the origins of the gender gap lie in earlier education levels. </p>

<p>3. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5543/gender-stereotypes-as-seen-by-5-decades-of">Gender Stereotypes as Seen by 5 Decades of Childrenâ€™s Drawings</a></p>
<p>Since the 1960s, researchers have been measuring gender stereotypes by asking children to draw a scientist. Since the study began, the percentage of students drawing female scientists has increased, but there is still a lot of room to grow.</p>

<p>4. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5613/digital-youth-divas-uses-narrative-to-interest">Digital Youth Divas Uses Narrative to Interest Girls in Programming</a></p>
<p>Researchers created a custom curriculum to build interest in STEM among young women of color. They also provided custom-made, digital YA books about girls of color engaging in tech-related activities to provide a narrative of success. </p>

<p>5. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5186/barriers-for-women-engineers-in-international">Barriers for Women Engineers in International Collaborative Research</a></p>
<p>This research examines barriers related to international collaborations faced by women in engineering fields. In a survey, respondents indicated that funding was the biggest barrier to international collaboration, but family issues were among the top five. </p>
