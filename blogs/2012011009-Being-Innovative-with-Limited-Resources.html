          <p>
            As suggested by Hui Soo, I just read an <a target=0 href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/finding_common_ground/2011/12/can_educators_be_innovative_when_they_lack_21st_century_resources.html">article</a> that discusses how educators can be innovative even when modern education tools are not available. It points out that being innovative shoudn't be just about letting student use modern learning resources because many school still lack them. 

It's possible though to be innovative even with limited resources. The author gave a very good example about how a teacher can use Twitter to learn others' experience and apply them in his own classroom even though his students don't have access to Twitter.

The article does remind us about the resource shortage problem that exist in some schools in today's context of e-education. It might be helpful to build flexible interfaces for our products and tools so that they can better serve people who don't have free access to IPads, computers or networks. Possible approaches might include flattened representation of our multimedia data. Also we may design features that serve intermittent requests so that people who don't have continuous network connection can use our service more smoothly.

As the article suggests, sometimes it will still work out even if resource access is limited to the teacher. This reminds us to design some teacher-centered features for our products so that they can function better in situations where the teacher is the only one that can access them.
