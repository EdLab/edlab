            Allright folks, this is my first blog post since joining as an intern at Edlab, so here goes: 

Today marks the end of my first week. It's been great 4 days (hectic, but awesome), and everyone has been really welcoming. Its surprising how easy it is to talk to anyone here; you just have to ask for help. 

We've had some good variety of activities during the first week, like yoga exercises, competition based on reading of a book (where the losers had to enter specially constructed hall of shame!), runner's club. Everyone's been telling us, the new interns, that this stuff doesn't happen every week, and we have been lucky to have such an eventful week. So I guess we interns brought our magic along!

Work wise personally, it's been a good deal of reading up on new technologies I'm not familiar with, so it's been slightly boring. So, I'm trying to learn fast to get comfortable, so that I be ready to to work on a project soon. 

I've not used Mac before, so, switching from windows to Mac has been another thing which I've had to learn on top of everything. Which brings me to the second part of this post:

<br>
LIST OF TIPS/SHORTCUTS FOR PEOPLE TRANSITIONING TO MAC:

- To find if a software/file is installed on your system, press command (âŒ˜) + space, which will open up a search tool called spotlight top left of your screen. Type in the name of the software/file to find if it's there on your mac. (Similar to pressing windows key and typing software name to search in windows).

- The delete key on mac works same as backspace key on windows. To get the function of windows delete key, use fn + delete. (Sometimes this does not work, for instance it stops working in the python shell in terminal).

- For right click, tap the trackpad using 2 fingers. you can find other mouse gestures by going to system preferences->mouse (Click on the apple icon on top left of the screen to get to system preferences).

- For some reason, some of mouse functionality is missing from mouse in system preferences. For eg, to enable drag lock behaviour (tap trackpad, drag to select, tap again to finish selection), go to system-preferences->universal access->mouse & trackpad->trackpad options

 You can other mouse options, like setting the cursor speed also here.

- To see all open program windows, use three finger swipe up/down. Alternatively, click mission control in dock. 

- There are no home & end keys on mac. Instead, use command (âŒ˜) + left/right cursor to get to the beginning or end of a line. (There's a bug in mac when this sometimes stops working randomly.)

- Similarly, command (âŒ˜) + up/down gets you to beginning/end of document.

- For page up/page down, use fn + up/down arrows.

- During web browsing, swiping left to right goes back, swiping right to left goes forward.

- Command key (âŒ˜) in mac does the same work as control key. so shortcuts like ctrl + T to open a new tab in web browser are instead command (âŒ˜) + T

- The dock below contains either open applications, or the applications you stick to the doc. To add an application to dock, open it, right click (two finger tap) on it's icon, click on options, chose keep in dock.

- Use command (âŒ˜) + Tab to switch between applications. to switch between different windows of the same application (for eg, to switch between 3 different windows of firefox), use command (âŒ˜) + ` 

- To quit an application, use command (âŒ˜) + Q

- Finder is the mac component analogous to windows explorer. to open it using keyboard, if it's not already open, use command (âŒ˜) + tab to switch to it. since it's not already open, nothing will show up on the screen. don't be worried, just press command (âŒ˜) + N. this will open a new finder window for you. (the finder always shows up when you try to switch applications using command (âŒ˜) + tab). 
  
 To hide a finder window, use command (âŒ˜) + H instead of command (âŒ˜) + Q.

- If you drag a window to secondary monitor, and do full screen, sometimes it goes to full screen on the primary monitor instead of the secondary one. This is a bug in mac, so you can just drag at the corner to resize it manually.

- Since there's no gtalk for mac, you can use ichat instead with your google account, and download gmail notifier for mac for gmail. But to be part of a group chat, you'll have to use gmail in your browser. 

Hope someone finds these tips useful. I'm sure I'll discover more and post later, since it's been just 2-3 days since I started using mac. 

<br>
Once again, it's been a great first week at Edlab, and I hope the rest of the summer follows suite.
