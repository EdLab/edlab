            <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp5690.pdf">Angrist, Joshua D., Dynarski, Susan M., Kane, Thomas J., Pathak, Parag A., Walters, Christopher R. (2011). Who Benefits from KIPP? IZA DP No. 5690</a>

For those who do not know, the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) organization of charter schools is one of the largest and supposedly most successful set of charter schools in the country. KIPP schools were featured in the documentary "Waiting for Superman." KIPP places an emphasis on extended school days, No Excuses policies, and heavily standardized curricula. There is a consensus that their students do achieve but some commentators, particularly Diane Ravitch, have accused KIPP of cream-skimming, claiming that only the best make it through KIPP while difficult students are thrown out.

This study done by Joshua Angrist and his colleagues at MIT, NBER, and Harvard take this claim to task by specifically focusing on special education students who remain 'under-served' by the public education system. Their study conclusively shows how special education students also thrive at KIPP, throwing water on the idea that KIPP only retains the best of the best. 

Their methods involve looking at applicant lotteries for a KIPP school in Lynn, Massachusetts and seeing how reading scores changed for low-achieving students as a result of attending KIPP.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
This will undoubtedly be a centerpiece in the next Schoolyard Brawl podcast. Over the longer-term horizon, it will be interesting to see what future studies say about the success of KIPP's practices. How much does spending per pupil have to do with KIPP's success? What are some ways charter schools can harness the power of technology better than regular public/private schools?
