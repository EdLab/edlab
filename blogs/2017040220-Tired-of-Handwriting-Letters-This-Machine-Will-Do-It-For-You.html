<p>There’s nothing quite like a personal, handwritten letter, but <a href="https://bond.co">Bond</a> wants to change that. The four-year-old company developed a machine that can duplicate anyone’s handwriting to craft penned letters, which the company then sends to the desired recipients. Clients simply type or text their message to the company, and the pen-yielding 3D printer takes care of the rest.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to make it really easy to send beautiful experiences to people," says Bond founder and CEO Sonny Caberwal. While some customers might use the company’s services to send birthday cards to their moms or letters revealing their love to admired ones, most use it to distribute handwritten letters in bulk, such as in forging business relations.</p>

<p>The technology is incredibly impressive, there’s no denying that. But the question must be asked: is something lost in human-to-machine translation? Is a handwritten letter truly the same whether it comes from a person or a bot? Finally, a question that will bother any lover of pen and paper (like myself): what could this technology mean for the future of handwriting? Join the discussion, lovers of handwriting,

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:17 Joseph.Banks:</b> As the founder says their goal is to send "beautiful experiences" to people. The receiver won't be able to decipher who wrote the note. I think there's something really interesting about creating technology that is sentimental.</p>

<p><b>@01:17 csd2126:</b> I think having a machine handwrite notes changes the authenticity or the value of a handwritten note in a way. I wonder how this is all that different from a handwriting font? Aside from the machine using a pen.</p>
