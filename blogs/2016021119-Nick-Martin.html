Nick Martin is an educator, technologist, and social entrepreneur with ten years of international development and peacebuilding experience. He is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1lMLRWz">TechChange</a>, a Washington D.C.-based social enterprise that provides tech training for social change. Martin is also an adjunct faculty member at Georgetown and George Washington Universities.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I have a bachelor's degree in modern poetry and a master’s in peace education. Armed with these two highly practical degrees I had a hard time getting a job—so I figured why not start an organization in the midst of a recession?</p>
<p>I had been running a local nonprofit dedicated to peacebuilding and intercultural understanding through the use of technology called DCPEACE and we simply ran out of money. After that, I decided to travel the world and volunteer/meet with individuals and organizations in other countries like India, China, Ethiopia, and Nicaragua, where I came across various organizations using technology to do things like provide healthcare to rural villages through mobile phones, map disasters and conflicts with digital tools, or track human rights abuses with social media.</p>
<p>Through my travels and conversations here at home in D.C., it also became clear that only a small percentage of the social sector community knew about these tech advancements or had the skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to them. And yet the demand for these skills was tremendous. So I thought to myself: How might the social sector as a field bridge this gap? How do we as a community bring more skills to more people who are eager to learn—what about online learning?</p>
<p>In an effort to better understand the potential for online learning, I signed up for dozens of online courses at places like Lynda.com, Coursera, World Bank Institute, FullSail University, Khan Academy, Code Academy, Code School, Udacity, Udemy, and more. While I definitely came across interesting examples, I also found that a lot of existing elearning was one-directional and top-down. Many courses fit a similar model where one all-knowing professor imparted his/her wisdom to a group of passive students. There were lots of long poorly-produced videos, endless amounts of PowerPoint slides, and quizzes upon quizzes.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that while this approach might work for those teaching Computer Science 101, it was not ideal for collaboratively tackling complex problems of development like poverty, health care delivery, financial inclusion, and empowering participants to address challenges in their contexts. So with the help of a small team of tech nerds, I set out to build a better model for capacity building through online learning—one that took the unique considerations of the social sector to heart. The TechChange online learning model we developed was (and still is) highly social and based on maximizing peer-to-peer interactions, practical and skills-based, and truly global with participants from between 25-50 countries represented in every course.</p>
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>There are so many problems in the world today—climate change, natural disasters, human conflicts, famine, human trafficking, diseases, unemployment, etc. People need new skills to address these challenges but traditional forms of education just haven’t kept up with the demand. And so many folks just can’t go to formal schools or take part in in-person trainings because of cost, time, geography, or disability.</p>
<p>Online learning—I should say good online learning—can be a powerful mechanism for building those skills, especially given the growth in global connectivity over the past few years. Moreover, many of the solutions to these problems will be local and will come about from south-south collaboration, not top down international development. We need educational experiences and platforms that bridge those gaps and allow people to share with each other as experts. That’s what we’re working to build.</p>
<p>Our goal is to help change the way that capacity building is carried out for individuals, communities, and institutions. I believe that the key to just and sustainable participatory development lies at the intersection of pedagogy and technology—a model where every participant, no matter where they are from, is both a learner and an expert, and where the role of the instructor is to facilitate interactions rather than broadcast knowledge.</p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The tremendous growth of mobile devices around the world will mean that more people will be learning over their phones. Cost of data plans and handsets will go down, making this technology available to 95-99% of people on the planet.</p>

<p>The rising costs of higher education and mounting student debt will force those interested in a career in social innovation to look for alternative forms of skills-building. We've written about this in the <a href="http://bit.ly/1O3fV6h">Stanford Social Innovation Review</a>.</p>

<p>Non-traditional education actors and institutions will increasingly turn to online education as a more affordable and effective means to train staff and constituents. And the quality of online learning experiences will continue to improve, engaging and incentivizing participants in new ways.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
We’ve got a few exciting projects in the works:
<ul>
<li>We just finished a really neat project with UNICEF: two self-paced courses on a new SMS campaign-building software which they support called <a href="http://bit.ly/1m4tGev">RapidPro.</a>

<li>We are working on an elearning project in Uganda and Nigeria: training several thousand health care workers and pharmacists in how to use <a href="http://bit.ly/1RmMzX4">Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) to better diagnose and treat Malaria</a>. 
<li>We’re building a really exciting series of online courses on climate change with the World Resources Institute.
<li>This fall we launched our new online <a href="http://bit.ly/1QK7sKn">diploma program in Technology for Monitoring and Evaluation</a> with over 150 participants from 45 countries. The diploma program will allow participants to take three of our most popular online certificate courses consecutively and offer a variety of other activities, features, and support services.
<li>We’re going to expand that program in 2016 to offer an online alternative graduate school experience for folks who want a career in social innovation but can’t afford to go into crazy debt.
</ul>
