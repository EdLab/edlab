What will the library of the future look like? It depends on the community it’s in! 
<p>
On February 16th 2013, <a href="http://www.ledgertranscript.com/home/4622908-95/library-forum-peterborough-community"> 90 citizens of Peterborough, New Hampshire</a> sat together in a forum to discuss a most important issue: the future of their beloved town library. The vialogue above contains the outside-of-the-box video invitation to participate in this event. 
<p>
It is clear from the message of the video that this is to be no ordinary forum: in lieu of the traditional town hall/stand-and-deliver-style meetings, potential participants are told they will work in small groups, with one group member acting as facilitator, to come up with new ideas for the library of the future. Such collaboration is intended to inspire a wealth of ideas and bolster new perspectives and ways of thinking about the library’s future. 
<p>
The Peterborough Library’s development project is supported by the 1833 Society, a non-profit whose sole purpose is to raise the funds necessary to revitalize and update the library. Perhaps most commendable of all is that the group encourages community members to contribute to the process in every way possible, be it via surveys, focus groups, or the above-mentioned meetings. Add to that, <a href="http://peterboroughtownlibrary.org/">the library has its own blog</a> to keep people abreast of updates and is yet another forum to share ideas. 
<p>
The people of Peterborough, along with a great number of citizens and scholars across the country, agree that the library of the future will be born from the needs and desires of communities. In fact, Peterborough’s future library will likely reflect the very nature by which it was conceived—a space that facilitates collaboration and fosters creativity.  
<p>
What do you think of Peterborough’s inclusive planning process? What would you suggest for your town or school library? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8496">Join the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a> to add your thoughts.

<b>@2:38 jagnitti:</b> Prepare the library for the next 50-100 years... That is a lot of planning to account for! Is it even possible to plan so far ahead? <p>
           <i>(In response)</i> <b>YogiP:</b> I guess that's why it's important to build it to be flexible!
