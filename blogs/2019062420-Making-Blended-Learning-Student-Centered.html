<p>Addressing different student needs in a big classroom is difficult. In a traditionally designed school, it is inevitable that some students will not be challenged enough, and others will not be able to keep up. However, a school in Washington D.C. has proposed a way to keep students learning, regardless of their level, while also allowing teachers more time to work independently with students who need it most.</p>

</p>Instead of giving traditional lectures, teachers at Eastern High School make instructional videos for students to watch, pause, and rewind at their own pace. Then, students engage in collaborative learning activities to apply what they've learned. Finally, they complete exit tickets to demonstrate that they've mastered a concept. This frees up teachers for the entirety of the class period to work with students to answer specific questions and guide individuals who need help.</p>

<p>Do you think this is an effective system for students? What might some potential pitfalls be? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50906">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:16 Pual M.:</b> This is probably the most effective use of blended learning I've seen. Blended learning may work best in situations, like this one, with highly variable attendance rates and skill sets. With videos, exercises, and exit tickets, this model allows for quasi-individualized learning within a classroom environment.</p>

<p><b>@04:58 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> One pitfall to this approach is that it relies on students' ability to focus and persevere in a task pretty much on their own. Many students simply do not have the ability to focus, especially if distractors like cell phones or laptops are present. Before implementing this approach, educators need to think carefully about how the crucial skill of attentiveness can be fostered in students.</p>

<p><b>@05:00 RuthS: </b>This method makes sense more in certain contexts than others, I think, and the teachers make a great point here about the positive effects blended learning can have when school attendance is spotty. These videos can help the students learn at their own pace and keep up with the content, even when they miss a significant number of days.</p>
