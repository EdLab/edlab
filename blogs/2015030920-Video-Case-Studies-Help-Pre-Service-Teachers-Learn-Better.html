<p>How do videos help develop reflective habits in teacher education? The authors of this study, using the example of pre-service teachers in music education programs, argue that videos can be effective tools for inspiring reflection. They found that the most effective videos were case study recordings of real classrooms and were taught with scaffolded questions to support reflection.</p>

<p>Learning with video also helped student teachers think critically about their beliefs and focus more clearly on different methods of teaching. Pre-service teachers enter teaching programs with preconceived ideas about what teaching looks like and what it means to be a good teacher based on their own experiences as students. An important part of a teacher education programs is supporting students to reflect critically on these preconceptions and modifying or reconstructing them through observation of a variety students and teachers in action and dialogue. Video case studies help bring diversity into this practice which is essential for great teaching.</p> 

<p>The most impactful videos in the study were those involving non-fictional classroom situations. Discussion after a case study is one of the most important ways pre-service teachers refine their ideas about good teaching. The reason for this is that a good case study video is one that models good teaching in a way student teachers may not have thought of or portrays a teacher solving a problem in a novel way.</p>

<p>The authors of the study recommended that teacher educators should lead discussions to focus on issues that make the case unique, discuss different perspectives within the case, analyze potential multiple sources of knowledge in the context of the case, talk about different ways to solve the problems presented, and discuss the potential consequences and impacts of the action the teacher took. Though this study focused on pre-service students in music education, it is clear that the conclusions drawn could benefit pre-service teachers in any field of study.</p>
