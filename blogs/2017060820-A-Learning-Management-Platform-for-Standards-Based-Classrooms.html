<p><a href="http://www.kiddom.co">Kiddom</a> is a one-stop standards-based classroom app that helps teachers develop curriculum, grade, track progress, and message students all in the same place. Teachers, students, and administrators use the same platform to keep education aligned to state and federal standards, such as Common Core.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Kiddom makes keeping track of assignments, grades, and standards easy by placing it all on the same platform. Teachers can develop their curriculum on the app by uploading documents or choosing lessons from synced open-source platforms such as <a href="https://www.ck12.org/student/">CK–12</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>. In addition, they can browse the list of statewide and national standards that relate to the task, attach them to the assignment, and create a grading rubric around those sets of skills. For any teacher that adheres to standards-based education, this feature will be immensely helpful.</p>
 
<p>Another great feature of the platform is that it allows teachers and students to message back and forth regarding particular assignments. It also provides graphs for teachers to easily keep track of their students’ mastery of different standards throughout the year.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Kiddom can sync with many learning management systems, it is not intended to have all the functions that such platforms have. For instance, Kiddom does not provide a space for students to hold a forum or communicate with each other on the app. This could limit the opportunities that students have to learn from one another outside school hours.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you work in a school that rigorously adheres to standards-based learning such as the Common Core, Kiddom will help you keep track of the specific standards your students master. The app is easy to use and well organized, making the stress of achieving different standards more manageable and perhaps even enjoyable.</p>
