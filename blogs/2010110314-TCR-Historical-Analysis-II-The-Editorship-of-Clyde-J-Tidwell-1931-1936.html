When approaching this section of the analysis, I set out to learn more about TCR's second editor, <b>Clyde Tidwell</b> (who never himself published in the journal). As it turns out, editing TCR may be a dangerous job.

Tidwell, who studied at Harvard and TC, was an Arkansas superintendent who came to TC as the Director of the Bureau of Publications in 1923.  In '24, he took on the role of TCR's Managing Editor, working with Dean Russell, and was made a TC Assistant Professor of Educational Administration in 1929. In 1931, he took over the journal's editorship completely, but died in 1936 (of unpublished causes) at the young age of 46.

<u>Contributors:</u>
Two of the most frequently published authors during this period were <b>Thomas H. Briggs</b> (TC Professor and member of the committee that produced the famous “Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education”) and <b>David S. Snedden</b> (TC Professor of Educational Sociology and Vocational Education, and proponent of the scientific reconstruction of curricula).

While published less frequently than their male counterpoints, Professors <b>Ruth Strang</b> (scholar of guidance, reading, health education, psychology, gifted children, group work and testing) and <b>Maxie Woodring</b> (secondary education) were the most prominent female contributors. 

<u>Topics:</u>
During Tidwell's editorship, articles about <b>teacher training, administration, school finance, guidance</b> and <b>ability grouping</b> were regularly published. Issues also addressed the <b>educational systems of foreign countries</b> (including Sweden, England, Iraq and Palestine). <b>Rural education, the Depression, and “Negro” education</b> were likewise frequently featured. The published college notes from this time even reported a series of Horace Mann race-relation lectures featuring representatives from the Tuskegee Institute and W.E.B. DuBois.

<u>Points of Interest:</u>
1. For the first time, original <b>abstracts</b> began appearing before featured articles, as well as language indicating experimentation and research (i.e., “The purpose of this study…”).

2. A number of interesting <b>visitors</b> spoke at TC at this time, including H.G. Wells, Helen Keller and Lady Astor.

3. There was also evidence of an interesting, intermittent debate about the <b>marital status of female teachers</b>. David Snedden chimed in, arguing that prolonged training or professional autonomy for young unmarried teachers was “childly Utopian,” given their likely departure from the profession after marriage. Likewise, he described the call for more professionalized, married instructors “antisocial.”
