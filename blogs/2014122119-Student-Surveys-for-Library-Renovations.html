<p>What types of spaces foster learning in higher education? How does changing a space impact a student’s perception of learning in that space? A study at the academic library at Rollins College sought to measure student satisfaction and learning behaviors before and after a scheduled renovation in one section of their library. To measure changes in student perceptions, researchers administered a 14-question survey asking students to describe their learning styles in the designated space and if the space met their needs as well as demographic questions like enrollment status and living situation.<p>

<p>Surveys were administered before the renovation and then one year later, during the same time in the semester. Pre-renovation results found that students generally believed the floor met their learning needs. Students appreciated the ability to use the floor as a collaborative learning environment and an individual learning space. However, survey respondents expressed a need for more electrical outlets and comfortable furniture. The post-renovation survey revealed an overall increase in user satisfaction. Additionally, data from gate counters showed a 15% increase in traffic post-renovation. Although students were happy prior to the library floor’s alterations, post-renovation responses showed continued support and positive perceptions.</p>

<p>Spurred by the digital evolution, the library endeavored to remodel a learning space in a way that better suited its users. After conducting surveys and analyzing feedback, the library implemented design changes that were shown to improve overall student satisfaction and continued use of the library as a learning space. Through this study, researchers developed a better understanding of the community wants and needs and were able to translate these findings into the space’s re-design.</p>

<p>Prior to the renovation, students believed the original space already suited their learning needs, and only had minor complaints about outlets and furniture. After the renovation, students were only minimally happier with the space due to initially high approval ratings. Further research might observe student satisfaction at the Rollins College library over the next several years to determine whether a renovation was necessary. The method of surveying students could also be reconsidered. Students were primarily concerned with immediate needs, but library renovations might find more success focusing on the future.</p>
