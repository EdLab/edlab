<p><b>Title:</b> Creating a Virtual World Mindset: A Guide for First Time Second Life Teachers (2010)</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> Sharon Stoerger</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/1010813151/fulltextPDF?accountid=10226">Journal of Distance Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can a guide work to support teacher use of <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> to teach students to produce and consume educational content?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>  <a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/1010813151/fulltextPDF?accountid=10226">Creating a Virtual World Mindset</a> is a guide designed for teachers who feel intimidated by Second Life (SL) and other virtual spaces and as a result rely on didactic, instruction focused teaching.  The guide contains a series of recommendations based on interviews with teachers, observations of teachers using SL in their courses, and analysis of transcripts developed from those courses. To address teacher intimidation and the reliance on a limited set of teaching approaches, the guide explains the value of student-centered learning in SL and scaffolds the teacher’s own learning about how to use SL in the classroom.</p>

<p>The content is divided into the following pedagogical topics: active learning, the "classroom" hierarchy, identity formation, and social interaction. It also covers practical topics: learning about SL, registering for a SL account, creating a free avatar, completing a SL orientation program, SL basic skills, SL and student-centered learning experiences, and SL instruction tools.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The author found that "three-dimensional virtual worlds are powerful in that they have the potential to support active learning, disrupt the physical classroom hierarchy, enable users to construct an identity, and encourage social interaction." However, SL can have such a powerful effect only if teachers are effectively taught the skills needed to use and teach with SL.</p>

<p>The findings suggest that SL teaches students experimentation, collaboration and active learning—skills the students then exhibit, not only in second life, but in the physical classroom as well. For example, students learn to map out "strategies to overcome challenges and navigate charted and uncharted paths." Students also learn to use decision-making skills and they develop a sense of place and identity.</p>

<p>However, the study also found that managing information in SL presents a challenge to teachers and managing SL with Moodle or Google Groups creates additional challenges. Moreover, it can be difficult to convince school administrators to allow SL in schools and inadequate technology and bandwidth can hamper use.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The guide demonstrates the real power of making space, whether virtual or real, for learning. With clear student-centered learning objectives, student learning experiences and skill development can be significantly improved. What is most interesting is the transference of skills learned in virtual space to the real classroom. It seems with further research a case could be made for teaching particular skills in SL because it could be a more effective learning environment for some skills that could then be used in real life.</p>
