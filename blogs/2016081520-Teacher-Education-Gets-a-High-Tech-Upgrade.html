<p>The University of Central Florida has found a way to combine teacher education with virtual reality. Using a program called TeachLive, the university trains its teachers with a computer-simulated classroom, the only one of its kind in the world. Prospective teachers step into a virtual classroom and interact with five animated students, each with a unique personality and learning style.</p>

<p>Just because the students in TeachLive are virtual doesn’t mean they lack the characteristics found in the average cohort of an urban, American middle school. Between answering the teacher’s questions, the virtual students might play on their phones, tell long, irrelevant stories, or completely zone out. Along with giving teacher candidates a chance to practice their teaching techniques, TeachLive strives to give them a taste of the challenges they will likely face in a real classroom. The program even stages virtual parent-teacher conferences.</p>

<p>TeachLive is intended to prepare teacher candidates for educational settings without bringing real students or parents into the process. Do you think interacting with virtual students in a virtual classroom can give pre-service teachers adequate training? What are some of the possible plusses and minuses of this process? Share your thoughts on this innovative teacher education method <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30060/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:34 dinosossi2:</b> Due to budgetary decisions, schools are often overcrowded and this presents additional issues in teaching. With only five students, teachers can focus on fewer interactions and be less overwhelmed, and have more meaningful practice, than they would otherwise.</p>

<p><b>@03:58 JennyAbamu:</b> First thing I noticed, the class has a small number of students. This is not realistic for our public school system. In addition, students are very polite, not cursing, waiting their turn to talk, not talking to one another, if a teacher has this experience, they are very lucky people</p>
