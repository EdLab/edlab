<p><b>Title:</b> Solving Conceptual and Perceptual Analogies with Virtual Reality among Kindergarten Children of Immigrant Families (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Passig & Timor Schwartz</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://tcrecord.org/library/abstract.asp?contentid=17339">Teachers College Record</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can virtual reality technology advance abstract thinking skills in in young children? </p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Analogical thinking is one of the central thinking skills that children develop from early childhood. However, research on early learners’ analogical thinking skills is limited. To achieve efficient ways of fostering the cognitive development of Ethiopian immigrant children in Israel, the authors designed a six-week experimental study. 56 Ethiopian immigrant children aged four to seven were randomly assigned to two groups. Those in the experimental group put on 3D gear and were guided in an immersive virtual environment while the control group practiced the same analogical questions with picture cards. In addition to immediate pre- and post-invention tests, both groups were further evaluated three weeks later to test their ability to preserve the learned solution strategy.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Both intervention programs significantly improved the young participants’ ability to solve analogies. However, children who were placed in the virtual environment improved their analogical ability more than the children using the pictorial mode. The virtual reality technology gave the children the opportunity to understand analogies in a concrete environment. Further, although age was found to be a predictor of perceptual thinking ability in the control group, this was not the case in the experimental group, suggesting that the virtual environment overcame the influence of age on analogical learning among the children in the experimental group.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> This study suggests the potential of using virtual reality technology with young children in school settings. It provides a new pathway for teachers to engage young learners in developing their abstract thinking skills. For educational technologists, it also provides a good example for designing and developing adaptive virtual reality technologies to foster children’s cognitive learning in a playful way.</p>
