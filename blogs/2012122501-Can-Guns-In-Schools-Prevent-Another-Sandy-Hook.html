          <p>
            We are all familiar with the tragedy that took place at Sandy Hook elementary school a couple of weeks ago. Since the tragedy, politicians from both sides have stated their desire to ensure such a tragedy doesn't occur again. While browsing Time magazine, I across this <a href="http://nation.time.com/2012/12/20/how-to-prevent-more-sandy-hooks-arm-the-school-staff/">article</a> underlining ways to prevent another Sandy Hook. According the article, arming school safety guards as well as teachers will be the best way to prevent another tragedy. Lawmakers in eight states introduced legislation requiring guns in schools as it has become a primary target. 

The National Rifle Association (NRA), in response to the criticism about guns following the Sandy Hook tragedy, proposed arming school personnel with guns as an alternative. I am very concerned about school personnel being armed with weapons. As a high school student, I witness disrespectful and sometimes hostile action toward school personnel and I fear that they may use their weapons in anger or frustration. The aforementioned and countless other instances are why I am opposed to guns in schools. It represents danger to both students and personnel. What do you think of this proposal by the NRA? Will it prevent another school shooting?
