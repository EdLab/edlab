          <p>
            I have learned many things from reading this <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-you-need-besides-experience-to-get-that-job-155123491.html">article</a>. The following are the most common answers that business owners give on why they would rather pick one of the two equally qualified candidates. 

<blockquote> 
The candidate with the better sense of humor: 27 percent
The candidate who is involved in his or her community: 26 percent
The candidate who is better dressed: 22 percent
The candidate whom I have more in common with: 21 percent
The candidate who is more physically fit: 13 percent
The candidate who is more on top of current affairs and pop culture: 8 percent
The candidate who is more involved in social media: 7 percent
The candidate who is knowledgeable about sports: 4 percent
</blockquote>

It is interesting to see the one with the better sense of humor would be picked, when you have your mind set on going to a place where one believes they have to be serious at all times. It is very hard to joke with someone who is interviewing you simply because you do not know what they find funny. 

Some of the top things a boss looks for in his employees when he is willing to promote someone is also included in the article. I would assume that those who want a promotion also want a raise, but it is likely that you'll only receive the promotion upon request. 

So those are some tips in case you were looking for a promotion, or have an interview in the near future. 

If you are or were to be a boss, what do you look for in a candidate for the position they are applying to? What would you want from them to give them a promotion?
