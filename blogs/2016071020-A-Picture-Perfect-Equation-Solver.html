<p>Math teachers and students, this might be the app you’ve long been waiting for. Rivaling the graphing calculator, <a href="http://mathpix.com">Mathpix</a> is the world’s first technology that reads pictures of handwritten equations and instantly displays solutions and chart graphs. And it’s easy to use: simply take a picture of an equation and the app will do the rest of the work for you. Although it’s ideal for calculus, it can also be used to solve and graph more basic algebra and trigonometry problems.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Mathpix easily solves almost all the kinds of problems students face in calculus, including derivatives, integrals, logarithms, and infinite series. It can even solve bounded integrals. Once you take a picture of an equation, the app will display the result as well as the individual steps taken to reach it. While testing the app, it seemed like I had a math tutor in the palm of my hand walking me through each problem—one that could easily recognize neat handwriting, including symbols such as π, Σ, and ∞. </p>

<p>In addition, the app’s graphing feature was intricate, yet simple to use. All trigonometry, algebra, derivative, and logarithm problems were immediately graphed upon solving. Not only can multiple equations be graphed at once, users can see point value tables and control equation variables such as amplitude, making the graphing experience flexible and cooperative.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite all the great features of this app, it does have limitations. For one, it does not graph integrals or bounded integrals, a task that comprises a large section of calculus that a graphing calculator can accomplish. In addition, it has a limit on the length of an equation it can solve. The app was unable to solve longer integral equations because of this, such as using the washer method to solve volume problems. Also, although the app solves algebra problems, it does not walk users through a step-by-step solution as it does for calculus problems. Apparently, however, this function is something the app developers will include in future versions.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Although this app is incredible and can provide great homework help for any advanced math class, its limitations are currently significant enough to prevent it from displacing the graphing calculator anytime soon. Still, teachers, students, and math tutors of advanced math classes will embrace this app and revel in its clarity as they check homework problems and explore math’s possibilities. As someone who studied math in college and tutored calculus, I certainly wish Mathpix had been around sooner.</p>
