<p><a href="http://home.writelab.com">WriteLab</a> is a web application with a clear mission: to help you write better. Users upload or copy and paste their writing to the site, and WriteLab analyzes it using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing, then makes suggestions for how to improve the writing sample. WriteLab also comes with built-in analytics and document sharing capabilities, meaning it allows peer and teacher feedback to be integrated into its assessment.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>WriteLab is unique because it grounds its feedback in pedagogical principles. Instead of simply correcting a writer’s mistakes, this web app makes suggestions and gives explanations for each so that the writer can understand the reasoning behind the corrections and decide which ones they want to keep. For instance, when I used the phrase "in recent years" in my writing sample, WriteLab asked, "What does 'in recent years' add to your sentence?" then suggested I try replacing it with a few more concise phrases to see if they would fit the piece better.</p>
 
<p>WriteLab gives users feedback in at least four areas: concision, clarity, logic, and grammar. Each problem area is color coded so that when looking at your analyzed text, you can clearly see what writing skills you need the most help with. In addition, the app allows users to make notes on their text and share it with others to receive peer feedback in addition to WriteLab’s suggestions. It also keeps track of writers’ progress and monitors consistent problem areas, as well as what pieces of feedback are most and least helpful for individual students. Because of this, WriteLab could be a fantastic tool for teachers to bring to the classroom and for other instructors and tutors to bring to writing centers.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The only downside to this incredible tool is its price. Although it is free to put your text through the site’s analysis, WriteLab will only give suggestions regarding concision, not any of the other skill areas. Thus, you will need to pay the monthly fee to make the most of WriteLab. That said, the cost, ranging from $5-10 a month, is significantly lower than even an hour with a writing tutor.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Because it combines machine capabilities with pedagogical principles, WriteLab is a fantastic resource for anyone who writes or edits on a regular basis. It offers clear explanations for all the suggestions it makes, thus teaching someone how to be a better writer while offering them immediate feedback on their piece. In addition, the sharing and commenting capabilities make WriteLab a valuable tool for any classroom.</p>
