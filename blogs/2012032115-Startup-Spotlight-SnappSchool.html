<b>The Details and Backstory</b>
<a href="http://www.snappschool.com/">SnappSchool</a> was started by a "former teacher and frustrated parent" who realized that parents who better understood the concepts their kids were learning in school (in this case, math) would be able to be more involved in their kids' schoolwork.

To help accomplish this goal, the duo decided to create an email-based "digest", or newsletter, aimed at parents that would help them to "refresh" their understanding of the K-6 math concepts their kids are learning in school (who really remembers how to multiply long equations?). Parents sign up based on their child's grade level to receive grade-specific newsletters once a week that are filled with practice exercises, "refresher" content and relevant news stories. These digests are all written by a team of certified teachers and aligned with the common core standards. The newsletter is free for the first 3 weeks and $7.99 to get the rest of the year.

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>
Tailoring content to one subject area, the one that most students (and perhaps parents) struggle with in school, is a uniquely focused approach. Sign up is easy and the price for the whole year is low enough that many parents can afford to add this resource to their arsenal. 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
What additional content could we leverage in a newsletter? Is “free for the first few weeks” an effective model to explore?

<b>Takeaway</b>
Simple, focused content delivery can be effective when it is paired with intuitive design and backed up by strong pedagogy.
