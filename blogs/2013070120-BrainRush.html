<p><a href="http://www.brainrush.com/">BrainRush</a> is a game-creation and play platform for adaptive learning in a variety of subjects. The system works to encourage a state of flow, adapt to student knowledge, and teach 10-15 minute chunks of content. A system for teachers to analyze student progress and send targeted games to their students is in the works, and soon students and educators will be able to develop their own adaptive games to teach and learn unique content. Founder Nolan Bushnell has a wealth of game experience as one of the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell">co-founders</a> of Atari. Bushnell is confident in the site’s ability to teach concepts quickly.  In a <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2013/03/13/qa-atari-co-founder-nolan-bushnell-on-creativity-steve-jobs-and-chuck-e-cheese/">recent interview,</a> he stated that "we think we can teach kids four years of academic high school in about six months with better retention than 100% mastery."</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The topics featured in BrainRush games generally focus on memorization and practice-based content. These types of activities are often the target for at-home work in flipped classrooms and work well as a first step toward technology integration. BrainRush would work well as part of a collection of online sources including video instruction, online readings, and games. The content on the site is easy to embed and share. The games are engaging and often target one piece of knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>BrainRush is still new and in the process of setting up the teacher portion of the site. There are many games to play on the site, but users are still unable to create their own games. At this point the library is a little ambiguous and the categories are not clearly differentiated. As content on the site grows, system categories should expand and search should improve. Learning plans and progress evaluations would be easy to build into the site and will likely improve as BrainRush develops.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>BrainRush is valuable as a curriculum aid. As part of a growing pool of short content, videos, games, and activities, it can help students learn more deeply about a particular subject in conjunction with traditional teaching or other online resources. Though Bushnell’s 6-month high school claim seems a bit exaggerated, helping students learn foundations more efficiently may help schools make time for more self-directed projects, creative endeavors, and 21st century skills.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>BrainRush lets students breeze through the basics.</p>
