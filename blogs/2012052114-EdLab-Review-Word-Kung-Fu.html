<a href="http://www.root-1.com/">Root-1</a> developed the soon to be released language arts app (currently in Beta "play only" web mode), <a href="http://www.root-1.com/products/">Word Kung Fu</a>, which is one of the CA-based educational game development company's four app-based, vocabulary-focused games. Root-1 develops games that are focused on the vocabulary space and utilize a platform that is powered by proprietary algorithms that deliver "detailed event tracking, user/expertise profiling and machine learning."

Word Kung Fu is broken up into three different areas: training, challenges, and leaderboards. Students are able to progress through training sessions that allow them to review vocab words that they will encounter later in vocab challenges. Challenges are martial arts-themed and include "wood breaking, brick smashing" and "word slice" among others.

<b>Note:</b> The web version of the game appears not to load on Firefox 12.0 browsers, but did load on Chrome 19.0.1084.46. Although it seems as if a "class code" is necessary, I was able to log in despite inputting "0" and receiving an error message.  

<b>Pros:</b> 
Word Kung Fu is an educational version of the ever-popular app, <a href="http://www.fruitninja.com/">Fruit Ninja</a>, and, fortunately for learners, seems to be just as addictive. With multiple games to choose from and an algorithmic backbone that adapts to each player, Word Kung Fu strikes the often elusive balance between entertaining AND educational. Leaderboards provide a nice opportunity for students to compete with each other and adds an element of c

<b>Cons:</b>
Although adaptive, this "web-based" version did not clearly identify how your progress is tracked and quantified. Perhaps this will become more clear in the app version?

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
As we amass resources for an adaptive learning database, it is important to identify meaningful benchmarks for what successful, clearly tracked adaptivity looks and functions like. "Fun" and entertainment are important, and perhaps will drive initial user acquisition, but for a technology to claim to be meaningfully adaptive, clear guidelines for judging this need to be present.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
Word Kung Fu seems like a fun app to help students become more agile vocabulary ninjas... I just wish the heavy-duty adaptive learning-based algorithms were a bit less hidden from view.
