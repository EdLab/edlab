Deleuze and Design

Deleuze Connections Series Edimburgh University Press Series editor Ian Buchanan

What might emerge from an encounter between Deleuze and design? From a
Deleuzian mapping of the relays between and blockages of the flows of
theory and practice? Where the practices of design and philosophy can
creatively affect each other?

Deleuze and Design is the first book to interrogate the theory and
practice of design through the thought of Gilles Deleuze and Felix
Guattari. Beginning with an investigation of how the field of design
is currently mutating, this book suggests an open-ended definition of
design reflecting design’s own entanglement with the practice of
‘making worlds’ and 'creating futures'. Taken as a force, a disruption
and a process, design will be examined insofar as it is the material
expression of possible worlds.

Whether products or scenarios, packaging or experiences, objects or
digital platforms, services or territories, organizations and
strategies, design is here taken in its broadest sense as a profoundly
disruptive force, constituted in the multiform entanglement of
practices, discourses, industry agendas, lifestyles and behaviours,
thus optimally positioned to offer a stringent critique of how the
emergence of complex relationships between human and non human
agencies elicit affects, tells stories and ultimately make us think by
doing.

To design means always to engage with what is not-yet but could be. To
design means to engage with the new, the possible, the potential.
Design is not however a mere matter of future- forecasting or
problem-solving. Rather, it is about turning imagination into reality.
Thus, the present emerges as the embodiment of a thought. Design
possesses an extraordinary quality: it is project that keeps on
designing, it keeps on giving visible, tangible shape to the material
world we inhabit. Every designed object contains in itself the seeds
of future practices and future behaviours. Furthermore, design as a
targeted expressive and creative act is constantly crossing the
boundary between chaos and equilibrium in its drive to partiality and
critique.

Can we investigate and reconceptualise design’s own prehension into
the future with Deleuze’s theoretical corpus? What are the tensions
between a creative philosophy intended as the

practice of creating new concepts and the practice, discourse and
theory of design as the field not simply of innovation but of the
creation of the future? What can the principles and practices of
design offer a material philosophy of partial critique?

Deleuze’s formidable thought can be taken on board by design, not as a
fulminous theoretical fad to be shortly outmoded, but as a slow
releasing arsenal of tools to think with, and to inform, the process
of thing-making. Ideas on the relations between the actual and the
virtual, the becoming else of matter, the material realities of
expressing a creative, critical position, the mapping of horizontal
networks of strategic opportunities and the affects elicited by the
utterly relational kinship of bodies and objects, all can benefit by a
reconceptualization based on Deleuze’s philosophy.

In particular, Deleuze’s idea that philosophy is creative and
revolutionary precisely because it is always creating new concepts
deeply resonates with the demands and the agenda of design, always
engaged with thinking about the not-yet. Even more pertinent to design
is Deleuze’s affirmation that new concepts should be both necessary
and unfamiliar, as well as being a response to real problems.

If to design means always to engage with the making of the new, design
then is a powerful perspective on the future, a lens through which we
can catch a glimpse of what is not-yet but might,

could be. Indeed, for some design theorists we have a future only by
design (Fry 2009). But design is not only a reality-building,
world-making project. It is also a vector intersecting a multiplicity
of other forces--political, economical, social, cultural,
experiential, institutional--and as a force it participates to the
construction of the future. It is not the future in itself but
participates in its creation; it is not an event in itself but
participates in its generation.
