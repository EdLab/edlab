To follow up on yesterday's NLT discussion, I am sharing directions from a project brief that I developed last spring.  This first piece lists the fundamental ideas that we need to represent in the NLT.

To get the New Learning Times off to a strong start, it is very important to provide readers and potential contributors with a strong framework.  We need to be very clear about what “fits” the new journal so that its image is not muddied.  

We have argued that the EdLab agenda is cognizant of the six following major factors:

A) massive change as the current educational sector is displaced by NEW LEARNING AVENUES; historian and former TC President Lawrence Cremin has referred to this kind of change as a shift in the configurations of educating institutions; the rapidly evolving and expanding communications and computing technologies represent a major new component in the educational landscape

B) the introduction of both cost enhancing and cost reducing applications of new technologies; our focus is on calling out cost enhancing approaches and IDENTIFYING AND SUPPORTING COST REDUCING TECHNOLOGIES

C) a very substantial DECLINE IN THE COST OF LEARNING on the order of the 90% reduction that accompanied production changes during the industrial revolution;  we need to identify strategies to enhance learning opportunities on a global basis that make learning affordable

D) NEW ROLES for learners and teachers reshaped by the new constellation of learning environments and tools; learners can become more active and more autonomous if we get this right; the careers of educators need to shift dramatically 

E) a decline in the importance of traditional education policies and a corresponding growth in the importance of POLICIES GOVERNING COMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION, CULTURE, AND TECHNOLOGY; a new range of policies affect learning, and we need to pay attention to them

F) the transition of educational research from a stand-alone activity conducted in isolation from the educational enterprise to an activity EMBEDDED in the very design of digital educational enterprises
