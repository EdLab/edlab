          <p>
            One of the projects I've worked on at the EdLab during my summer here has been to conduct Usability studies.  One such study a "user study", used software (Silverback) to capture the user's screen, as well as their face while they completed a series of 10 tasks.  The software also highlights (with an orange circle), the mouse clicks of the user.  The purpose of the user study and it's recording is to give people a series of tasks to complete and see how they go about completing them.  This allows you to see where people are getting stuck, or frustrated, and on a positive note, to see what's working.
There were 10 tasks in total, the first three focused on navigating the site as a new reader, the last seven focused on navigating the site as a new author.  Out of these 10, four tasks stuck out:

1) From the homepage fo to the post "Pressible Launch at the Gottesman Libraries" by Brian Hughes
- everyone uses the search box (or wants to, one even narrates "I'm looking for a search")
- the person who searches by the author's name does not get the post in her search results
- the person who uses the post title finds the post the fastest
- two people navigate from the "contributors list", where finding the post takes them each a bit of time.


2)  from this page, go to the post "Progress Obscuring the Past" which references Brian's Post
- after scrolling by the post link, one user uses the "search box" twice, and then checks the topics bar to find it
-the second person returns to the author site for Brian and then finds it
- the third person realizes it will be on the first page.


3)Create a new blog
- first user returns to the Dashboard, and then has to go back to the main page to create the new blog
- second user goes through each function on the dashboard looking for the "new blog"
- second user goes to another blog's main page to find it, and finally returns to the main pressible page.
- the third user finds it right away.


4) Create a new Post
- after they've created a new blog, they get kicked out to a segue screen which gives four options, none picked "dashboard" which is where they need to go to create a new post
-two users go to the blog page
-one user goes back to log in
- one user attempts to edit a preexisting post before finding "new post"

Upon watching the videos, things jump out at you that might be easy to fix.  Perhaps, get rid of the limbo page after you create a new blog, maybe add a "new blog" button in the dashboard.  This particular Usability study was with a population who had never used Pressible before, so some of these results could influence your instruction and tutorial sessions.  You can also do this study (or a similar one) again once you've made some changes, to see if the improvements have actually helped make the user experience easier, or if new issues now exist.
