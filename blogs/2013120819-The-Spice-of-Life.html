<b>Title:</b> Drawing on Variation Theory to Enhance Students’ Learning of Chinese Characters
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Ho Cheong Lam & Bik May Amy Tsui
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://ejournals.ebsco.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/article.asp?contributionid=30828966">Instructional Science</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Frances Marton’s variation learning theory argues that instruction should focus on the critical aspect of an object of learning, and inculcate that focus in students by varying that critical aspect while holding background factors constant. To test the usefulness of this theory, the authors conducted a study in two Hong Kong primary school classrooms.
<p>
When students encounter an unfamiliar Chinese character, they can often use similarities in the morphology of the character with known words to guess at the meaning. The participants in the study were separated into two groups, one taught to focus on key orthographical components of a group of words using variation theory, the other taught with a traditional Generalization method. After the lesson, the students were all given a test requiring them to apply these inferential skills to discover the meanings of a group of novel words.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
All groups saw significant improvements in their awareness of the relationship between orthography and meaning, although the subgroups taught using variation theory saw greater gains in their understanding of part-part relations (i.e., the relationships between different components in a similar character), while students in the traditional Generalization method group saw greater gains in their understanding of part-whole relations (i.e., how a specific component relates to the word as a whole).
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
Those working in Chinese language learning may be able to apply the lessons from this experiment in their own classrooms, or in language-learning software. With regard to general pedagogical conclusions, however, it seems too soon to say. Certainly variation learning looks like a promising subject for further investigation, and future studies should look to see how applicable its prescriptions are for other subjects.
