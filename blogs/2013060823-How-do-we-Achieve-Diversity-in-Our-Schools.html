          <p>
            I am currently taking a course, Economics and Urban/Minority Ed, here at TC with Professor Francisco Rivera-Batiz. So far, most of the first class sessions have focused on defining what and who constitutes urban and minority. The focused switched drastically in class last week where we had a spirited discussion around how public schools should achieve diversity. As I expected, we all agreed that diversity is important to one's education, especially in our increasingly globalized world, but we were split on what role race based policies such as affirmative action should play in achieving this diversity. 

The class discussion seemed timely considering the US Supreme Court is set to rule on an <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/06/02/affirmative-action-on-tap-at-the-supreme-court/">affirmative action case</a> that could potentially have huge ramifications for how public universities treat its minority applicants. Bismark recently blogged about other factors used by colleges in their admissions process for minority applicants. 
I first <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7335">blogged about the case</a>, <i>Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</i>, when the Court agreed to hear it early last year. The Court heard oral arguments for the case last fall. As customary with the Court, all high profile cases are usually decided during the final week and sometimes the last day of the term in late June.  

Since the Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board, which outlawed segregated public schools, school administrators, politicians, academics and broader American society have sought ways to increase diversity in many areas such as the workplace and education. Several states, including Arizona and California, which has the largest public university system in the country, have outlawed affirmative action practices in their admissions process and should the Court rule in favor of a total ban on the use of race-based admissions, many states might be forced to follow suit.
