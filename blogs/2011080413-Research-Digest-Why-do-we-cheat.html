Cannell, John. (2006) “Lake Woebegone” Twenty Years Later.  Third Education Group Review, 2(1).</a> 

In the wake of the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2299709/">wave</a> of <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6049">cheating</a> scandals that have been revealed over the past few weeks, I thought it was time to take a more serious look at the issue of fraud in our educational system.  It's not simply a matter of the widespread reports of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/education/01winerip.html">statistically impossible</a> <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-21/us/new.jersey.schools.cheating_1_charter-schools-erasure-grade-level?_s=PM:US ">test scoring</a>, or actual <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110727/NEWS06/107270396/Survey-Nearly-30-Michigan-teachers-report-pressure-cheat"> admissions of guilt</a>.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/education/11scores.html"> Politicians</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/11/135318957/in-d-c-michelle-rhee-may-answer-for-suspect-scores"> administrators</a> at the highest levels of our educational system have also been found with their hands in the cookie jar.  The “Texas Miracle” that Rod Paige, Bush's Secretary of Education who helped implement No Child Left Behind, has been found to have been based on <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/06/60II/main591676.shtml"> widespread fraud</a>, and while I've got nothing on Arne Duncan yet (and actually kind of like him), I'm beginning to think it's only a matter of time.

A common scapegoat when it comes time to place the blame for all these scandals is the current high-stakes testing environment inaugurated by No Child Left Behind, and continued under the Obama administration.  Searching for a deeper explanation, I found this historical retrospective by John Cannell, a doctor who made a nuisance of himself in the education world back in the late '80s.

Review:

In 1987, John Cannell, a practicing physician in West Virginia, noticed something fishy about the numbers the state was putting out.  Although it is by most metrics a fairly poor state, every county was testing above the national average.  Being, as his account makes clear, a real busybody, he went out and investigated the kinds of tests that schools were using to assess student achievement, both in West Virginia and nationwide.  He discovered that not only were the tests easy to game, but that it wasn't only West Virginia throwing up unrealistic numbers.  In fact, “all fifty states were reporting they were above the national average in elementary achievement.”  His report, labeled “the Lake Woebegon report” (after Garrison Keilor's mythical town where “all the children are above average”), made, received national attention, including, in 1990, a Sixty Minutes report.  

How did schools cheat? All tests were administered in-house, and purchased by the school system based on what results they were looking for.  They would often reuse the same tests year after year, becoming better at teaching the students what they need to know to answer the questions in that test, without becoming better at teaching. By picking and choosing the baseline national norm (often meaning norms that are years out of date) that the test uses to score students, they could fine tune whatever progress they wanted to demonstrate.

As this 2009 <a href="http://www.voices.org/news/state-naep-report/"> report</a> demonstrates, nothing has changed, and as Cannell himself ruefully admits, his efforts were for naught.  But he did at least demonstrate one thing.  It isn't the high-stakes that makes schools cheat.  He found widespread fraud long before No Child Left Behind, or Race to the Top.  He argues that, instead of adjusting incentives, all we need to do to crackdown on cheating is a more secure testing environment.

In the first link I provided, the education blogger Dana Goldstein writes: 

“When it comes to the K-12 education system, we're living in an age of brutal optimism about testing. Low test scores tell us nothing about a child, we'd like to think, but nearly everything about his school and teachers. Every child in America, after all, is supposed to reach "proficiency" in reading and math by spring 2014, at least according to No Child Left Behind. If any individual child fails, it won't be because he is disabled, poor, hungry, homeless, can't understand English, or maybe just isn't that smart, but because he's been failed by "the system"–those same bad-apple teachers and principals who cheat, or who are just too damn incompetent or lazy to teach their students.”

Although she goes on to blame our current testing regime, here I think she touches on a more important issue, and one that meshes with the history Cannell discusses.  It is our "brutal optimism" that makes us demand these gains.  In effect, we want to be lied to. Testing is merely the venue in which we now want those lies disseminated.  

The solution is to lower your expectations.  Generally, a good rule in life is to expect things to continue on pretty much as they are.  Granted, there's always room for marginal improvement, the more relaxed you are about the output of the system, the less it will have to deform to accommodate your unreasonable demands.
