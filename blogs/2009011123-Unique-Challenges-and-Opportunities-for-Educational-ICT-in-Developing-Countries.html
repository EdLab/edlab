          <p>
            It's clear that deploying ICT's in developing countries presents some unique issues that we may not think about in the U.S. or other developed countries. On the one hand, a lot of the work that remains in developing countries is to create the infrastructure necessary to support any meaningful use of technology. So, the focus of many in the developing world remains on very basic things such as introducing computers, connecting schools to a basic internet connection, and making teachers understand that technology can be an educational tool. 

At the same time, many of the initiatives in developing countries often introduce uses of technology that would be hard to conceive of in the U.S. because of the entrenched interests and previous history with technology that exists at home. So, while you have very limited resources in developing nations, you also have a clean slate from which you can conceive of pretty ambitious reform experiments. A few examples online include the Jordan Education Initiative (http://www.jei.org.jo/), the low-cost laptop movement (http://laptop.org/en/ or http://www.intel.com/intel/worldahead/classmatepc/) and an ICT centered approach to educational capacity building in Africa <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/17741/riding_new_technological_waves.html?breadcrumb=%2Fexperts%2F231%2Fcalestous_juma%3Fback_url%3D%252Fpublication%252F18714%252Fscience_engineering_and_economic_growth_in_africa%26back_text%3DBack%2520to%2520publication%26page%3D2">ICT centered approach to educational capacity building in Africa</a>. 

In environments with very limited resources and infrastructure, but also with limited opposition to trying something completely new in schools, I wonder what some useful new platforms we can conceive from redefining instruction.
