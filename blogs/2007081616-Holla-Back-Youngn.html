          <p>
            My age-mates would agree with me that we're at an awkward age right now. No longer teenager, but still not considered quite an adult. We find ourselves being constantly told that we're adults, but treated like incompetent children in the process. 

All my previous (and current) work experiences have been in offices where I find myself the rookie. While there is generally good-natured ribbing of the greenie amongst coworkers, sometimes people can be downright awful when they notice your age. 

Yeah, age discrimination. It's alive and thriving. 

As a receptionist during the school year, my main task is to be gate keeper and try to deal with as many trivial questions, issues, and problems as possible to save everyone time. Since the office I work for is a school office, I deal with a range of people like students, alumni, and other outsiders. Most of the time, I'm highly amused. 

But sometimes, I really want to let that receptionist smile slide off my face, reach across my desk, and strangle some of these mofos.  

So here's a typical scenario I encounter on any normal day — an alumni who's applying for grad school, or med school, or about to take the bar, comes calling because they need a copy of their judicial records sent to wherever it needs to be sent. School policy has it, that it'll take 2-4 weeks for the records to be pulled up, approved, and sent. Federal investigators receive them within a week, but students usually have to wait — since records requests come in steadily throughout the year (transfer applications, study abroad applications, grad school, etc.). First come, first serve. 

Naturally, if you didn't know and waited until last minute to request your records (which, btw, you should not do with anything of this nature ‘cause you're only screwing yourself over), you're going to be a put out and panicked. Most students and alumni, after a thorough explanation, despite being a little disgruntled, take it in stride. Then we have the ageists. 

These are the bungholes that are power-tripping, and get all spluttery and incredulous when I explain their situation to them. And most of time, they're calling from out of state so I have to listen to them yapping on the other line. It's important to be nice, I know, but sometimes, I can only take so much. 

Like the time this pompous law student got all hissy at me and got his panties in a twist when I told him it'd take two weeks (btw, did I mention that he waited until exactly one week before his bar application was due?). 

Pompous Donkey: *shifting tone to menacing authoritative polite* What's your name? 
Me: Excuse me?
Pompous Donkey: Your name? What's your name?
Me: Christina
Pompous Donkey: Well <i>Christina</i>, transfer me to your <i>supervisor</i>. I want to <i>speak</i> with him about this matter. 
Me: *all but ready to hang up on him* Sure, I'll be more than happy to oblige. He'll tell you the same exact thing. 

My supervisor came out laughing, telling me that he had just told him the same thing as well when he had tried to tattle on me. The only difference was that he shut up and kept quiet about it when told that I had been right. Did he really think that I was some inadequate lackey that didn't know what the hell I was doing and was leading him in the wrong direction? Yeah, I thought so. 

Other friends who find themselves working in jobs that require them to interact with people often complain of the same thing. Being looked down upon or thought of as incompetent when people/customers glance at them and see their age. 

Or sometimes, when we're the ones on the other side of the counter, or the customers we get hassled. Security guards who're on a power trip especially. (Don't even get me started with the ones here in TC — who the hell calls after people with “young lady”? I've been working here all summer. Do I <i>look</i> like your kid?)

Who are the ones that are going to look after your decrepit asses when you're old and senile? Who's going to be paying social security so that when you baby boomers retire, you'll be able to “reap some of the benefits”? Who are the “future of the nation”? The future leaders, the future doctors, the future politicans? Future, future, future. Yeah, I do believe that that will be us. 

Though I must admit, sometimes I take a look at kids younger than myself and am startled and frightened at the state of affairs. Like when I'm at a restaurant and face crappy service because all the waitresses/waiters are high schoolers who find it absolutely necessary to gather in the back and gossip, ignoring their patron's needs? 

Yeah, I mutter “high schoolers” and roll my eyes too.
