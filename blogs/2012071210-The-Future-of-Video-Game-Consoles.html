          <p>
            The internet is all a-buzz about <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console">the kickstarter project for OUYA</a>, which not only surpassed its goal of $950,000 in one day, but today (day 3) is about the cross the $4,000,000 mark.

So what's OYUA, and why have 55,000 people already spent $99 for one less than 24 hours after learning it exists (for the record it won't actually be released until March of 2013).

In the simplest terms OUYA is a video game console, but it's really something much bigger. OUYA intends to bring console games back into a market that they claim is being ruined by smartphones and tablets. From the kickstarter page:

<div style="background-color:#EEEEEE">The console market is pushing developers away. We've seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can't be as creative as they'd like.
</div>

The idea behind OUYA is to allow anyone to develop games (every console includes development kit), and to always offer at least a part of every game for free. The entire system runs on Android which means there is already a community of developers for the system, but founder Julie Uhrman is adamant that the system is not just for ports of existing mobile games. She insists that the system will have it's own ecosystem of games, and considering the overwhelming support that the project has already found, it seems she's right.

The video isn't on Youtube or downloadable so I couldn't put it on Vialogues, but here's the embedded version.

One of the most exciting aspects of the console, at least for me, is that the open nature of the system could allow for some great advances in educational games. During my video game playing heydey (the early to mid 90s) anything that had educational attached to it was <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/weird-educational-video-games/">sure to be awful</a>. I had a brief internship working on an educational video game a few years ago and it seemed that the game having high educational value was far more important to the funders, and therefore to the rest of the development team than actually making the game fun to play. So the game ended up being an educational tool that just happened to function like a game. With OUYA a developer could create a game that has educational takeaways, but is ultimately an entertaining game, without worrying about appealing to the board of some enormous company or institution. 

Even if it isn't a revolution in educational games, I think OUYA is going to be a game changer one way or another. Uhrman says they are "trying to disrupt an established industry" and that "there is a need for an open game console, and there is support from gamers and developers alike. You're the signal to the world that this is wanted." I, for one, can't wait to see what happens.

And before you ask, yes <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> will be on it.
