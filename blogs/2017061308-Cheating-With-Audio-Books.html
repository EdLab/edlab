          <p>
            I’ve just completed several readings for the course. I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed reading for class. Most of the readings I find enjoyable tend to be for leisure. The audio readings have been very enjoyable as well and have led me to question the difference between reading a book and listening to an audio version. According to <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/listening-to-a-book-instead-of-reading-isnt-cheating.html">this article</a>, there is no huge difference, although there are people who would argue that there is “cheating” when you don’t read the book and simply listen to it.

Reading is challenging task for some students. As a result, I wonder if allowing audio versions for students could be an option in our schools. The readings for the course would be more enjoyable if it were in audio form. I think audio books and other forms of listening to a book or reading should be an important piece to any online course. It will allow students to listen to their readings without looking at their screen (e.g. when they are no space to hold a phone on a crowded train). Students, myself included, enroll in online courses with the expectation that they will be a lot of options to access the materials and resources.

&nbsp;

The design of any online course (even if previously offered in-person) is crucial to retention. Some students enroll in online learning to learn something new or brush up their knowledge of something previously learned. The key to retention for either reason is the design of the course and how the resources are presented.

How do you read? Do you find it efficient?
