<p><a href="https://www.overdrive.com/">OverDrive</a> is a popular reading collection for libraries that boasts over two million eBooks, audiobooks, and videos for library patrons to borrow digitally.  Patrons can access the content either via the OverDrive website or by using their mobile app. The system requires a valid library card at one of the subscribing libraries, but with over 30,000 libraries in 40+ countries, OverDrive provides incentive to sign up for a card. Set up much like Netflix, OverDrive offers recommended reading by genre including biography, technology, and thriller and by categories like "most popular" and "hidden gems."</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The OverDrive site is well-designed, with a user interface that makes it easy to navigate. There are multiple avenues to search for books aimed respectively at patrons who know the book they are looking for, those just browsing, and those looking for resources in their field of study. OverDrive helps users find their local libraries by zip code or via Google maps. The books are compatible with most mobile devices and e-readers including Amazon's Kindle.</p>

<p>OverDrive offers services to help school and public libraries customize their online library for the learning needs of their patrons and students. This feature is particularly helpful in school libraries because both students and teachers are able to create wish lists of books they hope to see added to the collection. School librarians could use this list to acquire titles as needed throughout the academic year.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are multiple login screens that make accessing book content a long process. After the user signs up for OverDrive through a log-in, they must then enter, or find and sign up for, a local library card. It also may not be immediately clear to users that they can only check out ebooks from local libraries where they have a membership. The checkout system works exactly like checking out a physical book in the library, with a loan period, a "due date," and restrictions on how many users can access the title at the same time. This idea seems unnatural when applied to limitless digital resources and may not be intuitive to patrons used to accessing digital materials in other settings.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>OverDrive is a great way to integrate public and school library content into classrooms using mobile devices. Students using the system will have access to quality resources beyond their classrooms for research projects and book reviews. In addition, schools looking to expand their own digital collection can partner with OverDrive to make more books available to students and teachers.</p>
