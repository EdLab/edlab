<p><a href="https://www.osmosis.org/mobile">Osmosis</a> is a mobile app designed by two medical school students to help other students in the field learn and remember medical knowledge more effectively and efficiently. Users choose the topics and receive a selected set of practice questions along with correct answers and detailed explanations that incorporate images and videos. A visualized scoreboard that tracks learning progress and the option to receive questions through push notification make Osmosis a special learning app that facilitates memorization of key information needed to survive in medical school.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.osmosis.org/about">founders’ experience</a> as medical school students is a plus when it comes to content selection and design. They were able to network with faculty members from top medical schools, build a solid clinical advisory board to review questions, and partner with the American College of Physicians for useful content. The scoreboard visualizes learners’ progress with several view options: accuracy, time, and confidence level (users are asked to indicate whether they are confident about their answers as they submit them). Learners can use the scoreboard to identify their weaknesses and create new sets of questions to improve their learning. Offering questions via push notification is a creative idea that integrates subject learning into learners' daily use of mobile devices.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The navigation path between question sessions and the scoreboard, app settings, and topics might not be clear for some users even though the app has an overview of this during the installation process. Push notification is a great use of mobile devices for learning and currently the system sends out one message per day. While this frequency seems to seek a delicate balance between learning and social activities on mobile devices, the developers could consider leaving the decision of message frequency to individual users so that some could arrange for more aggressive learning schedules.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>In some fields, like medicine, progressive approaches to education can only do so much and memorization of content is inevitable. In these areas, better adaptive and content feeding technologies can help learners gain necessary information efficiently. Osmosis provides a nice example of design in this respect and there is potential to develop the app in other fields of professional training.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Osmosis turns push notifications into daily learning opportunities for medical school students.</p>
