            While the morning was mostly spent helping out at the morning poster session with Dana, I also managed to poke around some of the other poster offerings. It was a weird mix—a lot of international library cooperation, with some posters dedicated to ebooks and other global digital solutions kind of jammed in. There were two more rounds of poster sessions, each with a different focus: building connections in and out of the library, and library infrastructure (including physical space, resource management, and technology). All of the poster sessions were jam-packed, but I managed to talk to quite a few other librarians about their projects, our projects, and everyone’s goals for the future. We covered a lot of ground, and I want to share photos of some of the posters—some were exciting, useful, and relevant and some were kind of weird, but let me know if any look particularly interesting and I'll go into more detail on them!

This is a case of a public library offering music programs, but it would be cool to see something similar happening in our new 4th floor space!

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/6YYIQoh.jpg"> <b>Can You Print That? Collaborative 3D Printing Projects Drive Curricular Innovation</b> 
One of the best things about this poster was the array of objects & models created for science courses!

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LkPzEUo.jpg"> <b>Acquisition, Access, and Discovery of Streaming Media for Libraries</b> 
Streaming media was definitely a hot topic at this conference! There was a lot of interest in creating and hosting in-house streaming platforms, and people were excited to hear about Vialogues—even though the focus is different, the idea of creating a video platform definitely intrigued a lot of digital-focused librarians.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/5HfiIUy.jpg"> <b> Librarians as Graphic Designers</b> 
As someone who just learned how to use Adobe Illustrator to design a poster for a library conference <I>(thanks for the tutorial, Gonzalo!)</i>, this poster was timely!

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rPnmP7K.jpg"> <b>3D Printers in Library Learning Labs </b> 
For those of you who are wondering, a "library learning lab" is the preferred terminology used by IMLS when funding grants for what everyone else is calling a "makerspace." (The more you know!) I thought this poster showed great examples of how to use 3D printers in practical ways. Rather than using the printer to create manipulatives, this program centered on teaching kids critical thinking, problem-solving, empathy, meteorological science, and more. Kids in the program were encouraged to go out in their community to find a real problem, and then brainstorm and prototype solutions. The central image is one heartbreaking example: in this case, one kid who had experienced a huge tornado (this was Oklahoma, after all) noticed that disaster shelters were unable to accommodate his dog, so he used the 3D printer to prototype his design for a tornado shelter for family pets and other large animals in need of storm protection.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/l1w5Mp2.jpg"> <b> Study Room Reservations: An Open-Access Solution</b> 
This librarian was very excited by our own room booking system, Roomer, and we exchanged contact info. We may have developed Roomer first, but I have to give them a lot of credit for open-sourcing their software for other libraries to use!

For the last poster session of the day, I spent a few minutes helping Laura set up our <b>#homemade Digital Tools</b> poster before rushing off to my afternoon discussion facilitation on service experience design at the Marriott conference center. (It was so hectic and packed that I didn't even grab a picture of my own poster design in action! Maybe someone else did?) The Creative Ideas in Technical Services IG roundtable was lively and engaging, even if there weren’t many people at my particular subgroup’s table. We were still able to spend the whole hour talking about communication methods, hiring strategies, preparing to meet worst-case scenarios with the best service practices, and always trying to achieve a culture of saying YES to patron needs.
