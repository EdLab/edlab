          <p>
            In early May, the board of trustees at Copper Union made a decision to charge undergraduate students for tuition fees. This decision did not appear pleasant to students because for decade, students have not spent a dime on tuition fees because of Peter Cooper's vision that higher education should be open and free to all irrespective of the person's race, sex, religion, or wealth. As long as the person or student qualifies for the school's requirement, then the student should be enrolled. When the board of trustees publicly made this decision, students at Copper Union <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/9441">organized a protest</a> and camped in the office of President Jamshed Bharucha.

After two months of searching for a better solution to the institution's financial crisis, the occupation of Cooper Union has come to “a peaceful and reportedly productive end.” Occupation of Copper Union <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/nyregion/protesters-agree-to-vacate-top-office-at-cooper-union.html?ref=education&_r=1&">agreed to leave</a> the office of President Bharucha after being invited to join alumni, administrators, faculty members, and trustees in search for a better way to help the school with it's financial crisis.  Moreover, the leaders of the school have promised to find a place for the students to gather and strategize rather than protesting and causing destruction in the school. I believe that this is a good start for the school to get back to its normal form because I know this event became sort of a burden unto them.  And the school has taken a good decision by hearing the students voice because it's possible that this decision has deterred chaos that would have been raised in the latter days.
