            A recent newsletter by the <a href="http://www.hfrp.org/">Harvard Family Research Project</a> advocates ideas for building up "smarter" (e.g., "adaptive") data systems for students across the country as proposed by the Education Sector, a nonprofit think tank focused on education reform. It recently published an editorial <a href="http://www.educationsector.org/analysis/analysis_show.htm?doc_id=1184684">Five Design Principles for Smarter Data Systems</a>, calling for improved data systems to measure student learning in line with the U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan's initiative for students' learning data systems as "the driving force [behind education] reform."
<blockquote>1. From Institutional- to Learner-Centered
2. Information Flows Across Institutions
3. Usefulness and Usability Drive Adoption
4. Common, Yet Open, Systems
5. Get the Right Data</blockquote>
Interestingly, the organization suggests a variety of adaptive ways to collect students' data, similar to iPhone appliations:
<blockquote>The iPhone (and other "smart" phones) provide good examples: They adhere to recognized (or what might be considered standards-based) protocols so that they can operate across common voice, data, and GPS networks. The software, however, also enables the easy development and integration of an unending variety of useful applications, or "apps," that users can install to customize and extend the use of their phones. State longitudinal data systems, which currently exist separately from district systems, could be designed in a similar wayâ€“so that they provide the core of data for every district, but enable districts to easily tailor and extend beyond the core for their unique needs.</blockquote>
It also implies a trend of increasingly open-access databases across districts, states, and the nation, which indicates that many quantitative research studies can be achieved from those "qualitative and adaptive" data collections toward individual students through "intelligent" applications/data systems in the near future. </p>
