<i>"Brilliance or genius is not defined by success in school. This doesn't mean that academic success is not something to reach for. It does mean that youth who do not exhibit success in school should not be dismissed as lacking intelligence. In many respects, these kids are geniuses waiting to be discovered." </i><b> Christopher Emdin</b>

<b>An Education Innovator Wearing Many Hats</b>

<p>
Most people think that hip hop and science have nothing in common. Yet, Chris Emdin, who has an extensive educational background in both natural sciences and education, makes them intersect perfectly. His educational profile is distinguished and diverse: Ph.D. in Urban Education with a concentration in Mathematics, Science and Technology, Masters degrees in both Natural Sciences, and Educational Administration, and Bachelors degrees in Physical Anthropology, Biology, and Chemistry. As a researcher, book author, public speaker, provocateur, and above all "groundbreaking educator," Emdin works to explore innovative teaching practices in urban educational settings. Through his interest in hip hop culture he attempts to draw a close alignment between urban youth culture and science education. In his book <i><a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Urban-Science-Education-Hip-Hop-Generation/dp/9087909861">Urban Science Education for the Hip-Hop Generation</i></a>, he attempts to inspire his students and new rappers to unite hip-hop with science education. This combination creates a unique pedagogical approach that appeals to traditionally underserved urban youth who have been raised and immersed in hip hop culture. Since the birth of this idea, Emdin has reached out to others through <a href=" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYpcqntL8O0" >thought-provoking talks </a>, <a href=" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-emdin/children-science_b_1081642.html">Emdin--style blog posts </a>, and <a href=" http://www.freireproject.org/users/christopher-emdin">projects</a> grounded in critical pedagogy and geared toward traditionally marginalized youth. <p>


<b>Hip Hop As a Pedagogy in Science</b>
<p>
Emdin’s unique perspective on hip hop culture and science education is that hip hop is not just music, beat, raps or rhymes, but a way of being and seeing the whole world, and science can be viewed in much the same way. With such insight into hip hop culture and its close alignment with science, Emdin attempts to think of ways to combine hip hop culture with science classroom teaching. Starting with similarities between these two, he notes that observation, a main tenet of the scientific method, is similar to rapping, in that both are a narration pulled from daily life. Students are encouraged to narrate science facts they observe in hip hop style, so that they can listen, learn, and use those facts blended with what they are mostly familiar with in their daily life. In this sense, students do not merely mechanically memorize science facts, but absorb them as part of their daily life. Through this unique musical form students are inspired to share their opinions. Graffiti is also a unique component of hip hop, and the blackboard in the classroom is a fantastic space for teachers and students to create their own graffiti-like ideas and thoughts. In Emdin’s hip hop-centered classroom, genius is defined not merely by test scores, but by the very unique potential of each individual sitting in the classroom. <p>
