            <strong>Title</strong>: Understanding ethnic media : producers, consumers, and societies

<strong>Author</strong> : Matthew D. Matsaganis, Vikki S. Katz, Sandra J. Ball-Rokeach

<strong>Call number:</strong> <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=Understanding+Ethnic+Media">P94.5.M55 M38 2011<strong> </strong></a>

<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

This is the first book to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of how media produced <strong><em>by</em> </strong>ethnic communities, and <strong><em>for</em></strong><em> </em>ethnic communities, affect identity and perceived lines of division between “us” and “others,” as well as how the production and consumption of ethnic media affect the character of the larger media and societal landscapes.

 Integrating key ethnic media studies with original research, this book makes a unique contribution by covering both consumers and producers of ethnic media, as well as the history of ethnic media, its role in ethnic communities, the effect of globalization, and the professional challenges faced by ethnic media journalists. A compelling discussion on the future of ethnic media concludes the book and points the way toward further research.
