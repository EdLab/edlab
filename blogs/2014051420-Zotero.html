<p>If you are writing a dissertation, scholarly article or just want to keep track of a wide range of bibliographical resources, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is for you. The interesting name, great interface, and clear, easy-to-integrate system makes this software a winner. Zotero helps manage citations and create bibliographies, and it can support print, online, PDF, and other types of publications. Its features include web browser compatibility, online synching, and word processor integration.</p>

<p>Developed by the Center for History and New Media of George Mason University, Zotero was first released in October 2006. Items are organized through a drag-and-drop interface, and can be searched. Zotero works on mobile devices and it can even be used to annotate PDFs. The program also supports 30 different languages.</p>  

<p>Zotero has received funding support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, as well as user donations. Zotero can create citations and bibliographies in APA, Chicago Manual of Style, and other popular standardized formats.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Zotero is free and an excellent resource. It works seamlessly in word processing systems.  It is easy to use and compatible with a wide range of programs and browsers. Its integration with phone and web browsers makes it useful for storing nontraditional e-resources (i.e., blog sites, videos, etc). Its ability to synchronize resources across multiple systems is also a benefit for users that split research between the home and office and who use multiple devices, such as cell phones, laptops, and iPads. It can also synchronize with other similar programs, like Evernote. Its inter-compatibility with other resources makes it a promising choice. </p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>It seems to be an all around winner,  but it does have some bugs on Chrome and Safari. It also has trouble grabbing all the necessary data from some journals, and free accounts only offer 100MB of storage.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Zotero offers a friendly interface, multiple reference styles, and excellent compatibility. It is good system for users aggregating resources for research. Users that plan to amass a huge number of resources and maintain them over a number of years may want to look into other programs unless they are willing to pay for the extra storage. But, all in all, Zotero is a great way to keep track of references on the go and in multiple locations. </p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Zotero is worth downloading if you are a student or a researcher.</p>
