          <p>
            In connection with the current research around the Adaptive Learning Project, Jess and I have been thinking about a potential science learning environment. Before we go into the details of the tool, we have a couple of questions and thoughts about adaptive learning tools and the type of learning they promote. These questions, of course, take the idea of adaptive learning to the extreme but we think they are worth considering.
<li> What is the goal of the ideally created adaptive learning tool? Will it adjust the content so every user learns at his/her own pace and comfort level?
<li> If students become reliant on completely customized learning environments, will this hinder their ability to solve real-world problems? Think of Spiro's (1998) discussion of ill-structured, real-world problems: when learners attempt to apply strategies for understanding well-structured problems to ill-structured domains, they tend to make errors of oversimplification and overgeneralizations.
<li>How can we structure an adaptive learning tool to promote cognitive flexibility? Since real problems and issues do not tailor themselves to the learner,  is it possible to create an adaptive tool that is intended to <u>teach the learner how to adapt</u> to complex, dynamic problems similar to those in the real world?</li>
These questions led us to the subject of science (specifically the experimental process) as a focus for a new tool. The experimental process is taught as a fixed-path procedure in the classroom that does not function in the real world. Even if the teacher tailors the pacing and content of the lesson, the ultimate result of this "adaptive instruction" is a limited understanding of the real-world application of experimentation. We would like to explore the potential of a simulation to present students with changing conditions and ill-structured problems to teach them how to develop strategies for experimental design and execution in the real world. Thoughts?
