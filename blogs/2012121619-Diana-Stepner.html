In addition to heading up Pearsonâ€™s Future Technologies team, Diana Stepner is an advocate for APIs and open collaboration, especially in relation to education.  Beyond a focus on innovation and exploring new platforms, Stepner's team has also built collaborative tools for the classroom.We connected with Diana Stepner to learn more about her past and future work. Check out the interview below.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NLT INTERVIEW</b>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory/background affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I was a Communications major at UC San Diego. I took a course where we went to a local elementary school and helped the children use instant messenger to communicate with similar aged students in Russia.  It was amazing to see how the kids had zero barriers. They simply chatted away happily and shared their interests, activities, and updates. After that experience, I continually looked for ways to weave technology into my studies - both undergrad and graduate. 

Then while working at a start-up, it hit home how a poorly designed UI could negatively impact a person's experience with technology. This insight combined with my prior interest in how people can use technology to communicate (and the flip - how technology influences how we communicate) ultimately led me to return to school and obtain a degree in human computer interaction. 

Subsequently, in my work, I always look for ways to improve the user experience. I still think one of the most valuable experiences is being able to observe individuals using a product.  And, I continue to be fascinated by how technology can unite people regardless of distance. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The first part of my career was spent in customer relationship management, usually on the agency and professional services side. I enjoyed digging into the data to see what interesting facets could be discovered about customers. Ultimately the insights were shared with clients whose data we were analysing. Slicing and dicing the data in different ways required working developers who built the tools we used. I enjoyed acting as interpreter between the business world of our clients and technical speak of the developers.  Since then all my roles have included this business + technical mix.

I believe my inclination to naturally toggle back and forth between business and technical comes from growing up in Silicon Valley. You were always surrounded by start-ups as well as large companies exploring unchartered digital territories. Combining all these facets together, being in Product Management - where you are focusing on the customer, looking for global nuances, continually working with developers, and defining the future roadmap - really appealed to me.  I also enjoyed the variety of working at a digital agency, across multiple accounts, and helping clients see the potential of emerging technologies.

My current work in Future Technologies at Pearson enables me to leverage all of these experiences - translating between business and technical worlds, working across multiple parts of the business, interpreting customer needs into future-facing products, and exploring the globe from a digital perspective. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> With digital devices and experiences being part of everyday life, it's only natural that technology impacts how people learn.  And, as digital natives look back upon their education as well as envision the opportunities for their children, they do so with the mindset of one used to the rapid rate of change that digital provides. 

The Future Technologies team works with the business to explore new technologies in a similar rapid style.  We use a three month research, design, development approach which enables Pearson to continually obtain lessons learned, creative assets, and code.  Being able to quickly explore new technologies means the company can constantly evaluate how to best shape the learning landscape and better enable learners everywhere. 
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The presence of digital will become increasingly invisible.  It will be taken for granted that experiences will incorporate digital and access will be constant. As a result, companies will return to focusing on the content - specifically quality content, especially in learning - instead of the delivery mechanism. 

In addition the power of the community has raised the importance of contributing, both from an individual and a corporate perspective. As it becomes easier and cheaper for one to have a voice, value will increasingly be placed on sharing knowledge that truly enables learning. 

Individuals will also increasingly look to solutions which incorporate elements of personalisation - methods to filter through the ever increasing rush of digital bytes. The ones that stand out shall enable creativity, likely doing so through a sense of fun. They will appear more relevant given their perceived awareness of the context in which they are being used.
<p>
<b>Question</b> What are you currently working on  and what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We're looking into ways to cut through the digital deluge of information. Helping to identify and raise up the most important elements of insight, at the right time and in the proper context. 

In addition, embracing the trends mentioned above, enabling more ways for community contributions and adding 'fun'  into learning are also areas we are exploring.
