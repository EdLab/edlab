<p>The <a href="http://colarapp.com/">ColAR</a> app transforms a printable 2D coloring page into an animated 3D image after users add their unique artistic touch. Print one of the coloring pages provided on their website, color it normally with pens, markers, or crayons, and then use the camera on your mobile device to upload it into the app. The image you colored is then rendered in 3D animation and displayed on the screen.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>ColAR's augmented reality is intuitive to children and could potentially deepen their coloring experiences. There are a wide range of coloring pages to choose from including animals, holidays, people, and daily objects. Some of them are free and the rest are available at a reasonable cost. New images are always being developed. Users can zoom in and out and view the animation from any angle. In the animation, sound effects and interactive options are included; most importantly, users’ artistic creations are fully displayed. The app runs on both Apple and Android mobile devices and is available in five languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>At this point, users can only choose the coloring pages provided by the developers. The creative potential of this app would be enhanced if users could draw and color their own images. The app occasionally fails to recognize the image due to reasons such as lighting or the position of the camera. Though mobile devices are now more common in schools, some classrooms may not be able to provide all students a full experience either due to a high student-device ratio or a lack of projection facility to showcase students’ work in front of a group.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> ColAR can be incorporated in STEAM curricula. For instance, students can build stories around the animation. The images currently contain some content that could be used in science courses, but the ability to create coloring sheets could make this a powerful visual strategy for early science classrooms. With the rise of augmented reality in the classroom, apps like ColAR could serve as an inspiration for the further development of exciting technology enhancements to elementary school lessons. </p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>ColAR enables children to create magical drawings. </p>
