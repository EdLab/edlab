            Kate posted <a href=”http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/9726"target="_blank”>earlier</a> on yesterday's Meetup @Microsoft about the #EdTechNYC Meetup we attended with Jo and Thanh. 

I just wanted to add some thoughts, including how I appreciated the participation of a local school administrator who provided some valuable insight on how technology is effectively integrated. There's a need for more educators and administrators at tech meetups to keep entrepreneurs focused on tools that can be practically implemented.

<b>Limitations on Hardware</b>
Issues like student safety (physical and online), privacy, and parental controls aren't taken into consideration by startups often enough. For example, a significant barrier to integrating tablets into curriculum is that some schools won't allow students to take them home out of fear they'll become targets for assault and theft. This school policy affects whether the app should be primarily used in the classroom or at home. 

<b>Need for Collaboration</b>
In addition, educators often emphasize how entrepreneurs underestimate their free-time and willingness to experiment with new apps. In a learning environment that increasingly dictates what they must teach to, educators rarely have mental energy to invest in establishing, administering, and maintaining new routines for apps that may not even be effective. Unless tools are created in collaboration with teachers from the beginning, they run the risk of being irrelevant. 

I hope to see more venues for teachers and entrepreneurs to work together and am interested in how LaunchPad continues to develop. I'm also interested in seeing more Meetup Panels with contentious exchanges between teachers and corporate representatives!
