            As you all know we are striving to create applications for the education sector which would improve the overall user experience. Recently some of us here at the Development & Research thought of developing an "Author Feedback Tool". This tool will help in reducing the turnaround time when the author submits an article for evaluation and when his article gets published. Initially we are targeting it for tcrecord.org and then potentially to other domains. 

We believe the tool will be useful in giving the author an almost-instant recommendation about the article they have written and how it would fare in getting accepted with articles which has already been published. It will suggest areas of further improvement in their article which in turn will increase its acceptance chances.


Features of the tool:-

(1) <b>Auto-Summarization</b>:- 
The tool will create an "intelligent and automatic summary" of the paper. Our current approach 
is to use the "cut-and-paste" approach for summarizing the article. It's a two-step procedure
where we first "extract" important phrases/sentences from the article and in the second step we perform
"revision" operations like "sentence reduction" and "sentence combination" on the extracted sentences 
to generate a summary of the article.

(2)<b> Number of words and Number of pages</b>:-
It will compare the "number of pages and words" in this article with the articles which have already been accepted and give a chart with the percentile as to where the user's article stand among them. 

(3) <b>"Word-cloud"</b>:-
Generate a word cloud that shows words and key terms which occurred most frequently with their respective counts in the article

(4) <b>Structure of the article</b>:-
An outline of the article containing the main headings and their subheadings.

(5) <b>Recommend articles, authors, related literature </b>
Based on the word cloud and the summary, the tool will also have a feature of recommending other highly related/similar "articles"
or work of other "authors" and useful references that the author (has not yet included in his reference list) can include in his/her article.

(6) <b>Category</b>:-
Recommend the category to which the article belongs more automatically. Example, the article - "Trends in the use of Computers for Education" may belong to any of the categories like "computer" or "education"

(7) <b>Trends</b>:-
Look for trends among successfully accepted and rejected articles 

We are currently in the planning stage of the project and are open to any other potential ideas /suggestions you have for the project. Please feel free to step into the shoes of an author and imagine all the things you can think of, which can help you in better writing the article. We appreciate your comments and would be happy to make them a part of the Author Feedback tool.

Looking forward to hearing ideas from all of you.
