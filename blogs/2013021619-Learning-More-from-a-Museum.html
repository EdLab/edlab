<b>Title: </b>Deepening Students’ Scientific Inquiry Skills During a Science Museum Field Trip
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Joshua P. Gutwill & Sue Allen
<p>
<b>Research Questions:</b> Stagnant test scores in the face of rapid technological change have led to a renewed focus on science education.  Although field trips to science museums would seem to be a natural complement to this effort, the different teaching strategies and methods of museums as opposed to the traditional school raise some questions as to how the two institutions might cooperate. Too often students (and educators) treat such field trips as a break from, rather than an addition to, their learning program.<p>
<b>Study Design:</b>
In search of a method to strengthen the connection between school-based and informal learning, the research team developed a series of activities, called Inquiry Games, around a museum visit.  One set of activities was highly collaborative, the other more individualistic.  They then tried out the activity sets on students at a field trip to a science museum, with an eye both to how students behaved in the museum and to what they came away with afterwards.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
The study found that, although both activity sets resulted in greater student engagement and knowledge transfer, the more collaborative activity was more successful in both domains. A concurrent experiment, where they offered students a pre-visit lesson on the science involved but otherwise didn’t interfere with their museum activities, did not result in any measurable effect, indicating that "prior mediation" is not particularly helpful in creating a better museum experience. Apart from increased engagement during the trip, students using the new activities also indicated, in post-visit interviews, that they had found more occasions to use the methods they had learned during the trip.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward: </b>
This study offers a fairly clear path towards better integrating outside activities with formal classroom education.  With the addition of some simple group activities, designed to elicit student interest and engagement, educators can significantly increase the learning potential of field trips that often go to waste.  Much of these gains involve providing students with a scaffold for their learning, in effect, creating a structure for the museum’s exhibits to meet them halfway. This entails finding ways to elicit student interest and engagement, rather than increasing the volume of information they are expected to digest.  This lesson can be extended towards any of the disparate learning opportunities of everyday life that have been left by the wayside.
