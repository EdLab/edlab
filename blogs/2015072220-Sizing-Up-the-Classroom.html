<p>This study looks at the ways in which Connected Classroom Technology (CCT), specifically the digital assessment tool TI-Navigator, can support the goals of formative assessment by facilitating data collection and interpretation. Four middle and high school science teachers (who had found the tool easy to use and enjoyed using it) were selected to participate in this study. Throughout the year, classroom visits and interviews were conducted with these teachers and their students.</p>

<p>CCT was found to be useful on many different levels. Students were more engaged and motivated to learn science concepts when the quiz feature in CCT was used. Teachers were able to gather and display their studentsâ€™ responses quickly, which resulted in more meaningful classroom discussion. It helped students to understand their own progress in terms of comprehension, which in turn helped the teacher. CCT rapidly processed student data for the teachers, giving them more time to prepare and a better understanding of student progress for lesson planning.</p>

<p>This study points out that in the future more professional development for teachers will be needed so they can consistently and effectively make use of assessment devices like CCT. There is also a need for further research to include more subject areas and grade levels. Further research could also explore comparisons between digital and non-digital assessment strategies to gain a more complete picture of how formative assessment strategies can improve learning outcomes going forward.</p>
