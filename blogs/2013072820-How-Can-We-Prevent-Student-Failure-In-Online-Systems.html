<p><b>Title:</b> Wheel-Spinning: Students Who Fail to Master a Skill (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph E. Beck & Yue Gong</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39112-5_44.pdf">The 16th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
How can we identify and help students before they fail in online learning systems?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Achieving skill mastery is an essential goal of learning, but the reasons students sometimes fail to achieve mastery are complex. In online learning environments, students sometimes lack the knowledge to solve problems and reach the limits of built-in instruction. This is partly why teacher supervision and intervention are still important elements in digital learning. <a href="http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39112-5_44.pdf">Wheel-Spinning: Students Who Fail to Master a Skill</a> investigated this learning loop, which is a tremendous source of frustration for students in online learning environments. The authors called the state of struggling to learn a topic without achieving mastery "wheel-spinning." Students in this loop, much like a car in mud or snow, worked hard at assigned tasks, but did not achieve learning gains.</p>

<p>In their study, the authors investigated two intelligent tutoring systems: <a href="https://www.assistments.org/">ASSISTments</a> and <a href="http://www.carnegielearning.com/specs/cognitive-tutor-overview/">Cognitive Algebra Tutor</a>. After three sessions in these systems, students began to show skill mastery and the percentage gradually rose as students completed up to ten sessions. After ten sessions, the percentage of successful students stopped increasing. This indicates that a group of students, despite completing many sessions, continued to fail to reach mastery. The authors constructed a model to predict whether students would achieve mastery or become stuck in the wheel-spin. The data was collected from online use of the systems and included 131,909 problems solved by 5,026 students. The authors also collected behavioral data from the systems, including response time, reliance on hints, and use that indicated guessing.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors were able to predict wheel-spinning accurately after only two completed problems. They found that students who initially took more time than average to answer a question had a greater chance of success. The authors also found a relationship between students who were prone to wheel-spinning and those who attempted to game the system, but they were not sure whether these students were more prone to excessive hint-seeking because they did not understand the material or if the act of hint-seeking distracted students from real learning. The authors thought that hint-seeking and gaming could be discouraged through the use of alternative instruction paths and policies that penalize unnecessary hinting.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This research highlights some important considerations in online learning environments. Digital learning systems should seek to help students avoid wheel-spinning because it is often a state of frustration for students. The research conducted for this study suggests that identification of students prone to wheel-spinning is possible quite early in game play. Once this failure behavior is recognized by the system, alternative learning paths should be suggested. This study focused on intelligent tutoring systems, but all adaptive systems could benefit from early failure identification and measures to help students avoid wheel-spinning.</p>
