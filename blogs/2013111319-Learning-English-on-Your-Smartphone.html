<b>Title:</b> Effects of Video Caption Modes on English Listening Comprehension and Vocabulary Acquisition Using Handheld Devices
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Ching-Kun Hsu, Gwo-Jen Hwang, Yu-Tzu Chang, & Chih-Kai Chang
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.ifets.info/journals/16_1/35.pdf">Educational Technology and Society</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
The explosive popularity of smartphones and mobile devices, particularly with younger age groups, makes them a natural platform for learning. In particular, video can be a useful tool for language learning, provided that the video provides enough resources, in the form of captions, to allow the learner to get a sense of what is being said. Although previous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of such video, there is little work on how a mobile platform will affect its usage.
<p>
For this study, the authors took three classes of fifth grade English learners from an elementary school in Taiwan, and had each class undergo a month-long video instruction unit through dedicated PDA devices. Two classes were provided videos with English captions and Chinese subtitles, while the last control class had to go without any aid.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Students were tested on English mastery before, during after the unit, and also filled out a questionnaire on their experience with the PDAs. Starting from similar bases of English-language mastery, the experimental groups saw gains in vocabulary acquisition but not in listening comprehension. Interestingly, it was the students in particular who preferred a visual style of learning who saw significantly greater gains in the experimental groups. All of the students enjoyed the ease of the mobile devices.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The short test period and small samples urge caution in interpreting the results of the study. It is quite reasonable to assume that students will enjoy working with mobile video more than a traditional classroom lesson, but it is less clear that, implemented in the real world, with real world distractions, such a learning program will be successful.
