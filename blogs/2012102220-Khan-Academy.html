<p><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">The Khan Academy</a> is well-known for being a non-profit website that has a repository of over 3,300 video lessons covering subjects such as math, science, computer science, finance, economics, and test prep. Perhaps less well known is that the Khan Academy also provides users with the ability to practice what they have learned in the video lessons. The kind of practice depends on the subject; for example, math and science lessons have multiple choice questions while the computer science lessons give users a space to practice some coding similar to Codeacademy. Another feature of the website is that it tracks a user's learning progress through a user profile page, providing basic statistics on the videos users have watched and the exercises users have attempted.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b><br>The Khan Academy does provide video lessons for many topics with a bit more emphasis on math and science and related subjects. Some might question the effectiveness of learning from the videos, but there are some key elements that keep learners engaged and absorbing the information. The videos are usually around 5-10 minutes and founder/narrator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_(educator)">Salman Khan</a> explains the concepts in common language rather than the traditional "textbook" style.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b><br>The evolving assessment section of the Khan Academy is probably its least complete feature at this point.  Tests are only available for math. When it comes to other subjects such as science, finance, economics and test prep, there is no type of assessment or test to be found.  It’s surprising to see that science does not get the same treatment, especially physics since it heavily involves math. Users interested in more ambitious approaches for checking their understanding will have to look elsewhere.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>The Khan Academy has received much attention recently especially when the site <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Grants-2011/Pages/Khan-Academy-Inc-OPP1039840.aspx">secured funding</a> from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This year the founder of the site Salman Kahn was a winner of <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/site/about-us/mcgraw-prize">the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Prize in Education</a> and was named a "game changer" in education. With the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the site has grown from video lessons only to adding features such as assessments and a progress report for every user. The Khan Academy seems to be transforming in something more than just a collection of video lessons.  This is an interesting development to be sure, but let’s hope that this does not deter the Khan Academy from doing what it does best: continuing to grow their collection of short informative video lessons that do not bore the general public. While the assessment and progress reports are useful features, the video lessons are the special sauce of the Khan Academy.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b><br>  The Khan Academy lets users watch and learn.</p>
