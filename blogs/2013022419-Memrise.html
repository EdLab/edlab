<p><a href="http://www.memrise.com/home/">Memrise</a> is a platform that helps users learn languages, math, the arts, and other topics through mnemonic devices, gamification, and crowdsourcing. The Memrise learning method works to implant a short term memory and help it grow to a long term memory through periodic practice. For every small piece of learning content there is accompanying media such as text, images, and audio. These media items are called mems, and they are intended to help make the content stick in the learner’s memory. These mems are crowd-created by other Memrise users forming a learning community within the platform. After users learn a few concepts the system tests them to help them remember a piece of information for the long term. After a certain amount of time users are reminded that they can re-test themselves on what they have learned.</p> 

<p>The CEO and co-founder of Memrise, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Cooke_(author)">Ed Cooke</a>, has a wealth of experience in the subject of memorization techniques. Ed Cooke is a <a href="http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/grandmasters.php">Grand Master of Memory</a> and is the author of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Remember-Learn-Stuff-Thought-ebook/dp/B002RI9GUI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1355843629&sr=8-2&keywords=remember+remember"><i>Remember, Remember: Learn the Stuff You Thought You Never Could</i></a>, a book on memorization techniques developed from many years of researching, writing, and teaching about the subject.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Crowdsourcing is very beneficial for increasing the diversity and volume of content; learning concept groups on Memrise have multiple mems for learning each concept and users can upvote the mem that was the most useful for them. There are also plenty of gamification incentives for users to keep coming back to Memrise. Learner receive points for answering questions correctly. The more points earned, the higher users rise on the leaderboard for the course. The system is also diligent about reminding learners to take refresher tests. After completing a test for a course emails are sent out within a few hours to remind students of refresher content.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some mems added by users are not helpful when learning a concept. For example, a text mem for learning multiplication is not as effective as a visual mem. The downside of crowdsourcing mems is that the content varies in quality, but a strong community element may remedy this problem in time by upvoting well-wrought mems to the top of search results.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>While other online learning platforms focus on learning content quickly Memrise places more emphasis on learning well and securing knowledge in the long term. The platform compares learning facts to tending to a garden, emphasizing that learning needs to be tended to daily if it is to flourish. Every course in the system is represented by a virtual flower that grows or withers depending on how often users are active in the course. This learning avatar provides an emotional attachment that encourages users to keep coming back to the platform and refreshing the material. Memrise keeps learners engaged with fun mnemonic devices and keeps them coming back for more learning.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Memrise helps plant the seeds of learning (or at least memory) and helps them grow for the long term.</p>
