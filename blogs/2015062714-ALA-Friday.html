            After registration, I scoped out the buildings and <a href="http://alaac15.ala.org/general-exhibits-info">exhibit halls</a> so I’d have an idea where to go for all of my upcoming sessions. The conference is spread out between 4-5 buildings within a block or two of each other, so I wanted to make sure I knew the lay of the land! I attended quite a few poster sessions and a literacy event at GitHub, so read on for my detailed report!

<!--break-->
My first event was a poster session called <B>Assessment in Action: Year Two Project Posters</b>, which presented the results of several ACRL-sponsored, 14-month assessment projects at community colleges, colleges and universities. The projects examined the impact of the library (instruction, reference, collections, space, etc.) on student success and learning outcomes.

I looked at a lot of posters, and spoke to several researchers from the University of Mississippi, Macalaster College, and Pierce College.

The first Assessment in Action team provided an overview of an interesting investigation of student outcomes when using free textbook-alternatives for an introductory level college course. The research team interviewed faculty, surveyed students, and examined course data to explore the impact of swapping expensive textbooks for free alternatives. The librarians running the study were surprised by some of the findings: first, they had expected to see increased usage for library resources, but professors tended to assign readings and media from free online resources instead; secondly, they discovered no discernible difference in outcomes for textbooks vs. free resources. Still, the findings opened up a number of new research questions that were interesting enough that they received a grant from the Hewlett Foundation to expand the pilot program to a dozen or so public universities and community colleges across Mississippi to further study the impact. They plan to address the first part of their findings by developing more guides and recommendations for library resources ahead of time, so professors are more aware of the library resources that are available. They also hope to tease out the differences in student outcomes across socioeconomic status, since one of the purposes of using free resources is to level the playing field across the economic/income divide. However, the researchers were concerned that the use of free online resources might not have helped bridge the gap, in fact only widened it. Since higher SES students would be more familiar with online information seeking than the lower SES students, who may come from homes without reliable internet access and high schools without enough computers, the upcoming expansion program plans to address income inequality in more detail.

I also spoke to librarians from the University of Mississippi Medical Center, who investigated the use of collaborative library space to influence student perceptions of interprofessionalism in medical education. The project incorporated student groups representing different programs of study who had undergone Basic Life Support (BLS) training; these interprofessional student focus groups were hosted in the library's Collaborative Learning Center with a clinician/library faculty-led discussion on BLS and interprofessionalism. The dual purpose was to determine if students retain more knowledge in an interprofessional education setting, and to assess student opinions on interprofessionalism. The findings suggested that yes, hosting focus groups in collaborative spaces did lead to better knowledge retention and prepared students for entering the medical professional sphere. I thought this poster was interesting mostly because the research targeted a specific graduate audience, much like our own graduate school of education, and the librarians focused on collaborative use of space, which is something that we are also continually pushing and experimenting with in our own library.

Both Macalaster College and Pierce College had examined the impact of library instruction “one-shots” on student research skills and learning. One shot library instructions sessions are common in information literacy programs: they are essentially a one-time introduction to the library and an overview of its resources for students; they usually take place in an introductory or general requirement course.

Macalester College librarians identified and selected senior capstone courses in each Discipline (Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and Interdisciplinary Studies) and evaluated student work for evidence of three information literacy skills: attribution, evaluation of sources, and communication of evidence. The results indicated that students who received more instruction from librarians through class sessions or research consultations performed better in these areas than students who attended fewer library instruction classes or individual research consultations

The librarians at Pierce presented <b>More One-Shots? Prune Them Back? Or Plow Them Under?: Evaluating the Impact of Library One-Shot Instruction on Students' Success in Subsequent Courses</b>, which  examined the long-term effects of "one-shot" library instruction. The study asked whether one-shot sessions have a measureable impact on student success indicators (such as end-of-course grades) in subsequent courses. Their research methods included examination of student grades based on number of one-shots attended in a freshman composition course, analysis of student papers, and a survey of students' perceptions of the usefulness of strategies learned in one-shot sessions and their application to a subsequent research project. The findings were interesting: it seems like it takes four “one-shots” to make a statistically-significant impact on student learning, and student perceptions on the usefulness is strongly correlated with the number of sessions they attended.

Next up was the <b>Emerging Leaders</b> poster session! It was pretty crowded: not all of the posters were very readable from more than a foot away, and I only spoke to one group specifically. They were presenting a redesign project for the <a href="http://www.apalaweb.org/">Apala website</a>, and they talked about the information architecture of the site and their iterative design process. I couldn't tell if this was more of a class project or an actual redesign, but they had ipads out to show side by side comparisons, and they had a steady stream of people at the poster.

Finally, I met up with Alex, Dana, and Laura and we headed to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/30/fact-sheet-spreading-joy-reading-more-children-and-young-adults">a literacy event</a> and networking session sponsored by GitHub, DPLA, and NYPL at GitHub HQ!

The event theme (part of the push to spread the joy of reading to more people) was “Recovering the Classics,” and they had a lot of beautiful cover art on display. If anyone wants to get involved, <a href="http://thecreativeactionnetwork.com/contribute/recovering-the-classics/">the specs are available online</a>! 

I’m covering many more events and sessions on Saturday, so stay tuned!
