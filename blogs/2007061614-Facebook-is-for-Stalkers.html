            I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a technologically savvy person. The most I can do with html is the rich text mode featured on blogs and something like < bold >. I can't tell you what PERL is (it's a programming language, right?), and even if you left me stranded on a desert island with programming and how-to system configuration books, I still wouldn't be able to graduate from Windows XP to something like, oh let's say, LINUX. I can however, tell you a thing or two about the miniature social microcosms of the interweb and what's going on with the latest trends in the cyber world. And from what I've been seeing lately, I don't like it. 

Everyone is mostlikelyprobably (if not, you should be) familiar with <a href =http://www.facebook.com> Facebook</a> at this point, so there's no need for the niceties. I hate to be rude to the fbook after all we've been through, but its constantly evolving creepiness gives Darwin and his finches a run for their money.  

Back when I was a lowly pre-frosh in the summer of '05, my <a href= http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/250> roommate</a> created my fbook account for me: 1) you were considered a social pariah if you didn't have an account (even more so now), and 2) she felt like a loser because she showed up as having no roommate, which in turn, made her abnormal as well. That was the beginning of a complicated relationship. (Between fbook and I, not the roommate)

Sure, fbook has its uses, like providing hours of entertaining procrastination as you linked your girlfriends a particularly unflattering picture of that Annoying Girl from Humanities Lecture (don't lie to me folks, I know you do it too) and an even uglier one of her boyfriend, or the excitement of finding the profiles of that Awkward Couple that Furiously Snogs in the Dining Hall. Maybe you've even checked out those pictures of your professor on his summer vacation with his family in Greece and were weirded out because not only does he has a life outside the classroom, but his seven-year-old daughter looks uncannily like him, knobby knees and all. Any contact that you had with a person that you didn't personally know was acceptable; most likely you were in the same lecture and they desperately needed someone's notes, or you were “friending” that person because you vaguely remember meeting them and having an awesome drunken heart-to-heart at last night's party. Just good, clean fun that was fbook during its childhood. Intimacy without the actual interaction. 

Enter fbook's adolescence. The <a href=http://bu.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2229956361> newsfeed</a> appeared out of the blue <a href=http://bu.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2208588274> one day</a>, like a big, fat zit. Hell broke loose - within 24 hours, students from all across the nation were creating protest groups (membership rose exponentially by the refreshing of the page), emailing Mark Zuckerberg and his minions to undoubtedly curse them and their spawn to the depths of hell, and petitioning administration to take it down. Hell, even <a href=http://www.time.com>TIME</a> felt obligated to <a href=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1532225,00.html> write about it</a>. 

We received extended “privacy” settings, but the newsfeed stayed. Some people liked it, others got used to it, still others are disgruntled by it, claiming that it crimped their “pimping”. When high school students and even non-students got the OK to create accounts, there was barely a ripple. By that point, it was an acknowledged fact that fbook had stolen our souls; the anti-minifeed fervor died down and the minifeed was eventually justified — after all, it was just <a href=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stalking> stalking</a>.

True to its nature, the newsfeed really does report everything you do (yes, even when you <a href=http://bu.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2207838475> poo</a>), you just learn to either take the time to read it (which is pointless cause you'll see the same thing when you look at updated friends) or to let your eyes glaze over it. One uneventful day, however, I paid attention to it, and was startled by what I saw. 

I had logged on to access whatever silly comment my fbook wife had left me when something ominous looking caught my eye on top of my newsfeed. It was a little green icon with a dinosaur footprint and next to it read: “Update: 7 of your friends added the <a href=http://vt.facebook.com/apps/application.php?api_key=b9b11d46145f85b498e70669fb54d3f0>TRAKZOR</a>   application.”

Anyone who's been around on the blogosphere or has common sense can understand the nature of the application just by the “TRAK” in its name, but I still wanted to verify if my eyes had deceived me. In cold sweaty panic, I rushed to see what this fiendish thing entailed.

It was exactly as I feared. “Trakzor” is an application that logs a summary of who browses your page, what they look at and how many times they looked at it throughout the day. It's a rap sheet that lets all see which peeping tom has been looking through your profile, notes, pictures, groups, and friends, and shames them. 

Trackers aren't new; they've been around as long as social networking sites; <a href=http://www.xanga.com>Xangas</a> have their xtrackers, <a href=http://www.myspace.com>Myspace</a> has them, and I'm pretty sure that other sites such as Cyworld has them as well. It shouldn't have been a shock then, to see that someone thought it'd be useful to have one for fbook (or more like, it was about time). Students had been comparing fbook to Myspace, wanting features that would make it Myspace-esque. It's also a known fact that students “stalk” each other through fbook. What was the harm in acknowledging that we're a bunch of creeps with a lot of time on our hands? Everything apparently. 

After reading the lengthy explanation of how the damn thing worked, I scrolled down to view user comments and discussion threads. Not a single one was positive; everyone on the wall was lambasting the creator for trying to recreate fbook, which was “already creepy as it is,” into Myspace. Facebook, the students were saying, had gone too far this time, and it needed to take this off — right now. There was stalking, and then there was counter-stalking. Counter-stalking just isn't cool. 

I, personally, frankly, hate how fbook will log all of your petty activities throughout the day whenever you edit or change something, but it's harmless enough; some people have defended the minifeed's purpose by saying that it saves time (but since when do you log onto facebook to “save time” in the first place?). 

But to know that you are being watched, that your private browsing will be monitored, noted, and posted for an entire web community to publicly view, feels like a gross violation. Of what, there may not be a legal term for it, but it's there.

With Facebook as a social networking community, and the Internet being a public forum, facebook users cannot expect to never be viewed. If you post it, people will see it — it's a given. With this in mind, users shouldn't make a fuss about their profiles being subject to the curiosity of strangers, who might stop by to take a quick glance. It's nothing personal, sometimes they think you're hot, sometimes they wanna check out what kind of music you're into or what political party you support - mere curiosity. Who said that you were the center of the universe anyway? 

But yes, you're completely justified if you want to know who possibly browsed through your profile if it flatters you that much. After all, you're probably curious about them as well. It's reasonable to want to know who's been looking at you without you knowing. But at what cost are you willing to compromise your user privacy and anonymity to satisfy your narcisstic self-flattery? This may be just an opinion of mine, but I'd rather not know if that good looking fellow from math lecture has been looking through my photo albums if it'll mean that I can browse through not just fbook, but the web without worry that I'm being tracked wherever I go. I do believe that's what privacy entails, right? 

Trakzor is a fiendishly deceptive contraption - I had raised the alarm amongst friends but when they tried to search it on fbook they couldn't find it. I labored under a happy misunderstanding that it had been taken off. I was wrong. It had disappeared off the minifeed but was still in existence. There is still hope; not only can you block Trakzor, but you can also join the <a href=http://bu.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2389335937&topic=2943>petition</a>   to have it removed as well.
