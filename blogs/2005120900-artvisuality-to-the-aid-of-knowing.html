            ==excerpts from notes===

The concern over the value of the ‘image' in scholarly practices goes beyond visual disciplines.  In 1531, Thomas Elliot recommended courses in drawing to educators as verbal dispute was being abandoned in favor of visual demonstrations.   Two hundred years later,in the eighteen century, the reign of words seemed to be ending as Fontenelle noted that ‘things' were now in demand (Einsenstein, 1979). Leaping towards 1991 to locate the same concern, Mark Taylor in “Moment of Complexityâ€? voices the importance of teaching and writing with images as well as words. Stephen J. Gould recognizes in his “lawâ€? the value of visuals at any professional meeting. Benoit Mandelbrot (2003) acknowledges the effectiveness of visuality in Mathematics Education to the highly visual aspect this geometry.  "The observation of visual fractal expressions reveal some of the underlying mathematics of forbiddingly difficult conjecture." Brian Greene's String Theory (1999) is a result of a personal aesthetic drive to SEE how things work and generate new ways of thinking about things. 

The possibilities created by the interplay of words and images are generated after the text has been written.  If visuality, art, design, graphs, etc., is not to be merely illustrative, it must be integrated into the formation of the argument from the beginning of the process.  By throwing things together in a research assemblage -interplay of the verbal, visual and auditory- things that are usually held apart provide unexpected insight through novel interactions to engage the ‘reader' in creative interactivity (Taylor, 2001).

Today, the adhesion to written manuals and protocols in art related research has degraded the heterogeneity of research into the homogeneity of words and power point presentations.  Visual documentation has become a well accepted form of data collection but the end result of its analysis seem to revert to Gutenberg's hegemony of type,  as the sole distributor of knowledge and the glorification of the print bound document.

While the construction of linear written arguments, with endless references, still is incomprehensible to the man on the street, the visuality of communication may reach the ‘untutored' ones at the same time it provides more depth into the process of the event.  Regardless of the time lines for acceptance of a visual argument in academia, today's culture is saturated with information that goes beyond the written word and may finally cause its inclusion as self referential statements of actual events, not an “understandingâ€? of the pre-fabricated circumstances that populate the current research paradigm in my discipline and probably across the institution.
