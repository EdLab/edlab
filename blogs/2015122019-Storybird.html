<p><a href="https://storybird.com">Storybird</a> is a publishing platform for visual storytelling, creating a community of readers, writers, and artists. Users can discover and write poetry, picture books, and longform stories inspired by the professional illustrations curated by Storybird. They can connect with other writers, follow their favorite artists, add favorite finds to their bookshelves, and print their work. According to Storybird, hundreds of thousands of K–12 classrooms around the world are using the platform.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Storybird develops its services with the classroom in mind, as users can filter published stories and artwork by age and topic. Teachers can also easily create a free account and have an educator dashboard in Storyboard Studio for a private classroom community. Teachers can develop assignments or use Storybird’s suggestions, which then show up on student dashboards, as well as comment on, give awards to, and grade student work. </p>

The stunning array of illustrations—ranging from ethereal floating forests to boldly graphic chimeras—is sure to get creative juices flowing for both the most reticent and wildly imaginative writers. Imagine teaching mood by writing a poem for an image of a sleek train pulling out of a barely lit station at night, or of a summer scene of swimmers splashing in a pool. The compelling animals and people offer a chance for character development, and the option of sequencing illustrations offers an access point for students to learn about plot development. Educators can also use the illustrations to teach visual and textual analysis by simply asking students: What in the picture gave you the inspiration for that? Beyond learning about literary elements, Storybird also offers a chance for students to learn about the publishing process and feel the pride of a polished completed product. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Storybird is a flexible dashboard that can meet the needs of different classrooms, there are some limitations. The creative illustrations do not entirely prevent writer’s block, and teachers will want to prepare for that possibility. Storybird does not teach the writing process, but could provide sample prompts such as "What might this character be thinking?" or "Is there a problem in this picture that needs to be solved?" To address writers block in the case of poetry, Storybird provides piles of words, but figuring out what words are in the jumble and how to combine them to create a poem that matches the given artwork can feel a bit like playing a difficult game of Scrabble. Students may be stymied as they consider how to write a poem using "vacation," "punk," and "famous" for a Halloween themed graphic. There is an option to refresh the words, and Storybird argues for the imaginative potential and learning challenge of "creative constraint."</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Storybird is an excellent resource for educators and an exciting opportunity to experience the writing and publishing process for students. It’s visually appealing, allows for adaptive uses, includes a thoughtful set of educator tools, and accounts for privacy concerns. The potential challenges of classroom use—writer’s block and literary elements—can be seen as an opportunity for teachers to show their creativity in this experience.</p>
