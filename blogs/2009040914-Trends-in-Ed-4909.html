            <b>The Bologna Process: Redesigning Higher Ed</b> 

<img src=http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:OZSIx3S2pTZh0M:http://www.cretafarms.com/retail/products/images/bologna.jpg>

<blockquote>
Go to a university catalog and look at the degree requirements for a particular discipline.  It says something like, ‘You take Anthropology 101, then Anthro 207, then you have a choice of Anthro 310, 311, or 312. We require the following courses, and you've got to have 42 credits.' That means absolutely nothing.
- Clifford Adelman, <a href=http://www.ihep.org/>the Institute for Higher Education Policy</a>
</blockquote>

The picture of gourmet Bologna was just to tease out a smile. <a href=http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/hogeronderwijs/bologna/about/>The Bologna Process</a> is actually named after the Italian city where European higher-education authorities agreed to seek an alliance to award degrees based on comparable standards.  

For a decade, 46 countries in Europe have been working to reconstruct their higher ed systems based on issues such as building credit systems that will result in relevant knowledge and work skills, more flexible pathways into and through higher education (thus increase access), and accountability criteria.  In Latin America, 18 countries have also begun their own process. 

So what's on our plate in the US?  Colleges and universities in Indiana, Minnesota, and Utah are starting pilot projects to <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/education/09educ.html?ref=global-home>rethink the qualification framework</a> so that their degree programs reflect the agreed learning standards. 

While there are concerns that too much fine tuning will suppress academic freedom, proponents of this new effort say they plan to focus on standardizing goals for the learned outcome (in terms of knowledge and skill), instead of seeking to standardize the curricula.  

The Process has many areas of focus. For example, the redesigned credit system will seek to grant degrees based primarily on student workload, not faculty contact hours.  Each course is also expected to be assigned a level of challenge so that the combination of workload and level guarantees transfer of credits.

<i>*Bologna is also home to the University of Bologna, the world's oldest degree-granting university that is still in operation.</i> 

<b>iPhone-App-a-Day</b>

<a href=http://www.iphonepacifier.com/>Pacifier1</a> teaches infant shapes, colors, and numbers and features different classical pieces such as background music. Labeled as an educational baby game, this Pacifier-on-your-phone has settings that can adjust to fit the different skill levels of infants and young children.
