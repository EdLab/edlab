EdLab Teambox

This is my long overdue entry describing the EdLab Teambox.  The goal of the EdLab Teambox is to make the work of members of the EdLab widely visible to one another as well as to provide a project management tool to keep activities on track.  

The EdLab Teambox contains a set of ten projects that are used to organize the work of the EdLab and its members.  Each project encompasses a defined area of activity as specified in a project overview in the Pages section of the project.  These are also included here so you can see the entire set of projects and descriptions.

The first three projects below (EdLab: Administration, EdLab: Incubator, and EdLab: Library) are general project areas to organize on-going general operations as well as to provide spaces where new projects can be pitched and developed.  The Incubator Project should be used to develop new projects that fit the EdLab agenda, and the EdLab: Library Project should be used to pitch new initiatives that directly impact the Gottesman Libraries.  

All other projects are related to one of the current three focal projects.  Launch Pad 39B and the New Learning Times are each represented by one Teambox project.  The mSchool is represented by five Teambox projects.  We anticipate that multiple project areas might be created for the focal projects over time as activities come into focus.  At this point we are experimenting a bit to see how to balance the goal of creating reasonably sized project areas against the goal of limiting the overall number or projects to maximize visibility of all activities to everyone in the EdLab.

EdLab: Administration

The EdLab: Administration Project is the location for all activities related to the overall management and operations of the EdLab.  All general matters from resource allocation, personnel recruitment, and skill distributions, to social activities and down to what's for lunch and what kind of coffee we should get will be handled in this project. 

EdLab: Incubator

The EdLab: Incubator Project is the location for all activities related to new project ideas by members of the EdLab. Please use this project area to post materials related to proposals under development. All incubator projects will be discussed at the Tuesday 11 AM EdLab meetings so be sure to contact Hui Soo to get on the agenda for that meeting when your project is ready to be discussed.
EdLab: Library

The EdLab: Library Project is the home base for all activities that involve the EdLab and the Gottesman Libraries. When appropriate, emerging issues will be discussed with the Design, Publishing, and Services team (supervised by Brian Hughes, so be sure to see Brian to get on the agenda for a forthcoming meeting).

LaunchPad 39B

The Launch Pad 39B Project encompasses a set of activities designed to address the challenge of launching new educational products, services, institutions, and infrastructures in ways that allow them to have maximum impact in transforming the education sector. The project will conduct research into the current options for launching new educational initiatives. It will create resources to support educators, researchers, and entrepreneurs in the development of new educational activities. It will also engage those actively involved in early stage activities looking for support.
mSchool

The EdLab: mSchool Project is the location for all issues related to the core infrastructure for all mSchool components, including user management, e-commerce, embedded research, and analytics.

mSchool: EdNode

Ednode is an intelligent recommendation and search tool that enables users of online communities to efficiently query one another for information and support. Ednode seeks to do for person-to-person communication what traditional search engines have done to connect individuals to web content.  The mSchool: EdNode Project is the location for all work to develop the connected knowledge community to support individuals and activities within the mSchool.

mSchool: mPress

The mSchool: mPress Project will create a publishing application integrated within the mSchool framework by building on the work of the Pressible project. Key goals of the project will be to optimize a version of Pressible for a variety of uses within the mSchool learning environment and to integrate user management and analytics within the overall mSchool user management system.

mSchool: Scape

The mSchool: Scape Project is designed to create the flexible blank space that is the starting point for creating learning environments within the mSchool. It is the repository and the jumping off point for all mSchool applications.

mSchool: Vialogues

Vialogues leverages videos for learning by adding group interaction as part of the viewing experience. The mSchool Vialogues Project will work to integrate Vialogues as an application within the mSchool environment. This will include features that facilitate teaching and learning as well as integration with the mSchool user data system and user analytics.

New Learning Times

New Learning Times is the working title for a new EdLab publication dedicated to new ideas for the transformation of the education sector. This publication will feature content that illustrates current developments and future possibilities in education that promise to make learning more accessible, more powerful, and less costly. The New Learning Times Project is the location for all activities to design and develop the New Learning Times as well as those involved in creating the flow of content to be published.
