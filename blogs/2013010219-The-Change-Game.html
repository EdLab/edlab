<p><b>Title:</b> The Change Game: An Experiential Exercise Demonstrating Barriers to Change (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Amy C. Lewis & Mark Grosser
</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> The ability to instigate change is a valuable management skill. Educators in management programs are responsible for teaching leadership skills geared toward change. However, students may not fully comprehend just how difficult it can be at times to work toward change.
<p>
In response to this pedagogical challenge, the authors of <a href=" http://jme.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/02/15/1052562911435474.abstract?rss=1"> The Change Game: An Experiential Exercise Demonstrating Barriers to Change </a> developed the "Change Game," an experiential learning tool that simulates the obstacles associated with leading change. During the 45-minute exercise students are split up into "managers" and "workers." Managers must complete a change task that relies on the cooperation of the workers in order to earn a reward. Built into the simulation are financial incentives for the workers to resist change. The students typically fail to complete their task, which encourages an engaging follow-up discussion on issues related to leading change. Topics that surface typically include effective communication, group interactions, power, and trust.
To explore the effectiveness of the learning exercise, the authors collected quantitative data from a total of 46 students in two undergraduate organizational behavior classes. Students were asked to rate how well they thought the exercise highlighted challenges related to leading change, whether the exercise did a good job of illustrating common mistakes associated with leading change, and if, in general, the students felt they learned anything from the exercise. The authors of the study also analyzed answers to an end-of-the course assignment that asked students to reflect on the most important concepts that they learned throughout the class.
</p>
<p>
<p><b>Findings:</b> 
The results from both surveys suggested a strong consensus among students that the exercise helped highlight challenges related to leading change and that the exercise led to productive and engaging conversations that fostered leadership skills geared toward change. In the end-of-course assignments, a number of students linked important course concepts back to the Change Game exercise, which suggested that it served as an effective learning tool. 
</p>
<p>
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Bringing real-life experiences into the classroom is hard. The Change Game offers an interactive experiential approach, which can be used in a wide-range of classroom contexts. It also seems like an excellent match for a <a href="http://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom/ "> flipped </a> management classroom. The findings of this study suggest that it has a lot of potential in helping students understand the difficulties associated with leading change. In thinking of future directions, a larger-scale study that compares students who participated in the Change Game exercise versus students who didnâ€™t could offer further insights into its effectiveness.
