This is a photo from an interesting article I read about emerging movie theaters that try to give audiences an immersive experience. The article asks the question, "Where do audiences want to spend their money? A new technological experience, or a social experience that will never be exactly the same twice?"  This made me think about ideas for the fourth floor experience.

I'm not saying we should build a pool on the fourth floor (although I hear TC has one of the oldest indoor pools in the country)--- but this article made me think about how we can make our future media center more of an experience. 

For example, asking visitors to interact with technology. "One of the most promising of innovations currently in theaters comes from <a href="http://www.audienceentertainment.com/ ">Audience Entertainment </a> their firm provides in-theater gaming by using motion capture and the screen to ask the audience to engage directly in any number of game or content possibilities."

This firm actually reminded me of Unified Field, which we feature in this week's Seen in NY.

An interactive example that this article uses, was one that involved using one's cell phone and tablet to interact with a film. <a href="http://the2ndscreen.tv/creating-an-interactive-experience-in-the-movie-theater/">Second Screen</a> poses the thought, "Would it be possible to produce a fully interactive cinematic experience with the audience, at scale, in a movie theater environment without installing custom hardware at each viewing location?" For example, using an app to participate in the "Choose Your Own Adventure," film, where the audience can make decisions that determine the following scene and ending of the movie. 

It's very exciting to see how theaters are trying to make movie viewing more of a social and one-of-a kind experience. Caitlin Burns, the author of the article, writes, "but what is going to define that success is ultimately if those experiences are satisfying, enjoyable and exciting to audiences."  In relation to the 4th floor, I don't think the plans are trying to entertain people with hollywood cinema, but it's interesting to see how finding that balance of engagement and learning will mold the design for the fourth floor. 

With that said, definitely looking forward to today's Library Design Seminar!
