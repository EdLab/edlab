            Pygotham is a conference held by the python community to introduce new technologies and products that are related to the Python language. The conference is composed of tens of small sessions, which are goes on in six separate rooms. Each session lasts around an hour. 

A major topic, which was addressed by multiple sessions, is mongoDB. The primary feature of mongoDB is its document-based data representation and storage. The data for a single object is stored together in a BSON document (a variant of JSON) and can be fetched with just one command line. This fact makes it pretty easy to process data in a website because there's no more need to do joins, which is required by relational database and the fact that data is in JSON by default also saves time to compress data.

The first mongoDB-oriented session dwelt on how the database schema design pattern has changed since people started using mongoDB. A number of issues were mentioned, including indexed array keys, foreign keys, one-to-many relationship, denormalization, etc. 

Another session about mongoDB was about "mongodbengine". This is similar to the Object-Role model mapper we've been using in developing django products. As an example, the speaker introduced to us "Nymwit", an online word game that was built with mongoengine. Some of the game managing techniques were mentioned.

Still another session was dedicated to the data security issue for mongoDB. mongoDB supports asynchronous replication of data between servers for failover and redundancy. Two forms of replication are available, Master-Slave Replication and Replica Sets. Some tips were given on how to do scaling and achieve better durability.

There were also some other sessions that were primarily about mongoDB. They covered issues including mongo monitoring system, sharding and scaling and mongo drivers, etc.
