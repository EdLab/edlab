          <p>
            Thanks to everyone who participated in today's D&R on giving better professional feedback. Here's a recap of our group discussions:</p>

<p><b>Giving helpful feedback can be challenging because:</b></p>
<li>Personal relationships are difficult to navigate. Sometimes we avoid confrontation because we're afraid of having a negative relationship with our coworkers, even though not giving necessary constructive feedback could create more tension.</li>
<li>Motives for feedback may not be clear. If there isn't a culture of constant feedback, employees may be wary of criticism and wonder if it's coming from a place of helpfulness.</li>
<li>It's not delivered appropriately. Consider the appropriate mode (in front of a group, private meeting, passing comments, gchat/slack, email, performance review). </li>
<li>It's difficult to know people's communication preferences. How will they best respond without bristling at your suggestions? </li>
<li>The timing may be off. We generally agreed that it's better to give feedback sooner rather than later to avoid a scenario where someone responds with "I wish you had told me earlier." </li>
<li>It's time consuming to give <i>good</i> comments. This applies to both positive and constructive feedback. It's much easier to say something was "great" (or to not say anything at all) than to say specifically what you liked or wished had been better. </li> 
<li>It requires following up, which is also time consuming and easy to put off or avoid altogether. </li>
<li>Your position in an organization may make you feel out of place saying something to someone above you or on another team. How do you do this respectfully and tactfully? </li>

<p><b>We came up with the following ideas for overcoming these challenges:</b></p>
<li>Articulate clear and specific goals and project markers so that there are no misunderstandings about expectations.</li>
<li>Create a culture of feedback where everyone understands that they will constantly receive it and are expected to ask for it. </li>
<li>Structure regular weekly or monthly check-in meetings with supervisors and peers.</li>
<li>Create a safe place for anonymous feedback, like a suggestion box.</li>
<li>Be empathetic when approaching someone. Consider their personality, working style, and communication preferences.</li>
<li>Invest in professional relationships ahead of time so that your only communication with them isn't constructive criticism. </li>
<li>Don't be a Debbie Downer. Couch negative comments between things that are positive and make sure to offer praise when it's appropriate.</li>
<li>Be selective with praise. It becomes meaningless if it's given for everything, especially mediocre work.</li>
<li>Ask specific questions when soliciting feedback (rather than "Do you like this?/What do you think?") and ask specific questions when delivering feedback so you can appreciate a person's processâ€”it may help them realize where they need to improve without you even suggesting it.</li></p>

<p>Please add more ideas in the comments. And I'd be remiss if I didn't invite feedback too, so let me know how you thought this D&R could've been better. Thanks guys! </p>
