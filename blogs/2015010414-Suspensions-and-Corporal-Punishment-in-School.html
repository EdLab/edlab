          <p>
            Many schools have been criticized for suspending students for <a href="http://www.takepart.com/photos/8-disturbing-truths-school-suspensions-america/the-school-suspension-rate-dilemma" target = "blank">acts that are considered minor infractions</a>. Suspensions deprive students of essential learning hours. Some students are unable to complete their studies as a result. Some people argue that educational programs should be initiated to help students when they violate school policies. Some countries result to corporal punishment. The argument there is that it helps maintain discipline and keep students in the classroom instead of suspension, which leaves them at home. Suspensions can lead to total disillusionment with school. 

For most students in Ghana (where I grew up), suspension was perhaps the most severe punishment apart from expulsion. Students were subjected to corporal punishment. Caning was used to address student misbehavior, disrespectfulness, lateness, disruption of class and other misconducts. Corporal punishment has been banned in a lot of countries but is still used in others. Even though I am against corporal punishment of any sorts in schools, it is quite evident that corporal punishment reduces suspensions in countries where it is practiced. However, school suspensions in these countries are enforced when students engage in severe acts such us carrying weapons to school or engaging in physical or verbal assault.
