            Hi Everyone! Friend of Edlab, <a href="https://twitter.com/debryc">Deborah Chang</a>, asked me to share this with the community and I thought the blog may be the perfect venue! I worked as a mentor at a past event and really enjoyed the experience!

Startup Weekend EDU is heading back to New York City and we'd love for you to join us. We're looking for passionate designers, developers, educators & entrepreneurs who want to make a difference in improving education opportunities for all. Come learn the basics of founding & launching a successful education product while solving real problems in education.
 
Startup Weekend Education NYC
March 27-29, 2015
Avenues, the World School, 259 10th Avenue, New York, NY 10001
 
The event: We bring together a diverse group of people passionate about making a positive impact on education. In 54 hours, participants share ideas, form teams, design products and launch education startups. Startup Weekend Education begins with open-mic 60-second pitches on Friday night that result in the formation of small teams around the best, most viable education concepts. Teams spend Saturday and Sunday focusing on user research, customer development, validating their ideas and designing prototypes with the help of experienced coaches from the education market. On Sunday, teams demo their education products and receive valuable feedback from a panel of expert judges. Notable winners from past SWEDU events include Clever and Three Ring.  Vidcode--the team that took home the top prize at last year's event in NYC--has been featured in Forbes, Teen Vogue and more!
