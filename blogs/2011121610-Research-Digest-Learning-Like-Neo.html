Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNaf) is a new method of learning that uses a person's visual cortex and induced brain activity patterns to improve visual perceptual learning and performance of visual tasks. In other words, a person seeking to learn a topic would watch a computer screen and have one's brain patterns modified to match those of a person who already knows the content or how to do something. Yes, it does sound like something out of <i>The Matrix</i>.

At present, this learning approach might be used for various types of learning, including memory, motor, and rehabilitation. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
To be honest, I'm not sure if this can really be called a method for learning or just very high-tech hypnosis. The results of the study showed that subjects were not aware of what they were learning during the neurofeedback. Can learning really be just as powerfully done without conscious awareness as with consciousness? This question of whether unconscious mental processes are as analytically powerful as, or even more powerful than, conscious processes is a very old one. Perception and learning without awareness can occur, as seen in this study as well as what we know about general subliminal stimuli, but it is almost certainly limited to what it can accomplish. Therefore, it could be used as a great supplementary tool for learning for the future, but it is highly unlikely to replace learning itself.
