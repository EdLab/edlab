<p>The amount of media content available to students is steadily increasing; however, distrust of media is also rising. This problem is reflected in the heavy criticism of all information platforms, from news outlets to textbooks. When <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/05/immigrant-workers-or-slaves-textbook-maker-backtracks-after-mothers-online-complaint/">McGraw-Hill Education </a>was forced to edit their textbooks in response to social media outrage, Dr. Brendesha Tynes, associate professor at the University of Southern California, had enough. Her response was the creation of the <a href="https://ratemymedia.org">Rate My Media</a> platform, the first crowdsourced media rating tool focused on equity and inclusion.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>The concept of galvanizing public opinion in an organized platform is appealing in a world where media has increasingly fragmented into niche markets. It also should appeal to parents and educators who consistently seek quality media to educate students. The Rate My Media platform has a simple interface that is easy to use: media is sorted into categories from magazines to music. It is simple to search, rate, or read reviews. There are three unique star-based rating categories, including equity and inclusion, learning, and content quality; all of these cumulate in an overall rating.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>With the vast criticisms surrounding media, it can be said that Rate My Media is a little too basic, with the three ill-defined categories limiting other important features, like <i>authenticity</i>. As with most crowd-based platforms, crowds do not seem to be naturally gravitating to the site. Most media ratings are nonexistent or only have <i>one</i> reviewer. The forum on the site seems to lack both substance and direction.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p>With the advancement of new media comes many challenges for educators and parents seeking to find quality content to educate themselves and their students. Even the best researchers sometimes find themselves citing false or skewed information without the ability to check every source, which is why this platform is needed. However, building an educated crowd to produce quality ratings is an important criterion of Rate My Mediaâ€™s design that has yet to be met. </p>
