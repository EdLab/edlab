<b>Description:</b> This paper proposes the inclusion of more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning">adaptive</a> and personal learning platforms that should be available for educators. Most e-learning systems are now based on Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle, ATutor, and Blackboard, but these systems are mostly static. LMS offers all users the same services and contents but does not offer much in terms of customization. The proposed Adaptive Learning Systems (AES) is a system that would adapt their educational content and tools based on the personal preferences of the user. This would potentially personalize the learning experience and result in better learning. The paper compares the two systems and discusses their strengths and weakness, as one system lacks a certain feature needed for better learning while the other can provide that same feature. The proposed solution, according to the authors is to combine the best of LMS and AES, so the solution would essentially consist of implementing an adaptive learning element to the existing traditional learning management system. The paper concludes by noting that there needs to be more work that focuses on the implementation progress, deployment and evaluation. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> Adaptive learning technologies is still relatively new, and the biggest name that does this well is <a href="http://www.knewton.com/adaptive-learning/">Knewton</a>. There are some more applications and games that have the adaptive learning concept, where users are given the learning material based on their performance. So as it is seems that users are not understanding a certain concept, more learning materials are presented to the user so they can strengthen their knowledge, and ability to apply that knowledge. The proposed solution in the paper highlights the fact that e-learning would go from the traditional teacher and course centric learning environment, or “knowledge push”, to the learner centric and interest-based learning environment, or “knowledge pull”. In order to have a “knowledge pull” environment, applications need to become more fluid to adapt to each and every users' learning speeds or skill. We should be moving more towards this instead of a “one size fits all” type of application. Adaptive Learning Technologies is a great area for research, because it would be a great addition to the mSchool. Currently we are collecting adaptive learning applications and putting them into a database, so that we can better understand the concept and use them for a new product. If you happen to run into an adaptive learning application or if you'd like to find out more, send me an email.
