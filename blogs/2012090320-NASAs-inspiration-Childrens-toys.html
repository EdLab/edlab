<p>If we learned anything from the Apollo 13 mission, it was that life-threatening situations can be circumvented with quick thinking, creativity, and duct tape. While maybe not a universal truth, it brought to light the problem solving skills now representative of the most learning-centered and <a href="http://ourpublicservice.org/OPS/publications/viewcontentdetails.php?id=208">  innovative government agency in the United States. </a> </p>

<p>
Today, NASA continues to build a culture of innovation through internal platforms (i.e., <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/nasa@work.html">NASA@Work</a>) and external collaborations (e.g., the <a href="https://www.innocentive.com/pavilion/NASA">NASA Innovation Pavillion on Innocentive</a>). It presents complex problems and solicits ideas from employees, contractors, and volunteers. One such challenge was to create pioneering avionics software for NASA’s X-38 escape ship for the International Space Station. The escape ship is meant to bring crew members safely back to Earth in an emergency when there is no time to launch a shuttle to come to their rescue. 
</p><p>
The challenge was met by a group of young engineers who were part of a Johnson Space Center (JSC) innovation team. Members of this team came from various departments within JSC: Orion, the Mission Operation Directorate, Robotics, and others. Each member added value to the team by bringing with them a unique set of skills. <br>
</p><p>
The team put together a two-page presentation and a 60-second pitch for the JSC Innovation Board. The board liked what they heard and encouraged the team to create a rapid prototype of their idea. The culminating project is an example of quick work executed from an ad hoc team that came together based on a shared desire to solve a complicated problem.  NASA’s continued encouragement and support of such initiatives contributes to its longstanding tradition of serving (and nurturing) a community of innovators. It is an exemplar for all institutions, organizations, and companies desiring to invigorate creative and entrepreneurial ideas that are so crucial in today’s modern times.
