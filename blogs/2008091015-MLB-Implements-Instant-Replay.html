          <p>
            Baseball implemented <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sports/ci_10404256">instant replay</a> on Thursday August 28, 2008. It was a history making event in Major League Baseball (MLB). It was about time the league open their eyes to see that not only did the game necessitate this but it was just something that had to be done. MLB, in my opinion, should have created this rule when they saw that umpires were making incorrect calls on a daily basis. Lets face the truth: umpires are humans not robots, they can't call every play as accurately.

In the National Football League (NFL), coaches can  challenge a specific play if they think that a wrong called was made. In baseball it is a little different, you can challenge the fact that the umpire made the wrong call but it is up to them to decide whether or not they want to see the video of the play.

Some people are concerned about this new rule. They think the umpires are going to take too long to come back with a result. Pitchers might have problems waiting because they might lose their rhythm, which is quite possible, because they can throw at least forty to fifty more pitches depending on the inning.   

So if this was rule was implemented before now, many teams would have won games they ended up losing. I think the new instant replay rule makes it fair for al involved because now teams that deserved to win can actually win.
