          <p>
            A few weeks, I blogged about the Campaign for Fiscal Equity's (CFE) legal quest to ensure that New York City's public schools are receiving their share of the state's educational fiscal pie. One of the first landmark cases involving financial equity for public schools (<i>Levittown v. Nyquist</i>) resulted in the courts ruling that though the state's constitution doesn't mention equal funding for public schools, it does require students to receive “a basic sound education.” At first glance, a “basic sound education” sounded like another legal term phrased to simplify what is a very complex legal issue. 

The CFE's first legal challenge occurred in 1995 when New York State's Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) ruled that unlike the <i>Levittown</i> case, the CFE did have the constitutional right to challenge the state's education finance system. The Court took it a step further when it informed CFE's legal team that it will rectify the situation if they are able to prove that a large number of public school students are being denied a “basic sound education.” 

<a href="http://www.cfequity.org/ns-nys.htm">CFE</a>, acting on the Court's suggestion, returned in 2003 with a lawsuit against the state of New York in which it proved that a fair number of public school students were been denied a “basic sound education.” The question at hand concerned what was included in a “basic sound education.”  The Court basically held that New York State must ensure that public schools in the state are able to teach “the basic literary, calculating, and verbal skills necessary to enable children to eventually function productively as civic participants capable of voting and serving on a jury.” (Hui Soo responded to the initial post that a basic sound education involved students' been able to engage in civic duty as a result, i.e. vote). 

What do you think of the Court's assessment of what constitutes a “basic sound education” for public school students in New York State? 

(Hui Soo responded to the initial post that a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2526">basic sound education</a> involved students' been able to engage in civic duty as a result of that education, but questioned whether that was enough for the current knowledge economy).
