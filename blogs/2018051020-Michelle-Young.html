<p><a href="https://untappedcities.com/author/michelle-young/">Michelle Young</a> is the founder of <a href="https://untappedcities.com">Untapped Cities</a>, a site dedicated to rediscovering New York City, which is soon expanding to include Los Angeles. The site features unique articles and guides from storytellers, writers, and photographers, and hosts educational tours of sites around the city. Young is also an adjunct professor at Columbia University’s <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/faculty/174-michelle-young">Graduate School of Architecture</a>.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>What I do at <a href="https://untappedcities.com">Untapped Cities</a> is absolutely a combination of my education and professional experience. At Harvard, I studied the History of Art and Architecture, and after college I went to work in the corporate offices of fashion companies like Abercrombie & Fitch, J. Crew, and Calvin Klein. After five years in fashion, I decided to go back to architecture and studied urban planning and design at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (GSAPP). It was at GSAPP where I first launched Untapped Cities in 2009 (then called Untapped New York), as I saw an opportunity in the internet space for a website dedicated to New York City that helped bridge the gap between the academic research being done on cities and the popular consumption of it. </p>

<p>Over time, I used my business experience and my architecture and urbanism education to turn Untapped Cities into a full-time, professional endeavor. Untapped Cities is now both an online magazine and a tour company. We help New Yorkers (and, soon, residents of Los Angeles) rediscover their city through online content, tours truly for locals, and events/talks. I also now teach an Urban Studies studio at Columbia GSAPP in the architecture department, really bringing the whole thing full circle for me.</p>

<p><b>What does it mean for people to "rediscover" urban spaces and cities, and why is this important?</b><br>
<p>Rediscovery is about learning new things about the places you see all the time. This could be something on your street or a famous landmark that you pass by every day. Our goal is to surprise even the most long-time New York resident, every day. We aim to help people rediscover their own cities, to see the past, present, and future that surrounds them, and hopefully through this knowledge empower them to become a more engaged citizen.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Last year, we were part of the GSAPP Incubator, located in the New Museum, and we now work out of the <a href="https://nyc.socialinnovation.org/">Centre for Social Innovation</a>, which is full of organizations and companies looking to change the world. I hope that Untapped Cities shows the breadth of what one can do with an architecture and urban planning degree.</p> 

<p>From a broader perspective, we've had 16 classes of interns at Untapped Cities, training many young writers who have moved on to publications like <i>The New York Times</i>, as well as other endeavors outside of publishing. I love that we've been able to serve as a training ground. Our work also often ends up in very unexpected educational locations; our photographs are in textbooks published by Houghton Mifflin, Cambridge University, and more, and even in children's books. We also find ourselves referenced in many wonderful books about niche topics since we focus on lesser-known information!</p> 

<p><b> What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>We're super excited to be expanding. We'll launch Untapped LA in February and make Untapped NY its own destination page on our site. We'll also be launching a membership program–an insiders club for New Yorkers who will get access to the most inaccessible places in New York City (like the World's Fair Pavilion in Flushing Meadows, for example) and attend talks with the city's movers and shakers, all for a low monthly membership price.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter or other social media?</b><br>
<p>My favorite person on social media these days is <a href="https://twitter.com/lauriestories?lang=en">Laurie Gwen Shapiro</a>, a writer for Untapped Cities who just published a wonderful book <i>The Stowaway: A Young Man's Extraordinary Adventure to Antarctica</i>. We <a href="https://untappedcities.com/2018/01/10/10-nyc-locations-in-the-stowaway-a-young-mans-extraordinary-adventure-to-antarctica/2/"> just published a piece about her book</a> and hosted her at a <a href="https://untappedcities.com/tours/book-party-stowaway-young-mans-extraordinary-adventure-antarctica-author-laurie-gwen-shapiro/">book talk</a> at our offices. She shares a lot of very interesting stories across subjects and has insightful thoughts about so many topics.
