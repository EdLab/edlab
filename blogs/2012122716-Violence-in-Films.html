          <p>
            I came across this <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57559564/jamie-foxx-quentin-tarantino-speak-about-movie-violence-in-wake-of-newtown-conn-shootings/">piece</a> that talked about the Newtown shootings and how violence in movies might encourage such certain actions. But is this really the case? Critics are trying to convince filmmakers to reduce the violence in their movies but that some argue that doing so go against the filmmaker's first amendment right to freedom of speech and expression. Also films are a source of entertainment and it is not meant to be taken literally. Filmmakers, by their profession, are called on to be creative and violence is essentially a part of that creativity and the decision to watch the movie is solely up to the individual or parents for those underaged.
<p>	
I don't believe it's the violence shown in movies as it is just purely entertainment, I believe it's just the persons reaction towards violence. Their actions are caused by their own thoughts and personal feelings. I've seen many violent movies lately (Avengers, The Dark Night, and Bourne Legacy, etc.,) and was not affected by it at all. I am a fan of action movies, which usually contains violent scenes, but I watch and enjoy the movie purely for entertainment purposes. Do movie directors and companies need to tone down the violence in wake of the recent random shootings?
