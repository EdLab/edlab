          <p>
            Every year, thousands and millions of people strive to come to the United States to experience the American Dream. The promise of equality and an abundance of opportunities have lured people to America's shores for generations. However, every good thing in life does not come easily. Individuals who aspire to live in the U.S. must first pass a tedious, time consuming, and costly immigration process. For some families, the cost of the process is too much to bear. Consequently, they find other ways to enter the country, usually through illegal means. Today, many undocumented immigrants are facing deportation. Deportation affects children’s education.

According to this <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/01/the-educational-and-emotional-toll-of-deportation/426987/">piece</a>, out of the 50 million children that were enrolled in U.S. public elementary and secondary schools in 2012, 3.5 million had at least one undocumented parent. To avoid deportation, undocumented parents don’t send their children to school or for doctor’s appointment. In a nutshell, children living with undocumented parents will struggle to excel if one or both parents are deported. It is important for the government to enforce its immigration laws and policies, but it is also important for them to make sure that children who are legal (and often natural born citizens) living with undocumented parents, are attending school. The last thing they want is to allow this issue to force students to drop out of school, which comes with its own set of issues.
