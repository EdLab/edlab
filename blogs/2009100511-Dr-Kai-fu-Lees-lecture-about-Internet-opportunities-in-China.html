            <img src="http://www.cuasia.org/images/kaifu.jpg" align='left' hspace='20'>Dr. Kai-fu Lee (<a href=' http://en.innovation-works.com/downloads/bio.doc'>bio</a>), Chairman and CEO of <a href=' http://en.innovation-works.com/' target='_blank'>Innovation Works</a>, former Vice President of  Google and former President of Google Greater China, and a Columbia graduate, spoke at the Cowin Center of Teachers College, Columbia University yesterday (Oct. 4) about the opportunities in the IT industry in China. 

In the lecture Dr. Lee compared the Internet industries in China and in the U.S., analyzed the advantages and barriers of Internet development in the larger environment in China, and concluded that China has an extremely large potential market for Internet industry development. Some interesting points I remember that Dr. Lee mentioned are:

* The patterns of Internet usage between China and the U.S. are similar in terms of web browsing, email, instant messaging, etc. But there are also big differences in online gaming (U.S. has a significant larger population of online gamers), blogging (to my surprise, Chinese people use blogs more often than the U.S. people), e-commerce (online shopping in China is remarkably retarded than in the U.S., Japan, or Korea), etc.

* The clever Chinese Internet gurus have tons of interesting ideas and tricks to promote their businesses so as to prosper in the unique larger environment in China. For example, they invented bicycle delivery for online shopping and do in-person cash transaction at the buyer's door in order to avoid the barrier that China doesn't have an established credit system. They imitate products newly released in the U.S. or Europe such as iPhone, projector mobile phone, Facebook games, and micro-blogging, modify them to the Chinese customers' preferences, and sell them at a significantly lower price than the authentic versions. Such business models are very successful in China.

But the most interesting part in the lecture was about the new firm that Dr. Lee established last month. Dr. Lee said earlier this year while he was doing a routine procedure in the hospital, he reflected when were the most exciting part in his life. As the NO. 1 person in the IT industry in China and probably Asia, he was not really fascinated by the fact that Google China or Microsoft China (he was VP of Microsoft China too before entering Google) earn hundreds of millions of dollars. Instead, his happiest times were the two years he built Google China and the two years when he built Microsoft China from scratch â€” the content of creation. Therefore he resigned from Google and created Innovation Works, a platform to help ambitious and genius IT entrepreneurs create their businesses. Using his great experience, mentorship, and networks, Dr. Lee offers training as well as funding opportunities for the young entrepreneurs.

I admire Dr. Lee's great personality and the willingness to address the problem in China where many capable and ambitious people don't have adequate opportunities to stand out and pursue their goals due to the comparatively closed larger environment in politics and economy. I'd love to keep an eye on the development of his new company.

But I felt surprised when Dr. Lee said in the Q&A session that educational products may be less considered by Innovation Works because he believed due to the high cost of Internet bandwidth and the highly uneven distribution of rich and poor families in China, IT may not be great means to improve education for most people in China. I think he was right to some extent. But like he said in the lecture, Chinese people always have solutions to their own problems. There must be some way to bypass or minimize those problems he mentioned and bring better education opportunities to Chinese people via Internet.
