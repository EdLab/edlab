<p>MITâ€™s Integrated Learning Initiative (MITili) is bringing hard science, history, economics, and other fields together to shed light on one common issue: education. What is learning, how does it happen, and how do we measure it? What skills do students need today to face the challenges that lie ahead? How can K-12 education, higher education, and continuing education adapt in accordance with recent findings in brain science, technology, and other fields?</p>

<p>MITili not only draws on interdisciplinary research at MIT; it also partners with educators at all levels to gain greater insight into learning from teachers and students in the field. MITili researchers hope to act as catalysts that inspire and enable other scholars and organizations to take up the problem of education, which these researchers define as one of the most important problems MITili has ever tackled.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:39 Anna Curry:</b> I agree that education is one of the most critical problems because what we learn shapes how with think and behave in the world. That lens we are given through our education can either hinder or enable our ability to tackle the challenges of our world. If we aren't properly trained and prepared, problems will become more entrenched. 
 </p>

<p><b>@02:41 Dallas Milanovich:</b> Grouping education with radar and cancer as one of the world's "great problems" bothers me. Education isn't something that demands a single fix; it's a broad spectrum of institutions that face different challenges in different contexts. Because of this, I take issue with any organization that claims to be tackling "education" as a problem head-on. There is no one-size-fits-all model; a more focused research question is necessary for me to trust MIT in this endeavor. </p>
