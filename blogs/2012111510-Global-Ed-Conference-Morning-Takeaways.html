            <b>*Check-out the "mother" post for this conference <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8501">here</a> for context and background on this virtual event and my experiences yesterday.*</b>

<b>Day 3</b>
Today's AM session is a keynote by Mary Clisbee on Haiti's Ecole de Choix... and developing partnerships with the US. 

<b>Interesting points from keynote</b>
-Access to simple things lacking (from Broadband to staplers) & this can be an issue in high-needs schools in the US as well. 

-Many children arrive hungry and their only meals are at school... sadly, again, this is an issue in the US as well. "During the 2011 federal fiscal year, more than 31 million low-income children received free or reduced-price meals through the National School Lunch Program."  Learn more <a href="http://feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/hunger-facts/child-hunger-facts.aspx">here</a>.

-Struggle to find teacher candidates as many teachers in Haiti are paid almost nothing.  

-Fundraising means nothing if you don't stick to your mission.

<b>Overall</b>

<b>Pros:</b>
I find the <a href="http://www.globaleducationconference.com/page/2012-sessions-and-schedule">veritable smorgasbord of sessions</a> and keynotes exciting and a benefit of virtual, global conferences.  This virtual conference has sessions organized by time zone and there is something for almost everyone at any time of night and day.  Very handy for busy professionals!  These sessions are also recorded for later viewing.  

<b>Cons:</b> 
On the negative side, I really don't love that all the "action" of the debate and session is happening in a SMALL chat window with terrible contrast (See screenshot below).  This prevents you from easily accessing your own technology to take notes, tweet etc.  I am then left primarily listening to sessions and missing both the visual elements and active chat happening among participants.  It would be amazing if you could divide-up the viewer elements to display only the chat etc on your screen as you work.  

Also, the silly "smileys" and ability to "clap" by clicking on emoticons in a drop-down menu (see screenshot below), while cute are not efficient or as functional as easier to use icon-based navigation.  Finally, the option to ask questions through your mic is cool, but unclear as to how to actually do this. I believe the moderator has this control?

<b>mSchool and Vialogues Relevance...</b>
I really feel that we can learn from this conference re: future mSchool Courses and EdFluences platform.  

If we consider the integration of live-streamed video discussions... we need a Vialogues-like 1:1 visual ratio of conversation to video. The discussion should never be secondary.  

I struggled to scroll-through the linear conversation in this tiny box and this could have been avoided by giving higher priority to the "chat" or discussion component of the experience. Also, using greater contrast between text color and background would help with chat visibility and ultimately with accessibility.  

<b>Final note...</b>
After every session participants are given a simple survey re their experience.  Check-it-out below... SurveySidekick?
