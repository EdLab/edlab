            Hey Everyone!

Today's D&R meeting is about the revival of Pocket Knowledge! Join us as we explore ways to help PK reach its fullest potential through usability and marketability.

For today's activity, we will be asking the team to split up into two groups: the Search & Organize Group, and the Social & Promotion Group. Each team will work on an activity and present their findings afterwards.

For the Search & Organize Group, you will be separated into four groups and asked to find relevant materials for one of the following research assignments. Approach this from the perspective of a student and consider the following questions -- how easy is it to find what you want? What are some snags that you ran into? What would you like to see different? What would have made this more easy/fun? 

You will present your thoughts and research findings to the larger group. 

1. Educational Parks (John Fischer)
2. John K. Norton's Living Will
3. Anna Cooley's Memories of Teachers College circa 1939
4. A history of art education in the United States   

For the Social & Promotion Group we had some questions we would like to discuss and answer:

<b>Promotion</b>

-How can we start externally promoting PK?

-What can be the tagline for PK?

-Can we present at certain conferences? Library and Tech Conferences?

-What makes PK unique from similar apps like Mendeley?

-How can we use social media to promote PK?

-How are would we charge? Subscription Based? Storage Limit?

<b>Social/EdLab Mission</b>

-Can we integrate PK to other EdLab tools?

-What current features have a social aspect? How can we add more social features to make PK the Social Archive?

-Can we create an mSchool course with some of the materials in PK and what would that include?

-Is there a potential to include some of the content from PK in NLT?


If you have any extra feedback on the revival of Pocket Knowledge, feel free to comment below.

Thank you and enjoy!
