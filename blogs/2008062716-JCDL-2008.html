            Bill Buxton, Senior Researcher at Microsoft, gave the keynote address at JCDL 2008 last week.  After noting that Pittsburgh was the perfect place to reflect on libraries given Carnegie's historic sponsorship of them, his opening remarks followed the rhetorical question of how Carnegie might evaluate collective effort in libraries and information design.  Citing Carnegie's views on the importance of librarians, open stacks (a radical concept for its time), and catalog cards, Buxton made the claim that these three were the irreducibly basic means of accessing information, which simply go by different names these days: guides, browsing, and searching.  Interestingly, Buxton eulogized the catalog card, claiming that the loss of written annotations in the move to digital libraries was costly from an information design perspective.

Having concluded that collective efforts in moving to digital libraries failed to be as good as they might have been, Buxton drew on the thought of Louis I. Kahn, who apparently was the great 20th century American architect, to reveal the best way forward for information design.  Citing Kahn's idea that design and engineering are foils of the same intellectual work, Buxton decried the lack of true architects of information design, and bemoaned the fact that the field has only structural engineers at present.  He claimed that there are no software companies doing internal design of good products.  Instead, the field relies on the Darwinian competition of internet start-ups and the subsequent pattern of mergers & acquisitions and marketing.  For Buxton,  this indicates a failure to design systems in a conscious, meaningful way.

How fortuitous, then, that we had a home-designed, home-grown system to present during the poster session!  Although we weren't able to ask Buxton directly whether PocketKnowledge met his unspecified criteria for a good product, there was a lot of interest in PocketKnowledge from both the computer scientists and librarians in the audience.  Since we were presenting the poster in the context of developing PocketKnowledge 2.0, we got quite a few suggestions, some of which misunderstood the system completely ("What if you managed the metadata from the back end?"), but most of which were worth considering,  including that we should make copyright and intellectual property policies explicit, and conduct user studies with eye-tracking software to inform UI changes.

All in all, a profitable experience.  Quite a bit more went on during other sessions, so if anyone has questions about JCDL and what got presented, just come talk to me, or I've got the conference proceedings on USB.
