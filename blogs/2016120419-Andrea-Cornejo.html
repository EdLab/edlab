Andrea Cornejo is the founder of <a href="http://coderise.org/">Coderise</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering young people through computer programming in developing countries. She previously served as a Research Analyst at the Ministry of Education in Peru, where she designed and evaluated cost-effective innovations to improve educational policies. Cornejo was a Project Associate at Innovations for Poverty Action based in Peru for two years, where she specialized in impact assessment design of poverty reduction policies and projects. Cornejo earned her bachelor's degree in Political Science and Economics from Swarthmore College and is currently pursuing a doctorate in economics and education at Teachers College, Columbia University.

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Coderise?</b><br>
<p>I was motivated to launch Coderise after understanding how to shape the economic future of developing nations in Latin America, which I learned as an economics major in college. I started Coderise one year out of college as I was eager to connect the dots about the role that modern technology plays in promoting economic development and growth. With this in mind, I set out to start an initiative that increased knowledge of one of the most valued skill sets that many recognize as key to generating innovation, entrepreneurship, and ultimately economic growth with an added bonus of increasing social mobility due to its low cost. Along the way, I learned that there are many other factors that determine the successful learning and application of these "hard-skills," such as individual, interpersonal, social, and more general cognitive skills. In order to disrupt the education systems to make the transference of STEM abilities, we have to think of ways to do so in parallel to address these other important skills. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Coderise will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Coderise is a flexible program that has the capacity to learn and adapt to best practices in order to motivate students to become curious about technology and programming. In the future, I hope that Coderise expands while adapting to different countries and community needs. In parallel, this will allow us to better identify the mechanisms of the Coderise programs (including mentorship, student-based learning, and project-based learning) that generate the strongest effects on the students and what these effects are. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>While mixed learning methods (online and in person) have picked up in the past decade, we have yet to find a recognized successful model. That said, it is clear that some form of online learning will progressively increase in presence across the education sector. In terms of actual content, I hope that by generating evidence around successful practices of how to increase students' interest in STEM field and the benefits to be gained, we can contribute to the increased attention and resources devoted to the STEM education sector.</p> 

<p><b>Apart from your role at Coderise, what are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I am currently at Teachers College in my first year of the Economics and Education PhD. For now, I am focused on obtaining all the skills I need in order to be able to generate rigorous evidence through impact evaluations on education policy-relevant issues, which includes checking the effects of coding bootcamps and other programs similar to Coderise.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>The first person that comes to mind is Nick Martin, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.techchange.org/about/">TechChange</a>, focused on increasing access to professional development and education resources globally.</p>
