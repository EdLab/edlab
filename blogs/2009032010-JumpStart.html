            "In 2011, an estimated 20 million children, or more than 50 percent of all Internet users ages 3 to 17, will be visiting virtual worlds" -Daily Breeze

Based on this internet trend, companies are following suit and creating more of these environments for children.
On March 10th <a href="http://www.knowledgeadventure.com/">Knowledge Adventures, </a>the leader in adventure-based learning games for 3-to-10 year olds, announced the release of their new virtual world, called <a href="http://www.jumpstart.com/"> JumpStart.
</a>

Knowledge Adventures Inc. was created in 1991 as an educational software for children. JumpStart is in the process of transitioning to an online, adventure-based three-dimensional virtual world. In an article from the <a href="  http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/ci_9738991">Daily Breeze,</a>CEO of Knowledge Adventures David Lord said "The adventure is the learning, we aren't moving from our roots at all. We are just going to do it better."


Paid subscribers, for a fee of 7.99/month, will be able to log in and access all JumpStart educational content. So far more than 20,000 children have already become subscribers. The site allows children to explore the learning tools, moving from level to level without having to buy new software. It also allows Knowledge Adventure to continually add and update content, as well as provide a multiplayer environment with user-generated content.

<a href="http://www.jumpstart.com/"> Check out</a> what is a becoming a major resource for how children are learning."People now are beginning to understand that games really do make you smarter. Game players are good strategic thinkers and think three or four moves ahead.We are asking kids who are 4, 5, 6 and 7 (years old) to do that, and they can, and that's an amazing thing," -Leslie House, VP Knowledge Adventures.
