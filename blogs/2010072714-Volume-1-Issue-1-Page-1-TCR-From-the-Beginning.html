<a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=9657"> Russell, J. E. (1900). The function of the university in the training of teachers. Teachers College Record, 1(1), 1-11.</a>

More than 110 years ago, James Earl Russell wrote — beginning on the very first page of the very first issue of <i>Teachers College Record</i> — of the influence of dramatic societal and technological changes on education:

“The ideals which determine the growth of educational systems,” he wrote, “never remain long fixed: they change from age to age, to conform to the development of the political, economic and spiritual life of a people.”  Given the EdLab's forward-looking mission and our recent projects exploring the interwoven histories of the college and <i>TCR</i>, it seemed fitting — sitting here atop Russell Hall — to pause a moment in order to consider what came before, and to contextualize our own moment in the evolution of education….

<b>Russell's Retrospective</b>
With all on the horizon for teaching and learning (i.e., the hopes surrounding technology, research, policy and practice) it is easy to feel overwhelmed <i>and</i> inspired by the complexity of our times.  Still, Russell made clear that change and ambiguity were always parts of the educational landscape, and described in some detail how industrialization, the rise of the natural sciences and factional strife within and amongst religious institutions shifted the locus of education from the church to the state.  Crediting Prussia and France with some of the first state-run schools (conceived, incidentally, to recoup order and stability after political and military defeats), Russell recognized that the motives, intentions and outcomes of education at the turn of the twentieth century were neither stable nor straightforward.

Yet, amidst this turmoil, Russell called for the professionalization of teachers — and their according university preparation — as one path toward more effective schooling.  Declaring (as one could today) that “the subjects of instruction have become so many, the school curricula so complex, [and] the aims and purposes of schooling so radically changed,” Russell recognized the need for something <i>different</i> in order to meet the pressing demands of the day.  While he saw in teachers and people the great promise of potential, I wonder how much, if at all, our hopes and approaches have changed as we shift our gaze back to the present and the future — and what changes and innovations are still to come.
