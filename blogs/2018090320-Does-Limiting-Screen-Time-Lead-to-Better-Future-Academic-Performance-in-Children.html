<p>Many of us grew up with fairly strict household rules regarding TV or computer time. Maybe you were limited to a number of hours per day as a child or had a technology curfew; perhaps you yourself enforce rules and restrictions on your children’s technology use. Either way, such limitations are understood to be for a child’s own good, to increase their physical activity, social lives, safety, or academic performance. But do these rules achieve what they set out to do? Researchers at the University of Zurich approached this question in regards to school performance, and set out to determine whether the presence of such technology rules during childhood related to individuals' future academic achievement.</p>
 
<p>The researchers surveyed 1,100 first-year students, all ages 18 or 19, at a diverse urban U.S. university about technology rules their parents implemented in their childhood. Retrospectively, students reported the reasons their parents gave for limiting their technology use as kids, mostly as it pertained to internet usage. Researchers also asked student for demographic information, including gender, race and ethnicity, and parent education, then collected data on each student’s current academic performance.</p>
 
<p>Researchers found participants’ answers differed based on demographics; for example, female students were more likely to report rules pertaining to safety and privacy and students who had at least one parent with a college degree reported significantly more reasons for rules than participants with less educated parents. However, when it came to participants’ grades, researchers found that no matter students’ demographics, technology rules, regardless of reason, had a negative correlation to grades. Furthermore, having a rule limiting technology use for reasons of homework time displacement were related to lower college grades.</p>

<p>These results show that keeping children away from technology might backfire when it comes to academic achievement and learning. Perhaps these findings simply indicate that parents of children who were already doing poorly in school restricted technology use in the hopes it would affect their performance, with little effect. But it might also reveal something more pervasive; technology cannot always be our scapegoat for 21st century children’s ills. Reconsidering how technology is used and limited in the home could help us foster the learning of young people.</p>
