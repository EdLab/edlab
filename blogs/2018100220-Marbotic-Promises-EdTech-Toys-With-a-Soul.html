<p>Marbotic is a French-based educational toy company that believes tablets are innovative educational tools, but that learning and playing must comprise of more than just swiping a finger. They’ve invented specialized wooden blocks that can be paired with tablets to allow interaction between the physical world and digital spaces.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<p>The blocks are shaped like numbers or letters and when they are pressed upon an iPad, they facilitate an action or movement on the screen. For instance, if a child presses the block shaped like the number one to the screen, it will leave a digital stamp of the number. The toys are geared mostly toward very young learners in the early stages of literacy and mathematics skill-building. The toys also come in eight different languages.<p> 

<p>The wooden blocks are reminiscent of toys from a previous era. They do not require wifi, Bluetooth, or batteries to operate, but their innovation becomes clear when paired with a tablet. The company also promises that the blocks are gentle on screens, and will not cause scratches.<p> 

<p>The creators of the blocks used Montessori teaching methods in the design of their products. They even offer <a href="http://www.marbotic.fr/educators/">free lesson plans</a> for teachers to easily incorporate this technology into classrooms and they promise that these lessons are all common core compatible, too.</p> 

<p><b>Cons </b></p>
<p>The biggest drawback for the Marbotic blocks comes from their price. There are three different sets: the numbers cost around $40, the letters cost $60, and a bundled set runs $90. The blocks are compatible with the company’s  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/marbotic/id551172136?mt=8">apps</a> that run on both Apple or Android tablet devices.</p>

<p>There are currently seven different apps to choose from. While they are all free, users will need the specific blocks to make them work. Additionally, after spending almost $100 on the blocks, the limited number of apps might disappoint parents. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Marbotic blocks bring old school cool to play time. The blend between the physical and digital spaces is a refreshing addition to screen-dominated edtech toys. However, the price might be too steep for the somewhat limited offerings.</p>
