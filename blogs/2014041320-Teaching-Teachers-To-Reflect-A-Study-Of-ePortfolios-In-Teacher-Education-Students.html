<p><b>Title:</b> Promoting the Scholarship of Teaching Through Reflective e-Portfolios in Teacher Education (2014)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lina Pelliccione & Glenda Raison</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02607470903092813#.UxDNs_RdXrU">Journal of Education for Teaching: International Research and Pedagogy</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can we determine and assess specific guidelines for reflection that can empower teacher education students and first year teachers to reflect effectively on their teaching?</p>
<p><b>Study Design:</b>  
Using an interpretive approach, the study looked at first year education students who were also first year teachers. The study divided 45 students into three cohorts followed for three years. </p>

<p>The researchers were interested in the effects of structured reflection on student teaching in ePortfolios. The structured guidelines, including a reflective cycle aimed to foster deep learning and reflection, consisted of five parts: select, describe, analyze, appraise, and transform (Brown and Irby 2001). </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> 
The researchers found that for education students and first year teachers, "the development of professional teaching e-portfolios promotes academic reflection and directly engages teacher education students in the scholarship of teaching." They maintain that reflective practices using ePortfolios allow the teachers to reflect on their own craft, engage in dialogue with education scholarship and reflect on the craft of other teachers. Along with an increased number of reflections over the course of the three years, the researchers found that in the process of recording reflections, two new categories emerged (in addition to the original five: select, describe, analyze, appraise and transform): outcome and validation.</p>

<p>In addition to the impact of reflection on education students and first year teachers, the procedures of the study also benefitted the authors’ own practice of reflection as scholars. Structured reflection using ePortfolios appears to have benefits for academic researchers as well.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> 
ePortfolios have re-emerged as a way to "validate formative and summative evidence of achievement to external groups and to enhance student reflection and learning." The authors believe, and it seems an essential take-away, that reflection <i>can</i> be taught and done more effectively. Furthermore, reflection is an important part of teaching and learning and it can be enhanced and improved by technology like ePortfolios—the question that remains is: how?</p>

<p>The researchers here take a first stab at answering "how," but they could generalize their findings beyond the narrow group of first year teachers and teacher education students. It seems reflecting, and the cycle of reflecting the authors highlight, could be shared across roles and disciplines. Along with this, a theme just beneath the surface of the study is that ePortfolios are an effective way for teachers to set goals. Through reflection, we identify areas of improvement, set goals, and work towards improvement. The reflective element in the study ("transform") may be the most important. As teachers and as students, if we can identify through reflections areas of improvement, then we can improve and actively work to transform our practice and our learning, ensuring the greatest growth and success.</p>
