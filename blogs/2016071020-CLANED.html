<p><i>"CLANED® is a revolutionary open, personal and intelligent learning environment that benefits learners, educators, content providers and application developers alike. Truly collaborative, CLANED® helps in learning and teaching better and more effectively, constantly improving the results." </i> (<a href="http://www.claned.com/product/">CLANED</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>A New Spin on Collaborative Learning</b></p>

<p>Although the market for social media platforms is already quite saturated, the niche for social media-based <i>learning</i> has not yet been filled by a product. Although <a href="http://www.claned.com/">CLANED</a>, a platform developed by a team based in Finland, is not claiming to be the next Facebook or Snapchat, it seems to be presenting itself as a collaborative and social space for learners of all kinds to find their path. Users can upload or publish content onto a personal, collaboration, or public board not unlike Pinterest, and then add modules like a website, video, photo album, or document. Each board can be worked on by many users, and users can search public boards by tags if they're looking for pre-made content. The biggest social element comes into play when the user clicks <i>My Feed,</i> which is reminiscent of a Facebook news feed and includes new relevant articles, boards the user follows, and learning progress data from the past seven days.</p>

<p><b>Tracking Your Learning</b></p>
 
<p>CLANED also allows users to view board analytics, such as study time, study frequency, interactions, and comments. The platform generates graphs that can visually represent average study sessions by date and time, which board users can reflect on to track their learning progress. Another interesting feature that the platform provides is <i>study mode,</i> which prompts users to plan a study session by selecting the materials and setting a timer for the duration of the session.</p>

<p>Although CLANED offers lots of unique features that make learning a more social process, it could face a challenge that many social media-related platforms often encounter: the difficulty of building its user base when its popularity is still relatively low. As the ultimate catch-22 of social media startups, the draw for people to become new users on these platforms usually comes with knowing that lots of friends are already on it. CLANED is bringing social learning to the digital realm, but first, something has to bring all its future users to its sign-up page.</p>
