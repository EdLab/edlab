<p>A professor of a mandatory accounting course noticed her students were disengaging from the course once difficult concepts were introduced. As attendance and scores stagnated, the lecturer looked to technology for a solution. She and the university decided to pilot a gamified companion app for her course, and researchers were invited to study its implementation. </p>

<p>The gaming app presented students with a daily quiz related to accounting on their smartphones. Users gained points by answering questions with speed and accuracy. The app tracked progress and awarded badges for good performance. Additionally, a public leaderboard displayed the top-scoring students, a feature students could opt out of using. After its success, the app was expanded to science courses.  </p> 

<p>Researchers used the rollout as an ideal opportunity to test the efficacy of the app. Through a sample of almost 400 first-year students from basic science and accounting courses, the researchers explored app usage rates, class retention, and academic outcomes.</p>  

<p>When compared to the previous semester, overall student retention rates increased by over 12% once the app was introduced. However, the increase was slightly lower when compared to earlier semesters. App users also had on average around 7% higher course scores compared to students that chose not to use the app. Finally, the researchers found a moderate positive correlation in app performance to students with higher overall grades.</p>   

<p>While the app was seemingly successful in increasing student engagement and curbing attrition rates, the researchers cautioned that the results cannot be considered causal. More research must be conducted to confirm the correlations found in this test. Additionally, they warned of the so-called novelty effect, in which new technologies provide additional interest in a class, but the impact fades with time. For now, the findings at least offer hope for the efficacy of gamification in higher education.</p>
