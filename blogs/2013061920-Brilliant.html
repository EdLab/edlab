<p><a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brillant</a> gives their users more involved math and physics problems than they are used to as a way to challenge more advanced math students. These high quality problems require more advanced thinking than the math exercises students usually encounter. The platform provides a few problems at a time for users to solve and provides three chances to get the answer right along with a few hints. Users receive points for problems answered correctly and can exchange them for math related prizes like literature or t-shirts. The platform has an active community of math problem-solvers who hold discussions either on the <a href="https://brilliant.org/discussions/">forums</a> or through Google hangouts in the site’s <a href="https://brilliant.org/discussions/thread/master-sessions-e/">Master Sessions</a> which are designed to involve fully mastering a problem and learning with peers.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The problems are challenging enough that users employ more advanced problem solving techniques and spend more time <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/courses/materials/Polya_Father_of_ProblemSolving.pdf">understanding the problem, devising a plan, and carrying it out</a>. The gamification elements encourage users to answer the questions in hopes of receiving more points to exchange for prizes. Each question awards a different number of points, more difficult questions award higher points. This is a good indicator of difficulty that users can assess and decide whether or not to solve the problem.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Brilliant adds new math and physics problems every week, but the site has fewer problems to choose from than similar sites. The site won’t really guide users to solving a problem. Besides the occasional small hint or full solution users will need to solve the problems on their own.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Brilliant is a math site that targets advanced or self motivated learners. The site provides more than access to challenging problems; users can come together in the discussion forums and talk about <a href="http://sophisticatedfinance.typepad.com/sophisticated_finance/2009/10/george-polyakindred-spirit.html">heuristics</a> and even more challenging problems. Users can also contribute to the site by adding either their own problem or one from an outside resource. These functionalities give Brilliant a sense of community in which users learn new problem solving techniques from each other. Learning on the site might be increased by giving users a chance to reflect on a problem they’ve solved. <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/354">Reflection</a> could include checking one’s work, giving similar problems that are more challenging, or allowing users to come up with their own more difficult problem using the same concepts. Allowing math learners to reflect on their solution to a math problem is what’s missing online and offline, which is unfortunate because it promotes deeper learning.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Brilliant gives you a real mental workout!</p>
