            A chemistry library dishes out $20,000 a year for subscription to a journal called Tetrahedron, published by Elsevier. There seems to be a growing awareness and protests to the exorbitant prices of these journals. 

There's a lot of things broken about peer reviewed academic publishing today. The editors and peer reviewers for these magazines are usually professors who do it mostly with a sense of academic duty. The journals spends very little as salaries for these duties. 

The biggest absurdity of course comes from the fact that whereas other publishing companies pays big time for its content, a reputed academic journal actually has authors vieing to publish their articles for free in their journals, thanks to "publish or perish" that exists in academia today. For example, Watson and crick described the double helix structure of the DNA in 1953 and published the findings in a celebrated article in <i>Nature</i>. Do you think the authors should fight to get their articles published, which are then sold to universities with a $20,000 bill slapped up or rather that Nature should feel honored to have published the article?
The biggest sufferers in this colossal game of profit margins are the universities, the taxpayers and most sadly, students, because they not only indirectly support the salaries of the professors, but they also indirectly bear the brunt of pricey journal subscriptions. 

Professor Tim Gowers of fields medal fame has recently started a public boycott of publishing companies, called <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/index.php">the cost of knowledge</a>, which has recieved quite a bit of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/22/academic-publishing-monopoly-challenged">media attention</a>. The "cost of knowledge" website seems to have good support. At the least, I recognize a lot of my textbook authors who have lent their names. 

Can we at EdLab do something about it? We, as part of the library, ought to be concerned about this. The de facto alternative today to peer reviewed journals seem to be <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a>. The website, to say the least, seems very unfriendly and unfulfilling. One of arXiv's claim to fame is the first publishing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman">Prof. Perelmans</a> solution to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">poincare conjecture</a>. Considering that Perelman is probably the most enigmatic of geniuses today (who refuses a field medal?) and considering that his <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DG/0303109">article</a> is one of the most cited articles in math today, you'd expect that a search of "Perelman" or "ricci flow" would pop up the article on arXiv, but thats not the case. In fact, a Google search for "Perelman arxiv" gives his arxiv epaper as the first result, but not the search on the arxiv website! Basic search functionality seems to be badly broken in arXiv.

We already have a tool for this purpose, TC record, which is a world renowned publishing medium. More importantly, we have access to the best content providers (in the form of professors and students). This is probably enough to start a self sustaining publishing medium which can hopefully spread to other branches of academia. If one thinks about it, Facebook used the same trick in its meteoric rise in popularity. It became popular in one small exclusive Harvard club in which everyone wants in, and then it spread to other self contained pockets (universities). 

In conclusion, there is certainly room for improvement in the current situation. As Michelle explained in the product management 101 D&R seminar, this seems like a situation where demand is high and public satisfaction is low.  Lets hope public awareness grows and knowledge grows more and more free.
