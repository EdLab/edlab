            **Private**

Manav and I attended the Recruit NYC job fair yesterday. Attendees were all alumni of regional colleges and universities (e.g., NYU, CU, NYIT, Cornell, Dartmouth...). We were in interesting company (heh). The table across from us had recruiters from Holister/Abercrombie. Next to them was Aflac. Behind us was PIMCO.  But none of us could beat the line of hopeful candidates that eagerly awaited at the NYU table. All day they had a line about 20 people deep! It was inexplicable. 

Thanks to the design team (Daniel in particular) for helping us get our table looking all professional and sleek. In fact, the very first compliment we received was from a marketer/recruiter from another table who stopped by before the event began and marveled at how well our branding was coming through.  Props to you, Daniel!

We had a lot of tech positions we were looking to fill, but this didn't seem like the best audience. Most of the people we saw were interested in a sales/marketing gig. There were a number of viable admin candidates, though. I hope they take the extra step to apply. If even one person who applied through the job fair was hired here, I'd be satisfied. It's hard to say if I'd want to return or not... I guess it depends on who comes through.
