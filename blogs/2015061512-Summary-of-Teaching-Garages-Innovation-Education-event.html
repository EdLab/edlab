          <p>
            Last Thursday, I ventured out to an education innovation event hosted by  <a href="http://www.teachinggarage.com/">Teaching Garage</a>. The founder of Teaching Garage, Janice Chong, attended the same high school as Joel Klein, former NYC Chancellor of Education and CEO of  <a href="http://www.amplify.com/">Amplify</a>. When she sent him a Linkedin message asking if he would be the keynote speaker, he agreed!

The event was held on a top floor of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_Building/">Lipstick Building</a> in the  the law office of Latham & Watkins. At the pre-event reception, I had the opportunity to chat with the founder of <a href="http://press4kids.com/">News-O-Matic</a>, a great contender for a future Demo Night!

Joel Klein gave an inspiring speech. His points included 1) that many schools have become 'innovation free zones.' He talked about the importance of creating a culture of innovation. 2) He talked about the need to understand technology as a tool, not a golden ticket answer. 3) He talked about understanding the different ways students can learn with technology. For example, instead of seeing cell phones as a problem, we have to understand the ways students can learn with cell phones as well.

Following his talk, was a panel moderated by Ellen Biao at Interactive Educational Systems Design. She asked the panelist general questions, like what were there teaching experiences and what were creative things their companies were doing. Even though the questions were fairly general, the answers were interesting in that the panelists offered specific anecdotes from their experiences. Panelists included Richard Ach√©e at Google for education, Scott Kinney at Discovery Education, and Kobi Yamada at Compendium. The conversation circled back to how do you create a culture of innovation and what are the most promising aspects of technology.

Following this panel, there were three more panels.
