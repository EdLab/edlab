          <p>
            If you haven't seen it yet, check out the following promotional video from TC (found <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/users/prospective.htm">here</a>):

<iframe width="316" height="283" src="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/users/SplashImage.swf"></iframe>

I think there are a number of interesting things about this video.  For starters it utilizes a series of brief and active camera shots over longer audio.  This may be an attempt to look more "hip" like new videos for the generation with the shortest attention span yet, but I found it irritating.  However, it's impressive in that the shots highlight areas I see everyday in a way that makes them look newer and cleaner.  I've seen this a lot in Hollywood works and it never ceases to impress me.

There are also some underlying suggestions to the film that may make you uneasy.  If you know the people in the video, you'll notice that less than a dozen (I think, I didn't count) individuals give testimonials.  Two of these people were identified as Organizational Psychology students in the little title bar on the bottom.  But if you recognize the faces, you'll notice that an additional two people from Organization Psychology give testimonials without credit to their name or program.  Four testimonials out of perhaps a dozen from Organizational Psychology is rather biased.

Additionally, it seemed to me that the other programs referenced were "brain-heavy."  Various psychology programs and a neuroscience program seemed to dominate the list of orators.  I didn't notice anyone from economics, sociology, anthropology, interational ed, or other disciplines with a broader lens of human behavior.  The looming question for me is: Is this reflective of marking research, of general views of "good" programs, of which groups of students are more active in the community, or just a random bias?
