<p><i>"Worldreader is about e-books, reading, and literacy. We are a US, Europe, and Africa-based nonprofit organization transforming the lives of people in the developing world. Our mission is to unlock the potential of millions of people through the use of digital books in places where access to reading materials is very limited."</i> (<a href="http://www.worldreader.org/about-us/faq/">About Worldreader</a>) </p>

<p><b>  Digital Disposition  </b> <br>
<a href="http://www.worldreader.org/">Worldreader</a> provides free ebooks to schoolchildren in need all over the world. Since digital content is less expensive to publish and distribute, this strategy allows them to reach more people who lack consistent access to reading materials. Worldreader currently has a catalog of 27,200 books in every genre. Though their collection is primarily in English, they do offer titles in 43 languages and are working towards more books in different languages. Worldreader provides schools and communities with a list of books available in the digital library, and the users choose which books they want loaded onto e-readers and mobile phones for free. Students and teachers can download many other titles for free later, and they also have access to additional titles to purchase. </p>

<p> Mobile phones <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/02/13/emerging-nations-embrace-internet-mobile-technology/">are widely available</a> (and even smart devices are on the rise, though less prevalent) around the world, so Worldreader developed a mobile app to allow anyone to read free e-books. They've partnered with an Australia-based app developer to create a smartphone-like experience for regular cell phones, so even someone with a basic mobile phone can have access to Worldreader's library of ebooks. Worldreader also provides e-readers to schools in need (either via purchase or sponsorship) for even better reading experiences. </p>

<p><b> Curated Collections </b> <br>
The more relevant and engaging a student's first reading experiences are, the more likely the student will continue to read and learn, so Worldreader builds collections deliberately to support new readers. Although many of the current titles are donated by partnering publishers, Worldreader actively seeks out books written by African and Indian authors to appeal to their large population of readers in those regions. Worldreader also helps African and Indian writers and publishers with translation and digitization. This not only helps Worldreader build a larger catalog of titles, but it also helps writers expand their reach across the globe. </p>

<p><b>Future Partners </b> <br>
Worldreader works with a large number of publishers around the world, including Cambridge University Press and Penguin Random House, as well as other organizations like <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile">Opera</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/">Mozilla</a>. Authors often get involved by donating their books to Worldreader's library of free ebooks, and individuals and institutions can also sponsor a school or library project in need of funding. </p>
