          <p>
            I’ve read a lot about self-directed (or self-regulated) learning (SDL) recently and Virginia Ricard’s <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/995/georgenantwi1/trust-the-process">self-directed learning wheel</a> still stands out to me. Ricard’s model argues that the learner should be the primary driver and central focus of the wheel. Facilitator(s), setting, and resources are all essential components of the wheel and ultimate learner success. Often neglected in the literature is the role of settings (i.e. physical learning spaces) in the SDL process. Institutions, especially in higher education, spend millions on creating physical learning spaces for members of their community. My broader research question seeks to answer the following questions: how does physical learning spaces support self-directed learning?

Though my initial research into this area is still in its infancy, I came across an interesting research article, In <a href="https://sisaljournal.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/nakai2.pdf">How do Learners Make Use of a Space for Self-Directed Learning?</a> in the piece, Professor Yoshio Nakai examined how language learners in Japan used a classroom as part of their self-directed learning objectives. The participants in the study were candidates from the Philippines who were aiming to become care workers in Japan, hence the need to learn Japanese. As part of their learning objectives, the institution organized an hour-long “self-directed learning session that lasted for 17 weeks. Nakai sought to answer the following questions:
<ul>
	<li>To what extent were the students comfortable with exercising their autonomy?</li>
	<li>What kinds of activity did the students choose to engage in during the sessions?</li>
	<li>What can the kinds of activities they chose tell us about the needs of students as holistic individuals?</li>
</ul>
In his findings and analysis, Nakai found that the learners, despite their initial apprehensiveness about the classroom, eventually took ownership of the classroom. They further extended it to Facebook, where they created a private group to continue the learning activities from the classroom. The students were able to use their collective autonomy to conjure up activities in the classroom that supported their learning objectives. Students’ use of the classroom, whether simulating scenes from Titanic, decorating the walls, or leaving their personal belongings, meant they took ownership of the space and to a larger extent, their learning goals. In his final analysis, Nakai argues that it is imperative for educators to help learners by exploring the boundaries and possibilities of a learning space. This provides learners with the ability to determine the direction of their learning goals and objectives.

I think Nakai’s paper is a good starting point for exploring how learning spaces support self-directed learning. Nakai looked at students whose learning had a clear learning outcome: learn a language so you can land a job. This might have played a major role in how students approached the learning objectives prescribed to them by the program. Additionally, language learning, more than most subjects, requires collaboration between learners and thus might have played a factor in learners being so receptive to spending time alone in the classroom. These are questions and lessons for us to consider as we continue to explore how the learning spaces at the Gottesman Libraries currently or could potentially support self-directed learning.
