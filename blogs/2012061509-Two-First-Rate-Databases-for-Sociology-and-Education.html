          <p>
            There are two databases covering the sociological literature that are essential resources for sociology and education:  <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?ATG2613">Sociological Abstracts</a> and <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?clio6756058">SocINDEX with Full Text</a>.  <em>Sociological Abstracts</em> is made available by ProQuest (formerly from CSA) and is accessible through the Columbia University Libraries at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?ATG2613">http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?ATG2613</a>; <em>SocINDEX with Full Text</em> is made available by EBSCO and is accessible through Columbia at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?clio6756058">http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?clio6756058</a>.

<em>Sociological Abstracts</em> states that it "abstracts and indexes the international  literature in sociology and related disciplines in the social and  behavioral sciences. The database provides abstracts of journal articles  and citations to book reviews drawn from over 1,800+ serials  publications, and also provides abstracts of books, book chapters,  dissertations, and conference papers. Records published by Sociological  Abstracts in print during the database's first 11 years, 1952-1962, have  been added to the database as of November 2005, extending the depth of  the backfile of this authoritative resource."

<em>SocINDEX with Full Text</em> calls itself "the world's most comprehensive and  highest quality sociology research database. The database features more  than 2.1 million records with subject headings from a 20,000+ term  sociological thesaurus designed by subject experts and expert  lexicographers. <em>SocINDEX with Full Text</em> contains full text for  more than 860 journals dating back to 1908. This database also includes  full text for more than 830 books and monographs, and full text for over  16,800 conference papers."

Though these descriptions don't lend themselves to a very meaningful comparison of the databases, it's clear that there are significant similarities but also important differences between the two.  On the face of it, it would appear that <em>Sociological Abstracts</em> covers more than twice as many journals than does <em>SOCIndex</em>; however, the extent of coverage of individual issues--whether cover-to-cover or selective--isn't really touched on in the description of either resource.  My educated guess is that there's a great deal of overlap between the two databases, especially in terms of current coverage of the periodical literature, and this is partly borne out in a comparison of the coverage of current faculty members in Teachers College's Sociology and Education program:  <em>Sociological Abstracts</em> yields a total of 131 records in searches of the eight instructors, while <em>SocINDEX</em> yields a total of 136 records.  (In a comparison of results for Professor Gary Natriello, a sociologist of education, one finds a total of 28 records in <em>Sociological Abstracts</em> as compared to 25 records in <em>SocINDEX</em>.)

In other respects, there are clear differences in terms of dates of coverage and also the types of materials covered.  In total, <em>Sociological Abstracts</em> provides coverage from 1952 to present, and it provides abstracts of journal articles, books, book chapters,  dissertations, and conference papers.  <em>SocINDEX with Full Text</em>, on the other hand, provides coverage from 1908 to present (though how comprehensive this coverage is for any given journal is not stated clearly).   Both databases provide some full text materials via links embedded in bibliographic records; access to e-journal articles is supplemented by Columbia's <em>e</em>-Link feature.  In terms of non-journal materials,  <em>SocINDEX</em> links to full text for books, monographs, and conference papers, as <em>Sociological Abstracts</em> does not.

Here's how results compare for a search of each database combining the phrase "educational sociology" and the word "policy":  first, the search result for Sociological Abstracts:
