When David Keefe returned home from Iraq in April 2007, he went to art school. He had been an artist prior to joining the marines, and went straight to an MFA program in painting upon return. Over the next four years, however, his experiences in Iraq began taking a severe toll on him, and though he was making art, he wasn’t able to connect his personal experiences to his work. Then, a friend introduced him to Combat Paper, an art workshop that originated with the San Francisco-based <a href="http://www.combatpaper.org">
Combat Paper Project</a>, which teaches veterans how to recycle their uniforms into paper. Initially, David was against cutting up his uniform. After years of pressing it perfectly, wearing it in marches, drills and combat, he couldn’t imagine destroying it. But he followed his gut, and tried it anyway. "As soon as I cut, all those stories started coming out," he said. He has been sharing his art, stories and experiences ever since, helping bridge understanding and empathy between veterans and non-veterans.</p>
