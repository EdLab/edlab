<p>MOOCs have notoriously low completion rates. In fact, only about 5% of learners who enroll in a MOOC complete it. The question is, what is that 5% doing that other learners are not? A recent study proposed that the difference in completion rates could relate to commenting. The researchers of this study examined three areas: 1) the number of comments made on MOOCs, 2) the demographics of groups who make fewer or more comments, and 3) the relationship between commenting and MOOC completion. To do this, they surveyed over 25,000 learners.</p>
 
<p>Regarding the first question, the researchers found that the median number of comments made on MOOCs was only three. Many learners made at least one comment, while only a small number made many. For instance, the top 10% of all commenters made at least 16 comments.</p>
 
<p>The researchers also found significant differences between learners who commented a lot and those who did not comment. Learners were more likely to comment frequently if they were older, worked part-time or not at all, were well educated, and had taken an online course before. Likewise, learners were less likely to comment if they were younger and worked or studied full-time. There was no significant difference regarding gender or country of origin.</p>
 
<p>Finally, the researchers concluded that learners who commented more frequently were much more likely to complete a MOOC than those who never commented. This is not to say that non-commenters don’t finish MOOCs or are completely inactive; many do finish courses and are active in other ways, such as reading or liking posts. That being said, the more comments a learner made in a MOOC, the more likely he or she was to complete the course.</p>
 
<p>MOOCs are only gaining popularity, and many programs even offer them for college credit. As MOOCs continue to grow, it’s important for MOOC creators to understand the factors that associated with course completion and student satisfaction.</p>
