            <b>Chrome:Google  as Social learning:The workplace</b>
<a href="http://www.masie.com/Home.htm">The MASIE Center</a> conducted a <a href="http://www.masie.com/social1">survey that assessed the use of social learning technologies in the workplace</a>.  The 1,069 respondents were self-selected from “around the globe.” The first question asked about technologies used in the workplace.  The most used technologies were corporate collaboration portals (like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Sharepoint/default.mspx">SharePoint</a>)-57%, peer coaching/teaching-52%, and media sharing (images, video)- 48%.  Wikis and blogs followed close behind at 47% and 45%, respectively.  At the bottom of the list but still high (in my opinion) was Twitter use at 12%.  I wonder how Twitter is being used in these organizations….

The biggest barrier to social learning adoption is organizational culture. This makes sense: if the environment in an organization is such that it stifles creativity and implements control, then processes such as informal and collaborative learning through social technologies are not plausible.  

Interesting survey... I'd like to see what a retest would look like in a few <del>years</del> months!

<b>The science man cometh</b>

Eric Larson has taken home the grand prize (of $100,000!) from the Intel Science Talent Search with his project that classifies mathematical objects called “fusion categories”.  Eric has been successfully making the rounds at science, math, and engineering fairs for years; I should know-- I am a girl who is hip to her <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1758282205/bclid1312351001/bctid1343612579">science fair lit!</a>  Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell, relayed a message of social responsibility to the students.

He told them, 

<blockquote>"One of your responsibilities is that you make sure that, as you become adults you don't turn away from citizens who are in need," he said "As you come to the top ... give kindness and help the people down below, because they need you more than you'll ever know."</blockquote>

A little Dr. Suess-y at the end… but I like it :)
