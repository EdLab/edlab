<p>Gamification is a popular tactic for making learning a specific skill more fun, but it’s a strategy that when taken too far can end up being pretty ineffective. Proof of this can be seen in a recent study conducted by researchers Martin and Sakkal wherein they aimed to determine whether or not music skills gained in the video game Rock Band were transferable to real-world music settings. They were also curious as to whether musical skills learned in teacher-led lessons were transferable to the videogame.</p>
 
<p>Martin and Sakkal gave undergraduate students questionnaires to complete regarding their music-based video game experience along with their experience playing any musical instruments. Thirty-four participants who had no percussion experience and had played Rock Band ten times or fewer were chosen for the study. After all participants played through a song on Rock Band to receive an initial score, the researchers divided participants into two equal groups; one group used the built-in training feature of Rock Band, while the other group was given a one-on-one lesson with a music teacher. Both instructional experiences were given on drumming. </p>

<p>After their training, participants played through the same song on Rock Band they’d performed earlier, and were once again assigned a score. Then, participants were given three tasks. First, they watched two video clips, one of a highly skilled drummer and another of an amateur drummer, and were asked to comment on their technique. Participants then had to play along with rhythm tracks displayed horizontally rather than vertically, similar to traditional music notation but unlike in Rock Band. Finally, participants engaged in a set of call-and-response tasks, wherein they had to watch a professional play short rhythmic phrases and repeat back what they saw and heard.</p> 

<p>Though those most experienced with the game were the best at skills specifically applicable to Rock Band, controlling for in-game skill, those receiving a brief lesson performed better and were better at identifying drumming techniques. For example, while greater prior experience with Rock Band was a predictor of better performance on the second task (reading music), it was not particularly helpful when it came to the call-and-response task or to commenting on technique; participants who received a real music lesson, however, performed stronger in these areas.</p>

<p>This research suggests that while a musician might be better at a music video game, the reverse is unlikely; you can't become a good musician simply by playing music video games. Perhaps music video games would benefit from a more accurate portrayal of music and musicianship. Or perhaps it’s best to just play Rock Band for fun.</p>
