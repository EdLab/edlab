In an effort to better prepare students for future STEM careers, some of which may not exist yet, it would make sense to start teaching middle school students computer programming. It would be very beneficial to not only teach students different programming languages, but the logic behind writing code, as it encourages logical thinking. Logical thinking is being able to look at problem, understand it, and come up with a solution based on a well thought-out reasoning. Learning the theory behind coding will be a great help for not only learning how to program, but for other STEM subjects as well. 

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> As we try to predict the future of the STEM fields, one thing seems to be undoubtedly clear to most people, technology will become more and more integrated into jobs and careers of all fields. So should we not better prepare students to: understand the inner workings of technology, and ways to engineer better technology? There are plenty of resources to choose from when it comes to teaching students programming, one such resource is <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6443">Codeacademy</a>. Codeacademy is a good resource for beginners that let users learn a bit about some computer languages, and practice coding for those languages. Of course it's important to not just rely on one resource, which is an important thing to keep in mind when teaching students about any subject. Instead it would be very beneficial to provide students with different resources and let them pick and choose the ones they agree the most with their <b><a href="http://www.everythingesl.net/inservices/learningstyle.php">learning style.</a></b> All in all, in an effort to strengthen our student's engineering skills, introducing them to programming earlier on could potentially lead to more advance technology in the future. Let's keep programming, everyone.
