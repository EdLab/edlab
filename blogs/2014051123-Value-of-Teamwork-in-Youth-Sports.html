          <p>
            Teamwork is a vital tool for the success of every team in any organization. In youth sports, teamwork is emphasized most of the time to ensure that youth understand its benefits. As highlighted in this <a href="http://jerseybasement.com/value-of-teamwork-in-youth-sports/">article</a>, most some little league baseball coaches work very hard to ensure that their youth know how important it is to maintain a mutual relationship with their teammates. It is always easy for a team to work as a unit when kids are able to interact very well with their teammates. For most teams in the little leagues, "winning is not everything." The main goal of most teams in the youth leagues is to ensure that, the players work together to achieve a common goal. Eventually, the kids will also benefit from the skills they learned from their teams through working together as a unit.
<p>
To be part of a team, dedication is strongly required. In order to achieve a common goal, one must be ready to work with teammates. As a college athlete, I have been exposed to certain situations on and off the field that proves teamwork is vital in sports and other aspects of life. However, it is necessary to exhibit teamwork at work and school too. Teamwork makes us better as individuals and that enables us to help make the team better as well.
