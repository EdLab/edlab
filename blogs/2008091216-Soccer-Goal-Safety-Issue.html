          <p>
            A <a href="http://www.kpho.com/sports/17458392/detail.html#-">10-year-old student</a> at an elementary school in Arizona died early today after a soccer goal fell on him. This is the second such accident at an elementary school in as many months; in May, an 8-year-old student, also in Arizona, died after holding on to the crossbar of a soccer goal. When I first started playing soccer many years ago, I was a goalie and like the students in Arizona, I always felt the rush to always jump and hold on to the bar during recess and after-school. Though I never the misfortune of a goal giving up on me, I did it see happen quite a few times to other kids in the playground. Most soccer goals are portable and very weak and are usually self made from the box by a parent or coach. They often lack labels warning parents and coaches about the risks of holding on to the goal. In most professional soccer leagues, the <a href="http://www.sportsfieldspecialties.com/index.php?q=taxonomy/term/3%2C24">goals </a>are not portable as it is planted to the ground. The recent surge in the number of soccer goal deaths raises a lot of questions and concerns about playground safety in schools. In organized school soccer, proper checks are made prior to the game, including soccer goals, to ensure the safety of everyone; it will be nice if the same precautions are afforded the people who need it most: elementary school students.
