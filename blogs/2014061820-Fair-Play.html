<p>Fair Play is a five-chapter simulation game that helps players learn about common racial biases and the professional work of graduate students. Players in this game embody the character of Jamal, a new black graduate student, and navigate through different phases of graduate studies, including finding advisors, interviewing for jobs and other funding opportunities, writing conference proposals and research papers, and working with peers and scholars. Along the journey, players encounter racial biases and have to identify and address these biases appropriately in order to continue Jamal's academic journey.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The immersive fictitious academic environment in Fair Play provides a great context for learning about graduate school culture and daily racial biases. The tabs of goals, inventory, and almanac provide efficient guidance for smooth gameplay. The almanac section is especially helpful. As various instances of racial bias emerge during gameplay, the almanac dialog box pops up and asks the player to identify the  type of bias (e.g., tokenism, racial microagression, status leveling, etc.). Brief definitions of the types of racial bias and relevant scholarly articles act as resources for the player, and each time the player correctly identifies and defines an instance of bias it is recorded in the almanac as evidence of the playerâ€™s learning progress. The gameplay also explores the life of a graduate student seeking to advance in the academic world. Fair Play can be downloaded to personal computers or laptops so users can play even without an internet connection.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Currently the resource section on the website only has a one page summary of the gameplay. It might be helpful to make all the resources that are included in the almanac section in the game available on the website so educators can prepare teaching activities along with this game.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Fair Play demonstrates the possibility of simulation for learning simultaneously  about important social issues and professional culture in a virtual environment. As more and more learning video games emerge on the market, we can expect an increase in engaging learning experiences available to a new generation of learners through innovative interactive technologies.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Fair Play helps users experience racial biases through the daily life of a graduate student.</p>
