<p><a href="http://www.footnotes-app.com/">Footnotes</a> is a cross between an on-the-go memory album and digital Easter egg hunt. The iOS app allows you to drop notes in specific locations, and others can only see your note in full if they visit the same spot. The app was seemingly created in response to the deluge of digital content that’s so easily browsed from home that it’s tempting to learn about the world from the comfort of your chair. In contrast, Footnotes deliberately uses technology to push people to engage more with the real world.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b> </p>
<p>The app allows you to leave notes in a variety of formats. Text notes can be categorized as fact or fiction, enabling storytellers to create a digital narrative for readers willing to explore. Photo, audio, and video notes allow you to leave images, sounds, and short films for others to discover. The multimedia features are particularly nice for documenting your environment and marking changes over time, as well as binding stories to places. Citations allow you to link up information to give more meaning to a single note, and there is also an option to make your notes private if you’re only interested in connecting with specific people. The interface is intuitive to use, and the filtering function lets you limit visible notes by type, subject tags, and a few other categories. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Like most apps that make a feature of geolocation data, privacy is a real concern. The ability to create private notes helps to offset a lot of the potential issues, but it’s something to keep in mind for parents, teachers, and kids alike. As an educational tool, the app is best suited to cities or highly walkable areas. The geofenced footnotes are what make the app so compelling, but they’re also a liability for places without sidewalks or walking paths—since proximity is required to see the notes, they need to be left in pedestrian-accessible spots. Another downside is that the idea for something like Footnotes is only as good as the user community it fosters. It’s active enough in NYC and other large metropolitan regions, at least, that there are plenty of discoverable notes, but it’s still new—it’s probably best to reserve judgment on the quantity and quality of notes available for now. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> The educational opportunities are vast: teachers and students can create literary walking tours, informational scavenger hunts, extracurricular "field trips," and more for class projects, extra credit opportunities, and self-guided learning and exploration. It’s easy to imagine using Footnotes to create multimedia narratives in multiple class contexts, but it’s equally useful for a creative, self-directed community or group of people with similar interests and goals. Because the app needs users to generate notes, it’s not necessarily something you can jump into and expect to get a lot out of right away. Still, with a little effort to create a network of interesting notes, Footnotes can help create a very engaging educational experience. </p>
