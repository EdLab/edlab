            There has been a great deal of talk about school safety lately with the recent anniversary of the Newtown, Conn. school massacre at Sandy Hook elementary, while at least 24 school shootings since that day have claimed at least 17 lives, according to a <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/12/the-school-shootings-you-didn-t-hear-about-one-every-two-weeks-since-newtown.html" target="_blank">recent <em>Daily Beast</em> article</a>. Unfortunately, while politicians debate about the most effective strategies for gun control, school administrators must face the challenges of operating in a culture where violent incidents in schools are still unfolding.

Few events affect children like school shootings, who see and experience the coverage of these catastrophic occurrences on television and are left with many questions about their own safety at school.  While parents and teachers often struggle with how to broach the subject of school violence, psychologists suggest that traumatic events like school shootings also pose <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/violence/school-shooting.aspx" target="_blank">an opportunity to talk to children about their fears</a> and to go over some established procedures that may help to ensure their safety at school. For help in learning how to talk to kids about school violence, consider consulting some of the following resources available through Gottesman Library.
