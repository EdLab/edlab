<a href="http://www.parchment.com/">Parchment</a> is a free online service to advise and aid the graduating high school student in his or her college search.  
<!--break-->
<b>Pros</b>:
Parchment offers a few tools that could come in handy for students looking for guidance in their college process.  After you upload all the relevant information (SAT scores, grades, etc.) Parchment will, by comparing your qualifications with all the students that have already used the service and applied to colleges, give you a good idea of your chances of acceptance at any college you're interested in.  The site also offers a “college matchup” function, where you can see which of any two colleges students tend to prefer, when offered both choices.  For any given school, the site seems to have at least a couple hundred data points, so the numbers aren't arbitrary.  Apart from these statistical tools, the website makes use of the “tacit knowledge” of its community by offering both discussion boards (the category “What are my chances at…” is the most popular) and also by offering a forum for students to upload their own college essays, and offer feedback on the essays of others.  

<b>Cons</b>:
On the “minor annoyances” side, Parchment doesn't seem to remember users very well, and I've already had to sign back in a few times.  As for more serious issues, I think it might be a missed opportunity that Parchment doesn't provide more qualitative guidance.  Crowd-sourcing essay editing is all very well, but there are some fairly complicated issues in college admissions (such as the impact of affirmative action) where more expert guidance might be appropriate.  

Our Takeaway: 
As with many of the tools I've reviewed, part of the usefulness of Parchment is dependent on network effects, and it may not yet have the community size it needs to really shine.  That said, it's a good rough-and-ready tool to help students bring some rigor to the often-vexing process of figuring out where to apply.  

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
One thing that impresses me about the program is the way they transform internally produced data into useful and informative statistics.  Is this model applicable to educational programs as well?  I remember that the topic of data-mining has come up before, but it seems much easier here than was my impression.
