            Spending habits and sequence is important when it comes to understanding how to control money. Many young adults are easily attracted to items which they usually spend most of their money on. Most do not think about the future or what they will eat, or saving for their education. Young adults are carried away with feeling they are young and can live without worries because they have the vibe and also the attitude of living it up and enjoying life. Name brands, games, and electronics are the areas where the youth spend most of their cash. Everyone will love to live lavishly and enjoy life but everything has a time and place. 

Generally speaking, it is important to learn how to spend and save. The concept of the KISS method, which stands for "Keep It Simple Stupid", helps you understand the difference between a miser and a spendthrift. Being a miser and being a spendthrift is not good for the economy. A miser is a person who hates to spend no matter what the price is, even on basic necessities. This is not a safe way of living; it is essential to learn how and when to spend. Spendthrift is a person that is wasteful and spends recklessly like many young adults do. In order to be on the safe side, an individual must understand his or her budget and how much to spend. The KISS concept simply states to spend on what you need and a little bit on what you want and save the rest for future uses on important things or emergencies.
