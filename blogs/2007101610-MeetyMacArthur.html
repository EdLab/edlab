            (keep private) If anyone is interested in how the Meety proposal for MacArthur turned-out, you can find it below (without all the gory details):

<b>Bringing Participatory Cultures to the Classroom: Facilitating Collective Intelligence using Meety</b>

<b>Summary</b>

The EdLab at Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes subjecting Meety, a rich-video and collaboration environment, to a rigorous, 12-month design-based research process.  Meety is a unique application developed in-house that allows students and teachers to capture and broadcast live the audio and video proceedings of class-based meetings, annotate the proceedings of the meeting, and receive automated knowledge resources that Meety thinks would be useful for the class-based discussion.  Meety uses sophisticated speech recognition software and semantic analysis to provide the most pertinent knowledge resources to its users.  Students and teachers can then rate-up or down resources and “back-chat” to discuss the resources Meety provides or seek clarification on the in-class discussion.  A beta version of Meety is available to educators globally at http://meety.tc-library.org

The aim of the 12-month design-based research process is to optimize Meety for use in classroom contexts.  This process will be composed of three iterations.  During each iteration the tool will be used in a classroom context where automated as well as on-site data will be collected and analyzed.  From this analysis, a set of design changes will be proposed and those accepted will be implemented into the product.  It is expected that after three iterations of this process, Meety will be the most optimal for classroom-based use.  The findings of the design-based research process will be reported to the relevant communities and the revised tool will be made available to the global education community.  

<b>Project Narrative</b>
<b>Project Overview</b>

The evolution of digital social media has irrevocably altered our established notions of consumer and producer. Technologies such as blogs and wikis, and services such as YouTube, Wikipedia and Facebook, have awakened us to new ways of interacting with media that radically diverge from the transmission model popularized by newspapers, radio and television. These new forms of online interaction have been thoroughly embraced by today's youth, who engage in participatory cultures where peers create and share self-generated content, contribute to affiliation networks, and collaboratively problem solve.  Jenkins (2007) indicates that involvement in participatory cultures can have many potential benefits for today's youth, including opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and the development of skills valued in the modern workplace(1).   Despite the potential benefits, schools often are a barrier to the growth and development of participatory cultures.  Where much of the discussion of technology in schools has focused on access, there has been little discussion of how these networked technologies can be used as a way for youth to become active knowledge producers.  There are many reasons why this is the case, but one particular problem is the lack of tools for facilitating shared knowledge creation in classroom contexts.  For example, although YouTube is a terrific way for youth to share digital video creations, it also makes school administrators uncomfortable because of the large volume of non-educationally relevant content on the site.  A related problem is that many of the online tools currently available do not take into account the physical context of the classroom, and so miss a rich reserve of interaction that can be incorporated into online exchanges.  These problems highlight an immense opportunity to embed tools into classroom contexts that encourage the creation of participatory cultures and which also take advantage of the classroom context in which such a culture can flourish.  

The purpose of the project described in this proposal is to bring participatory cultures to the classroom through the incorporation of a new technology into the familiar context of the school.  In particular, this proposal will describe Meety, an innovative technology developed at EdLab, Teachers College, Columbia University, which is designed to augment student and teacher interactions in classroom-based contexts.  Meety is a sophisticated web-based application that combines video, sound, collaboration features, and voice recognition into a single package. Given the multiple ways that Meety can be described, the best describe is to describe one way it can be used. A typical use of Meety in a classroom-based context includes the following:

<ul>
<li> One or more students in a course, using their laptop computer and webcam, record the proceedings of the class. Using a wifi Internet connection available in a wireless classroom, the real-time, live recording is available for viewing by other students and the teacher within the course using a laptop computer.
<li> While the recording is in-progress, Meety is listening to the classroom-based interaction and providing real-time knowledge resources it thinks will be useful to the students and teacher. Students and the teacher can rate the resources.  Meety will then alter the resources it provides based on these ratings.  This set of resources are considered “Meety-made” notes. 
<li>In addition to “Meety-made” notes, users can create their own notes which get shared with the class.  These notes act as a “back-chat” for further discussing the classroom-based content, the knowledge resources Meety provides, and other related issues. 
<li>After the class ends, Meety can be used as an archive of the classroom-based interaction, with the full audio and video of the course available for playback; as well, all the notes generated by students, the teacher and Meety are also made available.
</ul>
In sum, Meety provides a venue for enhanced student participation in the knowledge sharing and creation process.  This is accomplished through the following:

<ul>
<li>The activity of collaboratively-filtering the knowledge resources Meety produces requires students to be critical of the knowledge presented to them.  For example, the presentation of knowledge resources should cause the student to ask, is this piece of content relevant to the discussion at-hand?  Is this a worthwhile resource for my peers and myself to view? 
<li>In addition to providing an opportunity for being critical, the knowledge resources provided can be used to augment the student's knowledge on the topic being discussed.  For example, Meety may bring up an article that provides an opposing viewpoint to the one being discussed in the physical classroom context.  This should cause the student to think: Does this discussion cover all the possible perspectives on the issue?  
<li>The back-chat allows students to collectively discuss some topic outside the verbal discussion taking place in the physical classroom.  The backchat allows students to clarify different points, augment positions with evidence from the web, ask questions for the teacher, or question the resources Meety provides.  
</ul>
A beta version of Meety is currently available on the Internet for use in classrooms worldwide <a href="http://meety.tc-library.org">http://meety.tc-library.org</a>.

<b>Next Steps for Meety</b>

The EdLab is currently seeking a $100,000 innovation grant to subject Meety to a rigorous, 12-month design-based research process(2).  In such a process, the EdLab will identify a New York City high school that is Wi-Fi and laptop enabled and that is looking for a unique and educational use of their technical infrastructure.  The EdLab will monitor the use of the tool in the school, using both online monitoring software and classroom-based observations and surveys, to inform design changes and iterations to the tool.  Meety will be subjected to three iterations of design-based research.  Each iteration will include student and teacher use, automated and classroom-based data collection, followed by a set of proposed design changes that will be incorporated into the project, and evaluated during the following iteration.  After the three iterations, it is expected that the tool will be optimal for use in classroom-based contexts.  The outcomes of the design-based research process will communicated to the educational community, and the revised tool will be made available to all schools and educators interested in using it in their schools.

<b>Evaluation Plan</b>

The project's research director will be charged with assessing the success of the project.  The assessment will address the following questions:
<ol>
<li>Did the design-based research process sufficiently surface the needs of students and teachers?  Did these needs guide design changes or were other factors more influential?  
<li>What were the quality of student-to-student interactions, and teacher-to-student interactions, using Meety?  Did Meety enhance opportunities for clarification and interjection?  What types of interactions did or didn't Meety promote?  
<li>What features of Meety were the most successful?   For example, was the video, sound, back-chat, or automated resource collection, more successful than other features?  
<li>How did the technical infrastructure affect the roll-out?  Did computers or Internet connectivity prove challenging?
</ol>
