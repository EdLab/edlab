I just read this behavior science article that I found very interesting. Here is the summary and the implications for education. 

This paper studied airport custom officers to see how they decide which passengers to search. The researchers aimed to model the officers decision-making strategies, which integrate a lot of cues and heuristic, and studied how expertise impact the selections of decision strategies.  

The results:
<blockquote>
Did experts and novices differ in their cue validity estimates?
<b>Expert officers showed a higher consensus than the novices among the cue validity. (flight origin, gender, nationality, age, amount of luggage, eye contact with officer, clothes, gait)</b>

Did experts and novices differ in strategy selection?
<b>There were clear differences between the experts' and novices' decisions, in terms of the passengers picked, strategies applied.</b>

Does dispersion of the cue validity estimates mediate expertâ€”novice differences in strategy selection?
<b>Cue dispersion might contribute to the expert-novice differences in strategy use but also points to the operation of additional factors.</b>
</blockquote>

In short, expert officers tend to rely on simple, non-compensatory decision trees. (which makes sense as they make hundreds of decisions every day and obtain regular feedback (although the feedback may be incomplete). People with the absence of experience within a decision domain (novices) seem to have tendency to use a compensatory strategy. 

<i>Expertise is often associated with higher decision quality, but it doesn't imply higher decision accuracy. Intuitive expertise in decision making - in some situations - may not reflect the consideration of multiple cues, but the use of simple heuristics. </i>

This study also pointed out several important issues, such as indication for predictive strength (statistical structure), informal exchange of knowledge and subjective experience, expert biases, adaptive nature for novice to become expert.  

It's a very common approach to model experts and novices in user modeling in education. We wish novices take the minimum amount of time and effort to become experts in the domains. Applying the lessons learned from the behavior science studies in our apps, for instance, 

<b>NLT:</b> experts know where/when to read new, interesting articles (from search or stream categories). Novices tend to explore and wander. Bridging the novice and expert gap, more adaptive support such as visualization to enhance awareness, badges/status, etc., (more pronounced personalized profiles, not necessary badges (I don't like badges personally)), more social features to enhance informal communications. Though, we do not want to dichotomize our users, we want to keep a balance novice->expert ecosystem. Features (whatever that could be) that tap in existing human behaviors seem to be the win for a long run. 

<b>SurveySidekick:</b>
What elements constitute a scientifically sound survey? 
What are the strategies for creating a scientifically sound survey?  
Tutorials certainly capture the key elements of a good survey but what we need is more clearer strategies to follow through the survey prototyping process. Again, visual awareness, pronounced profiles, and social features are three aspects of adaptive support. <b>Capturing the experts' intuitions may be intuitive, but may not always win, it's the awareness, and support for the process that count!</b> Research team has some good results to share, stay tuned. 

So on and so forth~
