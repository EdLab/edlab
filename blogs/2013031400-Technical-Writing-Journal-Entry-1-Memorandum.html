            Hello everybody,

I've decided to begin a journal made of what I'm learning in my technical education class at LaGuardia. This is actually an English class about how to properly compose an engineering paper and to improve your overall writing. Today's assignment required us to write a memo in an imaginative situation.  In this setting, I am the owner of an interior design company and my head designer has been assigned to redecorate our clients main office. The issue is that my client is dissatisfied so to address the problem, I write a memo to my head designer explaining the situation. Any tips or suggestions for my memo would be greatly appreciated.

<blockquote>
To: Jacob Daxter, Head Designer
From: Sebastian Sackey
Date: March 13, 2013
Subject: Redesign of Legacy Inc.'s Main Office Due Tuesday 

Although your redecoration of Legacy Inc.'s Main Office includes the necessary accommodations requested by our client, it still fails to meet the standards of comfort desired. In order to ensure the complete satisfaction of our customer I have proposed a redesign of the office including the desired specifics and arrangement of furniture. 

The main focus of our client is the level of comfort provided for their visitors as customer satisfaction is a service they cherish most, as do we. For this reason a rearrangement of the office furnitures is of utmost importance.

The front desk should not be too close to the office entrance for the reason that non-employees tend to line up in front of the desk causing the area to become congested. The length of the ceiling fan's suspension below the ceiling should remain within our client's company standards.

In addition, seats for non-employees must be lined up against  the walls on each side of the reception desk and should not exceed three rows. These suggested changes will aid in the overall functionality of the office and will further uphold our integrity as an interior design company.

I have proposed these changes to ensure our clients happiness. Because we are pressed for time in this project I have determined that it would be most efficient to complete this assignment by next week Tuesday. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to call or email me.
