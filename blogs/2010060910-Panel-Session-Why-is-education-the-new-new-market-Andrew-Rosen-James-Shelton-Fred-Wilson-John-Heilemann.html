            James Shelton: office of innovation in US DOE to support and drive innovation in education. 
Andrew Rosen: Kaplan CEO
Fred Wilson: Union Square Ventures. 

Heilman (moderator): Education as a market on the verge of tipping - what work is being done at federal level to change this space to more of a market open to innovation?

James Shelton: Example of congressional legislation that supports innovation only through non-profit companies - signals a cultural bias in America against for-profit educational institutions. 

Andrew Rosen: Huge amount of money in education signals potential for innovation, but much of this funding comes through government. This is why you see a lot of the innovation focused on supplemental education. 

Fred Wilson: "Free" as a viable business model in education, which may be important since you may be competing against "free" public schools. Traditional inputs to education (schools, teachers, etc.) were often an impediment or prohibitive cost for funding new ventures in education. Now, Internet technologies changes what the inputs have to be and how much needs to be invested to get viable prototypes --- more likely to get funding in to this area in the future. 

Shelton: Education is a lagging indicator of economic health since it is funded by housing prices in prior years. In the next 3-5 years, districts will have to make hard decisions about budgets and this could be opportunity for innovation. Also emphasizes the international competition where other nations are investing in their sectors. We have a window of 2 years to capitalize on our competitive advantage in education, but we risk being surpassed by others if we don't move. 

Wilson: education not a market-based economy, especially in K-12. This prevents supply meeting demand and he sees this as a big problem in terms of innovation. 

Heilman (to panelists): Where is the innovation happening right now that is promising?

Wilson: foundational technology (open source, platforms that can work inside of schools and outside), business model innovations (eg. "free" education), content/curricula/crowdsourced instruction. Technology finally getting pulled in to schools is important and will drive a lot of this change -- a lot of this pull will happen from the students/kids who will do this despite objections of their teachers and administrators who try to keep doors to tech closed. 

Rosen: winners over long-term are those who make the learning process more efficient. How big the market is depends on how much gov't can reform in introducing market-based incentives in the education sector. 

Shelton: Innovation is happening a lot more outside the U.S. -- we have to wake up to this. We are now at place where technology is going to have large-scale impact inside classrooms (low cost devices, cloud computing, ubiquitous Internet access). 

Heilman (to panelists): Which segments of education sector have most growth opportunities?

Rosen: where are the ones who have interest in education have the choice to make their educational choices. K-12 is not a good place in this respect since decisions made by bureaucracy. To change the system, must change the way education is funded. Advocates full information and choice for educational decisions. 

Shelton: Disagrees ... completely open and free markets may not always serve the best interests, especially in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Need for right level of regulation. 

Shelton: need to shift away from a "seat time" based model that rewards how many people you attract to a results based model that rewards developing competency.
