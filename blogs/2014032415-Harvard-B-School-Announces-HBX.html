          <p>
            Harvard Business School <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/03/business-school-expands-online/">has just announced</a> their new online learning program, <a href="hbx.hbs.edu">HBX</a>. Despite the "X" HBX is quite different from Harvard-led MOOC platform <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>. Focused instead, on furthering HBS's existing "case study" model, while reaching a new demographic through their CORe program, HBX promises to make HBS-level training available to more people for a lower cost. The HBX CORe model of three "interlocking" foundational courses is described in the <i>Harvard Gazette</i> piece listed above as, 
<blockquote>
The initial HBX offering, CORe (Credential of Readiness), comprises three interlinked courses:  “Business Analytics,” “Economics for Managers,” and “Financial Accounting.” 
</blockquote>
The piece goes on to describe CORe further: 
<blockquote>
HBS Professor Bharat Anand, faculty chair of HBX, says that CORe will be a rigorous program designed for serious and committed learners. “The HBX faculty team has thought carefully about how to create an online offering that mirrors the energy you find in an HBS classroom and that allows students to benefit from the diversity and experiences of other students.”
</blockquote>

What strikes me as most interesting, is the fact that this model is less a MOOC like edX and more a hybrid model similar to <a href="http://plusacumen.org/courses/">+Acumen's online/in-person leadership courses</a> (<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8863">here</a> are my thoughts from week 1 of one of these courses), they are also a departure in their focus on those new to the business trenches, as well as undergraduates, two populations purposefully left-out of the traditional business school population. For example, HBX explains: 

<blockquote>
CORe is designed to provide basic business fundamentals to segments of the population we've never directly addressed before: undergraduates, graduate students in non-business fields, and people who have just begun their first jobs in business but want a better foundation so they can thrive earlier in their careers.
</blockquote>

Finally, HBX will officially launch this June with additional offerings beyond CORe for established professionals in the works.
