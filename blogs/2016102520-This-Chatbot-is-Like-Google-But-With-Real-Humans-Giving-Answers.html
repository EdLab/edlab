<p>Sensay is a chat bot with a spin. Instead of robotically replying to your messages, Sensay connects you with other real humans, all anonymously, all through its chatbot. Whether you need inspiration, advice, travel tips, or recipes, Sensay intends to connect you with someone who has the experience you need. When using the app, a person requests a conversation topic then waits as the bot finds someone who can chat. As Sensay’s motto says, it’s a single contact on your phone, but with the experience of millions.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I have to admit, I was skeptical at first, hesitant to even download the app. Even with a robotic moderator to smooth over the introduction, how could I possibly feel comfortable diving into a conversation with a random stranger on my phone? Yet I did, and honestly, it was better than I thought it would be. This is mostly because Sensay provides a completely anonymous, yet still personal, platform for two people to converse. Sensay is available on several major communication platforms, including texts and Facebook message. I used the latter.</p>
 
<p>Sensay’s chatbot gives recommendations for conversation topics based on information users provide, and they can choose one of these suggestions or create their own. After users choose a conversation topic, the bot contacts human Sensays (people who give advice) and connects one with the user. At no time does the bot reveal information about either participant in the conversation. In fact, everything takes place through the bot, meaning that it almost seems like you’re talking to the chatbot, except with the knowledge of a real person.</p>
 
<p>After several failed attempts and at Sensay’s recommendation, I started a conversation seeking relationship advice. At first, it was odd. I really had to force myself to converse with this enigmatic other. But after a few exchanges, I realized the other person was really there to listen and give advice, and I started actually wanting to share more personal details. Whether or not I use the advice, Sensay kick started a personal conversation with another human, and I think this could be invaluable for anyone feeling lonely or unheard.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Perhaps the Sensay user base is still small, or perhaps they’re just not very active during the day, but my first two attempts at starting a conversation went unanswered. On my third attempt, I asked for a good book recommendation and only received a curt reply: "Anything by Christine Coulter." When I asked a follow-up question, the other user disconnected from the conversation. In other words, Sensay cannot always match you with someone who can answer your questions satisfactorily, and it might fail a few times before you’re able to have a real conversation. Because of this, Sensay is not a great tool for immediately finding answers, but rather for more involved discussions.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>At the end of my relationship advice conversation, I asked the other person why they used Sensay. "Sometimes just Googling things gets so old," they responded. In this age of constantly sharing personal experiences and information with others online, I understand that. Google is becoming impersonal, and Sensay provides a platform for intimate dialogue. This type of one-on-one anonymous yet respectful conversation is difficult to find even on less-spammed discussion boards.</p>
 
<p>Although Sensay doesn’t seem like a great go-to for all of the things the creators thought it would be (most likely because its user base is still small), it is a great system for anyone seeking personal contact with another human online. I recommend it for people seeking advice or inspiration but who don’t feel comfortable asking the real humans in their lives. I also recommend it for people interested in conversing in a new way.</p>
