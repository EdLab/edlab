            Work ethic is an important part of maintaining a job. <a href="http://www.gnd.com/6-things-that-will-get-you-fired.php" target = "blank">Employees</a> usually tend to overate themselves when it comes to their performances at work. However, research has shown that those who usually deny slacking off at work are most likely the ones not doing their work. It maybe that they are always tired at work, coming in late, and not doing the work at hand. Bosses and managers usually see what we cannot see about our work performance. Bosses hate unreliable employees and rather have people they can trust to be at work on time every day. This means even an employee being late once a month will be seen as unreliable. Managers see employees constantly asking for directions as unproductive as they prefer employees who try and figure things out and then ask for clarification.
<p>
Having a good work ethic means that you do your work at all times even if it means others can do it if you do not do it. This means that you are doing the bare minimum and not being productive enough. Companies like an employee who is always at work and ready to go. Employees with too much emergencies and family problems are often a big burden to the company. Constant complains and bad mouthing the company and its staff might lead to dismissal when word goes around. It is important to remain positive and keep negative comments and gossip to yourself. Going on social media sites and other sites that are not work related is to be avoided because bosses see it as a sign of unproductiveness. It is always important to work hard and stay interested in the work you doing even when the work is not interesting. Try to remain focus and inventive to challenge yourself to do you task.
