<b>Visual Information Management</b>

Download software <a href="http://www.thebrain.com/download">here</a>.

TheBrain is a dynamic mind mapping software that lets you link your ideas, files and web pages the way you think. You can visualize thinking, conceptualize ideas, take notes, and brainstorm by dragging and dropping. You can also create and share a context-rich information environment that reflects the way you think. <br>

<b>Price:</b>
PersonalBrain 5 Pro	  $249.95 
PersonalBrain 5 Core	  $149.95 
PersonalBrain 5 Free (trial version)	$0.00 <br>

<b>How it works:</b>
Once you install the software and open it and choose “new brain” under “file” in dropdown menus on the top. Click new brain and you are asked to fill out a blank which can be either a project title or a main idea. After creating node, by clicking right mouse button, you can add image corresponding to that node, event, thought type, and forget (delete) the node. You can import files from various file types such as firefox bookmark, xml, owl. Also, you can export “brain” file into xml, html, etc. <br>

<b>Prop points:</b>
Even though it seems that TheBrain assumes that knowledge is represented based on its meaning and accordingly the way of organizing knowledge structure is limited to propositional network, it left room that user can represent their knowledge not only in verbal, but also in a perceptual way by providing a insert tool that users can use images. This is an advanced function that cannot be found in “freemind.”  Also, the title can be either a child node or parent node. Since there is no idea that is placed all the way at top hierarchically, this module corresponds to how we think. <br>


<b>Drop points:</b>
Once a child or a parent node is created, it is automatically placed in a certain spot. After that, its location cannot be changed. In other words, users cannot change its position. This makes it hard for users to put some related child nodes closely that they think they are related to each other. <br>

<b>Final score: </b>
TheBrain recognize that knowledge in a box is dead knowledge and help users activate their knowledge by providing visualized information or knowledge minding tool. It also provides not only propositional network, but also image attaching tools. It is very encouraging and beneficial to use TheBrain, in that knowledge is not just represented based on its meaning. Therefore knowledge visualizing tool has to provide various way of representing users' knowledge. In this point, TheBrian matches with nature of our flexible thinking. <br>
