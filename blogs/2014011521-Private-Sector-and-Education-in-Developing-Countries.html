            There is a common perception among most people that government is in charge of providing education for its citizens.  In the US, the government ensures that every child can attend school for free, which is a privilege because children in different nations don't have this kind of benefit. Although some private sectors in the United States provide education, which is usually at the college or university level, it is very costly. As a result of that, many students prefer to attend schools run by the government. However, this is not the case in some developing countries. 

In Ghana, researchers in charge of <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/there-role-private-sector-education">this project</a> found that out of the 207 schools located in the Kasoa area of the capital city Accra, only seven were public schools. In essence, the remaining 200 schools are operated by either a for-profit or non-profit private sector organization. This is because when people move within the country for jobs, private education sectors are the first to respond by providing educational services for the local community. 

This reminded me of the school I attended when I was in Ghana. It was a for-profit school that provided me with a quality education. Private education sectors are not popular in the United States, but it is highly popular in low-income countries. Students enrolled in private primary schools doubled from 11% to 22% between 1990 and 2010. This indicates that the private sector plays an important role in providing education for children in such countries. The government can't always be responsible for this as some federal governments are not reliable or strong enough to provide a quality education for its citizens. This void is often filled by the private sector.
