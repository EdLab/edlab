            Well I think the big education news this week was the decline in for-profit new student enrollment reported by the Wall Street Journal.  In response to some <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6320">high profile cases</a> and widespread criticism, the schools have reigned in some of their more aggressive recruiting tactics, which seems to have led to declines in enrollment of 20-40%.  Skanda and I discussed for-profit schools <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6272">a few weeks ago</a>, and it does seem like some of these schools really skate the line between educational institutions and the movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoTx9RpL5W4 ">Boiler Room</a>.

It's striking that these large drops in enrollment are a direct result of changing recruiter compensation.  As the WSJ reports: “Cutting recruiter commissions had a rapid and profound effect at Capella Education Inc., which introduced a new pay structure in January: New-student enrollment dropped 35.8% in the first quarter, compared with a 10.7% decline in the period immediately before the launch.” So these changes look like a step in the right direction, although I personally would like to see less scrutiny of recruitment methods (where only for-profit schools come out looking poorly), and more scrutiny of outcomes, like graduation rates and outgoing debt loads, which are, after all, where the real problem lies.
