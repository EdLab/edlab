            Most scientists can recall the moment that inspired them to become continue studying science outside of school and make a career out of it. Below is a Vialogue of TED speaker Carl Lewis discussing how he and other scientists were inspired to study more of the sciences. He tells his tale of how nature has inspired him to become a scientist, and how he and several other scientists, found their inspirations randomly. Lewis believes that we can create more of these random moments of inspirations for students by exposing through these five steps: starting early and repeating often, exposing students to real-life science, connecting students to mentors in the sciences, linking science to other subjects especially the arts, and letting students explore on their own. These five steps are a great way for students to find their inspirations in learning the sciences by freely exploring the subject.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> Carl Lewis makes some interesting points when it comes to how to inspire students to study more about the sciences. What is especially interesting is the point of linking science to other subjects, like the arts for example, and this can be extended to all STEM subjects. In fact there are many educators who are adding art education to STEM education, and thus creating <b><a href="http://steam-notstem.com/about/">STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics)</a></b>. STEAM education is adding creativity and an artistic vision to STEM education, encouraging more students to be more innovative as well as creative. It's a great way to draw in students to STEM education, and it might led to more beautiful and innovative technologies in the future. For educators who want to make STEM subjects more interesting and engaging for student, STEAM education would be worth researching. Let's get creative, everyone.
