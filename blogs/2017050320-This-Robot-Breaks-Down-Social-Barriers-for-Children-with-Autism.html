<p><a href="http://www.herts.ac.uk/kaspar">Kaspar the robot</a> was designed to help young children with autism be more capable and comfortable with social interaction. Created by researchers at the University of Hertfordshire, Kaspar has realistic human features, but with easy-to-read, simplified facial expressions. This allows children with autism to be able to better understand the responses of Kaspar than they might other people, which leads to their learning how to have safe social interactions.</p>

<p>Geared toward children aged 5-10, Kaspar can talk, imitate eating, play the tambourine, and sing. Over 170 kids have worked with this child-sized bot over the course of 10 years of development, and the researchers hope that soon all schools and clinics that need this robot will have access to one. Kaspar will soon <a href="https://www.herts.ac.uk/about-us/news/2017/march/humanoid-robot-to-help-children-with-autism-to-be-trialled-in-the-nhs">be part of a clinical trial</a> conducted by Britainâ€™s National Institute for Health Research. In the meantime, Kaspar will continue working with kids with autism to help expand their social and emotional development.</p>

<p>Why might interacting with a social robot help some children with autism feel more comfortable than they would with another person? What might Kaspar mean for the future of inclusive or special needs classrooms? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/36372/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:31 RuthS:</b> I wonder how teachers would feel about incorporating this social robot into their classrooms. It seems unlikely that a teacher would be able to control this bot and teach the class, so there would need to be another adult in the room specifically focused on controlling Kaspar.</p>

<p><b>@02:18 RuthS:</b> Social robots like Kaspar could be predictive of what's to come in classrooms across the board. If Kaspar is specifically geared to help children with autism, there could be different social robots designed to help children with other mental or physical needs.</p>
