<i>Founded in 2004, Games for Change facilitates the creation and distribution of social impact games that serve as critical tools in humanitarian and educational efforts.  Unlike the commercial gaming industry, we aim to leverage entertainment and engagement for social good. To further grow the field, Games for Change convenes multiple stakeholders, highlights best practices, incubates games, and helps create and direct investment into new projects.</i> (From the <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/about/">G4C site</a>).

<b>Gaming for Good is not an Oxymoron</b>
<a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/festival2013/"><br>The Games for Change</a> festival recently celebrated its tenth anniversary.  The festival is hosted by a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation, <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change</a>, whose mission is to "catalyze social impact through digital games."  The Festival, held from June 17-19th in 2013, is also led by a Board of Directors that includes luminaries from a wide range of industries, from real estate to mainstream digital gaming companies, paired with major support from both <a href="http://www.packard.org/">The David and Lucile Packard Foundation</a> and Zynga.org and partner sponsors including <a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/site/">Carnegie Mellon’s Educational Technology Center</a>, <a href="http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/">The Joan Ganz Cooney Center</a> and the<a href="https://tribecafilminstitute.org/"> Tribeca Film Institute</a>.  Held most recently at <a href="http://newworldstages.com/">New World Stages</a> in NYC, the conference aims to support digital games that foster greater social innovation, learning, and help to address global issues such as poverty, discrimination, and more. </p>
<p>
<b>Personal Takeaways</b><br>
Upon initial descent into the subterranean nightclub like space, conference goers were greeted by a wall of graffiti AND a booth featuring Joel Klein and Newscorp’s newest venture, <a href="http://www.amplify.com/">Amplify</a>.  High "bar-style" tables lined an illuminated back wall that featured Twitter-based interactions and questions like, "What have you learned so far at the festival?"   Conference panels and discussion sessions were held in short time blocks across three intimate theaters.  These three theatres were well lit, audio was masterfully handled and the acoustics were optimized to help facilitate and increase the level of presenter engagement.  That being said, because of these same elements, audience participation was a bit more challenging, as it seemed awkward and intimidating for audience members to "call out" their questions to the stage.  Despite this minor limitation, the conference seemed to foster engrossing discussion, "freewheeling conversations" in-between sessions, and to allow for a truly impressive "back channel" dialogue across a wide range of social media.  It is these informal gatherings, online discussions ,and casual meetings between sessions that have become a hallmark of truly immersive, innovative conferences.

<p>
<b>Gaming the Globe</b><br>
Out of the few panels and discussions I was able to attend, I was most impressed with the last two presented on Wednesday June 19th.  Both <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/festival2013/program/gaming-thought-leader-eric-zimmerman/">Eric Zimmerman</a> and <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/festival2013/program/gaming-thought-leader-brenda-romero/">Brenda Romero (Braithwaite)</a> stood-out as passionate, unique presenters.  Zimmerman, who received a standing ovation for his ardent presentation, focused on social change and the role of digital interactions in creating and facilitating revolution.  Romero, on the other hand, opened her presentation with a touching, personal <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/11/brenda-romero-train-board-game-holocaust/">exploration of the inspiration behind her holocaust-focused board game, "Train"</a>, and her other games focused on issues ranging from slavery to the Irish potato famine.  She, more than anyone else, seems to have the broadest and perhaps most innovative view of what encompasses a "game."  In addition to these last stand-out presentations, my overall experiences with Games for Change festival were invigorating and inspiring, full of interesting insights, new connections and a general feeling of hope. Why? Because there are clearly so many individuals who believe in the power of games to help change minds, foster learning and improve our world.  Game-on!
