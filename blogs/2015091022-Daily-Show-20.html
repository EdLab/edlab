<p><b style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Daily Show 2.0 and the Political Re-Education of America</b><br /></p>
<i>With a new host, The Daily Show’s relationship to hard news may change</i>

<p>Where do students get their news? A <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-get-news-from-comedy-central/">classic groundbreaking poll</a> conducted by the Pew Research Center pointed to, wait for it, comedy shows. Pew found that 21% of people aged 18 to 29 named <i>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</i> and <i>Saturday Night Live/</i> as regular sources for learning about presidential campaign news. In a stark comparison, just 23% of the same youth cohort named traditional broadcasters like the nightly news broadcasts produced by ABC, CBS and NBC as their news source. Walter Cronkite wouldn't be pleased.</p>

<p>This trend has continued to hold. In a 2014 poll, 12% of Americans online mentioned <i>The Daily Show</i> as a news source, virtually on par with USA Today (12%) and The Huffington Post (13%). Perhaps even more startling, when the numbers were aggregated across the political spectrum, <i>The Daily Show</i> and <i>The Colbert Report</i> earned approximately the same level of trust as more conventional news, current affairs and commentary outlets like Mother Jones, Slate, and The Huffington Post. </p>

<p>On September 28th, former correspondent Trevor Noah will take over the reins of <i>The Daily Show</i>, one of television’s most celebrated comedy and news brands. What can we expect? And what will its impact be on the news and information diet of young Americans? </p>

<p>In interviews, Noah intimated that he would be moving away from the show’s focus on politics. Instead, Noah said that he would be focusing more on the preferred media of the coveted 18- to 34-year-old demographic. Namely, he would look to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jon-stewart-daily-show-trevor-noah-will-focus-more-on-buzzfeed-and-gawker-than-fox-news-10433045.html">online media sources</a> including Buzzfeed, Gawker and other social media sites rather than the show’s regular bugaboo, Fox News, and the rest of the cable television universe. </p>

<p>On his <i>Daily Show</i> appearances, Noah proved adept at skewering mainstream issues. As a multilingual person from South Africa, he has a keen outsider’s perspective. Noah proved capable at making fun of some of the most pressing social issues in America today, namely race and poverty. It's not surprising, these topics flow from his sharp stand-up routines. Also, Noah has the silky smooth delivery and easy confidence that is necessary in an anchor-based show where you become a voice of authority, like it or not. </p>

<p>Noah will want to make his mark by distinguishing himself from Stewart. But a couple of factors will keep him focused on bare knuckle politics and hard news to the benefit of young viewers who use <i>The Daily Show</i> as an information resource.</p> 

<p>First, despite the inevitable turnover from the old guard, <i>The Daily Show</i> cast and writing staff will remain relatively static. As such, it will be incredibly difficult to make a wholesale paradigmatic shift in a show that has been running so smoothly for so long. Just <a href=" http://observer.com/2013/06/the-daily-showdown-why-john-oliver-is-the-best-thing-to-happen-to-late-night-since-colbert-video/">check out this review</a> of Jon Oliver’s sublime turn when he took over the desk as a point of reference. If it ain’t broke.</p>

<p>Also, the audience for <i>The Daily Show</i> skews towards politically-oriented college students and well-educated graduates. Force-feeding a discerning, loyal audience something it may not like will probably prove too risky in the short-term. Too much celebrity and entertainment could force people elsewhere, such as <i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i> or <i>Last Week Tonight with Jon Oliver.</i> Both hosts are hyper-intelligent comedic forces of nature with proven records and devoted fan bases. Ignoring them would be at Noah's peril. </p>

<p>Finally, we can't stop witnessing the media firestorm better known as the Summer of Trump which is just entering its fall edition. This kind of ratings catnip is too difficult for any current events show to ignore. This is especially true given the biggest, longest and most expensive event that will be occurring over the next fourteen months—the U.S. Presidential election. We may learn more about what Donald Trump thinks of the Iowa caucuses more than we would care to. </p>

<p>Noah demonstrates sharp foresight by peering over the current media horizon to the increasing impact of online media on young people's daily lives. This trend will only become stronger and it would be shortsighted to ignore. However, on behalf of information hungry students, I hope he continues <i>The Daily Show’s</i> incredible tradition of skewering politicians and criticizing spotty media coverage, based on hard facts and accurate news, so that young viewers continue to develop an informed interest in the political world around them. </p>

<p>Although I don’t expect the revamped program to be radically different when it debuts, I am sure in 20 years when we are looking for his successor, <i>The Daily Show with Trevor Noah</i> will bear the indelible marks of its new host. </p>

<p><i> The Daily Show with Trevor Noah debuts on September 28th on Comedy Central. </i></p>
