          <p>
            Over the past two decades, the Hispanic population in America has increased dramatically and they are now the largest minority group. As such, it comes as no surprise that Hispanics now make up nearly a quarter of all public school enrollment across the country. According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/education/young-latino-students-dont-see-themselves-in-books.html?ref=education">this</a> New York Times article, despite their large and increasing numbers in schools, Hispanic children, especially in the elementary year, often fail to relate to the characters and stories they read.

A review of 3,400 books by the Cooperative Children's Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Education found that just over three percent of those books were written on or about Hispanics.  It is no secret that students enjoy reading about characters that look like them or share things in common with their lifestyle, but with most characters being white and a lack of similarity of the stories to their own lives, many Hispanic students have lost or are losing interest in books.

I believe that schools should have an equal amount of books about Hispanic characters and authors as they do for white authors and characters. This is especially crucial for those students who don't like school to begin with and find any excuse not to read. The possible and often negative consequences for such students are all too common. Should there be a change in book offerings to meet the demands of the burgeoning Hispanic enrollment in our public schools or should Hispanic students have to adapt to the characters and stories like other minority groups?
