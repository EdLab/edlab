          <p>
            According to the research done by the <a href=" http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/06/06/34execsum.h32.html?intc=EW-DC13-TOC">Editorial Projects in Education Research</a>, the national graduation rate for high school is at its highest point since the 1970s. This improvement shows the class of 2010 had almost 75% of its students graduate. Researchers have concluded that with the increasing graduation rate, the percentage of students earning their diplomas on time will pass that of the historical record held at 77.1%. However, many students leave high school without a diploma. Over one million students in America will not have the privilege of holding a diploma thus making their chances of finding a good job highly unlikely because they do not have the proper academic training.

The recent economic recession has giving hope to high school dropouts. Many nonprofits, profit ventures, schools and states have created dropout recovery programs. However, less than one out of five dropouts manage to get a diploma under this program which shows how hard it to decrease the dropout rate. Recently, the GED is going under a transformation. More and more people are using it as an alternative or a second chance to receive credentials which is somehow similar to a high school diploma.
