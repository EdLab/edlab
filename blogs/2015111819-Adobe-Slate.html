<p>In the past, student presentations have almost always taken the form of PowerPoint slides and poster boards. Now <a href="https://standout.adobe.com/slate/">Adobe Slate</a> is adding another option to the mix. Though not created with the sole intention of providing students with a way to create a book report—its target audience includes small businesses, artists, and many others—Slate is nonetheless providing children with a visually appealing and technologically immersive way to tell stories, but without requiring a computer programming degree.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Slate is a lot like <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> in that it provides templates for users so they can create attractive designs without having to do any of the actual coding—Adobe does the heavy-lifting for you. One of the best parts of Slate’s design options is its focus on high quality, eye-catching images, as well as its smooth scrolling—a popular layout style used by many websites today. This format is ideal for both desktop and tablet devices, and makes presentations more visually engaging for readers.</p>

<p>As an educational tool, Slate is a fantastic way to get students excited about presenting their projects in a way that makes use of new technology so they can go beyond their tri-fold posters and glue sticks. Students will undoubtedly be excited to see such a clean and sophisticated final product, and take pride knowing that they were able to create that.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because Slate is template-based, there is a limit to how much flexibility users have with design options like text manipulation. Although this can be an advantage for keeping the app simplified for new users, those who are a little more experienced might find the lack of flexibility frustrating. Another drawback for Slate is that it does not offer video integration, which could be an excellent addition for presentations, especially in the classroom.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Adobe Slate is advertised as a way to tell stories, and it certainly has the means for users to make that happen. However, at its’ simplest, Slate can be a valuable educational tool to help students become more excited about their school projects. The interface is easy to maneuver and the final products could fool anyone into believing that you majored in visual design—we’re just waiting to see upcoming additional features to make the app even more multimodal for students.</p>
