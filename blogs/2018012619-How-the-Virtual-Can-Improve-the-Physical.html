<p>Sal Khan’s career in education has traveled many paths: from teacher to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> creator, to lab school designer. Although his experience has taken him from in-person education to online and back again, he doesn’t see the two fields in opposition. "I’ve always believed that virtual is not in competition with the physical," says Khan, "that they can complement each other." Instead of viewing them as two heads eternally butting, he found aspects from each that could improve the other.</p>

<p>When he designed <a href="https://khanlabschool.org">Khan Lab School</a>, Khan used some of the characteristics of Khan Academy to innovate in-person education. The most significant change from a traditional school is the practice of personalized and mastery-based learning, as opposed to age-based, one-size-fits-all subjects. Students at Khan Lab School are grouped in different levels according to skills rather than age, and their own interests dictate many of the projects they choose to take up during the school day. In this case, the virtual feeds into the physical, sparking a new type of education centered on individual students rather than the classroom.</p>

<p>What other ways can virtual and physical education impact one another? How could personalized learning be more effective than traditional education? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41222">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:31 Cinthia Fabian:</b> Oh, that scene with the little girl being asked to identify areas of improvement was not only FREAKING ADORABLE (so adorable!!), but I can really appreciate helping people build that sort of self-awareness early on.</p>

<p><b>@02:27 Dallas Milanovich:</b> I think this is the sweet spot educators should be going for - online learning can be very isolating, but when used to complement in-person learning, I think it can be a great supplement. If you're struggling or need a new way to focus, this could be a great answer.</p>
