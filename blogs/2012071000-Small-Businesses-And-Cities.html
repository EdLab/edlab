            For any business to be successful, there are some almost certain universal features or resources it must have such as capital, staff, a vision and a strong user base, among others. As a result of this, starting a business is always a risk for any aspiring entrepreneur. An entrepreneur has to be willing to take criticism and get back up from failing in their recent opportunities. The entrepreneur has to be determined. They have to act towards any opportunity that comes their way. This is especially true for small business, especially the ones that need to be located at a physical location. Location is one of the key elements in the success of any business and finding the right one could determine the ultimate success or failure of that business.

There are some business friendly cities in the U.S. that helps businesses such as Oklahoma City, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Atlanta, Colorado Springs, and Omaha. Oklahoma City <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2012/smallbusiness/1206/gallery.best-places-launch-cities/?iid=SF_SB_River"> ranked first on CNN Money's list </a> of business friendly cities. Oklahoma City was first mainly because it has a low cost of living, which inevitably helps small businesses. The fact that small businesses have been helped by a growth in consumers, due to population increases, is another reason.
