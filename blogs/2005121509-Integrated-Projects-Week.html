            I thought to share the following note about the Integrated Projects Week (IPW) from my son Lu's teacher Linda Vasu (with Linda's permission), because I think that The School at Columbia is good at using the local resources as a learning community besides taking advantage of new technologies.

Each semester, the school has an Integrated Projects Week (IPW). In IPW, the kids of different grades mix, form a group of 5-6 kids each, and conduct a project with a particular theme for a whole week. Kids get to choose what themes they prefer and there are different projects, e.g., touring, drawing, cooking, experimenting with scientific concepts, etc.. Each group produces some products at the end of the week such as concrete architecture, slideshows of photographs or videos with stories, scientific experiments, or blog writings. Parents are invited to see their final products at the end of the week.

Lu always looks forward to the IPW. I thought that there were quite several benefits of such an IPW: 1) it socializes kids of different grade levels so that they can learn from and help each other; 2) it turns the local community into a learning community; 3) it's fun for kids because they get to "play" for the whole week.

I think this is a great approach for us to think about our EdLab projects.

Hi everyone,
Here we go....  Welcome!
Talk of The Town is for those interested in walking, observing, sampling cupcakes, engaging in conversation and the literary scene in a selection of neighborhoods — and writing! We'll be taking the subway, and we'll be walking...so wear comfortable shoes and dress WARMLY. BRING YOUR LUNCH; we'll eat back at school, after our morning travels and tastings. 

IPW Project Description:

Did you know that New York is a Cupcake Town? That there's a film script in development called The Cupcake Wars? That cupcakes sell books?

Let's figure out why…..

Each morning we'll visit a neighborhood independent book store and a nearby cupcake cafe or bakery. We'll browse and stroll, taste and talk. By 1:30 we'll be back at The School, where you'll develop and work for a few hours each day on your own writing project: cupcake reviews, book profiles, book store blogs, personal journalism, poems, lyrics…you name it. Or you can develop a series of read-alouds for one of the lower grades....

Project Learning Goals/Objectives: 
-	To learn about the NYC independent bookstore scene 
-	To discover and define the concept of taste and a personal aesthetic, as we get a taste of bookstores, books, cupcakes 
-	To use personal experience as a stimulus for creative writing 
-	To try varieties of writing and find a form of expression that best “fitsï¿½? intended content.
-	To respond to the spontaneous changes of direction that writing, though planned, often takes 
-	To become a practitioner of story-finding, story-developing, story-revising
-	To learn the art of craftsmanship
-	To complete a mini-portfolio of written work by the end of IPW
