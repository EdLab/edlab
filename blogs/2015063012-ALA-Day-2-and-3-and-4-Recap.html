            Boy has it been busy!

<b>DAY 2</b>
I started my day off with my LITA Lightening Talks presentation on Drips Gallery! I had 5 minutes to explain the process and goals of Drips Gallery.  The other presenters had some really interesting projects, the one I found most interesting was Yuan Li from Princeton University Libraries. Yuan Li presented on improving the ingestion of records at her library.  One student aid worker can manually ingest 50 records per hour. After research and planning, Princeton Univerity Libraries decided to use <a href="http://www.soapui.org/about-soapui/what-is-soapui-.html">SoapUI</a> to send and receive messages from the server and Notepad++ to transfer XML files from one schema to another. After the switch to the new semi-automated workflow, one student could easily ingest 1000+records/hour.

<b>DAY 3</b>
Today I led an interest group in the Creative Ideas in Technical Services.  My original topic was: User Experience in Digital Archives and Digital Libraries. Unfortunately, Internet was not provided at the Marriot Convention rooms, and I was unable to have my group work through my questions while clicking through predetermined digital archives and libraries. My Interest Group was small so I was able to pivot and talk about the frustrations with IR's, what software is currently being used by their libraries for digital repositories.  There was one librarian who works specifically with Drupal and Islandora and does not enjoy it.  She described the software as: "it was built by programmers for programmers". The overall takeaway I gathered was: adding metadata tends to be difficult from the backend and the users are constantly clicking in order to get to the item in need, no neither the librarians or the users are benefitting because of lack of access.

<b>DAY 4</b> 
I covered the Making a Zine in the Library: Creativity, Collaboration, Community presentation for a publication called  “Serials Spoken Here” column in Serials Review. Here are my notes from their presentation:

Castilleja High School in Palo Alto, CA.
Why do zines at a library or school?
-Benefits: analog and hands on, creative, collaborative, community, it's hip, lower production value = major risk taking
-they're not exclusive, but it's a collective and underground 
-authentic audience, not having to put it online, no need to edit, or have it polished
-the rawness is like by one of the girls, it's like a stream of consciousness 
-access to unrepresentative and marginalized voices that aren't being published mainstream 

What you need:
A photocopier, stapler, glue, creative people, snacks, time, a private communal space, stickers, stamps, old scrap booking supplies, a distribution plan (the girls take 5 or 6 and hand them out to their friends, every contributor receives one), transportation might be an issue, printers spreads, 

THEIR ZINE
-doesn't have a title, only a theme. How to create an identity without a title. The owls are featured in every zine. And owls tend to show up in their zine 
-Titles: gifs, myths, return, it's a secret, time, transformation 
-"What is this thing you're holding" page
-contributors and special guests (ts Elliot, Emily Dickinson)
-scraps page: it's bits, mysterious, stand alone comments or sentences 
-reading list for each theme
-playlist is a collection of songs that are published on a list in the zine for website 8tracks (via short link)
-short links for reads that are out of copyright 
-interactive elements, so the reader can write in it
...Lessons learned
-themes
-range of content, accept everything 
-inclusive attitude toward submissions 
-use of published work
-saving originals
-encourage friends to submit (receipts, math, science, art, ect)
