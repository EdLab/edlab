Mulu.me creates an intersection between a  <a href="http://pinterest.com/">Pinterest-like</a>, social pin-board and social-good-linked revenue generator.  How it works: users "curate" a page with links to products and services they endorse and recommend.  Users who generate traffic to these sites are then assigned "guru points" and given a percentage of sale if a purchase is made by this unique visitor.  The social good component comes-into-play as participants are given the option to choose what percentage of this monetary reward will be given to a charity of their choice.     

<b>Pros:</b>
The site is graphically pleasing and reminds me of a well-curated online shopping experience.  The "guru points" seem like an interesting way to reward active, knowledgeable users without relying on the potentially over-played badge. 


<b>Cons:</b>
This seems like a combination of Etsy, Tumblr and Pinterest... with the main differentiator being the "social good" aspect.  I think the curatorial trend is here to stay, but perhaps there is a clearer connection to how both users and "curators" would benefit listed more prominently or explained through an infographic.  At first glance, or without reading  <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120124/meet-mulu-a-pinterest-like-site-for-e-commerce-with-a-cause/?mod=mailchimp">this AllthingsD.com piece</a> I would have thought this Mulu.me was simply another slick e-commerce site. 

<b>EdLab Relevance/Takeaway:</b> 
As we move into the e-commerce realm with <a href="http://researchbroker.tc-library.org/">ResearchBroker</a>, and continue in the world of information and identity curation with both Vialogues.com and Ednode.com, I feel there are important lessons to be gleaned from this site.  1) "Guru" status and points could be more powerful than a complicated badge ecosystem 2) Site design, especially in the Beta stage, needs to express clearly and immediately the value for the end user and the "curator" of information 3) A social-good component built-into e-commerce could be a great way to help various causes while supporting your own mission, whether to make the world more stylish or to make re-imagining education a more enticing cause.
