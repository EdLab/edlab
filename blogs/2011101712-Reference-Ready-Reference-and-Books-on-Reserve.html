            <em>It's  been a busy couple of days here at the Gottesman Libraries as we prepare for midterms.Â  Midterms bring many members of the TC community to the first  floor services desk asking for assistance in navigating the library and the library's online resources. In an effort to bring more information to the  community about library services we are going to answer frequently asked  questions right here on Pressible! Of course you are still welcome at  all times to stop by the desk and ask your questions.</em>

Lately we have received many questions about the difference between  reference books, ready reference books, and books on reserve. Reference  books are located on the first floor next to the computers. The  collection is rather small because we have digital copies of all of our  reference materials. If you are interested in using a reference book,  you are able to retrieve it yourself and use the book anywhere in the  library. These books are not able to be checked out, but most reference  materials can also be found online. You can always conduct a search  through <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/">EDUCAT</a> to locate the library's reference collection.

'Ready reference' books are reference books that are in high demand. A popular ready reference book is the <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search%7ES6/?searchtype=t&amp;searcharg=APA+Manual&amp;searchscope=6&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=D&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=tAPA+">APA Manual</a>. These books are located behind the first floor services desk. You can check these books out for two hours.

Reserve books are books that professors place on the reserves shelf.  These books are usually textbooks or required reading for classes and  can also be checked out for two hours. The way to retrieve books  placed on reserve is to bring the call number of the book you need to the first floor  services desk and we will give you the book you are looking for.

I hope this helps to understand the differences between reference books, ready reference books and books on reserve!
