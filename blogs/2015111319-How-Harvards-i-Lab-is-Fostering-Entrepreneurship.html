<p><i>"Harvard Innovation Lab (i-lab) serves as a resource for students from across Harvard interested in entrepreneurship and innovation."</i> (<a href="http://www.buildingbeats.org/about-building-beats/">About Harvard i-lab</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Fostering Innovation in Academic Spaces</b></p>
 
<p>Harvard University's Innovation Lab (i-lab) has been integrating entrepreneurship and innovation in the Allston-Cambridge area since 2011. Its programming, event organization, and experimental multi-purpose public space bridges university divisions to support tech ventures. i-lab has the best of both worlds—veteran expert mentorship as well as the room to test out the newest tech ideas. Through its work, i-lab provides insight into important issues: Why are some organizations more dynamic than others? Do innovative organizations share characteristics? If so, what are they? And how do we foster innovative people, organizations, and products in a rapidly changing world? </p>
 
<p><b>Putting People First</b></p>
 
<p>i-lab sponsors workshops and provides resources for students networking their way into the marketplace. It also provides technological know-how and field-tested guidance to bring ideas to fruition. It achieves these goals through its openness. Students from any Harvard school with ideas are accepted with hopes of fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration across the university. Also, the center brings students and faculty together. One of the lab’s mantras is "student centered and faculty enabled." </p>
 
<p><b>Dynamic Programming</b></p>
 
<p>The art and science of innovation and entrepreneurship is based on proven methods. Entrepreneurial programming provided by i-lab is based on a four-part approach. First, foundational learning helps lab members learn the basics of entrepreneurship and innovation through online video and offline courses. Second, expert resources foster student work. The lab offers appointments with professionals across disciplines. Third, experiential learning includes trips, startup weekends and challenges to inform and entertain. And fourth, the Venture Incubation Program includes community building, workshops, and mentoring. </p>
 
<p><b>Reaching Out</b></p>
 
<p>Finally, embracing a public ethos in this era of shared information, i-lab even invites groups in to see how it fosters innovation. For example, Harvard’s Digital Problem Solving Initiative <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpVZoCZ3HYA ">visited the i-lab </a> to discover ways to foster innovation across different organizational settings. If you are a Harvard community member looking to develop your bold ideas in new ways, the i-lab could be just the organization to help you develop them into market ready products and services. </p>
