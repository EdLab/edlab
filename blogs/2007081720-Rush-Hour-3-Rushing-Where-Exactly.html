            Ironically, I ended up having to do exactly just that. Navigating the MTA system throughout NYC's rush hour, rushing to the theatre, and rushing to find a seat. Rush, rush, rush. As I settled, I could feel myself let out a sigh of relief. 

Rushed was exactly what this movie was, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

Critics have been deploring Rush Hour 3, calling it mediocre and overdone. New York Times review called it “crude” and “grimly unfunny” — not such a good sign. Nevertheless, there is a reason why Rush Hour 3 has been grossing in so much money at the box office, and after watching the movie, I could see why. 

There's nothing new to expect in the third segment of the Rush Hours Series, no new story-lines, or overly complicated plots and dilemmas, like the esoteric Oceans 13 that left audiences puzzled. The same slap-stick humor, crude racial stereotypes, and stunts have been recycled — the scenery is different, is all. 

The appeal however, lies in just that. 

Rush Hour 3 is a flick that remains the same at its core — hence familiar to the faithful audiences that return time and time again to watch it, and find laughs in jokes that quite haven't gotten old just yet. Like movies with several installations, such as Die Hard, Rush Hour has certain catchphrases and moves that the audience actively seeks for — the crowning points — the inside jokes. 

Maybe it was the effect of having to battle the 7 train to get to the movie theatre, or maybe it was the effect of a long day, or maybe I just have a low sense of humor, but I found myself able to enjoy the movie, much like enjoying a late-night snack of McDonalds. For as crude and ungainly as Rush Hour 3 may seem, it requires nothing of the audience, other than to enjoy it and appreciate its effort. Having been to Paris myself recently, I found myself enjoying and remembering the aesthetic scenery of the movie (and enjoying how the Eiffel Tower was incorporated into the climax as well). Oh, and an enthusiastic crowd definitely helps boost the experience as well. 

Underneath the humor however, is a startling honest portrayal of America, the people that make it up, and the relations the United States has had with the rest of the world, as seen in comments such as Chris Tucker when reprimanded for wrongfully jailing Iranian scientists “that doesn't mean they weren't going to blow shit up!”, or by George, the seemingly stereotypical French cab driver, who yells “Americans are the most violent people in this world! They go around mindlessly killing!” and of course, he brings up the war in Iraq. 

Rush Hour 3 does not attempt to deliver a justification or deep political innuendo, but responds with a shrug and a joke — we are what we are, but you know you want to be just like us.
