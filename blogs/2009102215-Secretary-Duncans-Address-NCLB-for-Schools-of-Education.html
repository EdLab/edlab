          <p>
            Earlier today, it was my great fortune to spend just over an hour of my working day attending Secretary Duncan's lecture about the future of teacher preparation.  As this topic sits near and dear to my heart (and to my purpose here at TC), I was eager to hear what he had to say and to consider how the administration's outlined plans might impact <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3379">our work to support practicing teachers</a>. Sitting now, atop Russell Hall, it seems all the more fitting and timely that EdLab contribute to what Duncan called this “difficult, important, and urgent” imperative.  After all, as President Fuhrman reminded the audience in her introduction, James Earl Russell helped solidify the popular conception of teacher education, focusing primarily on (1) general culture and liberal education, (2) special scholarship and content knowledge, (3) professional knowledge such as learning theory and psychology, and (4) technical knowledge that includes pedagogical skills.

Duncan's future-oriented message very much accorded with these emphases (which, incidentally, were developed before the turn of the twentieth century), although he demanded a “revolutionary, not evolutionary” effort to revamp extant preparation processes and raise the proverbial bar for teacher education.  In order to successfully teach diverse students in our information age, he argued, and in face of the impending exodus of baby-boomer teachers, we must transparently use longitudinal data about “what works” in teacher education and rev-up our approach to pre-service field experience and hands-on pedagogical learning.    

Duncan spent much of his speech simultaneously heralding and lamenting the reputational challenges faced by traditional preparation programs.  Frankly acknowledging their status as “the Rodney Dangerfield of higher education,” he rattled off a laundry list of popular and historical dismissals including the characterization of teacher ed programs as “a kitten that ought to be drowned,” a bunch of “Mickey Mouse courses” (with an “anti-intellectual bias”), or “cash-cows.”  Yet, he spoke with great hope about promising models emerging across the country and emphasized, in particular, the importance of residency models, strong school leadership, data-driven instruction, cooperative building cultures . . . and the enticing “carrot” of federal funding for “proven” teacher preparation initiatives and programs.

It was perhaps this last dangling carrot — and Duncan's hope to explicitly link student achievement data with teacher preparation programs — that left me most hesitant and unsettled.  Just as with NCLB, this type of outcome-oriented accountability involves an illogic of sequencing and causal relationships that potentially overlooks the affective, human dimensions of teaching and learning, and also jeopardizes the goals of cooperation, knowledge-sharing, and equitable service so eloquently championed by the administration.

Just like teaching in general, teacher education in (and for) our quick-paced, diverse, and complex world is highly adaptive and requires more than quantifiable, technical solutions.  Successful teaching and learning, at all levels, necessarily involves careful attention to the needs and hopes of those we serve, as well as thoughtful self-reflection at both the personal and organizational levels.  I am thankful to Secretary Duncan for sharing his views and ideas with us today, and hopeful that these qualitative elements, too, will influence the administration's (and the EdLab's) plans for the future of education and teacher preparation.
