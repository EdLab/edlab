Teaching can be one of the most creative professions. Teachers are expected to be versatile and resourceful at all times. They have to pitch sometimes dry course content in interesting ways, adjust materials and pedagogies to adapt to various learning needs, learn up-to-date technologies and apply them in constrained environments, and in some cases even find basic supplies and textbooks for their kids. While some enjoy these daily challenges, many more<a href="http://nctaf.org/wp-content/uploads/no-dream-denied_summary_report.pdf"> burn out within five years and leave the profession </a>. Most in-between teachers are finding better approaches to address their daily surprises and needs in the classroom. One innovative solution for these educators doesn't come from traditional education consultants but from a less familiar group – design thinking advocates. <p>

Design thinking is a systematic and creative process to generate ideas and design solutions to everyday problems. This approach encourages prototyping, testing and quick failure in order to find better solutions. <p>

Karen, a veteran elementary teacher, finds the designer identity gives her a fresh angle to look at her daily work and helps her and her colleagues find new solutions to daily problems. It also makes her more optimistic about the future of education. What exactly is the magic of design thinking? Is it too good to be true? Watch this video to learn more about Karen’s story and design thinking in practice, and join the conversation on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11984">Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:21 jagnitti:</b>Many teachers are overwhelmed with class obligations alone; adding yet another thing for them to learn is often out of the question.<p>

<b>@01:42 johnlee:</b>Redesigning teacher’s lounge, create better online collaboration platform for teachers…these all sound like great projects and it would be helpful to hear them say more about how design thinking helps in the process.<p>

<b>@02:38 Wang:</b> Design thinking seems like a great philosophy to help educators believe in themselves. Just wondering what are some other approaches that could have similar effects on inspiring teachers to be creative and see challenges as opportunities? <p>
