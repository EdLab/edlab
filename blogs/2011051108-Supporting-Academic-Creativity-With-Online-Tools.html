I'll be co-presenting with Peter Beaugard (on "Using Graphic Design Methods &amp; Interactive Tools to Encourage Play in Online Learning") and Nate Dern – (on "Crowdsourcing Creativity"). Join us at "Tech Panel I" at 10:45 - 12:15, on Friday May 27, 2011. My session is titled, "Supporting Academic Creativity With Online Tools."

<strong>What is academic creativity and why support it?</strong>

"Academic creativity" is not the same as just any kind of creativity. It's creativity that's exhibited/manifested/experienced in the pursuit of scholarly work – a sub-genre of creativity, if you will. So my hope is that a discussion of how to support it will be slightly more tractable.</div>
Why support it? Unlike creativity in general, academic creativity is dependent upon educational organizations – let's say by definition. More creativity in the pursuit of academic work could entail several broad characteristics: Students would be more inspired to learn. Teachers would be more inspired to teach. And it would lead researchers down new, interesting, and fruitful paths.

Creativity, on this view, is a lot like knowledge-sharing in general. But rather than over-determine the kind of activities, processes, and results that can be identified with creativity, let's just keep a <em>social</em>, <em>generative</em> definition in mind.

So, are the organizations you know supporting creativity? How? And how might they be hindering it? ("By being too academic" is not specific enough in this case).

<strong>What will my talk at the panel session be about?</strong>

To open a discussion about the possibilities and limitations of academic creativity, I’ll share an example of a software application (pressible.org) designed to support and enhance knowledge sharing in an academic community. By contrasting its social characteristics with other knowledge sharing tools, I argue that it strikes a balance between strict scholarly norms and the alluring possibility of abandoning them.

For example, Pressible allows for creating "citations" in a non-traditional way. Instead of promoting the use of footnotes (etc.), it makes a "Repost" feature available to Pressible authors. Reposting allows Pressible authors to quote another author on the Pressible network with one click (also

I hope the discussion will allow participants to share experiences (good and bad) with similar online tools, or present ideas for enhancing tools with the goal of academic creativity in mind.
