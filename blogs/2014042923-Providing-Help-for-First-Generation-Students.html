            During my first year in college, I attended a meeting called the Freshman Year Initiative (FYI). The meeting was organized by faculty members of SEEK, a program my current program in college. One thing I remember from the FYI meeting is this question, "How many of you here are first-generation college students?" Almost immediately, a good amount of hands were raised up in the air. I sat with my hands on my thighs because I was not a first generation student. I pondered to myself and wondered what they were going to do with those students with their hands up. Prior to reading this <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/09/29/colleges-try-meet-needs-first-generation-students/1266Se7UzAWW8mvoxwx7zJ/story.html">article</a>, I already understood that being a first generation college student is seen as a great achievement. Thus, I believe that to help these students pursue their career goals and not give up is one reason why the question was asked at the beginning of the meeting. After all, it appears that first generation college students face more problems once they start college.
<p>
MIT's First Generation Project has been developed to recognize the identities of a large invisible population: first generation college students. The purpose of the project is to financially support, provide peer mentoring, and networking events for first generation students. Nonetheless, studies have shown that most of the first generation students are students from a low-income family. For instance, there was a case of one student selling his textbooks to give his mother money for gas and another student trying to study for an exam while helping his family fight eviction. These are some of the private issues often faced buy first generation students. The example set by MIT has given impetus for schools like Tufts, Northeastern, and Smith to form similar programs to benefit first generation students. Just like the students from wealthy families, if first generation students are recognized and given all the help they need, they can also be high achievers.
