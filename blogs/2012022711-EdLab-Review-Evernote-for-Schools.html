<a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/schools/">Evernote</a> has released a set of resources and a premium-level pricing plan tailored specifically for schools. Resources to support this initiative include case studies, videos, and a discussion forum. This offering follows the success of the group's popular note-taking platform <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5964">"Peek,"</a> which launched last summer.    

<b>Pros:</b>
Evernote remains one of the most powerful and simple-to-use note-taking and resource- "clipping" platforms available. It makes sense to provide a suite of options to make adoption by schools as seamless as possible. Not only will students benefit from group note-taking, but the streamlined resource, reference and online material curation, and library creation is a huge benefit to young learners who are inundated with information online.

<b>Cons:</b>
Cost. While powerful, there are costs to this power and the many resources available to users. Schools with less available resources (i.e. public schools) will be left out as the cost for adoption will be a major barrier-to-entry. It would be wonderful to see a free version offered with less features available for less economically advantaged districts. An additional issue is that of available tech and bandwidth at each school. Much like YouTube and their "TeacherTube" option for schools the platform is only as helpful as the technology that supports it. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
As we continue to develop our proprietary social network, Ednode, it may be valuable to think about adding social note-sharing through the platform, allowing users to find research buddies and share research notes.  I also feel the case studies highlighted <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/schools/resources/videos/">here</a> are especially effective at communicating the value of this tool to schools and could be explored for Vialogues. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Evernote for Schools is an interesting way to make social note-taking and online resource curation relevant and helpful to students. It is interesting to see a platform that has widespread adoption for individuals across industries successfully translate into schools.
