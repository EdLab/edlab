            Hi everyone,

April is national poetry month and is, for me, a very exciting time of year. I have always (starting as early a I could write) aspired to be a poet and studied poetry as an undergraduate. While I do think poetry should be read all year around, I love this month because it is when everyone celebrates poetry. 

I came across a very exciting new way to continue my love for poetry (which I have admittedly lost touch with). Harvard's EdX has a great new course called The Art of Poetry</i> (From the <a href=”https://www.edx.org/course/bux/bux-arpo222x-art-poetry-1565#.U1F7Pa1dVqs=1”>Art of Poetry</a>).

"Overheard," as posted EdX's newsletter by that name, include the following comments: 

       To read poetry is to sign on to read the same poems again and again and again over a lifetime.
–Professor Elisa New
 
	A poem not only engenders dialogue between two people, allowing each person to bring his or her wisdom to its music, but also engages the reader in a conversation.
–Christina L. Turczyn 
 
	 We all respond to poetry in ways that are deeply personal and individual, including ways the poet could not have anticipated.
–James Boswell 
 
	Maybe the author's original intention doesn't really matter–poems exist as something separate and unique. They are a shared creation between the author's words on the page and whatever experiences the reader brings.
–Michael Balchan
