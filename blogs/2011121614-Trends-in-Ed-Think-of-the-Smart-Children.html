          <p>
            In the Washington Post Michael Petrilli and Rick Hess <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/closing-the-achievement-gap-but-at-gifted-students-expense/2011/11/21/gIQAe76ywO_story.html">have published</a> an opinion piece attacking the values of our current educational system.  Their jumping-off point is a series of efforts by the Education department under the Obama administration to encourage school systems to enroll more poor and minority students in gifted programs, with “disparate impact” lawsuits as the iron fist inside the velvet glove of this policy.   they're careful to note that this didn't begin with Obama; the motivating force is the longstanding nationwide desire to close the “achievement gap” between different (ethnic or social) groups.
<!--break-->
Petrilli and Hess state very clearly: “Our single-minded focus on closing achievement gaps has almost certainly hurt our top students. In 1996, Rand Corp. scholars determined that low-achieving pupils benefit when placed in mixed-ability classrooms, faring about five percentage points better than those placed in lower-track classes, but that high-achievers score six percentage points worse in such general classes.”

This feeds into the general claim that our current educational system is not serving high-achievers well.  Their gains on reading and math tests over the past decade, for example, have stagnated, as compared to real improvements by the low-achievers. Although the authors don't argue that we should ignore low-performing students, and structure our policies solely around the needs of the high-achievers, they do believe that a rational education policy should balance the needs of the two groups against each other.  

Put that way, it seems very rational, although I would prefer more concrete proposals than just: we shouldn't overload advanced classes with marginal students who won't be able to handle the work, a policy which would make sense even without worrying about the impact highest-achievers.
