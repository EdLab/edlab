<p>This video showcases a paper book that is used as an e-book of sorts, allowing users to draw and write in it and have their additions saved and uploaded to a similar book, anywhere in the world, where others can access this content and add their own. The book becomes a medium of communication—a way to share creations and build stories. </p>

<p>Researchers at MIT are also developing a compatible wearable jacket that can convey someone’s memories and perhaps even emotions! Who would have imagined that cold, lifeless technology could be used as a medium to share feelings? Stephen Fry tries on this jacket, and is amazed as he feels physical "touches" from the jacket that have been programmed and saved by the previous wearer. This can essentially allow a person to record a day of their life through the physical feelings they experienced that day, and to share it with future generations of their families, or even with other cultures. Imagine learning about a soldier’s day on a military base or an explorer’s journey to climb Mount Everest by experiencing the physical sensations they felt during those moments.</p>

<p>These projects seek to personalize technology in an intimate fashion. We often associate tech with disconnection and emotional distance, but these projects are challenging this association and experimenting with different ways that technology can bring us closer together to share in the human experience. With these current tools, we can just picture how far technology can be stretched and tinkered with to capture memory, like an interactive and maybe even an immortal diary.</p>

<p>How do you think these technologies can revolutionize storytelling? Jump into the conversation <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23274/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:22 PG.Williamson:</b> The never ending drawing machine would be revolutionary. Being able to have live interaction on a book? Kids in this information age have all the luck!</p>

<p><b>@00:50 Beckieb:</b> This is amazing! My teacher senses are tingling! I would love to incorporate this into creative story-telling with children. </p>

<p><b>@02:38 Beckieb:</b> My mind is blown. This is an epic way to capture our lives past mortality.</p>
