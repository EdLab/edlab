<a href=" http://www.coursehero.com/">Course Hero</a> aims to support students in a wide variety of college courses by providing related documents uploaded by students, flashcards on major topics, video lectures, and access to tutors.  This new social online education resource attempts to bring learning into the 21st century. The creators of Course Hero take the term "sharing is caring" to a whole new level by encouraging users to share their lessons, activities, and flashcards, and even the documents and resources they access in their college courses. Course Hero also includes online courses, similar to sites like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, which cover HTML, entrepreneurship, business, Excel, and dozens more. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pros:</b><br>
Course Hero is well organized; users can find what they need easily, whether it is study documents, tutors, courses, or flashcards. Users can also create materials for these categories and share them with other users. The uniformity of design makes it easy for new users to navigate the site. The recommendation system for the courses themselves is intuitive, and prevents confusion. For example, when a user takes the HTML course, Course Hero will show other related courses, such as CSS, Javascript, Python, and MySQL. These five courses are categorized under the "Web Programming" path and would indeed be appropriate recommendations for someone learning HTML.
</p>

<p> 
<b>Cons:</b><br>
Course Hero’s courses can be quite passive. They are usually made up of video lessons followed by a one-question quiz. Typically, after taking about 4-6 lessons users are given a 5-6 question test. These quizzes and tests are made up of fairly basic multiple-choice questions.  Making these quizzes and tests more challenging and engaging would make it easier to gauge a user’s knowledge.  For example the HTML course might test students by having them write and test code, just as <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a> does. Of course, that kind of testing may be harder to implement in courses on entrepreneurship or business. In any event, Course Hero’s main draw comes not from its courses, but from the ability to share college level course notes.  Therefore, the site should focus more on features related to sharing, creating, and organizing course notes and study materials.
 </p>

<p>
<b>Our Takeaway:</b><br> 
With the ability to allow users to share their college course notes, flashcards, and knowledge with other students, Course Hero gives students the potential to learn through collaboration and sharing. The site offers plenty of incentives for sharing documents, such as providing users with a free month of premium service if they upload 40 meaningful documents. Course Hero has a good platform but, going forward, the goal should be to increase the number of users sharing notes, flashcards, and college course material. With a huge and active user base, Course Hero could effectively replace the in-person study group, and, when organized correctly, online study groups such as Course Hero can create powerful learning environments by connecting users with a global knowledge base.
</p>

<p> 
<b>The Bottom Line:</b><br>
Course Hero is a knowledge-sharing platform with the potential to break down the 4 walls of the traditional lecture hall.
