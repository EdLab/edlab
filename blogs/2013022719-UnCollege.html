<p><a href="http://www.uncollege.org/">UnCollege</a> is a collection of resources for students thinking outside the college box. The site is heavily skewed towards the tech industry and highlights a $10,000, 1-year program that shuttles "students" through months of exploring abroad, working at a startup, pursuing personal creative projects, and building a brand. The site is trying to build a community around foregoing formal schooling and produced a <a href="http://summer.uncollege.org/">"Hackademic" </a>accelerator/conference in January 2013. Founder Dale Stephens, a 2010 Thiel fellow who was recently <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/lml45mkil/dale-stephens-21-founder-uncollege/">named by Forbes</a> as a bright new talent in education, is releasing a book based on the site in March, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Your-Education-Lectures-Thousands/dp/0399159967/"><i>Hacking Your Education: Ditch the Lectures, Save Tens of Thousands, and Learn More Than Your Peers Ever Will</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The site is a good starting point for a transition from student to un-student. It lists a well-curated group of fellowships and accelerators, a small but diverse group of interviews, and a reading list that is clearly a labor of love. The members of the <a href="http://www.uncollege.org/team/">UnCollege Team</a> have a personal stake in the movement that shows through in the clear attention they’ve paid to the site, all staff either avoided college completely or dropped-out after a few semesters. The site is a positive resource for anyone interested in an unconventional education experience and includes practical things like tips on breaking the news to your parents.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site has weirdly collegiate imagery and may come off a bit too positive, given the challenging and murky path that some students forgoing college may experience. Downloading the manifesto is also a bit tricky; what appears to simply be an external download actually signs users up for the site. The <a href="http://www.uncollege.org/academicdeviance.pdf">manifesto</a> itself is worth a read though. It is simple, but contains a good road plan and what seems like some hard-won wisdom.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>UnCollege is part of a small but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/fashion/saying-no-to-college.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">growing culture</a> of college skepticism. At this point there is precious little structure in place to accelerate a career outside of formal education and UnCollege is presenting a legitimate channel for growth. Though UnCollege seems to espouse a particular path outside of school, Stephens is a great model for this type of path. He’s extremely motivated, industrious, faithful in networking, and constantly involved in writing his own story. The site works well as a starting point and perhaps paves the way for diverse models of post-secondary education outside the college gates.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>UnCollege is an intriguing first resource for potential college ditchers.</p>
