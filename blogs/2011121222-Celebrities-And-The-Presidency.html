          <p>
            A few summers ago, <a href=”http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4786”>Daniel blogged about celebrities seeking political office</a> in the wake of Wyclef Jean's then bid for Haiti's presidency. As we eventually found out, Wyclef Jean didn't meet the requirements to even mount a serious campaign. Now Russian billionaire and owner of the soon to be Brooklyn Nets, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/12/world/europe/russia-protests/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">Mikhail Prokhorov, has announced he will be challenging Vladimir Putin in next year's presidential elections</a>. All this amid a backdrop of widespread protest against Putin and his party for alleged cheating in recently completed parliamentary elections. 

Soccer star George Weah lost out in presidential elections in war-torn Liberia four years ago and was one of the leaders behind the opposition movement in recent presidential elections, which they lost again. In Pakistan, cricket icon <a href=”http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/world/asia/ex-cricket-star-imran-khan-leads-antigovernment-protest-in-pakistan.html”>Imran Khan recently led a massive antigovernment protest</a> fueling speculation he will seek a presidential bid in the foreseeable future. 

I find it interesting that to date in American politics, there have been few high profile or well known celebrities who have ran for presidency. The last notable was former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, well known for his outstanding basketball career at Princeton and then in the NBA with the New York Knicks, when he ran on the Democratic ticket in the leadup to the 2000 election, eventually losing to Al Gore. President Ronald Reagan had a few notable movie roles before turning to politics. Though “celebrities” such as Donald Trump have flirted with the idea, few have actually made good on a campaign. 

I wonder why the trend of high profile celebrities running for the presidency of their native lands overseas have yet to take hold over here.
