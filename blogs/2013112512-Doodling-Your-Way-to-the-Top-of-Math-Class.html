One of the more recent star additions to the Khan academy team is Victoria Hart, a.k.a Vi Hart -- A self described recreational mathemusician. In the age where conventional mathematical pedagogy is being challenged, she has managed to blaze  an entirely new career path for herself, one that combines the two most creative and very different art forms: Mathematics and Music.

Vi Hart is the daughter of George Hart: A stony brook professor famous for his mathematical sculptures, who is currently the curator of the Math museum in new york. 

Vi Hart actually graduated with a degree in music, with a thesis about a 7 part sonnet on the harry potter series. Her mathematial interest was sparked by a math conference she attended with her dad, which she found to be "a lot of fun with so many passionate people." She continued attending math conferences and even collaborated with boy genius Erik Demaine on a couple of math papers. 

After graduating, she had trouble fitting in a regular job. -- “If I want to spend a week carving fruit up into polyhedra, I want to spend a week carving fruit up into polyhedra, and where am I going to get a job doing that?”

(She did end up spending a week doing that, posting information about that in her website)

All these received only modest interest, Until she turned her focus to creating youtube videos of her work. Shot by herself with a home video recorder, she created fast paced videos of her doodling about exponential functions and hyperbolas. These immediately went viral and captured the imagination of kids worldwide. 

My personal favorite is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av_Us6xHkUc">this video </a> where vi hart sings while drawing scale proportionate doodles. The tune is quite catchy.

With all the work Vi Hart has put to present mathematics in a fun and unconventional way, it is fitting that she caught the attention of Khan Academy. 

Currently however, the videos are mostly amusing, with little correlation with standard curriculum, Hopefully that will change. But judging from her success so far, she seems to be only finitely many doodles away from the glory of Martin Gardner.
