<p>The problem is two-fold: first, there is a disproportionate number of men in doctoral STEM programs compared to women; and second, women are less likely to complete their PhD in these fields if there are no other female students in their cohort. For many graduate programs, this is nearly a catch-22 situation.</p>

<p>A recent study examined this problem by analyzing 33 STEM doctoral cohorts at six public universities starting in the years 2005 through 2009. The average cohort size was 17, and the average percentage of female students per cohort was 38%. Overall, they found that 30% of the graduate students dropped out of their programs, and most of these dropouts occurred in the first three years. Also, women were much more likely to drop out if they were the only female in their cohort, and generally did so during the first year of their program.</p>

<p>The study found that if there were only two women in a cohort, their chances of graduating within six years drastically increased, and these numbers only continued to rise as the number of female students rose. This demonstrates that female support within cohorts is a significant factor in PhD completion rates, and the researchers think this could be the case for a few reasons.</p>
 
<p>For one, they say that women are overall less competitive in doctoral programs and less likely to be affected by low grades, so having other female peers could encourage more motivation to study and work through difficult assignments. For another, it could improve women’s chances of obtaining financial support or grants. Finally, a cohort with more women scholars could develop a climate that is overall more female-friendly, and this type of environment could encourage women to persist in doctoral programs.</p>
 
<p>Whatever the reason, the problem of underrepresentation of women in STEM PhD programs has a serious impact on completion rates, which only perpetuates the issue. More research needs to be done to investigate how to increase female representation and improve completion rates.</p>
