<p>Online learning platform <a href="http://www.tinytap.it">TinyTap</a> offers users ways to create and play educational games. Teachers and parents can craft games and publish them publicly, and kids can learn as they play any of the over 100,000 games that the platform has to offer.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This San Francisco-based startup offers a wealth of different activities on their platform created by the TinyTap community, including educational games, interactive stories, puzzles, photo albums, and classroom activities. Many of these activities are grouped into units on the same subject. The lessons on TinyTap could be particularly beneficial to young children or those with different abilities. Many of the activities involve correctly identifying different images and words or putting puzzles together, and each gives plenty of sensory feedback to indicate right or wrong answers.</p>
 
<p>TinyTap also provides ways for users to create games and ebooks without coding experience. With simple-to-use tools, you can easily crop images, add sound effects and voiceovers, and create puzzles and other basic activities. This feature is especially helpful for parents or teachers who want their children to learn specific skills or cater lessons to their interests. The platform also helps teachers incorporate TinyTap into the classroom with lesson plans, curriculum, and data analytic features.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because the platform makes it so easy to create games, this also means that the games do not have high production values. They are simple; the kind you could make on your own computer with moving images and voice overs. While not all of the games are high-quality, there are enough available that you should be able to find plenty that are. Another issue is that not all of the games correctly identify targeted age groups. For instance, I came across several games labeled for one- to two-year-olds that were definitely intended for older players. Because it’s basically like a social media platform for games, you might have to do some sifting before finding ones you’re happy with.</p>
 
<p>In addition, while there are some free games available, most require a paid subscription plan of either $7.99 per month or $60 per year, which could prove too much for some, especially those who prefer higher quality gameplay.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>TinyTap is a fun platform for homemade, simple educational games and is best suited for young children and those with different abilities. Adults get to create and children get to play. It’s a worthwhile project and provides a solid community of educators and learners alike.</p>
