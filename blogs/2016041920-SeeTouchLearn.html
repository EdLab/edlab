<p>People tend to take ability for granted. Only when we are confronted with one of life’s many problems do we stop to ponder the difficulties of disability. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/see.touch.learn./id406826506?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8">See.Touch.Learn.</a> is an app that helps kids with autism and special needs learn through visual instruction to overcome these tremendous challenges. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>See.Touch.Learn. is a well-designed app. Its flash card exercises are life-like and cool. In the initial levels, players are matched with simple alphabetical letters or everyday objects like carrots or running shoes. At the beginning of the game, players start with this single object, which is later matched with various scenarios and other objects. As the game progresses, the scenarios slowly grow in complexity, and help children gently master their surroundings in a safe, simple, and direct way. </p>

<p>Flash card fun is enhanced by a large library of 2,200 exercises and 4,400 pictures developed by experts. There is a world of opportunity at your child’s fingertips. Please don’t just rely on my word for it. See.Touch.Learn. won the Editors' Choice Award for Apps 4 Children With Special Needs (A4CWSN). </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The whole wide world of See.Touch.Learn. quickly becomes a pay-as-you-go experience. The bookshelves in the library may be stacked with objects, but you have to pay-to-play with the merchandise. Those with smaller budgets could quickly become frustrated. Also, due to the repetition involved with interacting with simple letters and objects, youngsters who are coping with different challenges and do not need help with this type of learning may find the game boring. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>See.Touch.Learn. is a high quality educational app. From my personal experiences teaching seventh and eighth grade special needs students English Language Arts, and at an Emotional and Behavioral Disorder school, See.Touch.Learn. could help vulnerable youngsters come to grips with a dizzying world teeming with sights and sounds one touch at a time. </p>
