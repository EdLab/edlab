<p><a href="https://www.myedu.com/">MyEdu</a> is striving to provide a better return on educational investment. The site is running a three-pronged attack aimed at retention, efficiency, and employment with tools like data analysis for colleges, GPA calculators, professor ratings, degree timelines, and built-in employer contacts. A <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-university-of-texas-system-invests-10-million-in-myedu-to-improve-graduation-rates-and-lower-college-costs-132434928.html">key partnership</a> with the University of Texas in 2011 helped launch the product and since then MyEdu has partnered with several institutions and greatly expanded services.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>One of MyEdu’s major goals is to connect students and employers. This connection is based on user profiles. Like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a>, MyEdu profiles allow students to represent themselves in non-traditional ways with video, endorsements, goals, and training outside of school. The employer pool seems to focus primarily on internship listings for current students, but MyEdu hopes to incorporate more post-graduation opportunities. Beyond connecting students with employers, colleges are using the site to collect data around enrollment and retention and to outsource student services like course planning, faculty evaluations, and advising. MyEdu seems like it could do some good here; institutional systems for these functions are often archaic, disjointed, and confusing. Making these services accessible to digital native students in a single interface might be beneficial and cost-effective. 
</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>MyEdu has a lot going on, but its success will rely on offering a unique package to schools and quality candidates to attract employers. The college discovery network is full of competition: sites like <a href="http://www.internmatch.com/">InternMatch</a> and <a href="http://www.internsushi.com/">Intern Sushi</a> are already offering internship connections to a large and growing group of users, <a href="http://blog.ratemyprofessors.com/">Rate My Professors</a> is still going strong, and sites like <a href="http://www.zinch.com/">Zinch</a> and <a href="http://www.aftercollege.com/">AfterCollege</a> are spinning out more targeted efforts. These functionalities are great under the one roof of MyEdu, but the site will have to inspire users to make the switch.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>With its unique access to students and employers, MyEdu has the capacity to eliminate the middleman from career readiness credentialing. The site’s focus on giving students more flexibility in professor choice based on peer review and learning style has the potential to change the enrollment patterns at schools. Unfortunately, these outcomes rely on MyEdu securing an enormous user base with enough clout to make change. In a time when à la carte student service startups are booming and all-inclusive learning management systems are securing deals with major institutions, MyEdu is in a strange position. The system is well-designed, clear, and functional, but the challenge will be convincing schools, students, and employers that it is a good fit for their needs. 
</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>There are so many good things about MyEdu that nothing really stands out.</p>
