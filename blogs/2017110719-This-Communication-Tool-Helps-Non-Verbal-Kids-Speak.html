<p>The inability to communicate is frustrating for everyone, especially children. But <a href="https://upcard.io">Upcard</a>, a flashcard for children with autism, improves conversations with parents, teachers, and caregivers and gives non-verbal children more agency.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Upcard gives users flexibility with words and images to craft each card. You can choose pictures from a bank of emojis or use your camera to take your own. After, you can label them and record a pronunciation or sound that will play each time the card is tapped. Children and parents can use the flashcards to construct sentences and communicate with images and text rather than vocalized words.</p>
 
<p>In addition, Upcard offers parents ways to keep track of their childâ€™s progress throughout the day. A plan feature allows parents to create a daily activity chart to help their kids understand the progression of each day. A diary feature automatically logs all the sentences a child has pieced together via the app throughout the day, and parents can add additional activities and timeframes as well. Finally,  a dashboard feature lets parents see which words are most used and how frequently their children complete certain activities.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Upcard has many good features, the app itself is not intuitive to use. The main feature of the app is a tri-level flashcard builder that children can use to construct sentences. Unfortunately, although this feature aims to reduce communication frustration, it needs more user-friendly functionality to achieve this goal. The flashcard builder felt constricting; once you flipped over the cards, you had to exit and reenter the feature before you could say something new. Also, the cards are automatically distributed so that only specific cards can appear in each of the three spots. For instance, you might make "I want" only available in the first position. While this is meant to help children construct more sensible sentences, it could also feel constricting for children who have trouble with sentences. It would be better if the app allowed for greater flexibility in this area.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>With its flashcard features, Upcard could prove a useful communication tool for nonverbal children on the autism spectrum or other non-verbal children. While the sentence construction feature could be more user-friendly, overall Upcard could help children ultimately feel like they have more control over their world.</p>
