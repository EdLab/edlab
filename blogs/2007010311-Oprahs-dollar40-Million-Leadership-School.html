          <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> officially joined the education business by opening the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070102/ts_alt_afp/afpentertainmentsafrica_070102164854">Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls</a> in Henley-on-Klip, south of Johannesburg, South Africa. The school, which provides a free education to 152 girls, cost 40-million-dollar and was funded entirely by Oprah.

Here are some other "features" of the school: 

- It is spread over 21 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectacre">hectares</a> and is composed of 28 buildings with modern classrooms, computer and science laboratories, an auditorium, a "wellness center," and a library. 

- Students, who are from poor families across South Africa's nine provinces, were chosen for their "intelligence and leadership qualities."

- Eventually the school will accommodate 450 girls. 

- Oprah has vowed to make the academy the "best school in the world" and promised that she would continue to support the girls so they could attend any university in the world.

This model of school development has many implications for educational systems in the U.S. and around the world. I have no doubt that all the students in Oprah's new school will excel. However, it is probably just as significant to conceptualize and implement other types of learning units/environments that would be just as educative. A good first step might be to study the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls alongside other schools/learning environments.
