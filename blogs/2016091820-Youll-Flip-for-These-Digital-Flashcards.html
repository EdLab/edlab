<p>From the creators of <a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> comes a new flashcard app that can build your knowledge in practically any subject area. <a href="https://tinycards.duolingo.com">Tinycards</a> combines premade flashcards from sites such as Duolingo, TinyHistory, and TinyScience with user-generated decks to provide an eclectic learning experience.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Tinycards is useful for both students preparing for class and people learning for fun. It contains flashcard decks on most languages, as well as on anatomy, geography, and the periodic table, to name a few topics. The wide range of school subjects found in tinycards makes the app a practical study tool. In addition, because many users create their own decks, you can find flashcards on virtually any subject. Whether you want to learn famous soccer players, dog breeds, or world flags, you won’t have a problem finding a deck.</p>
 
<p>Despite the variety of flashcards available on tinycards, its interface remains simple, intuitive, and aesthetically appealing throughout. Users can search for decks based on subject, creator, or what’s trending at the moment. Also, because you can follow certain creators and view their profiles, there is a social element to tinycards that makes the experience more interactive and compelling.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Much like Duolingo, the levels in tinycards become increasingly difficult as you advance through the game and remain locked until you pass the level preceding it. Unlike Duolingo, there is no test you can pass to prove your pre-existing competence in a certain subject and skip ahead; users must practice each deck sequentially. This means that although I have an advanced understanding of French, I must plod through the basic level decks until I reach the vocabulary I actually want to practice. This is very time consuming. Although flipping through each deck might make sense for a subject with fewer cards, it is impractical for a subject like French that has 71 categories with a handful of decks each. Unfortunately, I’ll have to pass on that one.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Tinycards is a useful study tool for students and a fun platform to learn specific facts for anyone who loves trivia. It’s best suited for people who are unfamiliar or who have just a beginner’s knowledge on a certain topic. By far its fullest decks are on foreign language vocabulary and world geography, although science and pop culture are also popular topics. While it’s certainly not the best tool for learning a new subject, it is a great supplementary companion while learning the material elsewhere. It’s the type of app that is perfect to bust out in airport lobbies or in the backseat on road trips, which is why I’ll be keeping this one on my device.</p>
