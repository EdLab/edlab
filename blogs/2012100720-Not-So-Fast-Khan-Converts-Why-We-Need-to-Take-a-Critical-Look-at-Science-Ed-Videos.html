Have you ever watched something, only to immediately forget what you saw and heard seconds after turning away from the screen? Even if you can’t recall this phenomenon happening to you, chances are, it has. Or, so says Derek Muller of <a href=" http://www.veritasium.org/">Veritasium.org</a>, a blog that publishes educational science videos. As someone who has devoted a tremendous amount of time and energy to studying how to create effective videos to teach science (he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the topic), Derek has gathered scientific evidence that, he feels, dispels some of the frenzy surrounding the videos of Khan Academy and others like it. 
<p>
His main argument is not that the videos of Khan Academy are useless (in fact, he thinks they are great resources for educators), but rather that they potentially encourage passive learning, and one of the consequences of such passive viewing is forgetting or not accurately remembering information. Also, Khan-esque videos do not do enough to challenge learners who hold preconceived notions (which are often misconceptions) of scientific concepts. For example, he found that if learners who hold erroneous knowledge simply watched a video that contains straightforward, correct information, they will (<a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1973#time=423&comment_id=30882">@7:03</a>) stop paying attention because they assume they already know the information. Therefore, they do not recognize that what is being presented is different from what they believe to be true. Perhaps the most disturbing revelation, though, is that learners become more confident in whatever mistaken ideas they held before watching the video.
<p>
Have you been able to learn a scientific concept by using Khan Academy, or do Derek’s findings ring true for you (or your students)? Do you think that the proliferation of online videos ultimately helps or hurts the future of learning? Check out the reactions to Derek’s video below and be sure to add your own thoughts to the <a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1973">vialogue</a>!

<a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1973#time=421&comment_id=30883">@7:01</a> Carla: Eh... I don't know. I feel like whenever I watch a video for learning purposes, I'm pretty open and I DO learn something. Otherwise, how would we ever learn anything if we're not presented with the correct information outright? 
<p>
<a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1973#time=294&comment_id=30884">@4:54</a> RemyV: I can absolutely see how this can be so. If I believe something to be true, why would I bother learning more about it, let alone what I think to be the WRONG information? I wonder how we gain those misconceptions in the first place... 
<p>
<a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1973#time=376&comment_id=12933">@6:16</a> Katezvdp: Seems like clearing-up misconceptions before establishing meaningful learning is crucial!
