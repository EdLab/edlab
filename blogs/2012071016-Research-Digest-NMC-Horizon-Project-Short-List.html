          <p>
            The New Media Consortium (NMC) publishes an annual report, entitled their <a href="http://www.nmc.org/news/its-here-releases-horizon-report-2012-k-12-edition">Horizon Project</a>, spotlighting the technologies they think will have the greatest impact on education in the next 5 years. A lot of the technologies mentioned are ones that we at EdLab are familiar with. The authors of the article provide real-world examples of some of the technologies being adapted in the classroom or elsewhere, and I'll share some of the more interesting ones in this post. 

<strong>Time to adoption: 1 year or less</strong>
Cloud computing, collaborative environments, mobiles and apps, and tablet computing.
<i>Example:</i>
Using iPads in the classroom in the wake of Christchurch earthquakes in 2011 
<a href="http://vimeo.com/23582085">http://vimeo.com/23582085</a>

<strong>Time to adoption: 2 to 3 years</strong>
Digital identity, game-based learning, learning analytics, personal learning environments
<i>Example:</i>
Evoke, a social networking game that simulates real world issues and encourages users to fine new, innovative solutions to the problems 
<a href="http://www.urgentevoke.com/">http://www.urgentevoke.com/</a>

<strong>Time to adoption: 4 to 5 years</strong>
Augmented reality, natural user interfaces, semantic applications, tools for assessing 21st century learning trends
<i>Example:</i>
Augmented reality of your internal organs using your webcam. Try it out! Cool!

Additionally, the authors identify the overarching trends and key challenges in education today. Again, some of these are going to sound like a tired refrain to people in EdTech, but they're still worth highlighting.

<strong>Trends</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The abundance of resources/relationships made easily accessible via the internet is increasingly challenging us to revisit our roles as educators.
</li>
<li>
As the cost of technology drops and school districts recise and open up their access policies, it is becoming increasingly common for students to bring their own movile devices.
</li>
<li>
Education paradigms are shifting to include online learning, hybrd learning, and collaborative models.
<li>
One-to-one computing is spreading to a large number of countries and regions.</li>
<li>People expect to be able to work, learn, and study whenever and wherever they want to.</li>
<li>Technology continues to profoundly affect the way we work, collaborate, communicate, and succeed.
</li>
<li>
There is a new emphasis in the classroom on more challenge-based and active learning.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The demand for personalized learning is not adequately supported by current technology or practices.
</li>
<li>
Digital media literacy continues its rise in importance as a key skill in every discipline and profession.
</li>
<li>
Economic pressures and new models of education are bringing unprecedented competition to traditional primary and secondary schools.
</li>
<li>
Institutional barriers present formidable challenges to moving forward in a constructive way with emerging technologies.
</li>
<li>
K-12 must tackle the increased blending of formal and informal learning.</li>
<li>Learning that incorporates real life experiences is not occurring enough and is undervalued when it does take place.
</li>
<li>
Many activities related to learning and education take place outside the walls of the classroom and thus are not part of traditional learning metrics.
</li>
<li>
Putting 21st century technology into 19th century schools is a major undertaking.
</li>
<li>We are not using digital media for formative assessment the way we could and should.
</li></ul>
<strong>EdLab Relevance</strong>
This is a very brief overview of the findings, but in the interest of space, I wanted to make sure I hit on the main points. At EdLab, we probably want to look at the technologies that are 4-5 years away from adoption and start developing a long term strategy that includes the incorporation of these technologies so we put ourselves in a position to make the greatest possible impact when these technologies attain widespread usage.
