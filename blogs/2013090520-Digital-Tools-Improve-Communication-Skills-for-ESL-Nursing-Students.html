<p><b>Title:</b> Improving clinical communication of students with English as a second language (ESL) using online technology: A small scale evaluation study (2012)</p>

<b>Authors:</b> Fran Rogan & Caroline San Miguel</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471595312002302">Nurse Education in Practice</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Are podcasts and vodcasts effective learning tools for first-year undergraduate ESL nursing students to develop clinical practice communication skills?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Nursing is an increasingly popular area of study among ESL students. Unfortunately, due to the lack of industry-specific language resources, students are at high risk of being unprepared for clinical interactions and even clinical failure. A study from the University of Technology in Sydney Australia evaluated an independent learning program that blended online resources and classroom activities. Through a series of university grants, a program designated "Clinically Speaking" gave first semester undergraduate ESL students access to a collection of podcasts, vodcasts, online audiovisual terminology tools, transcripts, and worksheets focused on typical interactions among nurses, patients, and staff. A group of approximately 300 ESL students, primarily from China, Korea, Nepal, and Vietnam, completed evaluation surveys at the end of their first semester based on how often they used the tools, why they didn’t, how they helped prepare for clinical placements, and suggested improvements.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Overall, the majority of students regarded the resources as effective learning tools. Approximately two thirds of participants agreed that the podcasts prepared them to use clinical terminology. Students responded even more favorably to the audio-visual tools with a larger majority of participants indicating that vodcasts significantly increased their confidence in clinical situations. Participants reported that the combination of resources helped them with both nursing and communication skills and helped them develop a better rapport with patients. Specific features of the program that were beneficial included correct pronunciation modeling, an emphasis on spelling, and the ease of accessibility, which facilitated independent learning. Despite the positive reception, students also provided constructive feedback, asking for more vocabulary definitions as well as the option of synonyms and colloquial alternatives for the target language.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The study’s authors attribute some of program’s success to the collaborative development process that included students, academics, and clinical facilitators, and they recommend that future language learning resources also incorporate feedback among all stakeholders. As positive as the reviews were, it’s difficult to generalize the potential effectiveness of these tools for a wider student population in other subject areas because of the small survey size and the focus on specific language and job skills. Within the nursing field, these tools appear to be a successful model for creating a program that enables all students to develop effective patient communication skills, regardless of their language background.</p>
