          <p>
            I really like the EbLab website, it is great. I believe there are some things can make it even greater. There should be an instant notification feature for when someone comments on one of your blogs. This would be really helpful. I would also like to see a tagging function where you can see if you've been tagged in a post or comment. If you are mentioned in a blog because you are possibly working on a project with someone else, it would be nice to get notified as well. You would also receive a notification when someone tags you. Another good feature I would like to see is to be able to follow a person who usually blogs about things you are also working on or have an interest in learning more about. 

We can also add something like circles as they have in Google+ where you can make a circle with the people you are working on a project with and post updates there for everyone in your circle to see. These are just some ideas I had as I was reading blogs earlier today. What are your thoughts on these ideas and any other ideas you have about improving our website?
