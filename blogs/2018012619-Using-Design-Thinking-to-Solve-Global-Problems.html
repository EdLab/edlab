<p>How does designing a computer mouse relate to creating a school? Ask <a href="https://www.ideo.com">Ideo</a>, a design consulting firm, and they’ll tell you that both require the process of design thinking. Ideo started as a product design firm that made electronic products, including the computer mouse, accessible to more people. Now, they’ve taken that iteration process and started applying it to systems instead of products, such as a school system in Peru. They also have <a href="https://www.ideou.com">an educational platform</a> for anyone who wants to learn more about design thinking because they feel so strongly that design thinking can change the world.</p>

<p>According to Ideo, there are four steps to design thinking: observation, ideation, prototyping, and testing. That process is repeated until the finished product meets the original need. The design thinking process is currently being used to tackle many significant societal problems, including rethinking educational systems and finding ways to solve food shortages.</p>

<p>Do you think there is room for prototyping in a school, where every decision has real effects on students and teachers? Which aspects of society do you think design thinking would work best with? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41221">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@03:25 Dyranda:</b> I think we need to be careful about turning students into customers and keep in mind they are in school to learn, not just math, economics, history and geography but civics too.</p>

<p><b>@04:03 Buster Wainwright:</b> They make a good point in regards to learning from the prototype... who would have thought the first mouse was based on the roll on deodorant model!</p>
