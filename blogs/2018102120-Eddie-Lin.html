Eddie Lin is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.nexusedge.com/">NexusEdge</a>, an online company that partners with institutions to give students access to video mentoring and microcredentials as well as courses on Linkedin Learning intended to supplement traditional courses. He started his career in New York at UBS Investment Bank and Goldman Sachs. He also worked in marketing at Adobe and competed as a contestant on the reality TV show Fear Factor, where he ate 20 live bees (a great learning experience and influential in his career strategy). Upon receiving his MBA, Lin worked in strategy and business development at Live Nation/Ticketmaster. He eventually moved into education technology and has also served as adjunct faculty. He holds a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and an MBA from the University of Southern California, where he served as Class President. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at NexusEdge?</b><br>
<p>My co-founder Shanti and I started NexusEdge out of our lifelong pursuit for career fulfillment. When we met 13 years ago, we were struggling to find a career that was the right fit for us because we didn't have the right guidance at the time. We have personally struggled with this process and we eventually found our way. In general, this process starts in high school, carries into postsecondary, and continues well into our careers. And we have learned the specific challenges of this process for underserved demographics through becoming their teachers, mentors, and administrators.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at NexusEdge will change the way learners approach their education?</b><br>
<p>We have created a scalable method for current industry expectations to be taught in the classroom by using artificial intelligence and machine learning to help students transition from school into the workforce. We have a unique approach to credentialing, and this is changing instructional design in the classroom. We firmly believe that artificial intelligence and machine learning is the only way to advise tens of millions of students at scale, and this will democratize access to opportunity. This has been reflected in the organizations that have been recognized for using AI and machine learning to help low-income, minority, and first-generation students get into and through college.</p>
 
<p>Our experience working with students in the classroom has helped us understand first-hand the disconnect between the classroom and industry. We have worked with classrooms across a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds, and all knowledge gained in these areas has been incorporated into the product.</p>
 
<p>We have helped numerous students with career guidance in a wide variety of career paths; this led us to design a machine learning solution to provide advice at scale.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>We are already seeing a greater personalization of learning at all ages, and this can only be executed at scale through artificial intelligence and machine learning. We’re starting to see this as more of an emphasis across education venture capital as well, which we believe reflects a more permanent shift in education itself. For postsecondary education, we have already started seeing a greater emphasis on the development of skills, and less on the degree itself. There is a decreasing emphasis on the significance of where you went to school, but more on the skills learned irrespective of how they were learned (MOOC, bootcamp, etc.). I believe we will see a greater rise of meritocracy in the hiring process. If you can do the job, you should get the job.</p>
 
<p><b>What, if any, are future plans for NexusEdge?</b><br>
<p>The future plans for NexusEdge center around growing a network of employer partners and expanding more robustly across other states in the US.</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lesamitchell">@LesaMitchell</a> is our Managing Director from Techstars. She is passionate about education, coming from a large non-profit with a large emphasis on Education, the Kauffman Foundation, and puts a tremendous effort into growing the education startups in her Techstars portfolio.</p>
 
<p>She’s not active on Twitter, but she’s a great champion of innovation in education: <a href="https://twitter.com/deborahquazzo">@deborahquazzo</a> is a partner at GSV Capital, one of the largest Venture Capital firms in the world. She also places the greatest emphasis on education, founding the ASU+GSV conference 10 years ago, which has grown into one of the most prominent education conferences in the country with attendees from all over the world. Previous speakers have included Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Vicente Fox, John Legend, and many others.</p>
 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/michaelmoe">@michaelmoe</a> is the co-founder of ASU+GSV as well, but I don’t know him as well. <a href="https://twitter.com/lijiang2087">@lijiang2087</a> is also a sharp guy, also from GSV, who stays on top of latest trends.</p>
