<p><a href="https://labyrinth.thinkport.org">Lure of the Labyrinth</a> is a digital game geared toward pre-algebra students. The game merges comic book dialogue, monster mythology, and mathematical challenges as it sends players on a quest to find their missing pet in a dark, monster-filled sewer world. In order to succeed, players must complete various math games that test pre-algebra skills such as proportions, fractions, areas, and slopes.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The mathematical games in Lure of the Labyrinth are both fun and challenging; they require real calculation to complete, yet also focus on comical or amusing scenarios that make them engaging. For instance, players practice proportions by doling out globs of food to monsters at the employee cafeteria, and they practice areas and perimeters by planting fantastical flowers to avoid herbivorous garden gnomes. Although the graphics and game controls are simple, they will definitely keep middle school students entertained, and the game’s comic book features not only enhance the game’s narrative, but also add literacy practice to the experience.</p>
 
<p>Lure of the Labyrinth also has an incredible amount of resources that allow teachers to easily integrate the game into their regular lessons. The website includes curriculum plans for each math challenge in Lure of the Labyrinth, complete with additional activities, assessments, and an explicit connection to national educational standards. There are also explanations of each math challenge and videos on how to implement the game in the classroom.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The biggest problem I encountered in Lure of the Labyrinth was the lack of explicit instructions for completing each math challenge or even for navigating the surroundings. Challenges are presented without explicit instructions, and players must figure out the objective of each game as they play. Even with a firm grasp of pre-algebra, I found some of the challenges completely puzzling the first time through because of this lack of instruction. The game would be more supportive if it offered clear instructions or a hint button for each challenge and for the game map itself. At one point, I spent a significant amount of time searching for a door that turned out to be in a completely different room that I had never been in before, and the game did not make that clear. Teachers who want to implement Lure of the Labyrinth will likely have to explain the objective of each challenge before students play and guide them through the game landscape.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Lure of the Labyrinth will be a fun and challenging addition to middle school pre-algebra classrooms. Students will engage in games that require real mathematical understanding, and the provided curriculum and lesson plans make it easy for teachers to implement the game in class. The only downside is the lack of instructions and hints in the game itself. Teachers will have to be prepared to supplement those details for students in class.</p>
