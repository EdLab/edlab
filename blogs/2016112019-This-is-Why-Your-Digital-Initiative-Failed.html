<p> One-to-one computing initiatives, which aim to provide all students with access to personal devices like laptops and tablets, are becoming increasingly popular. Yet, many educators still view the introduction of personal technology in the classroom with skepticism. If teachers view in-class digital devices in a negative light there’s little chance that these ambitious initiatives will succeed. So, how can ed policymakers and practitioners better understand and account for teacher attitudes and beliefs towards tech? </p>
 
<p>Researchers in this study set out to develop a new survey instrument for measuring the attitudes of teachers toward digital devices in the classroom. They were interested in the academic, social, emotional, and personal effects that teachers believed digital devices had on students. Researchers developed survey questions with the help of current educators and then piloted the survey on a group of 59 teachers at one Jesuit high school in the Midwestern United States. The survey presented teachers with statements such as, "personal devices allow students to form more meaningful relationships and students actively ‘goof off’ when using personal devices in class." Participants were asked to rank their level of agreement with each statement and the data was then analyzed for reliability and grouped based on a principal components analysis. </p>
 
<p>Initially, researchers expected the data to be interpretable in terms of the <i>payoff</i> of digital devices for students in the <i>cognitive,</i> <i>interpersonal,</i> and <i>intrapersonal</i> domains. However three unexpected categories emerged through data analysis. These clusters related to: a) teachers’ immediate concerns about student distraction, b) their practical concerns about classroom learning, and c) their vocational concerns for the holistic growth of students. </p>
 
<p>Researchers found that teachers viewed the impact of digital devices in terms of how they experienced them in day-to-day practice. While most teachers believed that these devices could positively impact certain academic outcomes, they were also concerned that devices were distracting and that increased screen time could lead to negative social and emotional consequences for learners. Surveys like this one could become valuable tools for researchers and practitioners, allowing them to keep teachers in mind as they design, evaluate, and improve digital initiatives.</p>
