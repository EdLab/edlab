Recently there has been much debate over the future of developing applications for the iPhone. The article, <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/34473/Apple-Control-freak-or-quality-catalyst">'Apple--control freak or quality catalyst?'</a>posted on the develop blog yesterday summarized such discussions as well as details regarding Apple's decision to harness only native code. Apple will release new terms of service (ToS) for the forthcoming iPhone OS 4.0 this summer. The general sense is that the new ToS aims to tighten the grip on the way applications are developed for the platform. Basically, Apple is proposing that all iPhone and iPad applications must be 'originally written' in C/C++/Objective-C, which would seem to suggest they are looking to create an environment that encourages the use of native code and the Cocoa Touch API as the sole platform for App development.

This is news is obviously an issue for popular third party or meta-platforms such as Adobe's Flash, and alternative App development platforms that run above Cocoa Touch such as .Net through MonoTouch. It has sparked considerable debate from both ends. 
<blockquote>Adobe's Lee Brimelow used his blog to claim Apple is implementing â€œtyrannical control over developers and more importantly, wanting to use developers as pawns in their crusade against Adobe."

Whereas some of the new features of Apple's 4.0 OS, such as an Xbox Live-styled social network and in-App advertising system, have been received well by a number of developers, who have voiced that opening the doors to the likes of Flash would "simply flood the app store with a bunch of crap".</blockquote>

Additional third party development platforms such as Unity, have also taken to <a href= "http://blogs.unity3d.com/2010/04/10/unity-and-the-iphone-os-4-0/">their blog</a> to discuss the possible interpretations the ToS could take on in order to delineate how they and their many users who develop with this platform will be affected.
