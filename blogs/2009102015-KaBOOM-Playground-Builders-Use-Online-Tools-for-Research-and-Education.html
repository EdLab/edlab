            KaBOOM! is a national non-profit that empowers communities to build playgrounds. Arianna Choi's <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=blog/628">Trends in Ed, 10.19.09</a> blog post about Snug Playgrounds reminded me of KaBOOM! and their interesting approach to the education of play.

For those of you unfamiliar with <a href="http://kaboom.org/">KaBOOM!</a>, since 1995 this non-profit has led over 1,500 <a href="http://connect.kaboom.org/_Blue-Cross-and-Blue-Shield-of-North-Carolina-builds-a-playspace-with-YMCA-of-Northwest-North-Carolina-Winston/video/766160/14937.html?b=">playground construction projects</a> that pair community leaders with funding partners who support their mission.

Of interest to those of us at EdLab, the KABOOM! website contains two very cool educational features for its users, a <a href="http://kaboom.org/build_playspace/toolkit/road_map">KaBOOM! toolkit</a> and a <a href="http://playspacefinder.kaboom.org/">KaBOOM! Playspace Finder</a>.

The <a href="http://kaboom.org/build_playspace/toolkit/road_map">KaBOOM! toolkit</a> is used for developing a playground build project from "mile marker 1" (Research) to "mile marker 8" (Maintain). Each mile marker contains an online course about that stage in the playspace building process. Lesson descriptions and supplemental materials are available for each mile marker. KaBOOM! also provides live online training sessions in conjunction with the toolkit.

The <a href="http://playspacefinder.kaboom.org/">KaBOOM! Playspace Finder</a> is an online tool that allows users to identify and rate parks across the country. Members comment about playspace design, upload site photos, and include detailed descriptions of playspaces, which allows anyone to perform coast-to-coast field research without leaving their office.

I think KaBOOM! is a good model for online learning about playground design. Their website also contains discussion groups, a message board, user profiles, and most recently they implemented podcasting, which highlights subject area experts. <a href="http://connect.kaboom.org/_Nature-Play-with-the-Grass-Stain-Guru-KaPODCAST-001/video/807186/14937.html">Click here</a> for an example podcast, as host Danielle Marshall talks with Bethe Almeras, author of the Grass Stain Guru and preeminent voice for natural playspaces and nature play for children.

Personally, I have participated in two playground builds in Pittsburgh, PA through the Junior League of Pittsburgh. I would recommend KaBOOM! to anyone who wants a phenomenal community service experience!
