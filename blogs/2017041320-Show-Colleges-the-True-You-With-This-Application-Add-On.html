<p>Ah, the Common App. College applicants appreciate the convenience of applying to multiple schools at once, but it’s difficult to feel truly represented through a series of stock essay questions and transcript requests. <a href="https://www.zeemee.com">ZeeMee</a> is trying to change that. Geared toward high school students applying to college, ZeeMee is a free social media platform and visual resume that students can attach to their applications to show colleges their <i>true selves</i>.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>ZeeMee offers several different services. The most notable is the public profile students can create to attach to their applications. Students fill out information regarding their activities and personal life with pictures and videos of each. They also have the option of adding a meet me video. The profile ultimately looks like a resume infused with visuals, and the link can be included on the applications of partnered colleges. As of now, over 200 colleges, including schools such as Carnegie Mellon and Virginia Tech, accept ZeeMee links as part of their application process.</p>
 
<p>In addition to this, ZeeMee offers students a platform to meet other people interested in or accepted to the same colleges. This allows students to get a sense of the school’s culture and to begin creating communities before reaching campus. This is a particularly useful feature for nontraditional students. ZeeMee also just launched a video text messaging system that further aids in the college application process by sending students reminders throughout this grueling time. For students who don’t have a solid relationship with their teachers or guidance counselors, this could make all the difference between those who make it to college and those who don’t.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While ZeeMee offers many useful features for students as they transition from high school to college, the main focus of the company could potentially be problematic. For instance, while partnered colleges are able to access ZeeMee profiles to get a better sense of a student’s personality, it could give these students an unfair advantage over others without a ZeeMee account. This will continue to be a problem until, if ever, ZeeMee becomes an application requirement. Also, whenever images or videos are included in an application, there is always the risk that implicit biases will creep into the decision making process more than with traditional application materials.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>ZeeMee has a valorous mission: to make the college application process more personal. More than that, the app can help students with similar interests form friendships and communities before starting classes. This aspect of the app could encourage all students to reach campus after being accepted, but especially students from underserved communities. ZeeMee has the potential to become ubiquitous for graduating high school students, but whether or not it will truly change the application process is still to be determined.</p>
