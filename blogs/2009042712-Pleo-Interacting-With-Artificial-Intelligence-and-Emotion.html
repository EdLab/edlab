          <p>
            Recently, I had the privilege of caring for "Pleo", a baby robotic dinosaur for a class with Dr. Sandra Okita, "Theories and Boundaries of Technological Artifacts". Pleo, designed by a group of  robotics experts, animators, engineers, and programmers combines electronic, sensory, and neuronetic systems that give him the ability to interact and have adaptable behaviors. 

During this two-week period of care, I observed how Pleo's behavior and personality formed according to the level of care I gave him.  In order to properly care for Pleo, you need to give him the type of attention you would give a puppy.  Pleo needs to be adequately fed, spoken to, petted, and interacted (or played)with in order to thrive and develop a positive/strong personality.  When placed with new environments or people, Pleo's behaviors and reactions change accordingly.  For example, when he was two days old, I took him to a group meeting.  Pleo exhibited classic symptoms of shyness- hanging his head down, crying when he couldn't see me, etc.

As I explain in the video, I believe that a toy like Pleo could be quite beneficial educationally- as the owner, you are given a tangible reflection of how your actions can affect another life form.

On a sadder note, Ugobe (the makers of Pleo) went bankrupt in April of 2009.  According to Wikipedia, "on April 17th, 2009 Ugobe filed chapter 7 bankruptcy, and halted the production of new Pleos".  Unfortunately, it seems that Pleo may have the same fate as his real-life ancestors and may become extinct.
