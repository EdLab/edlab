Though it is now defunct, <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/640">inBloom</a> had big ideas for education, as evidenced by the video above. Tablets take center stage as vehicles to collect and view data on student performance, progress, and other assessment metrics. The teachers are portrayed as never without their mobile devices and are all too happy to add a last minute homework assignment to their students’ online learning portals. <p>

The data capture component of this story has hit many a nerve. In the last several years, a host of articles have been published in the wake of rising concerns about student privacy in large data systems like inBloom. For example, as the <a href= "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/business/deciding-who-sees-students-data.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&">New York Times reports</a>, "Parents in Louisiana raised a ruckus after discovering that their children’s Social Security numbers had been uploaded to inBloom." 

In light of inBloom’s closure, policy makers and superintendents have been working to understand what data can and should be collected and how this data should be managed so that it can most effectively and safely advance the education of students. <p>

InBloom controversy aside, how do you see this story playing out in 5 years? Does such a system raise concerns for you about student data? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13536">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@6:06 JordaJean:</b> I like how, at the end, the students seem to be taking charge of their learning. Nice that technology could assist in this, but could self-directed learning occur in children in the absence of tech?<p>

<b>@06:11:Welmer</b> This would be nice, but with unemployment as it is I don't see every parent checking an i-pad every night to see what your child did.<p>

<b>@06:30 MartinPaper:</b> Isn't inBloom the company that is getting into hot water over its data collection practices? No wonder they imagine the future to be entirely digital-dependent. How else will they make money!
