          <p>
            I believe that it is reasonable for a city's school board to close one or two schools within a district if the performance of a particular school(s) is very poor. But according to this <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/51969896#.UZ1Xk5U9_ww">article</a>, the Chicago School Board has voted to close up to fifty public schools: forty-nine elementary schools and one high school for the sake of financial footing and better education. How do you improve education when the source or the facility to provide education has been terminated? 

As expected, the community or the Chicago Teachers Union didn't take this information pleasantly. And I understand their frustration because I think there should be a better way to improve education in that district rather than taking actions that appears to damage education. Closing a school should be base on the poor performances of the school but not based on budget shortfalls. After all, there are better ways to reform a school that is suffering from a financial setback. As stated in the article, the school closure do not only put students' education at risk but their lives will also be at risk because they will be forced “…to cross gang boundaries in order to get to their new classrooms.” This decision by the Chicago School Board affect students from low-income families and the worst of all, it affects students with specials needs. If you were to ask my opinion about this case, I would tell you that the School Board of any district should think deeply about the pros and cons before closing any school. If the decision to close schools is not solely base on the schools performances, they should think twice.
