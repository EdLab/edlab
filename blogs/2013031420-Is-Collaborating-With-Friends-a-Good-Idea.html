<p><b>Title:</b> When Is Collaborating With Friends A Good Idea? Insights From Design Education (2009)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Heidy Maldonado, Scott R. Klemmer, & Roy D. Pea</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Existing research on collaboration has shown a significant and large negative correlation between prior friendship and group work performance. The literature shows that working with friends yields lower-quality outcomes, disruptive behavior, pressure to agree with prevailing ideas, and a reluctance to give critical feedback. Studies that created perceptions of high affiliation and agreement among teammates found that this contributed to a decline in performance. However, the existing literature has not yet considered the heterogeneity of friendships common to educational environments; it is rare that student work groups are composed entirely of friends. Educational settings often compel a combination of friends, acquaintances, strangers, and even rivals to work together. This study sought to examine the outcomes of naturally-formed groups in an online environment.
 <p>
<i>When Is Collaborating With Friends A Good Idea? Insights From Design Education</i> used quantitative and qualitative methodologies to investigate the relationship between project quality and pre-existing friendship among teammates in design project collaborations. The aim of the study was to understand how prior friendships in student groups influence learning and performance in computer-supported collaboration. Data was collected from 39 university students, working together in teams as part of the coursework for six weeks. Students were asked to rate their relationships to each teammate at the end of the class so researchers could determine the numbers of friends, acquaintances, and non-friends or strangers in each group. A group friendship score for each team was calculated by averaging the group membersâ€™ individual friendship ratings. Team project performance and grade were determined by a panel of academics and independent judges.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results confirmed that there is a significant negative correlation between prior friendship and group performance. The researchers found that mixed teams, which contained a more even mix of friends and strangers, produced even worse results than groups with high friendship ratings. They also found that the items in the self-evaluation questionnaire related to positive team dynamics were not significantly correlated with the prior friendship of group members; groups of friends were no more likely than other groups to report that their team had fun together, got along well, or liked one another.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The research team speculated that friendships in groups tend to influence the formation of teams, the type and number of group meetings, and decision-making and work allocation for project tasks. Students were more likely to group with friends when given a choice, but in groups with high friendship ratings harmony became more important than product. The spectacular failure of mixed teams was attributed to a failure to form a group identity, which teams with high friendship scores did readily. These findings are a bit of a downer for educators. Friendships in the workplace have long been <a href="http://spr.sagepub.com/content/12/2/199.full.pdf+html"> associated with</a> satisfaction and retention. As traditional higher education becomes more competitive with other learning strategies and learning relies more heavily on self-motivation, retention efforts will have to increase, and it is unfortunate that this simple strategy is often in conflict with quality work. More research is needed to examine the relationships students form in online environments but serious students, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w536Alnon24">reality television contestants</a>, may not be there to make friends.</p>
