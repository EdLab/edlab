<p><a href="https://flat.io/en/">Flat</a> is a web-based music score editor that allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on musical writing and arrangement. Developed by Tutteo Limited, it offers specific features <a href="https://flat.io/en/edu">for educators</a> to integrate Flat into the classroom, such as the ability to sync with Google Classroom and to track student progress on class assignments.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The first thing you might notice about Flat is its clean, sleek interface with its familiar tool selection and intuitively categorized menu options. The program requires no installation, so you can get started right away just by going to the website. Tons of instruments, from piano and trumpet to glockenspiel and ukulele, are available for use, and navigating all the selected instruments is easy through the drag-and-drop tools. You can also use the playback function to hear how the composition sounds; adding lyrics and chord progressions are built right into the program as well.</p>

<p>If you need to revert back to an earlier version of your score, you can go through the tracked versions to retrieve one of the iterations that gets saved automatically as you’re working. When your masterpiece is complete, you can export it in various file types, including midi, pdf, and mp3. Collaboration is easy through Flat, making it ideal to use in music classrooms, and teachers can encourage their students to edit each other’s work or co-compose a song.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>In order to be easily integrated in a classroom setting, educational products and software should have tools and features that facilitate productive assessments and feedback. Flat would benefit from having a system for teachers to provide their students with feedback. For example, a commenting feature similar to the one in Google Docs could help educators highlight specific parts of the score and provide detailed feedback that students could use to edit their work.</p>

<p>Although Flat provides blog posts on music theory as well as tutorial videos for teachers just getting started with their product, it would be helpful for teachers if there were also suggested curriculum and lesson plans around online score writing, either developed by Flat itself or by other educators through a crowd-sourced sharing platform. This would help music educators integrate new and potentially unfamiliar technology like Flat in a smooth and effective way, ensuring that students are getting the most out of this new product.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Flat is a great music score writing program that can be used for free (though a premium "Power" plan is available as a subscription if desired) in the classroom. As music education evolves, teachers will be looking for helpful technologies that foster collaborative and creative learning, and Flat is, without a doubt, a fantastic option.</p>
