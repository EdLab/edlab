Galeet Cohen, a middle school teacher, has a funny way of keeping her class in order. How’s that, you ask? She makes them laugh! <p>

Never missing an opportunity to chide a student or inject a little self-deprecating humor, Galeet has crafted a teaching persona that puts her kids at ease and on their toes. Even when they act up, she reacts in character with a logical course of action. This approach has earned her respect from countless students who are used to getting a "because I said so" response to a prescribed punishment like detention. <p>

Galeet appreciates a good sense of humor. "Kids are funny!" she says. The way she says it, with the hint of a laugh cracking her voice, makes you wait in anticipation for a punchline. It’s easy to see how she could captivate her students. <p>

Besides the obvious laughter factor, what benefits could be had from a wisecracking teacher? Tell us about the funniest teacher you’ve ever had in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13596">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:27 Carla:</b> She has a really relaxed attitude with her kids. I loved teachers like this. Sharing a laugh with a teacher (especially if I was the one making the joke) was definitely a form of respect.<p>

<b>@00:58 MartinPaper:</b> If my science teachers were funny (or at least shared their humor with me) I might not actually revile it still. I might even associate it with positive feelings!
