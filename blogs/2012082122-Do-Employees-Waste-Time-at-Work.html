          <p>
            I came across this article on Forbes about how employees manage their working time.  In the piece, the author cites another article by entrepreneur Russ Warner, about how employees should manage their time and work while on their company's clock. Warner cites a survey conducted by <a href="http://www.salary.com/wasting-time-at-work-2012/">salary.com</a>, as one of several evidences that employees to do waste company time with internet surfing top of the wasting time list. Facebook, LinkedIn and Amazon are several of the sites that employees visit when wasting company time.
 
According to Warner, the 18-35 age group are the biggest culprits when it comes to unnecessary Internet surfing at work. He cites five reasons why employees surf the web during company time: (1) they don't feel challenged enough in their job. Other reasons include, (2) they work too many hours, (3) the company doesn't give sufficient incentive to work harder, (4) they are unsatisfied with their career, and (5) they're just bored. Warner offers several solutions for employers such as installing monitoring software on company laptops and computers though as he correctly notes, tech savvy employees can access proxy sites or use their mobile phones as alternatives.
 
What are some other solutions for companies? Does installing monitoring software serve as an invasion of privacy?
