            *PRIVATE*

Today I (along with Pranav and Brian H.) attended Randy Glazer and Aetna's presentation on the new Value Plan which will be offered at the College. 

Personally, I have mixed feelings. I much prefer the old Oxford network of practitioners. However, I'm generally a fan of Health Savings Account plans because the overall costs are typically lower in most cases. Additionally, you can contribute money to the account <i>PRE TAX</i> and it's not a "use it or lose it" set up such as an FSA. Finally, TC will be partially funding the account for 2015 (see below for more details).

Glazer and Aetna's presentation is available <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/i/a/document/33574_Value_Plan_and_HSA.pdf">here</a> or as an attachment to this blog post.

A few pointers from that presentation...

<!--break-->


The <b>most surprising facts about the HSA</b> were:
<ul>
<li>If you are enrolled in TC's 2014 FSA plan and have money left over in your account as of 12/31/2014 you won't be able to use the HSA until 4/1/2015. It's <b>highly recommended to exhaust all of FSA funds by 12/31/2014!!!</b>
<li>You can't keep a regular FSA along with your HSA, but there is a new 
<b>reduced benefit FSA</b> available specifically for dental and vision. However, 
the next point basically makes this type of FSA obsolete in most cases
<li>You can pay dental and vision costs using the HSA which means that in most cases there is no need to carry a separate FSA
<li> HSA contribution amounts <b>CAN</b> be changed month to month, unlike an FSA
</ul>

Some general facts about the TC health plan offerings
<ul>
<li> As before, TC is offering 4 health plans: Access, Direct, Exclusive, and Value
<li> Aetna's Open Access Managed Choice Network of practitioners is the superset of all of their networks and is available for all the plans, except for Exclusiv
<li> The "deluxe" Access Plan is closing as of January 1, 2015. This means that this is the last chance to get into this network. Once you're in that network you won't get kicked out of it in subsequent years. Frankly, I'm not sure if there is really much of a plus to the Access plan as currently structured.
</ul>

Some additional facts about the new HSA Value plan
<ul>
<li> High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) as specified by Federal law
<li> Enrollees will be given links to set up Health Saving Accounts (HSA) at WageWorks (which are actually going to be held at BNY Mellon)
<li> The HSA bank account fees will be paid for by TC
<li> Contributions into the HSA are pre-tax and don't expire
<li> TC will be contributing the following amounts <b>FIRST YEAR ONLY</b>:
<ul>
<li>$300 for individual
<li>$600 for Employee + 1
<li>$900 for family enrollment
</ul>
<li> There is a maximum that you can contribute into the HSA annually, including the TC subsidy. Here are the maximums:
<ul>
<li> $3,350 individual
<li> $6,650 family
</ul>
<li> Deductibles per family, NOT per individual
<li> Outside of routine preventive care (covered 100%  no deductible)
<li> <b>In-network</b> deductibles:
<ul>
<li> $1300 deductible for individual
<li> $2600 deductible for EE+1 or  family
</ul>
<li> After deductible: 20% copay of the negotiated Aetna rate
<li> Out of network: 30% copay
<li> (In network) Out of pocket cap (deductible + coinsurance or Rx copays): 
<ul>
<li> Single $3,300
<li> Employee + 1 or Family $6,600
</ul>
</ul>
