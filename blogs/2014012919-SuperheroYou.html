<i>SuperheroYou combines education and entertainment to inspire <a href="http://superheroyou.com/conference/">intelligent events</a> and experiences that spark deep connections, collaboration, creativity and change.  It’s a community dedicated to helping you unleash your superpower.</i> (from the SuperHero You <a href="http://superheroyou.com/about/">site</a>)
<p>

<b>Quick, Qwik Learning</b><br>
Founded by Jim Qwik (yes that is his real name), <a href="http://superheroyou.com/">Superhero You</a> takes the elements of participatory motivational events and combines them with workshops to facilitate "<a href="http://kwiklearning.com/">Qwik Learning</a>" techniques led by both Qwik and leading rapid learning experts (<a href="http://superheroyou.com/experts/">here</a> is a recent list of co-presenters).  These "intelligent events" which are designed to entertain, inform and motivate both individuals and teams, are focused on Qwik’s unique memorization and speed-reading techniques.  Qwik lists the goals for these events on the Superheroyou.com site as allowing people to "create deeper connections, collaboration, creativity, and change. It’s a community dedicated to helping you unleash your superpower."  To further this sense of community support, Qwik shares a number of videos from these events on his site from "<a href="http://superheroyou.com/macgyver-creative-problem-solving/">The MacGyver Way to Creative Problem Solving</a>" to "<a href="http://superheroyou.com/tony-hsieh-downtown-vegas/">Unleashing the power of Collisions, Collaboration and Co-Learning</a>." Qwik has also developed a <a href="http://kwiklearning.com/courses/">range of courses</a> and set of support resources to augment these in-person events on his parent site, QwikLearning.com.  
<p>

<b>Saved by Learning</b><br>
Qwik describes his own "come to learning" moment as a visit to the hospital as an overwhelmed college student and blames his exhaustion and subsequent hospital stay on ineffective study habits.  Qwik also explains his mission as being partly fueled by a childhood brain injury that left him "scholastically challenged."  These unconventional "learning moments" are what he identifies as inspiring his life’s mission of "helping others unleash their brainpower to learn anything faster and live a life of greater power, productivity and purpose."  Qwik notes that the current educational system, more often than not, tells learners WHAT to learn and never HOW to learn effectively.   This is an interesting point and one that is especially powerful coming from an individual who struggled to learn in conventional educational settings.  Despite his learning difficulties Qwik has quickly become one of the "accelerated learning" movement’s leading voices and a learning mentor to leaders of Fortune 500 Companies and Ivy League institutions alike.  As is common in the superhero mythos, the learning weakling in everyday life has armed himself with the "super powers" necessary to become a learning powerhouse.
