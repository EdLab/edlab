            I took a UI design course by Professor Steven Feiner this semester and I loved it. Toward the end of the course, we learned some techniques used for information visualization. With such huge amounts of data/information readily available everywhere these days, it becomes important to help the users get a quick overview/summary status and be able to figure out if they need any details and where they may find them. Time and again, researchers have found that human brains can grasp huge amounts of information in the form of visual representations. So if a person were to be shown a pie diagram as opposed to a table of data, he would grasp the conveyed information more easily through the pie-diagram. 

This plays a vital role when the information to be shown is really huge.

One technique we learned in this area was the "Fish-eye-view". The examples I have noted below were mentioned by Prof. Feiner during his lectures.

It's an artificial perspective exactly as you see in the picture above. A fish-eye view takes the perspective of the user, showing the elements that are at the center of focus in greater detail and distorting the elements as their distance from the focus groans bigger. The picture below is a "conceptual" fish-eye view. This famous cover of the New Yorker magazine depicts the perspective of a typical New Yorker, who might know details of 9th avenue, but doesn't care much about what lies beyond the small insignificant strip called New Jersey. :)

So how does it apply to the software world? Writing code editor let you expand and minimize function definitions. When function definitions are minimized you can scan through a huge code file quickly and have a detailed look at only functions which interest you. It's a kind of fish eye view. Here is a screen shot of another plugin. You can hold your mouse of the right pane and see a detailed view in the main pane.

Another interesting application (Fish eye menus)<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/fisheyemenu/fisheyemenu-demo.shtml">here</a>.

Maps implemented with a fisheye effect -

Even the mac has a fish eye view (the magnifier at the bottom of your screen) which some of us see everyday. It looks cool although some times it make life a little more difficult. (It goes a little against Fitt's law. More on that next time.)
