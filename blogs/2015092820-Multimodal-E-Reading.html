<p>E-Readers are commonplace enough now that seeing someone reading a novel or biography on a tablet won’t cause people to look twice. But <a href="http://metabook.com/">Metabook</a> is bringing new features to e-reading that might just make anybody do a double-take.</p>

<p>Metabook is an e-reading platform that provides images, videos, and audio elements to supplement the reading experience. This could be in the form of pictures of the story’s settings, voice acting on behalf of the book’s characters, or author’s notes about the text. As a multimedia reading app, Metabook seeks to provide resources in a multimodal way. Metabook has the book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil slated as the first multimodal book to be published for the app.</p>

<p>Do Metabooks enhance or hinder the reading experience? Will they help or prevent readers from using their imagination and reading comprehension skills? Can they effectively be used in the classroom by students and teachers? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23471/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:01 yaotse:</b> Meta books will provide more visualized meaning to the content in the book. I think there should be an option to have books with regular text as well as the meta books.</p>

<p><b>@00:23 idrissa10:</b> Meta books gives the reader the option to listen to authors recording and use that as a reference point if they do not understand a content from a book. However, as a reader I like to figure out what certain passages mean by myself. The option of stopping and listening to the author’s point of view of a story I believe is too tempting. It takes away from the reader’s imagination and ability to analyze and dissect the information on their own.</p>

<p><b>@01:56 Beckieb:</b> While I like how this platform offers more "features" like photos and videos, there is an element of surprise that I like to keep for myself when I'm reading a book. I don't necessarily want to know what the literal picture of the place the author imagined in their description of a house. That, to me, is a great assessment and indicator of a good writer; their ability to describe something in a way that gets everyone closer to the same picture, or lends itself to the reader's imagination altogether.</p>
