<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 68 individuals, and yet very few evidence-based interventions exist for one of the key characteristics of ASD: social skills deficits. Interventions that do exist tend to be costly, resource-intensive, and vary in terms of outcomes. However, researchers have recently developed a social skills coach in the form of wearable technology that can listen to conversations the user is having and prompt appropriate social responses. </p>
 
<p>This coach takes the form of Holli, a software application that runs through Google Glass, a pair of modified eyeglasses with a small display, microphone, and touchpad. The device captures spoken word from conversations and translates it into text. Then, Holli provides potential responses users can give. </p> 

<p>In order to determine the effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction with this new technology, researchers conducted a study of 15 children between the ages of 8 and 16 with ASD. Though the researchers acknowledge that this is a small sample size, they assure it is sufficient for revealing at least 90% of usability problems. Participants were asked to utilize Holli while engaging in a restaurant-themed interaction with a researcher. The researchers noted how accurately the application responded, how quickly the user and application responded, and then had participants complete a post-session questionnaire to evaluate their experience with the application.</p>

<p>Results of the study demonstrate that Holli is a viable tool for children with ASD. The application accurately detected and recognized 9 our of 10 user utterances in real time, and all users were able to complete the full 10-turn exchange. User response time varied due to differences in reading time, pointing out a potential flaw with the application. Additionally, more complex artificial intelligence is needed for more sophisticated conversation topics. However, participants expressed a strong affinity for the technology, describing it as easy to operate and enjoyable to use.</p>
 
<p>The positive reaction to Holli demonstrates that this technology might be a real breakthrough for those with ASD. Google Glass and Holli can provide the ability to practice social skills in a safe, controlled environment while reducing cost and other accessibility barriers. While previous ASD-assisting technology based on human-to-computer interactions has been criticized for being socially isolating, this study demonstrates that utilizing technology for human-to-human social coaching is possible.</p>
