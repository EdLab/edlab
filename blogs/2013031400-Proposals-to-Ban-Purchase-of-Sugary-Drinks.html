            One of Mayor Bloomberg's final policy move is the removal of 32-ounce sugary drinks. He claims it is easier for people to die from obesity rather than from starvation and further added that if someone wants a 32-ounce drink, they can buy two drinks.  Chicago's Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, has supported this decision, and hopes Bloomberg wins this case. Mayor Bloomberg feels that no one else is doing anything about this so that is why he is stepping up and making sure sugary drinks are no longer served in 32 ounce cups anymore.

I agree with what Mayor Bloomberg is trying to do, as I don't think anyone needs to drink that much soda in one serving. It is simply very unhealthy. Also, more people buy the bigger cups because fast food places make it seem like a better deal by making it cheap and offering more. Some people might not agree because they claim people are responsible for themselves and most know the pros and cons of buying a bigger drink. The problem is that most people don't pay attention to the cons at the moment, especially when they think of it as a saving money move.  This <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bloomberg-obesity-costs-bury-article-1.1287153">article</a> sheds further light on Mayor Bloomberg's plans regarding sugary drinks. Should larger cups be removed from restaurants, or should people be responsible for what they buy?
