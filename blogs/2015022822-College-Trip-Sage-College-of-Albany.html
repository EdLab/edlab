          <p>
            Sage College of Albany is a private institution located in upstate New York. It is a small school with a student-faculty ratio of 11:1. The school's location plays a major role in connecting students with internships in various fields of interest. I was welcomed by the soccer team on an overnight recruiting visit last week. My favorite part of the trip was the time I spent was sitting in an Intro to Law class. I had to remind myself multiple times that I wasn't in a high school class and that the learning style was a bit different. The teacher was referred to as "professor" and I experienced a college style lecture for the first time. By the end of the class, the professor had barely wrote on the board. He mostly interacted with the students about a court case they were assigned to read.

After class, I met the rest of the soccer team for lunch.  After lunch the team gave me a tour of the school. The first day ended with an indoor game at the school's practice facility. I had breakfast the next morning, met with the soccer coach to talk more about academic and athletic expectations, and exchanged contacts with my potential future teammates. It was amazing trip and learned a lot more in person than I did from the brochures.
