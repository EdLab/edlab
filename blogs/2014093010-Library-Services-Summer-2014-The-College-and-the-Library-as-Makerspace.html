The concept of libraries as makerspaces--sites where library users have the means to create with technology, in the broadest sense of the word that includes tools of all kinds as technology--is an exciting and challenging new development in our field, and one that we at Gottesman are striving to incorporate.  It's an idea that I'm still trying to wrap my mind around, but it occurred to me recently that for us at Teachers College, the origins and founding principles of the institution may provide some insights and leads on what the library's role should be.

It's instructive to remember, for example, the College's early incarnation as the Industrial Education Association, founded in 1884 "to teach boys and girls the industrial arts (including the manual arts and domestics arts) and to promote industrial education as a part of the public school curriculum."*

The Historical Photographs of Teachers College collection, viewable in its entirety in our online archive PocketKnowledge, includes abundant images of labs, shops, and classrooms where the precursors of maker culture were actively promoted and practiced at our institution.

A connection that's more difficult to make is between the work we do in public services and the kind of activity that's at the core of what makerspaces are about.  Though we unquestionably post news, analysis, and research support materials on this blog, and though our role as mediators and deliverers of information to the community is beyond dispute, the tools in the use of which we offer students training are strictly research resources, and the work we help students produce mainly intellectual work.

But this seems to me effort well worth making, and what's made as a result by students as real and crafted as if there were tangible products.  The following is a sampling of what students with whom we consulted during Summer 2014 were seeking:

or in library spaces, for a total of 62 students.</li>
</ul>
It will be interesting to see to what extent maker culture takes root in our library, and as a services person I find it intriguing to speculate about how core makerspace tenets might be incorporated in how we deliver assistance to the community, or, perhaps more importantly, how we help create a space in which our users do, make, and create--do research, make discoveries, create knowledge--on their own.
