Dr. Kathleen Houlihan is the CEO and Founder of <a href="https://www.dream2career.com/">Dream2Career</a>, a digital recruitment and marketing firm that promotes synergies between the workforce and education. She is a Forbes contributor and a member of the Forbes Coaches Council. Prior to opening her business in 2017, she was a full-time faculty member and aided students at six different higher education institutions in finding successful career pathways. She has served on elected committees and boards and worked at the executive level for most of her 15+ years in education.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Dream2Career?</b><br>
<p>I have a passion for helping students succeed. That is the common thread that has made me feel accomplished in life and in my career. This passion is the reason Dream2Career was established; to do more to help students find the best career pathways to success while recognizing that not every student needs a four-year degree.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from parents, students, and school administrators who have used Dream2Career?</b><br>
<p>Here are some of the responses from students I have worked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>"You are a passionate and caring advisor!"
<li>"She really knows what she is talking about through experience."
<li>"Communication during our meetings was exceptionalâ€“always insightful"
<li>"Dr. Houlihan, thank you so much, without your help I would have never landed my dream job!"
<li>"Thank you for listening to my ramblings and helping me figure things out. My future is finally in focus."
</ul>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Students will need to be life-long learners and they will need more opportunities to develop emotional intelligence. In the future, the curriculum will be developed to support industry needs and experiential learning will become prominent in the educational environment. </p>

<p><b>What are the future plans for Dream2Career?</b><br>
<p>Dream2Career, funded through business and industry, will help students find effective career pathways that lead to jobs they love, without the extra burden of tuition they cannot afford.</p>
