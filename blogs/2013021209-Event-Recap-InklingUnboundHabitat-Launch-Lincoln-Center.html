<b>Event Details:</b>
Last-night <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/2783">Laura Costello</a> and I ventured down to an <a href="https://www.inkling.com/">Inkling</a> "Unbound" launch event hosted at <a href="http://jazzatlincolncenter.org/">Jazz @ Lincoln Center</a>. From the first moment, the event was truly "edtech elegant" from the green-tied staff and card catalog drawers full of flowers to delicious hors de oevers hour paired with a rare book exhibit.  

Once the cocktail hour was over, we were ushered into the beautiful glass-walled event space that overlooks Columbus Circle and Central Park; truly a breathtaking view. The tables were again covered in white linen and flowers and arranged along tiered mezzanines. The event definitely felt more like a wedding or dinner theater than a launch, but this was an overwhelmingly positive aspect. Too often at tech-focused events you are crowded in uncomfortable folding chairs and there is not really a great place to prop your devices and the tables, which served only a decorative and not gustative purpose, proved most helpful (see why this was a double-edged benefit in "Takeaways" listed below).  

<b>The grand reveal...</b>
Matt MacInnis, CEO and founder of Inkling began his presentation with a visual history of the book's journey from print to digital... delivered in much the "Steve Jobs" school of presentation (minus the black turtle-neck - he wore a dress shirt and suit jacket). This led-into an exploration of the "evil empire" aka Amazon and other "walled gardens." This discussion was punctuated with images of Lego Darth Vadar mini-figures standing-in for Bezos<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos"></a>.  

Then came the grand unveiling of the "Unbound" commerce site and the "Habitat" platform for content creation and collaborative development.  Details on both were a bit murky. I assume more details were revealed at Inkling's <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013">Tools of Change 2013 conference</a> presentation.  In addition, Inkling brought onstage a luminary in the <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/">Open Educational Resources (OER)</a> world to share and stress the "Unbound"/OER connection and potential.

Check-out my <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/423">newly released NewLearningTimes.com article on TOC 2013 (you must create a free account to view)</a>, featuring an exclusive interview with Joe Wikert, General Manager and chair of TOC (Inkling is mentioned as one of the event's "Diamond" sponsors).  Also, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7277">read this review</a> by Laura from early last year on the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/411">EdLab</a> blog.

<b>Takeaways:</b>
<ul>
<li>Time will tell if Inkling's newest offerings are just another "walled garden"... with "cooler design."</li>
<li>Beautiful, well-planned events are always fun and impressive...Kudos to Inkling/Lincoln center event planners!</li>  
<li>If you don't want participants to Tweet or take images at an event... please make this explicit BEFORE the event starts.  "Emphatic" Tweets and emails from PR execs are never fun or tasteful at an event stressing "openness" and attempting to make a direct association to OPEN educational resources.</li>  
<li>Overall, I am excited to learn more and wish the Inkling team all the best as they attempt to take-over the world of publishing content search, creation and distribution!</li>
