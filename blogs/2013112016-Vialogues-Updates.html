          <p>
            This week's meeting on Vialogues was lead by Francisco and he did a great job. The major discussions that went on apart from the individual task we have done on Vialogues and on blogging were mainly on different paths we can follow to get more users on Vialogues. The discussion was surrounded mails on getting active users that will take part on commenting as while as creating videos. The ideas were personally talking to people, emailing professors and teachers, and the last one which I thought to be very interesting was a marketing approach which is sort of a project to promote Vialogues. This marketing approach is for people working above us to provide us a module to follow in getting active users or to provide us a list of emails and contacts to reach out to educators around the countries because they provide a bigger incentive to student to learn and Vialogues can be a tool for that. Another idea was taking it step ahead by meeting with educators and presenting them what Vialogues is all about.

Below is what we individually worked on during the week on Vialogues and Blogs. 

Reindorf changed his theme from language to stem. Stem is project that focuses on mathematics and engineering. He created two videos and his blogs were based on the videos. He has three new users and his approach is personally talking to people.

Ahmed central theme is on Economic development in developing countries. He created two videos which focused on economic growth and development in Southern Africa; his blogs were on educational reforms and his approach on getting new users is by talking to people who once signed for NLT to start using Vialogues since they do not know about Vialogues.

Bismark is working on videos related to Global Education and awareness. He created three videos and they were about the world bank providing fund to improve pre-school education in Armenia; his blogs are based on the same theme. Bismark's approach in getting new users is through emailing TC professors about Vialogues.

Bachir created five videos on Vialogues about Psychological effects of children in the urban youth. Bachir's blogs are related to his Vialogues and he plans on talking to people in his church to get new users. 

Elysee is working marketing; he created three videos and his blogs were related to his theme. He talked to professors and teachers about Vialogues.

Francisco is working on a theme about Criminal Justice and his videos were about plain view which is to help with situation of stop and frisk and racial profiling. Francisco blogs are related to his Vialogues. He has four new users through talking to professors.
