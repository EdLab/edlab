<p>Robots are seizing a place at the front of the classroom more and more frequently, and a new study examined how students viewed two different types of teaching robots. One was called <i>teacher as robot</i> and included a bot with a telepresence screen on which the teacher’s face appeared. The other was called <i>robot as teacher</i> and was a bonafide bot complete with a mouth and eyes made of cameras lenses. Despite the different physical characteristics, both bots taught the same pre-recorded lecture on business communication to a group of undergraduate students, and the audio from the teacher as robot was used for the robot as teacher.</p>
 
<p>The researchers were looking at three areas of student perception: teacher credibility, affective learning, and behavioral learning. They found that students perceived both the teacher as robot and robot as teacher as credible, but the teacher as robot was considered more credible. In addition, the students reported that they experience greater affective learning with the teacher as robot. In other words, the teacher as robot led to a more positive regard for the subject matter. Interestingly, however, the robot as teacher led to an increase in behavioral learning, as in, students were more likely to follow the behavioral suggestions given by the bot.</p>
 
<p>As robot use increases in the classroom, this study provides some insight into how students view bots in teaching roles. It demonstrates that telepresent teachers, like those who appear on a screen on a robot, garner more trust from their students and make the learning experience more enjoyable than regular bots. That said, regular bots seemed to have greater potential regarding behavioral learning. Although additional research in this area is needed before making generalizations across the board, these results provide insight into how students perceive the use of teaching bots in the classroom and could influence how future technologies are implemented.</p>
