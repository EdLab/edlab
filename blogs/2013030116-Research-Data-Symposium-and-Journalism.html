          <p>
            Because of my background in journalism, I was quite interested in the 2pm panel discussion at Wednesday's Research Data Symposium. (Thanks Sharon for posting that event!) I wanted to see the different ways journalism is using data, and what kinds of data they are analyzing, and how are they visually displaying this data. 

I am no expert on data analysis, but rather interested in data visualization. I always admired how newspapers and journalism outlets were able to create interesting graphs and timelines. For example, a few weeks ago, I saw a very powerful  data visualization of <a href="http://guns.periscopic.com">U.S. Gun Killings in 2010. </a> What I like about this graph is that you can hover over a line, and it shows you facts about each person who was killed. This project was actually provided by  <a href="http://www.periscopic.com/">Periscopic,</a>,  which is a “socially-conscious data visualization firm.” They have some awesome projects!

Mark Hansen, one of the panelists on the “Integrate and Analyze” panel, also discussed and showed a couple of examples.  <a href="http://nytlabs.com/projects/cascade.html ">Cascade</a>was developed by the New York Times Research and Development team to create a visualization of how people are sharing NYTimes Links on Twitter. He also talked about the  <a href="http://www.artnews.com/2012/10/16/ben-rubin-shakespeare-machine/">Shakespeare Machine, </a>  located at the Public Theater. It's a machine with 37 four-foot-long blades,  streaming  phrases from Shakespere's plays based on algorithms . Check out this <a href="http://www.artnews.com/2012/10/16/ben-rubin-shakespeare-machine/ ">article</a>  about it. Two different examples, but none-the-less, very interesting!

If you want to watch the panel, you can see it <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29607823">here</a>. 

Overall, I'm glad I dropped by to see the panel discussion. I have no experience in creating any of these data visualizations, but I'm excited to see what the EdLab team will come up with! When Sharon, Janice Daniel and Laura started talking about mapping out SiNY episodes, I became very excited about the possible interactive platform that Seen in New York could live on. ;) Looking forward to see ideas come to life!
