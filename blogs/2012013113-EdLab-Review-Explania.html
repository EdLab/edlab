<a href="http://www.explania.com/en">Explania</a> is a good place to find high-quality animations that will help to instruct and educate people about science, technology, sports, and health. These animations are either created by Explania or co-creators and cover a wide variety of fields including technology, health, sports, software and more.

<b>Pros:</b>
One of the unique features of Explania is that companies and organizations can sponsor an existing animation and offer the viewer additional information on their own website. Sponsoring an animation allows your company logo to be attached to the animation. Therefore, the company can advertise their services to their target audience through whoever was interested enough to watch the animation. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The pricing of Explania's services aren't listed but a quote has to be requested. Judging by the fact that the companies currently listed on the site are big corporate companies, the prices to make a custom animation or even sponsoring an animation has to be hefty. However, as a resource to those who want to just use the videos for educational purposes rather than advertising, all the videos are available for free after signing up.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Perhaps we can create animations or short videos that are informational and that features our bigger "Trends in Ed"s that have the potential to go viral. Not only will it spread the word about the news and trends of the education sector, but also expose EdLab and our brand along with it.
