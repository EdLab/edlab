            There are perceptions in some circles that religious practice and sporting activities cannot be reconciled. This question usually rears its head during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the period where all Muslims must fast from sunset to sundown every day for an entire month. For many observant Muslims who also play sports, especially professional athletes, Ramadan often poses a challenge in terms of finding the right balance between their religious and professional obligations. 

Although I am not a professional athlete, I played competitively in high school and currently do so in college. This <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/high-school/frederick-douglass-academy-boys-soccer-team-adjusts-accomodates-athletes-observing-ramadan-article-1.944577">article</a>highlights some of the challenges the coach and current players on my alma mater, Frederick Douglass Academy, boys varsity soccer team face during Ramadan. As the article highlights, some players who observe Ramadan practice despite the obvious risks. It's a difficult balancing act for any player and coach as a lot of things have to be taken into consideration, especially the player's health overall health. 

I chose to practice during Ramadan mainly because I love playing soccer. I believe most of it is more mental than physical. As soon as we start playing or doing drills, I completely forgot that I was fasting. My focus was solely on practicing and learning from the coach. As Ramadan continues to occur during the summer months (longer days), coaches in all sports must continue to find the right balance for their players.
