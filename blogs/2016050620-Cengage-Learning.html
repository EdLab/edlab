<p><i>"Cengage Learning believes that engagement is the foundation of learning…engagement is at our core and our focus is on engaging with learners, both in the classroom and beyond, to ensure the most effective product design, learning solutions and personalized services—all to help people learn. "</i> (<a href="http://www.cengage.com/us/">Cengage Learning</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Achievement and Student Engagement</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cengage.com/us/">Cengage’s</a> name is a conglomeration of <i>center</i> and <i>engage</i>, and like many other educational organizations and companies, its creation of a hybrid word serves to reflect its core mission in the education field. Cengage targets college students and faculty, librarians, business people, and K–12 educators and provides resources to foster student engagement in learning.</p>

<p>The organization also includes digital course support services and custom learning materials on their website. Higher education professionals who need help developing online courses can access in-person and online training resources, searchable by discipline.</p>

<p><b>Partnerships and Resources</b></p>
 
<p>Another branch of Cengage is Gale, which partners with libraries and businesses to provide both digital and print resources to supplement already existing archives. Academic and public libraries can receive access to databases like <i>Gale Artemis</i>, a digital humanities archive.</p>
 
<p>And for educators, Cengage has partnered with National Geographic to provide teachers in every grade and subject area with eBooks, apps, professional development, and research. The two organizations offer options such as on-site and webinar workshops on implementing the Next Generation Science Standards or using data-driven instruction.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Cengage casts a wide net in trying to provide services for different educational stakeholders. The challenge that comes with a scope that broad is getting stakeholders to understand the niche that the organization fills. </i>Engaging students</i> is a lofty goal, and though most educational professionals would likely agree that it is an important one, it may be hard for them to see how to integrate Cengage’s services, and how those services can directly benefit them.</p>
