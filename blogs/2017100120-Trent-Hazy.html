Trent Hazy is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.mindsumo.com/challenges">MindSumo</a>, a platform that helps college students develop problem-solving, communications, and creative thinking skills by allowing them to solve real-world corporate challenges. Hazy has helped launch over 1,000 student projects from the world's largest businesses, including Unilever, Walmart, Microsoft, Mercedes Benz, and Capital One. A graduate of Stanford in Product Design, he previously worked on the strategic design team at Ford and on mobile applications at Virgin America.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at MindSumo?</b><br>
<p>In 2006 I took an engineering class where we designed a handheld presenter device for Logitech. This was the first time that my theoretical skills were applied to something real. This experience opened my eyes to what work was out there and what I was good at. Not many students get to see their theoretical knowledge applied to a practical, real-world problem during their academic experience. My goal in starting MindSumo was to give students exposure to corporate projects so they could have the same "a-ha!" moment I did. Nothing is more powerful in helping you find your passion than hands-on experiences.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at MindSumo will change how college studentsâ€™ approach their learning and professional goals?</b><br>
<p>Throughout my teenage years and into my first few years of college, I planned on becoming an automotive designer. I even did an internship at Ford and made serious steps in this direction. Unexpectedly, by taking these actions, I learned this career path was not actually a good fit for me. Students today mostly make decisions about employment based on the company's brand, for example: Is it well known? Are my friends talking about it? Is it competitive? My goal with MindSumo is to give every student a taste of what it's like to work at a company. With that small taste, hopefully students will have a more holistic perspective of a profession, industry, or company, and then make a better informed decision about what they want to learn in school and what they want to do in their career.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Google's Eric Schmidt believes that data analytics is the most important skill for the up and coming generation. I agree with him and I think we'll see a lot more statistics and data classes across all disciplines. Employers often tell us that the students who are most prepared for working life are those who use data to understand the world and then make educated decisions based on their analysis.</p>

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to MindSumo?</b><br>
<p>I am actually pursuing my MBA at Stanford starting this fall. I expect this entrepreneurial program will foster business and leadership skills, which will enable me to make a bigger impact on the world in the years to come. It's going to be a challenge balancing my work at MindSumo with the full-time MBA, but I have a great team that will be supporting me.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>One of the smartest and most interesting people out there is <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc">Patrick Collison</a>, CEO of Stripe.</p>
