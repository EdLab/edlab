As <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6676">Megha reported in April</a> Grockit first launched in Beta form as a Q&A platform for YouTube videos.  The newest <a href="https://grockit.com/">Grockit</a> incarnation however, is focused on interactive, online test prep for grades ranging from secondary to grad school and beyond.  Utilizing game dynamics like badges & leveling-up, along with group & solo study sessions and interactive online tutors, Grockit seeks to be the ultimate online hub for test prep.

<b>Pros:</b>
Grockit seems to have something for every learning style, from video-based or written tutorials to chat-room style "group study" sessions, classic Q&A-based test content delivery and a friendly, easy-to-use interface.  As you move through a free-trial of the platform, one simple, easy to overlook feature that stood-out is the ability to input the actual date of the exam you are preparing for so that Grockit can generate auto-reminders to send you.  This simple step, overlooked by other groups, seems extremely valuable as you prepare for an impending exam.  Also, beneficial is the clean, uncluttered test content delivery format.  It is easy to focus-in on the content and questions being delivered when there is a clean UI and pared-down options for response (the classic banner "tools" & navigation bar even shrinks).  Once you exit test prep mode, are engaged in a solo or group study or are on the dashboard/home page, there are more shiny, colorful buttons and fun design elements to interact with, but when you are in test mode the delivery is all business, while not playful, this is a very effective way to present online test content.  

<b>Cons:</b>
Again, the price.  Why does online test prep have to be almost as expensive as my gym membership?  I know it depends what city your gym is in, but still!  I do like that Grockit offer a scholarship fund called <a href="https://grockit.com/gre/subscriptions/new">Grockit for Good</a> and automatically donates a membership to an under-resourced student (great idea to take a cue from <a href="http://www.toms.com/">Toms shoes</a>).  Beyond the cost, I found the group chat-enabled test prep to be slow and cumbersom, instead of responsive & adaptive.  This feature which allows you to answer test prep questions and then wait for all the others in the chat to answer to move-on to the next, sounds good in theory, allowing you to potentially ask each other for help etc., but the reality is that you feel stuck in an anonymous chat room waiting for strangers to finish a problem you just answered.  Perhaps, this is inherently the problem of an in-person classroom that online tries to solve.  However, here it is just replicating this problem without a clear solution.  

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we develop, interactive online content and course delivery platforms it is important to remember that the simple, seemingly insignificant details like a reminder option for timing your preparation or a clean UI/UX for question delivery, can have a huge impact on the end user.  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
It is tempting to add game dynamics and fun, playful UI/UX design elements, thinking that more is more.  However, Grockit is a great example of the fine balance between the importance of inviting design elements paired with simple, clean user interface for content delivery.  This dance is hard to pull-off, but Grockit provides a great example and framework for this successful balance.
