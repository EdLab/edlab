          <p>
            For People who are not familiar with Fluensee, it's a language translation application which extracts text from images taken using iPhone into other languages such as French and German.

Fluensee was developed last year by Jo, Faisal, me,  Shuchi and Hui Soo. We are waiting for the iPhone license to formally launch it and also improve the OCR engine to give more a accurate extraction for images, which are a little blurrish or taken at an angle. Till now we were not able to get the Apple developer license, although Hui Soo tried his best to get us one. It seems Apple takes time in issuing licenses if one needs to do business with them protecting their right of development.

In the meantime, another company called <a href="http://www.pictranslator.com/">Pictranslator</a> launched their language translation app claiming they are the first ones to do it, which is entirely wrong. 
On top of this, Google decided to launch it's language translation app too as a part of their Google Apps.

We have recently tried to improve our OCR engine by using the ABBYY mobile OCR, which we found to outperform our earlier open source OCR. When we contacted them for the developer license, they told us that they too are now developing language translation applications for iPhone and would not be able to give us the developer license. 

I don't know what's in store for Fluensee now, is it a chance which was missed because of better OCR or developer license? Could there be a way where one can register or protect the idea?
