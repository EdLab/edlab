Mike Feerick is the CEO and founder of <a href="https://alison.com/">Alison</a>, one of the world’s largest free learning platforms. It has over 11 million registered learners and 1.5 million graduates from its one thousand free courses across every country. Feerick is an internationally recognized social entrepreneur who received a Diploma Award from UNESCO for innovation in education (2010), an Ashoka Fellowship (2011), and a Guinness Social Fund Award (2012). In 2013, Alison was a WISE Award winner (Qatar Foundation). He was a World Economic Forum social entrepreneur of the year finalist in 2016.</p> 

Feerick is a popular global speaker on the future of workplace learning and has been featured across international media including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, and <i>The Economist</i>. Feerick founded and chairs <a href="http://www.irelandxo.com/">Ireland Reaching Out</a>, a non-profit Irish diaspora initiative with the goal of reunifying the 70 million people of Irish descent worldwide. He holds degrees from the University of Limerick (BBS, 1989) and Harvard University (MBA, 1994).</p> 

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Alison?</b><br>
<p>My experience in philanthropy has had a defining impact on my work at Alison. It taught me that charity and philanthropy alone could not make education available to all anytime soon. What we needed was a new business model that could make money by providing education and skills training for free online–and that’s what we sought to create when we began developing the Alison model in late 2005, finally launching our new free learning service in April 2007. My experience in the UK music industry in the early 1990s, which was completely changed by the online distribution of music, convinced me that the education industry could be transformed by the internet as well. In terms of educational impact, I was lucky enough to complete an MBA at Harvard in the early 1990s, and the experience there made me ever more comfortable with the idea that once a viable model was found, I’d have the skillset to make the dream a reality.</p> 

<p><b>What has been the response from those who have used Alison?</b><br>
<p>We are now close to having 12 million learners, and well over 1.5 million graduates spread across every country worldwide. So, without a doubt, the response has been hugely positive. Yet, at Alison, we are certain we are only scratching the surface of what is possible in terms of providing free education to the world. Sometimes, the very best idea isn't one that grows centrally, but many ideas and systems coming together in stages. We think we have something like that with Alison. We are planning long term and our ambitions for where Alison might be in the years to come is exceptionally ambitious. The prize is pretty awesome though, as with free education we are literally empowering millions. Over the past year, we have focused on developing a highly scalable platform, front-end and back-end, that will allow us grow exponentially in the years ahead.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p><b>(i) Informal Certification</b>: Today, certification is too slow, limited, and too expensive. At Alison, if you pass a course, you can be tested on it anywhere and anytime to verify to anyone that you still retain the knowledge and skills you once had. Because of the ubiquity of the internet and smartphones, it’s easy to test people at a moment’s notice and at next to no cost. This puts certified learning on any subject within anyone’s reach. We have to find ways to make learning accessible to everyone. People should be able to study anything anywhere for free, and we at Alison are slowly making that happen using a new free learning ecology encompassing free informal certification.</p>

<p><b>(ii) Free Publishing</b>: Throughout the history of civilization, there have been many more learners than teachers, but with free high-quality publishing tools such as those available on Alison, anyone who is a subject matter expert (and can pass some prescribed courses!) can become a publisher. Even though Wikipedia is a phenomenal resource, I am still disappointed by how much information is not made available for free on the web in a primary learning format. The reason is commercial; publishers who know stuff are unwilling to publish what they know for lack of an economic advantage. I see Alison,  and indeed other players, changing that.</p>

<p><b>(iii) Corporate Certification</b>: Corporations can now create courses and certifications as rapidly as traditional universities and colleges. Every organization is going to create certifications around their own products and services because they can, and it makes commercial sense to do so.</p>

<p><b>In addition to Alison, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>Alison is rolling out a network of Alison Learning Centres across Africa right now. Essentially, we are trying to make high-quality education and skills training opportunities more accessible in less-developed parts of the world. We are having very great success in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, but there is still a huge need for solutions like Alison in that part of the world.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I do have a Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeFeerick">@MikeFeerick</a>, and you can see who I follow. Don’t follow many people in the learning space though!</p>
