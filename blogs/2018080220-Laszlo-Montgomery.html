<p><a href="https://teacup.media/">Laszlo Montgomery</a> is the founder of Teacup Media and host of the <a href="https://teacup.media/category/shows/china-history/">China History Podcast</a>. His popular podcast explores a wide range of topics related to Chinese history, from ancient dynasties to American-style Chinese food. His channel also ran three seasons of the <a href="https://teacup.media/category/shows/chinese-sayings/">Chinese Sayings</a> podcast, which provided the historical roots and contexts for various Chinese idioms and phrases. Listeners from across the world tune in to his shows to learn about China.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your
current work?</b><br> <p>While I was a student at the University of Illinois, Deng Xiaoping visited the U.S. and relations between our two countries were normalized. This was in early 1979. I began my Chinese language studies that summer. I picked up and moved to Hong Kong in 1989, and after nine years there working for two consumer product manufacturers, I moved back to the U.S. and continued working with Chinese manufacturers to place "Made in China" products in the U.S. mass market.</p>  

<p>An interest in China since my earliest days along with a natural writing ability was what led me to podcasting in 2010. After more than two decades in sales, all I did was combine my China passions and smarts, writing ability, and salesmanship to cobble together the whole China History Podcast program. I’m just a salesman for Chinese history. </p>
 
<p><b>Why is it important for people to learn about China?</b><br> <p>Being informed is the root of understanding. And understanding between peoples of different nations is the root of friendly relations. I truly believe that. It’s no good for society if people choose to wallow in their prejudices and preconceptions about other countries and cultures. This is especially true in a multicultural, diverse society like the U.S.</p> 

<p>The original altruistic intent of the China History Podcast was to inform my fellow Americans about Chinese history with the hopes that it would lead to better understanding of China and ultimately friendlier relations. As it turned out though, less than half of my listenership is in the United States.</p> 

<p><b>Why do you think podcasts have become such a popular medium? What are some of its advantages over other forms of media?</b><br>
<p>Podcasting is a perfect medium for my message. It’s harder than most people think to effectively combine learning and entertainment. Podcasts are the ultimate antidote for long commutes, kicking back, working out, or walking. It’s an enjoyable and entirely passive way to learn, consume infotainment, and enjoy self-cultivation.</p>
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br> <p>I just finished a six-part series on the <a href="https://teacup.media/2018/03/20/chp-197-the-history-of-china-vietnam-relations-part-1/">History of China-Vietnam Relations</a>. I had no idea how much history there was between these two next-door neighbors. And Vietnam history, for Americans at least, tends to only start at the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. The feedback has been amazing. I guess there are a lot of people interested to learn more about Vietnam than just the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter or other social media?</b><br> <p>I don’t use Twitter and Facebook that much, but I do follow news about China and about U.S.-China relations in particular.</p>
<p>I have religiously followed <a href="https://sinocism.com/">Bill Bishop</a> since I first learned who he was. He’s really the only one I pay attention to on a daily basis. <a href="https://www.jeremiahjenne.com/">Jeremiah Jenne</a>,  too. And <a href="https://supchina.com/author/kaiserkuo/">Kaiser Kuo</a>, someone who always has something insightful and meaningful to say about China. Former <i>HuffPost</i> Beijing correspondent <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/matt-sheehan">Matt Sheehan</a> is part of the next generation of insightful China experts and always has interesting things to write about.</p>
