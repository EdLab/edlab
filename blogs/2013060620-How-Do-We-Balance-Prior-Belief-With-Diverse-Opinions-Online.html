<p><b>Title:</b> Why Individuals Seek Diverse Opinions (or Why They Don’t) (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Jisun An, Daniele Quercia, & Jon Crowcroft</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> 
<a href="http://www.websci13.org/deadlines/">2013 CM Web Science conference proceedings </a></p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
One of the aims of education is to enable students to synthesize diverse opinions and draw their own conclusions from existing evidence. It is a common belief that exposing people to balanced information can shift opinions toward more neutral arguments, but from the existing literature it appears that when faced with diverse opinions, information seekers with strong feelings tend to polarize. <a href="http://profzero.org/publications/websci13_why.pdf">Why Individuals Seek Diverse Opinions (or Why They Don’t)</a> studied why people pursue or avoid diverse opinions in news media outlets. The authors used a combination of online surveys, in-depth structured interviews, and a quantitative analysis of 320 million tweets. They coded the survey results and built a reasoning framework to associate the individual’s value of opinion diversity with prior beliefs, emotional state, & social context.</p> 

<p>The survey portion of the study targeted social media users age 18-49 in Europe and South Korea; most were college graduates or had education beyond college and all were regular internet users who read an average of 17.46 news articles each day. Participants reported that they had been exposed to diverse opinions online without consciously seeking them, and 43% claimed that they actively sought diversity online. The rest of the participants reported that they either read to support for their own views or actively sought to avoid challenges. The authors estimated the political diversity of media mentions in the participants’ tweets by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Shannon_index">Shannon diversity index</a>. The twitter dataset revealed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law distribution</a>; 81% of users received a low diversity score, while a few users were very diverse. The authors calculated an emotion score to gauge the sentiment of the tweets and associate political diversity with emotion.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results showed that popularity and attachment to particular issues affected participants’ desire to seek diversity. Weak beliefs or uncertainty about an issue caused readers to seek variety, especially if they cared deeply about the issue. Popularity was also a factor in determining whether participants became attached to an issue. Users were more likely to cite diverse opinions if an issue was repeatedly mentioned by more than one of their online contacts, though participants were likely to have contacts that shared their beliefs. The authors also found that users who employed more emotional words in their tweets tended to seek diverse opinions. Overall, not every individual valued opinion diversity equally and many sought out diversity only under particular circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Online tools that aim to bring unconnected individuals together for discussion or suggest diverse readings for users seem destined to fail in light of this study. Most users reported that they did not actively seek diverse opinions and even if they did encounter them, the experience was not necessarily meaningful. However, it seems there is a strong connection between learning and seeking diversity. When participants held weak beliefs about an issue they seemed to seek a variety of opinions in forming their own. After they held strong beliefs about a topic, they tended to seek support in reading and were unlikely to change their beliefs. In teaching and suggesting readings, strategies to try might include giving users curated content, fresh topics, and incentives for considering different opinions.</p>
