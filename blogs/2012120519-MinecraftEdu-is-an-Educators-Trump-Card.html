Latching onto the mammoth popularity of the game that has been likened to virtual Legos, Joel Levin, a computer teacher in NYC, instantly saw the relevance of Minecraft to education. Working with the game’s publisher, Mojang, Joel created the spin-off known as MinecraftEdu. This version, made specifically for use in schools, grants teachers access to customizable maps and powerful building tools that let students experience ancient worlds, chemistry, English, and other subjects. <p>

MinecraftEdu is not without its critics. As with any other classroom activity done on the computer, there is the danger of distraction. Also, some students find the 1991-style graphics off-putting. However, the magic of Minecraft, as players will tell you, is not about the graphics, but the compelling gameplay. <p>

Part of the charm of Minecraft is that its audience is hard to define: high schoolers, college kids, professionals, and even children seem to enjoy losing themselves in the 16-bit world. For many, Minecraft has proven to be a creative escape, where they can spend hours building their dream world out of 3D cubes. In fact, within a short time, uninitiated players soon realize that the actual focus of the game is not on accomplishment, like so many games before it, but on exploration.  Minecraft is the ultimate strategy game where players learn resourcefulness is the key to survival-- a lesson that teachers all over the world seek to instill in their students. <p>

Have you been swept up in Minecraft mania? If not, what would it take to sway you? Can you see the educational merits of the game, or are you left wondering what all the fuss is about?

<b>@00:00 TomsBlake:</b> I think that this idea of Minecraft in school is great. Minecraft unlocks creativity for people and allows them to use their minds. With the application for teachers, it would allow people to do various projects, builds, and it could give educational insight on ancient buildings and structures. This would be a smart thing for a school to get because of its educational purposes and creativity level. <p>

<b>@00:00 Chagen:</b> I believe that video games could teach us things, if they were designed to do so. The Minecraft teaching looks terrible, and I don't think anyone would learn anything. The effects of using Minecraft would be anti-social skills. <p>

<b>@00:00 bradygottsch:</b> At first when i started watching this video I did not think i was going to like it. But after watching the whole thing i think its a great idea
