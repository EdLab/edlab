<p><a href="https://magnuskingdom.com">Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess</a> teaches young children ages five and up the basic rules and gameplay of chess. The app feels like a chronological video game where players defeat opponents, collect items, and face battles, all while learning about the pieces of chess and how they move. The game is one in a <a href="https://magnuscarlsen.com">series of apps based on Magnus Carlsen</a>, a young, contemporary chess grandmaster, and was created in collaboration with DragonBox. The app costs $7.99 on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnus-kingdom-of-chess/id1348301017?mt=8">app store</a>.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess does a fantastic job of mixing gameplay with education. Players start by moving a king piece, animated as an oval-shaped creature, across a checkerboard landscape one square at a time, just as in chess. Throughout the landscape are collectable items and coins, passageways to different settings, and chess opponents. These enemies are simple at first, a pawn or two of the opposing color, and players learn how to attack on a small scale before engaging in greater challenges. An animated Magnus occasionally appears on the board, cheering you on.</p>
 
<p>As you move through different settings, you collect additional pieces and learn their movement and attacks. Maybe there’s a key you can only get by moving diagonally: you learn to use your bishop. Maybe moving in an L shape will defeat one opponent: you learn to use your knight. Along the way, there are bigger battles you happen upon. Maybe at one point it is six opponent pawns against your four pawns and king. Maybe another time it is four opponent pawns and two rooks against your four pawns, two rooks, and a king. The combinations vary each time, but because they start small and gradually grow, players can really learn to master each piece’s movements and attacks as well as overall strategy.</p>
 
<p>Finally, the gameplay is engaging enough to keep children interested in several components. Not only are they learning about chess, they are also completing easier tasks such as collecting coins and finding new outfits. This helps ease the cognitive load between battles and contributes to the game’s narrative. To help spell out specific chess rules, there are cards scattered over the landscape that players collect along with the other items. Each clearly explains how a piece moves and attacks or describes a specific strategy.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>One of my concerns while playing this game was whether children would be able to recognize regular chess pieces outside of the app. This is because the animated versions, depicted as fun creatures, naturally aren’t direct representations of real-life pieces. It might be helpful to have cards players can collect that depict the shapes of actual pieces.</p>

<p>In addition, it would be beneficial to have a two-player option where kids can use the app to challenge their friends or family members in real time. It’s educational for children to apply these skills to real gameplay, and creating that option in the app itself would further enrich the experience.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Magnus’ Kingdom of Chess provides a fun and effective way for young children to learn how to play chess. Its gameplay is engaging and challenging enough to keep kids entertained, yet the lessons and scaffolded chess strategies will also ensure they learn the basics of the game, and beyond. I highly recommend this app to young children as a fun and educational screen time option.</p>

<p><i>Update: Magnus Kingdom now has an updated feature that addresses my first concern. Players can choose whether they would like character representations or actual chess pieces on the board, and they can switch between the two at any time.</i></p>
