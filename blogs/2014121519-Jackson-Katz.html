<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
I have been an activist-scholar-journalist since my days as an undergraduate in the late 1970s-early 1980s.  I knew when I graduated from college that I wanted to do social change work, especially around the issue of preventing men’s violence against women by helping to shift social norms in male culture—across class, race and ethnicity—about what it means to be a strong man. I went to graduate school initially because I wanted a masters degree as a minimum educational credential in order to advance my gender violence prevention and media literacy work on and off college campuses. Eventually I went back to school in my forties to get a Ph.D. for much the same reason.  Throughout my post-college life I have been an autodidact. Graduate school gave me focus and access to brilliant people whose work I incorporated into my vision.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I am one of the architects of the "bystander" approach to gender violence prevention. I developed this approach along with my colleagues in the Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) program that I started in 1993 at Northeastern University’s Center for the Study of Sport in Society. Today the bystander approach—sometimes called "bystander intervention"—is the mainstream of the field.  The White House’s "It’s On Us" campaign is based on this concept.
<p>
I hope the increased attention to sexual violence on college campuses leads to a greater focus on the need for gender studies at all levels of the educational system. In the MVP model for gender violence prevention our philosophy and methods emphasize the central role that gender norms and their intersection with issues of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation play in the perpetration of sexual violence and relationship abuse – and in their prevention.  
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I hope to see a dramatically increased focus on media literacy education.  We live in a media-drenched culture in which media is the great pedagogical force. The idea that we can be educating young people for democratic citizenship in the twenty-first century without integrating critical media literacy is naïve at best and dangerously irresponsible at worst. 
<p>
In my and my colleagues’ gender violence prevention work we build media literacy into the process from the beginning, as the social norms that underlie abusive behaviors are often accentuated if not produced in and by media.  One form of media whose influence is crucial to study and understand is pornography.  And of course social media is also key, both in the way it disseminates information and in the way it redefines peer cultures and social norms.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
I am finishing a big web site for my gender violence prevention organization <a href="http://bit.ly/1F9qmRN">MVP Strategies</a>. And I am working on a book about the socialization of boys into men in a culture of violence.  
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I have a Twitter account but don’t follow anyone closely.  My Twitter following is more driven by current events and topics.
