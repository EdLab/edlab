            In the research, learning, design process and the employment of the organizations we create, questions are important. They both frame the scale and scope of an investigation and project, as well as, the answers to them establish the beginning criteria for success. Here are some of my questions from when we started designing the upCREATION Experience a few months back:

How do you “design” a life in an emergent, complex world? How can a personal life, work life, family life, social life, and planetary life be achieved without conflict and compromise? How can a complex, rapidly changing global society “escape” to a higher order, achieve a paradigm shift without chaos and collapse? What are the likely scientific/technological advances over the next 20 years? What is the likely mix of Disaster scenarios and positive options we will face in 2030? What world are we, collectively, actually designing for today with our education/political/economic systems and philosophies? What will a “normal” Human be in 2050? What is the state of our global technology, economics, ecology, politics and the system: Humanity on Planet Earth and Near Space? What is our heritage of the last 10,000 years? What is the scale scope, range and character of our possible futures? And... How is each of us a fractal and cause of many possible futures; which is yours? How is your mind/brain a network architecture which mirrors reality and reality it? How do you use it as a creation tool? How is GroupGenius a merging of networks? How can traditional organizations be transformed into Future Ready enterprises?

Each of these questions have many design assumptions embedded in the question itself. They also rest on many trends and research outcomes which are well documented. Many of us will live to see the answer to these questions. Our children and grand children certainly will. Thinking about the future is not about tomorrow, it is about determining what we do today––personally, and as a society.
