            <a href="http://www.aftercollege.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/Screenshot2012-04-27at52426PM.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

<a href="http://www.aftercollege.com/">AfterCollege</a> is a site modeled around the analog alumni networks maintained by colleges and universities to usher their graduates into the working world. Offering job boards, associations, and resources, the site intends to be a one stop for the recent college grad. AfterCollege is extremely old for a startup. Developed first in 1996 by students at Stanford it spread and grew with the internet, sopping up campuses, resources, and design awards through the aughts. 

<b>Pros:</b>
AfterCollege may be 16-years old, but a recent site redesign keeps it from looking that way. It has a number of interesting partnerships with sites like Salary.com, Mint, and BookRenter. Their interest indicator in the sign-up process seems to suggest an aggressive and constant push for new job content. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The resources offered for job seeking and financial management are fairly robust and far-reaching but don't include many sources outside of their partner sites and proprietary content. I'd like to see more links to outside sites and a larger selection of tools &mdash; some of the content seems a little outdated. I'd also like to see more innovation in the presentation of resume materials; sites like InternSushi seem to gravitate naturally towards multimedia and online content integration.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
AfterCollege operates on the same idea as Ednode, but excludes the human elements of networking in favor of a direct payout. The site is impressive in terms of job and network listings and that's something recent college graduates will always want, but it could do a bit more envelope-pushing in the job application area. Because employers seek the site for the freshness of entry-level candidates, it would be easy to shift conventions like static cover letters and analog-looking resumes. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
AfterCollege is a solid site that tends to the safe.
