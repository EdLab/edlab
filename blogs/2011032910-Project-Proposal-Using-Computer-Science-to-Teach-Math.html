As Conrad Wolfram points out, we spend way too much time teaching students how to learn how to calculate math through various tricks and procedures without ever allowing students to engage with the logic and reasoning that underlies them. Wolfram really appears to be onto something when he states that math is a four-step process: 1.) Posing the Right Question, 2.) Formulating from the real world to a mathematical expression, 3.) Computation, and 4.) Determining whether the mathematical conclusion is verified or verifies what occurs in the real world. Already math begins to look more interesting than what is often taught in schools (primarily 2 and 3). 

Another key point in this TEDTalk is on the value of programming. As someone who has very limited programming skills, I always wish I had more time in high school to take a computer science class. For me at least, computer science serves as a way of formalizing mathematical algorithms and procedures. There has been a trend in math education to require students to describe process. The don't-just-tell-me-the-answer-tell-me-how-you-got-there attitude has made its way into everything from state-level standardized tests to the Advanced Placement Exams. I have no problem with this attitude but it strikes me that if English were the best way to describe mathematics, this would be more prevalent than actually so in the professional world. Yet it is computer science that often serves as the framework for accomplishing quantitative processes in the real world. 

But here is perhaps the biggest and most practical benefit to using compsci to teach math, something Wolfram surprisingly did not mention: it's easily verifiable. 100 students explaining how they solved a quadratic equation requires a lot of effort from the grader. Checking whether 100 programs work requires nearly no effort from the grader. The efficiency gains from this seem here for the taking.

So where to from here: well I would suggest developing some basic application that would be able to have the necessary computing abilities that would allow a student to demonstrate his or her knowledge of a mathematical concept, nothing too difficult though. I was thinking of starting with something within the Khan Academy videos since those run the gamut from basic addition up to ordinary differential equations and could provide some structure. One big constraint is the ability for students to learn basic programming. A student obviously needs to know a little bit about syntax and semantics in order to program a mathematical algorithm, but there do exist very basic pseudo-programming-languages such as those used in your typical TI graphing calculator that are relatively easy to learn and give the necessary flexibility for an educational setting. 

I would love to get some feedback on both the merit of this idea as well as how this idea could be executed in practice.
