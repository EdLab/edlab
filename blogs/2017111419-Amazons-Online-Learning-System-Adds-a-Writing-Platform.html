<p>Started by Amazon, <a href="https://www.tenmarks.com">TenMarks</a> is a learning management system for teachers of grades K–8. While TenMarks started with only math curriculum in 2009, it added a writing platform in the summer of 2017.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>First of all, TenMarks provides considerable support to teachers using the platform. When they create an account, teachers are able to access a wealth of lessons, assignment suggestions, preformed quizzes, assessment tools, and creative activities for their class. When teachers choose various assignments, quizzes, or activities, students will receive notices on their personal accounts and can complete them via the same system, making assignment collecting and grading a breeze. Also, public school teachers need not worry: all lessons and rubrics are Common Core aligned.</p>
 
<p>TenMarks also offers some creative and fun activities that other learning systems do not. One example is the burst activity on the writing platform. Bursts require students to make comments on images, answer short prompts, or write text exchanges between various characters in a funny situation. For instance, one burst encourages students to write a text dialogue between two dinosaurs planning a birthday party. These provide teachers with a ready-set warm up exercise to get their students thinking and writing creatively, and it also compels students with a fun foray into a task they might normally dread.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While TenMarks math is available for all grades K–8, TenMarks writing is currently only available for grades 4–8. This means that teachers hoping to improve and track younger students’ writing will have to search elsewhere. Also, while the platform’s pricing is comparable to other systems, it will likely be out of the price range of many school districts, especially if schools want both math and writing platforms. Prices range from $4 per student for the basic level of one subject to $16 per student for the premium level of both subjects.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>TenMarks has proven itself as an effective online learning platform for math, and its recent writing addition is sure to be a success as well. Students will have fun with the creative writing exercises it provides, and teachers will be able to keep track of individual students’ writing and classroom trends with ease.</p>
