<p><a href="https://educlipper.net">EduClipper</a> is a learning platform that personalizes educational experiences with clip-sharing amongst the learning community. This application was created by Adam Bellow, a former high school teacher who intended to foster easier exchange in the education community between teachers and students. <ahref="https://educlipper.net">EduClipper</a>, as described most popularly, is the educational clip to Pinterest’s pin.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The platform at first glance is simple, clean, and friendly. Students can create clips to feature pieces from their learning experiences and then organize and collect clips in the Board and Portfolio features. Teachers can flip through a portfolio of a student’s work, and provide feedback directly into the app. EduClipper gives students and teachers the power to incorporate photos, videos, and links onto their personalized boards in comprehensive folders. With the flexible nature of manipulating the app, creative freedom is enabled, mimicking a key feature in most successful education interfaces. Teachers and students can tag-team assignments, giving both parties access to interact and exchange commentary on work. One of the coolest features is the EasyBib tool that automatically creates links to content as soon as they are uploaded onto the board.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Like other classroom management apps, EduClipper has usernames for students and teachers that help educators avoid student-to-teacher texting. The app’s mission is to create incredible portfolios for the learning community, and while the platform seems to be geared toward students, it is not necessarily the kind of interface that is inviting to higher grade levels. EduClipper doesn’t seem highly differentiated from Pinterest and I wonder if elementary aged students would really find this application preferable to this other popular app.</p>
 
<p>EduClipper may take some getting used to. In the digital world that bombards users with easier and more engaging platforms every day, some teachers or students could get impatient with fruitless searches, and jump over to safer and more familiar platforms to farm content. If children are going to use this feature to store their learning experience, what makes this platform so much different than a Google search and a social media platform to host it? </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>EduClipper is like an educational version of Pinterest. With EasyBib and a user-friendly interface, teachers and students can utilize this app in informative and fun ways to engage mixed media and school assignments. This application can be a fun venture into teacher-to-student engagement, but it lacks must-have features to make it indispensable. As a result, many users may just go back to what they were using before after a short period of experimentation.</p>
