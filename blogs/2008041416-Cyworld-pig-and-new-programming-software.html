          <p>
            There are so many socializing websites nowadays that I have never heard of, but are apparently making loads of money (e.g. <a href="bebo.com">Bebo</a>). 

Hui Soo also introduced me to another website called <a href="http://us.cyworld.com">Cyworld</a>. For those of you who have never heard of Cyworld, it's unbelievable. One of the main "selling" point of this website is a mini-room at the center of each user's page. Each user is given 30 free Acorns (Cyworld currency) that he/she can use to buy things (background theme, furniture, animals...etc) to decorate their mini-room. For my account, I bought a pig for 4 Acorns, but it doesn't even move or wag its tail. It's just...there...in my mini room...its presence alone cost 4 Acorns. While I can not refund my pig, I can refill my Acorns. How? 10 Acorns = 1 USD. Yes, people are actually buying these Acorns all around the world so they can put stuff in their mini-room on their personal page. It's a serious business, the website reports <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7098992.stm"> 10 million USD of trade per month </a>in the year of 2006. 

While I wonder about the demographics of the people who actually pay real dollars to get virtual Acorns, yet another product designed to make life easier for the people with the strongest purchasing power (aka. parents) is launching. <a href="kidzui.com">
Kidzui</a> is a new software for parents to control their kids' online activity. The software is actually an Internet browser, but it only connects to websites that have been approved safe for children. So far, more than 500,000 pages have been reviewed and deemed safe. The product website claims they are adding new pages everyday, hence, you will have to pay a monthly service fee.

Finally, after all the reviews of stuff that are created to haunt your wallet, I found out last week about the Entertainment Technology Center in Carnegie Mellon. One of the star project of the center is <a href="http://www.alice.org/">
Alice</a>, a free software that are supposed to make programming as easy as "drag and drop". Have anyone used it before???
