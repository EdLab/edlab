<p><i>"The Games for Change Festival is the leading international event uniting game creators with those who believe in the power of digital games."</i> (<a href="http://festival.gamesforchange.org">About Games for Change Festival</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Games for Social Change</b></p>

<p>The 14th annual <a href="http://festival.gamesforchange.org">Games for Change Festival</a> brings together video game designers, researchers, social innovators, educators, and gamers with a mission: to showcase the transformative power of digital games. The festival features over 100 different speakers in the field of impact games. These are not regular video games you find in any entertainment store, but rather games that engage contemporary social issues in a meaningful way in order to create social change. The festival will award honors in four categories: Best Gameplay, Most Innovative, Most Significant Impact, and Best Learning Game. Each category has <a href="http://festival.gamesforchange.org/festival/festival-awards">three nominees</a>.</p>

<p><b>Topics of Discussion</b></p>
 
<p>This year, the festival events will be separated according to three different topics: Neurogaming and Health, Civics and Social Impact, and Games for Learning Summit. Each topic has a series of panels, talks, and workshops to educate visitors on emerging sectors in gaming. In addition to the three main areas of interest, the Games for Change Festival will also have a VR for Change Summit for the first time ever, which will feature how virtual technologies and games create social change. Some of the sessions among these four topics include "How to Use Comic Book and Augmented Reality to Challenge Sexual Violence," "How Gaming is Bringing Education to Children in Conflict Zones," and "What do "Fake News" and Video Games Have in Common?".</p>

<p><b>What Players Will Learn</b></p>
 
<p>The Games for Change Festival hopes to show visitors the power of video games to educate, foster humanistic skills, develop self-confidence, and change our society for the better. Some of the games involve immersive narratives that take players through difficult life experiences. One such game is called That Dragon Cancer VR, which is a game that chronicles two parents’ experience watching their young son fight cancer. Another is Living Life as an Eggplant, which discusses gay body images and dissatisfactions by having players objectify their own body appearance to meet the game’s arbitrary beauty standards.</p>

<p>Regardless of the topic a game focuses on, one thing is sure: the creators hope it will be a vehicle for social good and lasting impact. The event will take place at the Parsons School of Design from July 31–August 2.</p>
