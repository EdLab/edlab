<p><i>"We solve the challenge of personalized reading practice for students, teachers, and principals." </i> (<a href="http://www.moxiereader.com/">MoxieReader</a>). </p>
 
<p><b>Tracking Student Reading</b></p>

<p>Hoping to eliminate the wasted time and paper associated with handwritten reading logs, the creators of <a href="http://www.moxiereader.com/">MoxieReader</a> built a platform for classroom teachers to access and organize information on what their students are reading, at what rate, and with what frequency. Through an intuitive interface, students scan the ISBN of the books they are reading, enter reading time and page numbers, and MoxieReader keeps track of reading history, progress, and stats to help both students and teachers track reading habits.</p>

<p><b>A Personalized Reading Guide</b></p>

<p>Beyond tracking student reading, MoxieReader also functions as a guide by suggesting books based on interest and reading level pulled from its expansive database. Students can scan ISBNs of books to learn more about them, and can also see what their classmates are reading, which might encourage them to read something they otherwise wouldnâ€™t consider. Encouraging breadth as well as volume of reading, the more a student uses MoxieReader, the more accurate it will be in its book recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Building Reading Motivation</b></p>

<p>Perhaps the most valuable thing about MoxieReader is that it uses digital intelligence to motivate learners. The ability to track individual progress and know how far users are from proficiency at a certain level could challenge them to read more. By helping students find the right books, it also improves the chances that its users will enjoy reading. Instead of relying on dreaded quizzes as assessments, discussion and classroom community are encouraged through peer-team-based reading challenges and games. This, too, encourages students to enjoy reading rather than be intimidated by it.</p>
