            The big idea in Leonard Waks' <a href="http://site.ebrary.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/lib/teacherscollege/detail.action?docID=10739185"><i>Education 2.0</i></a> (available as ProQuest ebook) is that what he calls the <i>learningweb revolution</i> is not merely about new learning technologies that can make education more efficient, more transparent, more widely available, etc. It is about a shift in paradigm, from a hierarchical, industrial model of education, to an open, collaborative, post-industrial one. In other words, what he calls <i>Education 2.0</i> is about a different conceptual metaphor structuring the activities of learning. 

The idea of conceptual metaphors was first introduced by linguist George Lakoff and philosopher Mark Johnson in their influential 1980 work <a href="http://teach.iii.com/record=b1435228"><i> Metaphors we live by</i></a> (EDUCAT P106 .L235 c.2). According to Lakoff and Johnson, conceptual metaphors structure our activities, including our thinking. Here is a color example from their book; I quote at length: 

"To give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such a concept to structure an everyday activity, let us start with the concept ARGUMENT and the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety of expressions:

ARGUMENT IS WAR

Your claims are <i>indefensible</i>.

He <i>attacked</i> every weak point in my argument.

His criticisms were right on <i>target</i>.

I <i>demolished</i> his argument.

I've never <i>won</i> an argument with him.

you disagree? Okay, <i>shoot!</i>

If you use that <i>strategy</i>, he'll <i>wipe you out</i>.

He <i>shot down</i> all of my arguments.

It is important to see that we don't just talk about arguments in terms of war. We can actually win or lose arguments. We see the person we are arguing with as an opponent. We attack his positions and we defend our own. We gain and lose ground. We plan and use strategies. If we find a position indefensible, we can abandon it and take a new line of attack. Many of the things we do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war. Though there is no physical battle, there is a verbal battle, and the structure of an argument--attack, defense, counter-attack, etc.---reflects this. It is in this sense that the ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor is one that we live by in this culture; its structures the actions we perform in arguing. Try to imagine a culture where arguments are not viewed in terms of war, where no one wins or loses, where there is no sense of attacking or defending, gaining or losing ground. Imagine a culture where an argument is viewed as a dance, the participants are seen as performers, and the goal is to perform in a balanced and aesthetically pleasing way. In such a culture, people would view arguments differently, experience them differently, carry them out differently, and talk about them differently. But we would probably not view them as arguing at all: they would simply be doing something different. It would seem strange even to call what they were doing "arguing." In perhaps the most neutral way of describing this difference between their culture and ours would be to say that we have a discourse form structured in terms of battle and they have one structured in terms of dance. This is an example of what it means for a metaphorical concept, namely, ARGUMENT IS WAR, to structure (at least in part) what we do and how we understand what we are doing when we argue. <i>The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another</i>. It is not that arguments are a subspecies of war. Arguments and wars are different kinds of things--verbal discourse and armed conflict--and the actions performed are different kinds of actions. But ARGUMENT is partially structured, understood, performed, and talked about in terms of WAR. The concept is metaphorically structured, the activity is metaphorically structured, and, consequently, the language is metaphorically structured."

Waks argues that the potential for new learning technologies and the learningweb revolution to effect fundamental change in education depends on the extent to which we succeed in replacing the old metaphor of EDUCATION IS FACTORY WORK with the new metaphor EDUCATION IS NETWORKED COLLABORATION. These are not Waks' terms, but I think he would be happy with them.
