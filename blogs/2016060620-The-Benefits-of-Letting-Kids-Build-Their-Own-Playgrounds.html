<p>"Without play, life is unlivable." So says a young child in this Vialogue. Yet in NYC, lack of space often prohibits kids from enjoying themselves freely outside. Adventure Playground hopes to change that by offering a space for kids to create, explore, destroy, and take charge of their play on their own terms without the interference of adults. Adventure Playground is usually housed in a large, grassy area full of all the supplies kids need to create: cardboard, tape, wooden planks, tools, markers, paint, and string. The people who created Adventure Playground find that when children are given this freedom to make their own play creations, imagination and a sense of adventure take over. </p>

<p>Of course, the playground is not totally adult-free, but the grown ups in the space act more as lifeguards than as teachers. If kids need help with a project, the playguards are there to offer guidance and extra hands. Although NYC has only housed temporary Adventure Playgrounds so far, the staff hopes to soon establish a permanent location on Governor’s Island that’s free and open to the public.</p>

<p>"Play is children making sense of the world," says one member of the staff. Do you agree with this statement? How else might the Adventure Playground help children grow? What are some possible negative elements of this design? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/28841/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:58 dinosossi2:</b> I think the provision and use of multiple types of media is really important in play. Just because I see a ball as means to engage in play doesn't mean you do too. Limited media types constrain and push back against the unboundedness inherent to the truest ideals of play.</p>

<p><b>@02:27 idrissa10:</b> Some advantages could be that it helps enhance students creativity and perception of the world. As one of the students said @00:13, Adventure Playground could help students become "free."</p>
