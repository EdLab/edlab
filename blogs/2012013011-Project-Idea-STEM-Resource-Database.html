            **PLEASE KEEP THIS PRIVATE**

I would like to introduce what will hopefully be the first of many STEM related project proposals to everyone here, and I'm hoping for some of that good old fashioned EdLab feedback.

What I would like to do is create a large database of different types of resources (e.g. images, videos, games, simulation apps, etc.), that are related to the topics of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. All of these resources would be organized by different categories such as:

1) Type of media
2) General subject- Specific Subject
3) Appropriate Grade Level
4) Rating Level

These are just some of the ways we can organize this type of database. The purpose of this database is so that it would be used by teachers, student-teachers, or any type of educator who would need help looking for an engaging and educational resource to use in their STEM classrooms. 

Not only would we have a large database of STEM resources that is well organized, but we can have a review for each resource, that would be similar to our New Learning Times Edlab Review category. Much like the Edlab reviews we will have a description of the resource, and the pros and cons, but we can also have these additional sections:
1) How the resource can be integrated in the classroom 
2) Whether is resource is for learning the theory, applying the knowledge, or both 
3) If the resource has real-life examples (this would be for resources that enables students to apply their knowledge)

We can add more sections but this list is just an example of how we can give a resource a detailed review so that educators can decide whether they would use the resource or not, and if so how to integrate it in their curriculum. With each review we can have a Rating Level that would be one of the search criteria. We can do the usual 5-star rating but I think we can come up with something more original and intuitive.

I was thinking that the database would be accessible through a website that would be similar to Pundit, where educators would type in what they resource they need and get a list of resources that matches their needs. Although before that, we would need to have a huge database first which will be easy to do but a lot of work. So what does everyone think about this idea? Would it be useful for teachers, and is this something that can help the Edlab become an authority for STEM resources as well?
