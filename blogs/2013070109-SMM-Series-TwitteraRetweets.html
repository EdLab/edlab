          <p>
            As Brian and I discussed at the EdLab Development & Research meeting last week, not only is it important to have engaging content on your social media page, it's essential that there is a good amount of activity from your followers.  This is why today's post in the SMM Series will be about how to get more people to retweet your tweets.  

Here is one of the articles I have included in my mSCHOOL course on <a href="http://www.reviewzntips.com/get-more-retweets/">ways to get people to read and retweet your content</a>.

For our social media accounts specifically, I think we have to work on gaining more activity from our followers. This means that for Facebook, we need more likes/comments/shares; and for Twitter, we need more people to retweet our tweets. What I find most important in this article is the fact that you need to interact with your followers before you can expect them to interact with you. Another point I am especially looking at is #7: Prove you are not a Robot, which also goes along with #10: Engage with who Retweets you. Brian and I are currently working on creating a new "template" for our NLT tweets. I think if all of our tweets are too similar, it gets boring and is easy to skip through while scrolling down a news feed. And lastly, it is part of social media etiquette to thank people for retweeting your content (there will be more on this etiquette in my SMM Series post tomorrow).  

Hope you learned a few things from this post for our different Twitter accounts as well as your personal ones!
