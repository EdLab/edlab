Due to a recent collection and facilities expansion, The James Branch Cabell Library at Virginia Commonwealth University found itself in need of a room reservation system that mirrored its commitment to accessibility and fairness. While they considered analog room sign-ups, they eventually decided to adopt the OpenRoom, an open source room-booking software developed at Ball State University. The group behind OpenRoom developed the system in 2010 for similar reasons and the system is currently used in 4 institutions including Ball State and VCU. Both VCU and Ball state felt that current ILS-based and commercial booking software failed to produce successful patron-driven room booking systems.

VCU was extremely happy with the room booking system and logged over 16,000 reservations in the first semester of use. A simple marketing plan involving flyers, signage, and ad space on the library website transitioned into a survey period. The data collected during the initial survey was used to initiate the development of a mobile service based on student feedback. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
One of the features VCU implemented in its OpenRoom system is a check-in that forfeits any reservation unconfirmed in the first 15-minutes. We voted this idea down in the planning stages of Roomer because it seemed unnecessarily complicated. A feature we might consider for Roomer 2.0 is an honor system based check-in. A system like this would enable poaching by unaffiliated users but might free up problematic no-shows and further benefit Roomer's target, the here/now participant. 

The other question raised by these articles is whether we might open a successful system to other institutions. Commercial booking systems are still as Ball State found them in 2009; they've largely failed to develop successful mobile systems and generally look pretty dismal.
