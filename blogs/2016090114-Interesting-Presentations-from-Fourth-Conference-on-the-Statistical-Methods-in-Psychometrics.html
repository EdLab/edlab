          <p>
            Yesterday and this morning, I attended the Fourth Conference on the Statistical Methods in Psychometrics. Columbia Statistics department hosted and organized the conference. Even though the conference only lasted a day and half, it packed a lot of useful information. I really enjoyed and learned from the presentations. 

The majority of the presenters were from academia. Well known researchers like <a href="http://stats.lse.ac.uk/moustaki/">Irini Moustaki</a>,  <a href="http://www.psychology.illinois.edu/people/hhchang"> Hua-hua Chang</a>, <a href = "https://sites.ualberta.ca/~mgierl/"> Mark Gierl</a>, and <a href="http://web.edu.hku.hk/staff/academic/j.delatorre">Jimmy de la Torre</a> presented their current researches on various technical topics. Professor Moustaki's research is mainly concerned with developing new procedure and statistics for assessing model fit from pair-wise likelihood estimation. Professor Chang explored the possibility of integrating cognitive diagnosis models into internet based learning. Professor Gierl shared his recent discovery and thoughts on the topic of automatic test item generation. Professor de la Torre presented his preliminary results from his multi-year NSF funded research on developing framework and methods of constructing educaitonal measurement instrument based on Cognitive Diagnosis Models. 

Two experts from industry also presented their work. Alina von Davier - Senior Research Director and founding director of the Computational Psychometrics Center in ETS shared her group's work on developing new platforms and models to assess collaborative skills of students. They recruited thousands of participants from Amazon turks to collaboratively solve problems on their newly developed prototype platform. Instead of analyzing the outcome data like the traditional educational assessment does, they are more interested in analyzing the process data to assess the collaboration skills of the participants.

Yan Karklin - Knewton's principal data scientist presented their work on evaluating different approaches on estimating student's proficiency in an online adaptive learning environment. Specifically, they compared the prediction performance of recurrent neural network (RNN) which is relatively new and a more traditional approach - Bayesian extension of item response theory. The results are somewhat surprising. The RNN performed worse (slightly) than the traditional approach. Their results suggest that the Bayesian Hierarchical IRT models provide better performance in their applications.

The research topics presented are diverse and mostly technical in nature. But there are some common motivations. Traditionally, educational assessment is more interested in scaling students. Now, I feel the trend is shifting towards developing assessment framework to better facilitate learning. 

The presentations are all 40-mins long sessions. I like this format. Speakers had ample time to interact with the audience. Particularly, we can raise questions and discuss with the speakers as the presentations going on. The traditional presentations at other conferences are usually short 15-20 mins sessions. I often feel I don't actually remember what I was going to ask at the end of the presentation. The 40-45 mins long sessions are perfect for this purpose.
