            <b>Inspiring science students through robot submarines, telepresence, and Internet2</b>
Ocean explorer, Robert Ballard (famous for discovering the Titannic wreck in 1985), is no stranger to taking students on <a href=”http://www.jason.org/public/home.aspx “>live virtual sea expeditions</a>. As he announced on Feb. 6, his newest endeavor has him embarking in the territory of “telepresence” technology, which will allow him to keep “unmanned robot submarines on the ocean floor 24-7.” These remote-controlled subs will be equipped with cameras and a live feed will constantly be available at the University of Rhode Island's Archeological Oceanography command center.  Similar command centers across the country will be linked together via <a href=”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet2 “>Internet2</a> (not to be confused with Web 2.0). Ballard contends that it is the availability of fiber optics that makes the remote experience feel so real.  Read more about technology that goes over my head <a href=”http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/top-news/index.cfm?i=57190”>here</a>.

<b>When Imagining the Audience in their Underwear Doesn't Cut it Anymore</b>
Got a speaking gig coming up?  If you're anything like me, it's not the actual speaking that's stressful, but more so that daunting Q&A round. It's a perfect excuse for people who disagreed with your points to engage in aggressive banter with you (do I sound bitter?) or, at the very least, point out a few discrepancies (maybe even some highlights!). Calm those anxieties by heading over to <a href=”http://www.speakerrate.com/”>SpeakerRate</a>.  This site allows you to upload your speech and have it rated (on a scale of 0 to 5) by the community. The community members may also provide constructive feedback.  Who knows, you may turn out to be a rockstar of the presentation world (groupies are not provided by SpeakerRate).

<b>iPhone App-a-Day</b>
This one's more of a report than a feature: Japanese newspapers have foreseen the future of paper-based newspapers and decided to proactively counter what may be the end of newsprint.  Three major Japanese newspapers–Nikkei, Asahi, and Yomiuri–have previously collaborated to launch a website, http://allatanys.jp/ (pronounced ‘a-ra-ta-ni-su', meaning “to make something new”), that consolidate the stories of each paper in one place.  The iPhone app offers similar capabilities, where users can read and compare each paper's cover stories, editorials, and pictures and consequently can gather each paper's different media policies and political opinions.  So far, though, the app only offers abstracts of the articles, forcing users to visit the corresponding paper's site to get the full text.
