Kids learning through video games is not a new phenomenon; educators have been exploring ways to integrate video games into their teaching for some time. However, kids writing their own video games is an arguably less common learning approach that is gaining popularity among kids and teachers. What do kids learn from writing their own video games? How can video game design and production be linked to academic learning? What are some challenges? Are there any similarities between authoring video games and traditional kid-friendly activities, like playing baseball? <p>

In this video, ten-year-old Rhys shares his game design experiences and helps answer the above questions. Thanks to the rapid advancement of technologies and new media, kids today have easy access to powerful game design programs such as <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/947">Gamestar Mechanic </a> and
<a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/868">Scratch</a>. As producers of videos games, they have new channels to express themselves and new forms to release their creativity. Furthermore, the authentic audience from online game design communities helps learners improve their design skills through feedback loops and motivates them to continue working on their projects. <p>

What do you think about young people producing video games? Join us <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10469"> on Vialogues </a> to discuss its implications for the future of education. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@0:56 Brian.Sweeting: </b> "When it has a good story, it comes through to the player, just like you're reading a storybook."<p>
 
<b>@3:23 johnlee:</b> Authentic audience can liberate instructors from the role as the only grader on all students assignments and students get better feedback from the learning communities. Seems to me a win-win scenario. How can we create authentic audience for various kinds of assignments in schools?<p>

<b>@4:04 johnlee:</b> It is amazing that Rhys has developed such a mature attitude toward those non-constructive comments (such as "this game is awful")! I believe his eagerness to seek constructive and specific feedback from both online and offline communities will help him create/play great (baseball) games! <p>
