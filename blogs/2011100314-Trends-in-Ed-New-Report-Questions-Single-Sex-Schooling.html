          <p>
            A new <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/education/23single.html">report</a> set to be published in Science magazine claims that single sex education is “ineffective, misguided and may actually increase gender stereotyping.” The study, “The Pseudoscience of Single Sex Schooling” was conducted by the founders of the American Council for CoEducational Schooling and argues against what is becoming an increased trend towards single sex public schools in the country. There were only two public single sex schools in the nation during the mid-1990s but there are currently over 500 such schools in over 40 states.

One of the chief arguments in the report dismiss the notion that single sex schooling actually results in better academic outcomes and it also restricts the ability of boys and girls to work together while reinforcing gender stereotypes. It is worth noting the authors of the report are all psychologists and neuroscientists with extensive research on gender roles. The report comes at a time when there is ongoing debate in education circles about the academic outcomes of single sex schooling. There is even a pending case involving the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and single sex classes at a school in Louisiana.

The report also asks the US Department of Education to cancel a recent regulation in which “single-sex classes may be permitted as long as they are voluntary, students have a substantially equal coeducational option and the school reasonably believes separation will produce better academic outcomes.”  A spokesman for the department, in keeping with policy, said they will look at the report but held off on any immediate action as a result of the report.
