            For-profit colleges have been receiving a lot of bad press lately mainly due to the high debts their students take on to enroll, and the lack of employment opportunities for those students upon graduation. There have even been congressional hearings on the many dilemmas currently facing for profit colleges. All the uncertainty about the future of “for-profit” education is not deterring new for-profit K-12 schools from springing up all over the country, especially in the New York City.

Hailed by the NY Times as the “practically the only significant primary and secondary institutions to have started up in the last decade, and may represent the future of private-school growth,” most for-profit K-12 schools are now seeking accreditation to add a legitimacy to their institutions. What's the difference between regular private schools and for-profit K-12 schools? According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/nyregion/22private.html?_r=1&ref=education">this article in the NY Times</a>:

<blockquote>Nonprofit schools enjoy generous tax advantages, including low-cost benefit packages, property-tax exemptions and grant eligibility. They also must bridge the gap between tuition revenue and the expense of running the institution with donations, no surprise to parents who face frequent solicitations for pricey galas and the ever-needy annual fund. For-profit schools pay taxes but generally refrain from soliciting parents, instead securing money from investors who hope to make money later, if the school is sold or the company that owns it goes public.</blockquote>

Since financial corporations (the term applies to for-profit schools) are not obligated to disclose any of their financial information, there is no way to measure if for-profit schools actually make a huge profit though there seems to be a market for-profit schools, especially in New York City. However, new for-profit schools face stiff competition from already established private schools in New York City. The newbies are quick to note they have more flexibility in experimenting and/or implementing new teaching methods than already established private schools, where change is often met some skepticism from parents and teachers. They also usually try to offer something new or unique from other private schools, namely a scenic location, teachers spending more time in the classroom, and a rigorous and diversified curriculum, among others.
