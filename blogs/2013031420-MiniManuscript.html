<p><a href="http://www.minimanuscript.com/">MiniManuscript</a> is a crowdsourced, editable database of research article summaries. The site was inspired by its founders’ frustrations at the individualistic nature of academia and their dream for greater collaboration among researchers. A bit unsurprisingly, the founders are two Ph.D. candidates who discovered they were often duplicating research and wanted a way to share their work. The summaries are billed as a discovery tool, like movie trailers, not a replacement for reading the full article. The site was primarily initially funded by awards including the <a href="http://www.shell-livewire.org/alumni/grand-ideas-award-winners/2012-winners/2012-August/jake-fairnie/">Shell LiveWIRE Award</a> and is currently free to use.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Search on the site uses <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a>’s database to ensure that citations are correct and duplication is minimized. The summaries themselves are very structured with categories like participants, method, and results. The option to read the original article also links through PubMed. The enthusiastic founders are great <a href="http://www.minimanuscript.com/uploads/ckeditor/MiniManuscript_Biographies.pdf">video fans</a> and the option to create video summaries for articles has the potential to invoke new conversations around traditional research.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Like all crowd-centric sites, MiniManuscript will need to drum up robust community participation and the summaries might not be of universal quality. The site attempts to inspire participation with contests and incentives for summary writers. The homegrown aesthetic of the site is charming, like a well-loved library, but it could use a bit of UI smoothing. Their sign-up screen, in a lightbox, is particularly rigorous and the initial search confusingly includes all of PubMed’s database and makes it difficult to differentiate the articles that have summaries and those that do not.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Though MiniManuscript does not offer access to original articles it does contribute to the increasing openness of academic information and the movement from static published articles to an evolving and editable digital scholarship. The summaries could work as a jumping off point for researchers outside of academia, who may not have access to academic databases. The founders also <a href="http://www.minimanuscript.com/uploads/ckeditor/MiniManuscript_Fact_Sheet_Nov_20121.pdf">suggest</a> that summaries could be used to help non-native English speakers, who may have trouble with traditional keyword searching, find and evaluate research.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>MiniManuscript is bringing big research to the masses.</p>
