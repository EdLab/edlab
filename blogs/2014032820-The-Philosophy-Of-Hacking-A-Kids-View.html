"I want to be happy." That is 13-year-old Logan's answer for the question of "What do you want to be when you grow up?" Realizing that happiness is not taught and emphasized in most schools, Logan decided (with his parents’ support) to hack school and create his own education. In this TED video, Logan puts on his philosopher hat and talks about what it means for kids to be happy, what it means to learn, and why he has found that hacking is the answer. <p>

Logan has distilled the importance of education and life into three main points. Adults need to realize, Logan argues, that before asking students what they want to be when they grow up, students need to be happy, healthy and be allowed to play (hack). His mature analysis of the term "healthy" includes recognizing feeling safe in schools and being physically healthy. He also cites from his pal, Dr. Roger Walsch who has written on Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC). Dr. Walsch argues students need to learn how to make a life before they learn how to make a living. Logan takes up Walsch’s points and speaks lucidly about how and why students need to build their own education. He talks the viewer through an exciting range of experiences he has been involved in at school and the mentors he looks to for support. Logan demonstrates the value of the discerning view of the student in conversations about education. <p>

As a parent, teacher, or kid, have you ever thought about what you see as the important life questions? Do you agree with Logan that more kids should be in hack school? Share your thoughts <a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13165">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@4:46: Norsyl:</b> Good question - why aren't there more kids like Logan?.<p>

<b>@06:08 Sappho:</b>"I hack my education" as community-based, experience-based, personalized learning. Why is hacking something different or new than progressive, experience based learning? What would be synonyms for hacking?
