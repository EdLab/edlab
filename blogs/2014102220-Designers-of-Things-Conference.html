<p><i>"Designers of Things is a two-day conference and demo hall dedicated to the explosive and exciting potential of Wearable Tech, 3D Printing, and the Internet of Things, giving the growing design and development community around these three innovative technologies a meeting place to discuss and share insights about the road ahead, and view a large-scale showcase of the newest technologies and products."</i> (via <a href="http://www.designersofthings.com/sanfrancisco/">Designers of Things Conference</a> website)</p>

<p>The Designers of Things Conference is an event determined to create a place for sharing new ideas via live demos, networking parties, and skill acquisition sessions. Their events focus more on knowledge transfer than typical lengthy "sage on a stage" conference models. Their first event took place September 23-24, 2014 at the Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco.</p>

<p><b>A Thing-Based Philosophy</b><br>
Designers of Things aims to grow and inspire communities of design around wearables, 3D printing, and internet-of-things-based technologies. Through collaboration and events including demo halls, lectures and experimentation, the conference strengthens the ecosystem of design and technology with an eye towards innovation. The organizers believe in the importance of experiencing (read: playing with) new technology and matching the right VCs to those seeking funding for their exciting projects. Because of this unique environment, everyone from curious dilettantes to expert VC firms <a href=" http://www.designersofthings.com/sanfrancisco/about/#who-attends">turned out</a> for the first conference.</p>

<p>The two-day conference launch was held in San Francisco earlier this year and featured Gadi Amit as the keynote speaker. Amit is the founder of New Deal Design. In his talk <a href=" http://www.iotworld.com/author.asp?section_id=3150&doc_id=563554">he spoke of</a> how important it is for designers to humanize wearable tech. The idea of humanizing technology and crafting innovative applications for technology was a theme across the many presenters at the conference. According to Katie Stern, <a href=" http://news.ubm.com/index.php?s=2429&item=124785">General Manager of the conference</a>, "There couldn't be a better time to launch an event for the growing design and development community around these innovative technologies."</p>

<p><b>Designed by UBM:</b><br>
