<p>Online learning in higher education continues to grow annually, with <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2016-02-09/study-enrollment-in-online-learning-up-except-at-for-profits">25% of students</a> taking at least one online course in 2014. Nationally, the number of students taking online courses is <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2016-02-09/study-enrollment-in-online-learning-up-except-at-for-profits">almost 6 million</a>. Yet online learning still faces obstacles regarding student drop out and dissatisfaction rates. </p>
 
<p>As learner-learner interactions tend to improve student satisfaction in in-person classes, a recent study reviewed how learner-learner interactions affected online classes. The purpose of the study was to determine how learner-learner interactions in an online undergraduate course impacted student performance, satisfaction, and perceptions of online collaboration.</p>
 
<p>Researchers conducted this study with 77 undergraduate students enrolled in the same online class over the course of one semester. While the students all completed the same assignments, half did so individually, and the other half did so in small groups of three students each. After the semester ended, the researchers administered surveys to the students to measure their perceptions on learning, satisfaction, and feelings about online collaboration. In addition, the researchers also took note of students’ grades.</p>
 
<p>Based on student grades, the researchers found that academic performance was significantly higher in students who participated in groups rather than those who completed assignments individually. Interestingly, however, they found that there was no significant difference in satisfaction with the course between the groups and individuals. Finally, students who worked in groups had an improved opinion of online collaboration after taking the course.</p>
 
<p>These findings indicate that students who collaborated in an online course had higher levels of performance even though their overall satisfaction did not significantly improve. The latter point could be caused by a variety of reasons, including unfamiliarity with the learning platform or unequal responsibilities in group dynamics. Because of this, researchers recommend ensuring that students feel confident using the online platform and that there is a rubric for group tasks. If both performance and satisfaction improve, students are much more likely to stay enrolled in an online course rather than dropping it.</p>
