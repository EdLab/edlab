          <p>
            There is a growing trend of professors customizing their textbooks through several different online resources. Through websites like the startup <a href ="http://academicpub.sharedbook.com/academicpub/index.html"> AcademicPub</a>, and older websites such as <a href ="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">Flatworld Knowledge</a>, professors can pick and choose content from different textbooks and free resources online to combine them into one customized textbook that would be more affordable to students compared to buying traditional textbooks. When <a href ="http://chronicle.com/article/New-Digital-Tools-Let/129309/"> a professor from University of Tennessee at Knoxville</a> customized his textbook through the startup site AcademicPub, the cost for a digital copy of his customized textbook was $14.95, a paperback copy was $27, and finally a hardback copy was $45. The paperback and hardback copies can be mailed directly to students, or they can be available at their school bookstore. These prices are way cheaper than traditional textbooks! 

Traditional textbook companies, like McGraw-Hill, are also starting to give professors options to customize their textbooks and also customize printed textbooks as well. They can remove some chapters from a textbook if a professor feels that they are not needed. So while customizing textbooks has been around for a while, it seems to be becoming more mainstream as books in general are becoming more digital. This option to allow professors to <a href ="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021884/">“Frankenstein”</a> a textbook (combing content from other textbooks to form one textbook), will help students with the cost of textbooks since many professors currently require students to purchase several books for their class, costing students more money and putting them deeper into debt. Judging by the cost for a customized textbook from AcademicPub, this new trend of "Frankensteining" textbooks online will be a more affordable option for students who accumulate a lot of debt just from buying textbooks.
