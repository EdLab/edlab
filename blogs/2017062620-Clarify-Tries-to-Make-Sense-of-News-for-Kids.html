<p><a href="http://www.playbac.com/clarify">Clarify*</a> aims to help children make sense of the news. The app is video-based and geared toward children ages 10–14, but is also intended to be a tool for the whole family to use together. It is available on a subscription only basis for $4.99 a month.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Clarify* works exclusively within a medium that children are increasingly comfortable with: short videos. Every day, a new 2–minute video is published pertaining to a topic in current events. The videos are narrated over engaging animations, and each is produced by real journalists. To me, the best part of the video series is that it encourages family conversation around sticky topics. Each video ends with two open-ended questions that prompt parents and children to discuss the topic together after the video ends. Another positive feature is that families can share the app by creating different profiles and tracking what others have watched.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>While this app laudably tries to tackle big issues, some of the issues were much too big to be condensed into a two-minute video. In fact, trying to do so led to a lack of nuance that made the videos more inflammatory than informational. For instance, the video about why some people don’t believe in climate change seemed painted in strokes much too broad. This is not only misleading, but also harmful to the impressionable minds of children, especially considering the extreme polarity increasingly dividing people in this country.

<p>In addition, only videos from the last 14 days are saved on the app, meaning there is no ability to search for specific topics to watch. The app would be much more useful and interesting if that were a possibility.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While Clarify* might help start informative and profound conversations between parents and children, some of the videos seem more biased or inflammatory than news ideally should be. In addition, most of the topics seem too big to tackle in two minutes, which means families will likely have to research the topic more to help children understand the topic better.</p>
