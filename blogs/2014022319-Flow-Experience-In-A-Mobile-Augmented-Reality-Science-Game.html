<p><b>Title:</b> A Mixed Methods Assessment of Students' Flow Experiences During a Mobile Augmented Reality Science Game (2013)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> D.M. Bressler & A.M. Bodzin </p>

<p><b>Research Questions:</b>
Which features of flow emerged for middle school students while playing a mobile augmented reality (AR) science game? What influences do gender, interest in science, and gaming attitude have on middle school studentsâ€™ flow experiences while playing a mobile AR science game?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Flow is a positive psychological state in which people feel deeply involved in meaningful actions and feel challenged, yet intrinsically rewarded and enjoy themselves as they work on the tasks at hand. It is a theoretical concept to understand engagement level in activities within various disciplines such as science and art. Researchers in the field of education have applied this concept to understand students' learning and engagement in technology-mediated environments and identify flow experiences in these cases. As technology advances rapidly, the authors of this paper aim to explore whether and how flow experiences might emerge in one of the latest and most exciting education technologies -- mobile augmented reality (AR) science games.</p> 

<p>Sixty-eight middle school students in an urban area in Pennsylvania volunteered to participate in an enrichment learning activity to play one mobile AR game, <i>School Scene Investigators: The Case of the Stolen Score Sheets</i> (SSI). Divided into nineteen groups, students played this AR game that utilizes Quick Response (QR) codes around the school to facilitate the investigations of a forensic science mystery presented in the game narrative. Pre-surveys and post-surveys were administered to gather data about students' demographics, interest in science, gaming attitude, gameplay feedback, and flow experiences. Field observations and group focus interviews were conducted to document supporting evidence regarding to students' gameplay and experiences.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Participants described the gameplay experience as unique and unlike other typical school day activities. In addition, they enjoyed the adventurous activities and were eager to be challenged by the game. In other words, they felt "a flash of intensity, a sense of discovery, and the desire for higher performance," which are characteristic of the flow experience. Results from this study also indicated that neither gender nor interest in science were important predictors of students' flow experience in the game, but participants' gaming attitude was very useful in predicting students' level of engagement. Lastly, this mobile game helped students build better relationships and increase their interest in investigative science.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Many scholars and educators have advocated using games for education. Evidence from studies like this one supports the use of well-designed games that immerse learners in flow experiences and situate them in a challenging yet rewarding state of mind. Such conditions facilitate motivation and meaningful learning. Educators have a lot to learn from the design of these engaging games and could potentially apply design principles extracted from the games to the design of other classroom activities. Meanwhile, the increasing development and production of mobile games in this direction could be very helpful in creating immersive, challenging, and joyful learning experiences for all learners. </p>
