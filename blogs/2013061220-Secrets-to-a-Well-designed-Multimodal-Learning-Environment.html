<p><b>Title:</b> Interactive Multimodal Learning Environments <p>
<b>Authors:</b> Roxana Moreno & Richard Mayer 
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-007-9047-2 "> Educational Psychology Review </a> <p>
Research suggests that multimodal learning approaches enhance student understanding. Put simply, multimodal approaches use verbal and nonverbal modes to represent content. Two common examples are a lecture with video, or a book with images. The multimodal approach  adds a nice layer to the traditional talking-head lecture, or a book without images.   Add an interactive component to the mix and the potential for learning increases even more. In the context of our high tech and multimedia-centered world, instructional design that incorporates multimodal media has the potential to foster learning like never before.  The challenge, however, is designing a learning system that promotes active learning but doesn’t overwhelm the learner. In an effort to advance our knowledge of effective multimodal learning environments, the authors of <i> Interactive Multimodal Learning Environments </i> set out to develop a solid theoretical framework that can help guide educational designers using media to promote learning. 
<p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Upon reviewing the literature on <a href=" http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html "> cognitive-affective theory of learning </a> with media and <a href=" http://www.academia.edu/681000/Instructional_Design_Principles "> instructional design principles </a> for interactive multimodal learning environments, the authors found that guided activities, reflection, feedback, pacing and pre-training were key aspects to maximizing learning. Guided activity refers to an opportunity for the learner to interact with the person or tool facilitating their learning experience. Reflection signifies a concerted and intentional effort to think about one’s learning experience and actions. Providing quality feedback that aligns with the student’s prior knowledge and encompasses an explanatory component, as opposed to simple corrective feedback, is another key ingredient to the learning equation. Pacing refers to handing control over to the learner in terms of presentation of material. Pre-training simply means providing the learner with appropriate prior knowledge to augment the learning experience.
 <p>
The authors reviewed and conducted a number of studies aimed at testing the effectiveness of these design principles. Across studies, they compared a control group to a group of learners who were immersed in a learning setting that incorporated one of the aforementioned design principles. For example, in one of the studies, a group of learners had control over the pacing of visual representations in an interactive multimodal presentation. Their learning outcomes were compared to a group of learners who lacked such control.
<p>
Across the experimental studies, the results reaffirmed the positive impact of the five design principles. One nuanced exception was reflection. There was a significant difference in learning outcomes among students who reflected on their experiences while engaged in non-interactive learning activities versus those who did not. However, there was no noticeable difference between the two groups when engaging in interactive learning activities. A takeaway from this finding is that if instructors wish to encourage deeper learning with non-interactive activities, reflection may be a good method. However, interactive learning without a reflective component may be sufficient to ignite engaged learning.  <p>

<p>

<b>Moving Forward:</b> The practical implications of this study are that multimodal instructional environments are more likely to foster meaningful learning when they embrace the five design principles highlighted in this article. The authors of this study suggest future research on interactive web-based games in order to better understand how to incorporate instructional design principles into game learning. Other areas ripe with research possibilities include individualized digital tutoring programs and online libraries aimed at enhancing learning.
