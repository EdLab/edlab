<i>We argue that the advent of Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and broadband Internet create promising opportunities for developing new learning technologies but that a fundamental obstacle remains: the effectiveness of learning technologies is rarely known </i> (<a href=" http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/harnessing_technology_to_improve_k-12_education/">Hamilton Project</a>).

<p>
<b>What works for appliances might not work for Apps</b><p>
Two economists have set out on a mission to improve American education.  No, not <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/">these two economists</a>, but <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/aaron_chatterji/">Aaron Chatterji</a> from Duke University and <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/about_us/our_people/benjamin_f._jones/">Benjamin Jones</a> of Northwestern University.  The duo <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/harnessing_technology_to_improve_k-12_education/">have proposed</a> a rating system and establishment of a third-party organization called EDU STAR, to assess educational applications and technologies.  Going where <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm"><i>Consumer Reports</i></a> has dominated for decades, Chatterji and Jones have decided that their system will be able to successfully rate apps based on a set of criteria established, at least in part, by an initial group of in-school pilot tests.  Students and educators would be asked to help assess the effectiveness of technologies selected for these tests and rate them on the EDU STAR platform.  So far however, <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/THP_ChatterjiJones_EdTech_DiscPaper.pdf">the fledgling proposal</a>, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/">Brookings Institution</a> and their corresponding <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/">Hamilton Project</a>, has garnered mostly negative reviews.  Critics, ranging from <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">EdTech blogger Audrey Waters</a> to edtech news source <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/">EdSurge</a>, seem adamant that two economists are not the right experts needed to help solve the education crisis.  For example, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/economists-propose-edu-star">EdSurge claims</a> that the system will be too reductive, "Relying on an overly narrow ratings system invites decisions that will be as misguided as they are precise."  However, not everyone’s a critic. <a href=" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/hamilton-project-report-c_n_1917166.html">The Huffington Post’s Education section reported</a>, "The proposal aims to encourage innovation in the education sector — which has seen relatively little new technologies compared to other industries — and provide new methods to help students learn."
<p>
<b>Creating an EdTech Bridge to Nowhere</b><p>
Regardless of whether you feel EDU STAR, if developed, will succeed or fail, Chatterji and Jones state <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/harnessing_technology_to_improve_k-12_education/">in the initial abstract </a>for EDU STAR, "We argue that the advent of Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and broadband Internet create promising opportunities for developing new learning technologies..."  While the idea of combining the CCSS and broadband access sounds ideal on paper, there are a few fundamental issues.  One, accessibility.  While efforts are being made to improve access, broadband advocacy group, <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org/">Education Superhighway</a> currently estimates that over 80% of US schools do not have adequate bandwidth to support digital learning.  Finally, Chatterji, Jones and their critics seem to be missing the bigger issue, while rating applications is not necessarily inherently bad, the system that grants access and funding for these applications (schools) might not be ready to support their proper or intended use.  If our educational system is outdated and slow to change (which it is), no manner of rating system or assessment will be able to be truly transformative.  While I disagree with Waters and EdSurge, and support the potential of harnessing "market forces" to pressure educational technology creators to make better products, what I see as the bigger call to arms should be how to rate and revamp the actual system that we use to educate learners.
