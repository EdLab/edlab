<i>University of the People (UoP) is the world’s first tuition-free, non-profit, online academic institution dedicated to opening access to higher education globally for all qualified individuals, despite financial, geographic or societal constraints.</i>  (<a href=" http://www.uopeople.org/groups/tuition-free-education">UoP</a>).
 <p> <b>University Power to the People</b><br> Unlike the ever-popular MOOC, University of the People (UoP) is not massively open, but instead, is massively free*.  Combining popular elements of 21st century eLearning (peer-to-peer, online discussions and collaborative study groups) mixed with more traditional elements of Higher Education (admissions, sequential coursework and faculty), UoP provides a truly "hybrid" option for those seeking an alternative route to the college dream.  Founder <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=34307399&locale=en_US&trk=tyah2">Shai Reshef</a>, who was recently voted one of the <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/2012globalthinkers">100 "Top Global Thinkers" by Foreign Policy Magazine</a>, takes the early Latin origin of the word "University" (universitas = "the whole") quite literally and believes that it is through democratizing and opening access to higher education, that we can help support budding global thought leaders.  Reshef sums up his personal mission for UoP in <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/6521">this vialogue</a>, "Let's release our human potential!"  He goes on, in the same TEDx talk, to describe how through providing a truly tuition-free, credential-granting online university, UoP is able to offer a solution to the growing issues of expense, availability and access to higher education that prohibits much of the world from attending.  This ground-breaking program is made possible through donations, affiliations and partnerships with groups ranging from the <a href="http://www.youthaward.org/partners/un-gaid-0">UN’s GAID</a> to <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/informationsocietyproject.htm">Yale Law School ISP</a> and a collaboration with New York University for admissions and an internship program offered through <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/social-innovation/catalyst.html">HP’s Catalyst Initiative</a>.  In this way the program creates a robust online experience that marries forward-leaning eLearning with established admissions processes and real-world internship opportunities.   <p> <b>What does "Free" buy on today’s education market?</b> <br>A lot.  The program, which was established in 2009, has admitted more than 1,500 students from 135 countries to their associate & bachelor’s degree tracks in both <a href="http://www.uopeople.org/groups/programs/business_administration">Business Administration</a> and <a href="http://www.uopeople.org/groups/programs/computer_science">Computer Science</a>.   Requirements for admission include a high school diploma, computer access and English language skills (All classes are only taught in English.).  Beyond basic requirements for admission, learners, once admitted, interact with one another, volunteers and faculty through "collaborative learning" opportunities and Open Education Resources (OER).  These resources include wikis, discussion boards and free eTextbooks.  For example, the UoP site highlights this use of OER resources, "Within online study communities, students share resources, exchange ideas, discuss weekly topics, submit assignments and take exams." Learners are required to participate in these online forums and are graded on participation, while faculty use these opportunities to interact with small cohorts of students who move together sequentially through the program.  This collaborative eLearning model paired with real-world internship opportunities appears to satisfy almost all learners who engage with the program.  Through polling conducted by UoP 95% of students (polled consecutively each term) would recommend the online university to peers.  Despite learner satisfaction, the biggest question remains... will potential employers vote as favorably?  Is it enough to offer a "free" degree when a major barrier to workplace entry is competition from other job seekers who "bought" their degrees from traditional for-profit universities?  While the UoP is an important, valiant effort and promising direction, it is possible that despite UoP graduates’ hard work, their efforts might not equal much in today’s highly saturated and highly competitive job market.  
<p>  (<b>*Free:</b> "All that is asked is for students to pay a one-time application processing fee ($50) and subsequent modest examination processing fees ($100) levied per course."  Students who are unable to pay are provided a scholarship.)
