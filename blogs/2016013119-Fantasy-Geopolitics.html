<p>Fantasy sports have been thrust into the spotlight with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/sports/fanduel-draftkings-fantasy-employees-bet-rivals.html?_r=0">recent controversy</a> over the ethical practices of big fantasy companies. <a href="http://www.fantasygeopolitics.com/">Fantasy Geopolitics</a>, however, is neither under fire nor under investigation as a site for gambling and unregulated business practices. Even though it mirrors fantasy sports websites, Fantasy Geopolitics has a different goal—engaging students in world news and global politics.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Fantasy Geopolitics is a fantastic way to get students engaged with civic education and world news through gameplay. It collects data from the <i>New York TImes</i> and Google Ideas’ GDELT Project, which is the world’s largest open database, aggregating points from both in order to determine how many times each country is mentioned in global news reports. Each player’s dashboard has a news feed, which gives real-time updates of news accompanied by the flags for the countries mentioned within each article. The dashboard also has sections for top players, top countries in the previous week, activities of other players—such as their recent draft picks—and a public message board.</p>

<p>The interface for the dashboard and map is very clean, making it easy to navigate. The game is also available for play on desktops, tablets, and phones, making it easily accessible for students and classrooms with any type of device.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>As is often the case for online educational games and programs, Fantasy Geopolitics draws a portion of its income from premium memberships. Even though the basic package—one commissioner with up to five players—is free, it costs $99 a year for up to 100 players, and $198 a year for up to 250. If teachers are interested in using it for their social studies classes, the basic package will undoubtedly be insufficient to cater to their thirty-plus students per class. Also, students might not be motivated to win, which would prevent them from conducting the requisite research to do better in the draft. And finally, students may be so wrapped up in the numbers for each country that they might not engage in the actual news articles themselves, leading to a surface-level understanding of world news at best.</a>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Gamifying learning has taken the educational sphere by storm, and Fantasy Geopolitics is another easy-to-use, intuitive platform for playing a game that could supplement students’ learning both in and and out of the classroom. Although the game does not focus on most of the nuanced details of global news, it may also ultimately benefit from this, keeping gameplay simple enough to follow and entertaining enough to keep playing.</p>
