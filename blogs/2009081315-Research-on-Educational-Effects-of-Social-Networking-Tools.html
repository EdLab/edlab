            Some of my colleagues are currently trying out some <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3082" target="blank"> social networking platforms </a> for educational purposes. I found these articles providing empirical evidence and useful insights on how social networking software can be used for education.

Selwyn, N. (2007) <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/513958/Facebook-seminar-paper-Selwyn" target="blank">‘‘Screw Blackboard... do it on Facebook!': an investigation of students' educational use of Facebook' </a>

Based on an analysis of 68,169 wall postings (4% of these postings related closely to the academic/learning experience) of 612 undergraduate students during 5 months in a UK college, this paper reveal 5 themes of these education-related online interactions: i) recounting and reflecting on the university experience; ii) exchange of practical information; iii) exchange of academic information; iv) displays of supplication and/or disengagement; and v) “banter”. 

In discussion, Selwyn points out that students' postings are guided by “norms of disengagement, disorganisation and mild disgruntlement”, and in a sense Facebook as backstage space helps participants to shape and negotiate their identities as college students. 

The backstage nature of these virtual social interactions got me to wonder whether a social networking site launched by college can maintain similar momentum of student participation.

Greenhow, C. & Robelia, E. (2009). <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122530871/abstract" target="blank"> Old communication, new literacies: Social network sites as social learning resources. </a>

This qualitative study examined the role of a social network site, MySpace, in the lives of 11 high school teenagers from low-income families in the U.S. As to the effects of social learning, the study reveals that MySpace provided: 

(1) Validation and appreciation of creative work;
(2) Peer alumni support:  Having friends (of friends) now in college is helpful for these students from low-income families, "many of whom are the first in their families to go to college and depend on modeling and advices and encouragement from similar peers who have succeeded."
(3) school-task related support, such as “chatting online to mitigate school related stress, asking questions about instructions or deadlines, planning study groups, broadcasting or requesting educational resources from the network, gathering project materials, brainstorming ideas, sharing written work, and exchanging feedback.”

Here are useful and comprehensive reference lists of research about <a href="http://www.danah.org/SNSResearch.html" target="blank"> social networking software </a> and <a href="http://www.danah.org/TwitterResearch.html" target="blank"> microblogging </a> (not limited to the field of education) compiled by an expert, <a href="http://www.danah.org/" target="blank"> Danah Boyd </a>, in this research area.
