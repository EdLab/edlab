<i>As the instructional leaders in the building, principals need to embrace and understand technology. It would be ridiculous for a principal to say I don't get reading or math. In today's tech driven world, it's just as ridiculous for instructional leaders to say they are scared of tech </i> (Jin-Soo, teacher from New Orleans, LA, via</i>

<b>Digital Empowerment</b> 
<br>
Focused on creating <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">an open cc 3.0 platform</a> for teachers, students, admins, policy makers, parents, and technologists to constructively identify <a href="http://www.waywordradio.org/pain_point/"> pain points </a> in education" <a href="http://edpain.digitalharborfoundation.org/">EdPain,</a> is the ultimate "safe space", or in this case, "harbor" to express your discontent. EdPain was developed by the nonprofit group, <a href="http://www.digitalharborfoundation.org/">Digital Harbour Foundation</a>, a Baltimore-based advocacy organization that trades on tech empowerment paired with action.  Focused around "digital literacy programs and inquiry-driven tech exploration" hosted at the groupâ€™s <a href="http://www.digitalharborfoundation.org/2012/09/18/rec2tech-center-a-vision-of-a-community-tech-space/">"Rec2Tech"</a> centers, they hope to create more opportunities in the real world and online for educators, technologists and students to collaborate.  These opportunities include mentorship, fellowships, events and workforce development.  EdPain is the perfect example of a desire to marry open, collaborative technology (wiki/blog hybrid) with social media to help give a voice to the many who want to, as the group describes in their mission statement, "change the global conversation around education in the digital age." 
<p>
<b>An Agile Education System?</b>
<br>
EdPain was created with the assumption that setting up a space and structure for individuals to identify the problems in education will help motivate people to find solutions.  The term "pain point" is often used in agile software development to describe the issues an organization faces before they can adopt a new more flexible development method, and it is apropos here.  For the education system to change, we must first identify the factors that are preventing this transformation.  Enter EdPain.  Just tweeting about a problem is not often a constructive practice; however, creating, as Digital Harbour has, a more condensed conversation around these issues could be transformative.  Many "edupreneurs" already utilize an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development methodology</a> in which identifying the "problem" you hope to fix with your product or service is the first and most important step in edtech development.  Perhaps EdPain will help to take this practice beyond technology and into education to help stakeholders identify and remove obstacles.  Education is not a product and neither are learners; however, the current system was built around a factory model of mechanized, replicable processes, meant to encourage us to think and interact in this way.  New parallels can be drawn between the technology industry, where product development has been redefined, and 21st century learning processes.  While this new approach to developing solutions around a central problem is not groundbreaking on its own, the potential solutions for education, developed around these constantly evolving problems may be truly disruptive.  After all, we do not have the same set of issues that we did at the turn of the century... why is our educational system still the same?
