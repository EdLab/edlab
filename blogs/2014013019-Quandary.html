<p><a href="http://www.quandarygame.org/teachers">Quandary</a> is a situation game that thrusts users into the role of the captain of a space colony beginning a new life on a new planet. Players can choose between three conflicts in the colony and it’s up to the player to resolve these conflicts. Problems are solved by talking to citizens, considering their opinions, and formulating resolutions. After players enact a solution they are able to see the consequences of their decisions. This web browser game teaches critical thinking, decision making, creativity, and problem solving.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Quandary gives users a unique challenge that may not be found in most games. The game action focuses on teaching ethics, a subject not normally taught in K-12 education. Experiencing the challenges of gameplay can help students develop problem solving skills. Plenty of resources are provided for teachers on how to use the game in the classroom. Quandary is a web browser game that is also available as an app for mobile devices. The app version of the game provides some extra features over the web version including character customization. Both the web and app versions are free to play and players do not need to sign up unless they want to save their scores or create characters.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The game is very short and currently only three episodes are available to play. Quandary does have some replay value as students can play again to try to increase their scores or make different decisions and see their outcomes. Some areas of the game may be a bit confusing for first time players; an example of this is organizing the thoughts and opinions of the characters.  </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Quandary is an interesting game that focuses on assuming a leadership position and making carefully thought out decisions. The games focuses on resolving conflicts and teaches players to organize the thoughts and opinions of the game characters. Quandary is great at teaching students soft skills like decision making, critical thinking, organization, and problem solving that are in great demand from potential employers. It’s a great way to introduce young students to the topic of ethics. The game with its science fiction storyline might also be used in science and literature classes.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Quandary is an adventure in ethics on the final frontier.</p>
