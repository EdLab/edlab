                    The ATF was created in 1886, under the United States Department of the Treasury.  It was formed as the revenue laboratory within the Bureau of Internal Revenue (more commonly known today as the IRS). In 1942, the ATF was given the responsibility to enforce federal firearms laws. 
	
        In the 1950's when the Bureau of Internal Revenue was changed to the Internal Revenue Service, the ATF was given the task of regulating tobacco tax too. From that point on until the 1970's the Bureau was called the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division (ATTD). In 1968, when the Gun Control Act was passed the division once again changed its name. This time it was also in control of Firearms and was rightfully renamed Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. In was not until President Nixon in 1972 signed executive order separating the ATF from the IRS did the ATF become the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. 
	
        After what happened on September 11, 2001, the ATF was redirected from the Treasury Department to the Justice Department in 2003 under the Homeland Security Bill.
