            I have my eye on the fourth column of the <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu">library website</a>.  According to our initial plans for the library website, the fourth column would be the place where we would feature a next generation research tool (the ads are completely lovely, but planned only as temporary).  We have called this tool Library Website X.  

The prospects of Website X have led me to think about <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/715">the McFarland and Klopfer presentation</a>.  As you may recall, <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/3020">McFarland and Klopfer proposed SPINE</a> (Scholar Practitioner Information Networks for Education), which aimed to “create multiple network depictions of the educational knowledge domain that can be interactively explored via on-line system — that builds on prior work in related fields and seeks to extend and improve upon it by applying it to the field of educationâ€? (2).  The paper took particular aim at Google style lists of results and advocated for a more visual scheme similar to Grokker:

<blockquote>
Good search criteria can generate a long list of knowledge artifacts relevant to a topic, but the lists do not facilitate the viewer's understanding of a topic, its organization, and how it is developed — i.e., how types of knowledge span artifacts and are interrelated, and how social relations under-gird this body of developing knowledge.
</blockquote>

At the time of the presentation, I thought that dismissing the list as not facilitating understanding as a bit premature.  Interestingly enough, today's Wall Street Journal featured an article titled, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?AH-6912812CAN2931 ">“The Way We List Nowâ€?</a>, which argues for the primacy of the list as a way of making sense of things.  I mention this article because I think we should seriously consider the ways in which individuals cognitively process visual materials and not so quickly dismiss the list. 

I have also been looking at other web tools for doing research.  Of course we have <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/central_search.php">Super Search</a>, which from my perspective is very cool.  There is also <a href="http://ottobib.com/">Ottobib</a>, which claims to “make bibliographies faster, easier, and more useful.â€?  There is also <a href="http://crazyegg.com/">CrazyEgg</a>, which attempts to visualize web usage in some interesting ways.  And although not quite a research tool but interesting visual experience, checkout the <a href="http://virtualexperience.amd.com/">AMD Virtual IT Experience</a>, which aims to create the impression of being at a high-end technology trade show.
