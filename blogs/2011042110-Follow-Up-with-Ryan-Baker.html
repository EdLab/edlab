          <p>
            I don't know how much others were fascinated by Ryan Baker's seminar a few weeks ago, but I certainly was (education + stat + probability + econometrics = Skanda happy). I decided to email him some specific questions I had about his work and analysis. He has been responsive to my questions and very helpful; here are some takeaways from our email exchange:

1.) There is still a lot of room for improvements in technology to help further develop educational data mining. The logging of data needs to be improved so that all relevant factors are tracked and the production of data is robust. Essentially, this is a problem of data integration and sharing. Building better repositories where data can be stored and exchanged easily is probably the key going forward.

2.) He could not test for interaction effects in his model because the number of possible multiplicative interactions that could be tested for was more than the number of data points he had in his set. To test for interaction effects would result in <a href"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">over-fit</a>.

3.) Most of the gaming strategies discovered and outlined in his research could not be applied to typical testing formats because online tutoring has the added benefit of feedback.
