<p>In libraries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_commons">information commons</a> house a combination of information and technology resources. Here, students can participate in classes offered by various academic departments in the library, in addition to using the space for independent learning. Academic libraries in Pakistan are fairly new to exploring the possibilities of information commons spaces and what these spaces can provide for their students. This study focuses on the resources offered in these spaces, the reasoning behind creating spaces like this, and how regular library services might be affected. </p>

<p>A questionnaire was sent to the directors of 117 academic libraries that are part of the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. Ninety-seven of the libraries ultimately responded to the questionnaire, and the results indicated that there was some familiarity with the concept of information commons if not widespread adoption. Only 41 libraries reported having information commons spaces, and most existing spaces were fairly new—at most, only about three years old. Roughly half of the libraries with information commons reported that the spaces are located on a single floor; the others reported a lack of large, available spaces, so the component parts of the information commons were parceled out among multiple floors. Although this multi-floor configuration is preferable to not having an information commons at all, it was also correlated to a shortage of professional staff. Still, the study makes a point to note that information commons are significantly enhancing academic library services in Pakistan, and directors from more than half of the libraries without these spaces said that they planned to build them in the future. </p>

<p>When looking to the future with these new spaces, the study suggests that libraries in Pakistan (and even elsewhere) should consult with librarians and library patrons who have already established and utilized these spaces. The set up is costly, but inter-institutional collaboration increases the odds of receiving grants, and allows libraries to plan projects in phases together to serve multiple learning communities. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the benefits to university communities outweigh the costs: information commons can bring people together and help them feel more at ease—and better supported—while conducting research or working on collaborative projects in the library. </p>
