<p>Many studies have warned us of the potential perils that media and digital technologies pose to creative thinking, but few have analyzed to what extent apps and digital media can actually support creativity. There are plenty of apps specifically focused on building creative thinking skills in children, and they’re very popular for children aged 8–11 (aka <i>middle childhood</i>). </p>
 
<p>A recent study examined whether and how creativity-focused apps actually affect children’s creativity in middle childhood. The study took place at an annual children’s film festival in the Netherlands and included a total of 94 participants, aged 8–10. Researchers included four creativity-based apps in the study. Two were age and skill appropriate for children: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toca-hair-salon-me/id730873197?mt=8">Toca Hair Salon Me</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easy-stop-motion-studio-introduction-to-animation/id593847174?mt=8">Easy Studio</a>. The other two were at a lower age and skill level: <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/nick-jr-draw-play">Nick Jr. Draw & Play</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sago-mini-monsters/id824281761?mt=8">Sago Mini Monster.</a></p>
 
<p>Each child played two apps, one from each skill-level group, for at most 10 minutes per app. Before and after game play, researchers conducted creativity assessments on children. After, they also asked the kids survey questions, measuring engagement and enjoyment.</p>
 
<p>The researchers were surprised to find that none of the apps had significant effect on children’s creativity levels. That said, children by far preferred and were more engaged playing the apps geared toward their age and skill level instead of those geared toward younger children. This shows, predictably, that children are more likely to enjoy, engage in, and learn from apps geared toward their developmental needs.</p>
 
<p>The researchers think their overall negative findings could demonstrate that creativity is a skill that takes a lot of time to develop. And, as the findings show, it probably won’t be affected by just playing an app for a few minutes. The researchers think that with continued app use, however, children’s creativity levels will have a greater chance of expanding, especially if those apps are geared toward their specific age and skill levels.</p>
