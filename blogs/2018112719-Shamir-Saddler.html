Shamir Saddler is a founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.smartterm.io/">SmartTerm</a>, an education management platform powered by machine learning. It is designed to digitize and improve education infrastructure globally. Saddler also currently works as Director of Software Engineering at Jibe, a tech startup in New York City. He earned first place at <a href="https://piedata.co/">Piedata’s</a> Cando Code, the first and only regional Hackathon in the Caribbean. He is currently a member of Global Shapers HUB of Kingston, Jamaica. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at SmartTerm?</b><br>
<p>My foundation has served as a solid base for my work at SmartTerm Limited. I attended Campion College, one of the top high schools in Jamaica and then moved on to Howard University, the top HBCU in the United States. At Howard University I studied Computer Engineering and fell in love with software development and solving problems through writing code. My passion landed me opportunities at Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and Jibe Inc in Manhattan. My professional experience gave me the opportunity to work on large-scale projects with big clients globally. That exposure enabled me to lead the team at SmartTerm and build out a SaaS Education Platform targeted at helping developing countries improve their education infrastructure.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at SmartTerm will change learning in the Caribbean?</b><br> <p>One of SmartTerm’s missions is to digitize schools throughout the Caribbean region and other Developing Regions, allowing for proper data analytics and insights, which will help with decision-making for key stakeholders. By bringing technology to schools we will make learning in the classroom fun and engaging, and by using machine learning we will help use data to create an environment for personalized learning.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>There are two technology areas that will revolutionize the education industry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Machine Learning will change the way we teach because it will be actively leveraging data and learning from it to make constant improvements to how teachers teach and students learn. Personalized learning has been a buzz concept, but with Machine Learning this can become possible as schools will be able to automatically match students with a teaching style. SmartTerm Education platform is actively thinking of ways to make this available on a large scale.
<li>Augmented Reality will disrupt education and make primitive approaches and archaic ways of teaching obsolete. Imagine a world where the cost of resources in a lab won’t limit a student’s access to practical assignments. I’ll let you think about that for a second....
SmartTerm is currently in the lab working on the possibilities of bringing AR to Caribbean Schools.
</ol>

<p><b>What, if any, are future plans for SmartTerm?</b><br>
<p>Future plans for SmartTerm include entering two different markets:</p>
<ol>
<li>To help schools in inner-city areas and black communities in the United States. This does match our development initiatives and mission to create equal educational opportunities for everyone. We believe that expanding will increase the scope of innovation for SmartTerm.
<li>To help schools in Latin and South America as they are also in need of a solid education infrastructure to ensure youth in their countries remain globally competitive.
</ol>
