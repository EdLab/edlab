          <p>
            Design Based Research seems to take a lot of heat in many sectors.  I started arguing that the idea is old and really follows from the “woops, goofed up the first conception but I want to keep my grant money, better make some research design changes!"? problem in many fields.  I had hoped to push this to what is has become when it is more formalized (although under various names).  In particular, a very similar approach is used in business with strong results.

Sheena S. Iyengar at Columbia's Business School (she's not alone, just the only name I really know) uses it to begin research on decision making.  And of importance, her group videos behavior and interviews to begin their research and then moves on from there analyzing which explanations from the interviews actually precede behavior and which seem more like rationalizations.  The process sounds a lot like reSEARCHing to me.

Also, OHDCC at Teachers College is currently using a similar approach for a consulting project.  They are first utilizing observational and focus group question data to develop and validate a set of research questions which they will then pursue. Most business studies have a similar “pre-study"?  If we were to do so, we could probably just avoid mentioning the pre-study to maintain legitimacy.  reSEARCHing allows for post study right? 

My personal experience, unfortunately, has been that changing a study halfway through can make statistical interpretation impossible (and there's probably a qualitative analogy here).  So it's a mixed bag but if we really want to pursue this methodology, can we have a seminar presented by someone with experience with the notion?  I could speak to a friend at OHDCC if we're interested, though I don't know how much they can do for us...
