            <b>Your Own Hub for Academic Research Papers?</b>
<a href= http://www.mendeley.com/>Mendeley</a> is free software for managing and sharing research papers and so far the beta 0.6 version is lookin' good.  Among their brilliant line of features (<a href= http://www.mendeley.com/tour>a quick tour</a>), the most noteworthy one is that it automatically extracts metadata and references.  While members cannot ‘write' their research papers together per se, they can share their own mini digital libraries of published papers (written by them or others) with like-minded researchers — meaning, the search engine + collaborative desktop catered to your academic interest has unlimited potential…given that enough people will sign up and begin uploading what they have and create ‘communities of practices'… 

Research trends and statistics is another great feature that shows popular authors, papers, journals, and tags in the member's academic discipline.  A similar logic is also applied to the member's own mini-library and it spits out stats about your own collection and sharing habits.  Who knows Mendeley could help concretize your research interests even before you figure it all out yourself.

<b>Doodle 4 Google</b>
Last year Google opened a competition to all K-12 students in US schools, encouraging students to design their own version of the google inspired by the theme, “What if?”  This year the competition is up and running again under the <a href= http://www.google.com/doodle4google/index.html>“What I Wish for the World”</a> theme.  

In addition to having different brackets for judging and giving out prizes like trips to the Google New York office, t-shirts printed with their doodle, and college scholarship + 25K technology grant towards the winner's school, Google has also announced that the Smithsonian's, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum will host an exclusive exhibit of the top 40 regional winners' doodles from May 21 until July 5.  This exhibition is being planned to focus on the problem-solving nature of the design process and include educational programs for teachers and students.   

Here are my three favorite picks from last year's list of regional winners.
To cut down the list of forty regional winners into four national finalists and one national winner, google will be hosting an online public vote from March 11-18 - I'll be sure to remind you then to cast your vote too!
