<p>In the age of eloquently simple web design, features like interactivity and parallax scrolling often come out on top. When making sites look appealing and easy to navigate, educational organizations have to put careful thought into presentation if they want to gain traction on their sites. <a href="http://www.ilo.org/infostories/">InfoStories</a>, an online platform that features various narratives constructed around labor research from the International Labor Organization (ILO), brings all of those elements together.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>InfoStoriesâ€™ narratives are all on aspects of labor worldwide, including topics such as pay equity and child labor in agriculture. Each narrative contains illustrations and graphics, interactive infographics, embedded videos, and other multimedia elements that make following the narrative engaging and interesting. For example, the narrative on pay equity has a graph on the pay gap by occupation; users click through different careers and countries to see the graph change based on how much women and men earn for the same work. The information is relevant and thought-provoking, and would likely work well in a high school social studies classroom for students to explore topics in greater depth.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although InfoStories provides beautifully presented information for each issue covered, it currently only has five published. Because the organization presents its own research findings and builds its own stories, it likely takes a significant amount of time and effort to create each narrative. And although the interactive nature of the narratives makes for a more engaging experience, some of the interactive elements seem gratuitous. For example, a photo of a man and a woman in the pay equity story is broken down into nine panels, and to learn more miscellaneous facts about the pay gap, the user must click on each panel to flip it over to the fact side. In the fixation to make apps and websites as interactive as possible, a balance between aesthetics and function should be maintained, and interactive choices should <i>add</i> to the experience, rather than just slightly change the way users receive the information.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The ILO provides incredibly relevant and informative data and facts about pressing labor issues in an inviting and thoughtful way, and any social studies class or curious learner would benefit greatly from exploring its various narratives online.</p>
