            Over the last couple of weeks, London's security alert is “critical” due to the bombing of a terminal at Glasgow Airport in addition to authorities finding two cars filled with explosives in the heart of London. With the two-year anniversary of the train bombings that killed 52 people recently passed, Londoners don't need a reminder of the dangers of terrorism. Since the tragic events that transpired on September 11th, 2001, I have had a deep fixation with the cause of modern-day terrorism. Newly installed British premier Gordon Brown, in one of his first speeches, stated his desire to “win the hearts and minds” of his nation's Muslim community, a daunting task considering England is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in Europe (France tops that list with a reported 10 million Muslims). <p>

To win the hearts and minds of Muslims in the West will not be an easy mission considering many often feel out of place and fail to integrate into mainstream Western culture. The problem, as I see it, is not so much with the Muslim communities but of governments that for the most part have made mistakes to aid the ideas of terrorists such as Osama bin Laden. President Bush famously declared his war on terror as a “crusade.” The Crusades were a series of wars waged by Christians, mainly against Muslims during the 10th century. Let's face it: the term “crusade” in the 21st century holds a deep meaning as it did 10 centuries ago when it comes to religion. To complicate matters, bin Laden and his cohorts have been very effective in capitalizing on Western mistakes. Al-Qaeda was quick to note the historical context behind “crusade” with the goal of legitimizing their war against the West as a crusade. They noted that the mostly Christian West was waging a “crusade” against Muslims in Palestine, Chechnya, Iraq, among other places and in the process may have gained new recruits eager to continue the “jihad.” <p>

Examples abound when it comes to Western mistakes in dealing with its Muslim citizens. A couple of years ago, cartoons of the prophet Mohammed with a bomb in his turban turned up in major European newspapers. This led to widespread protests in the Islamic world and beyond from Muslims who felt disrespected because pictures of Mohammed are forbidden in Islam due to fear it might lead to idolatry. The newspapers were wrong in portraying Mohammed with a bomb in his turban because it further emphasizes the widespread belief among many Muslims that they are viewed as terrorists in the West. <p>

The current ire of many in the Muslim world towards the West started during the Cold War. Following World War II, we lived in a bipolar world: the United States and democracy vs. the Soviet Union and communist. Coincidentally, the West planned to win the “hearts and minds” of many nations so they wouldn't fall to communism. This led the Western powers, specifically the U.S., to adopt many policies to combat communism. The most notable of these policies was containment-theory that in order to stop the spread of communism, it must be “contained.” For close to 40 years, containment will be overriding foreign policy for the West. In order to apply the policies, the West heavily supported repressive regimes in Africa and Asia (where all Islamic states are located) so it wouldn't fall victim to communism. These repressive governments enriched themselves and cohorts at the expense of their constituents. As a result, poverty was widespread throughout the Islamic world during the Cold War. Out of this poverty grew contentment and anger by citizens not towards their own governments, but towards the West. They feel their governments were corrupt and repressive due to heavy economic and political support from the West. Since the larger blame was placed on the West, it is the West that must feel the brunt of their anger. <p>

The blame is not completely on the West either. Muslims living in the West, I believe, must understand but more importantly realize that Western culture is very liberal and many of the things they may view as a sin or immoral is seen as normal in the West, e.g. dating between teenagers and scantly clad women on television. I have a large number of Muslim friends from all corners of the world and they all view their faith as the best way of life and never fail to share their faith with me though I am a Christian. They are some of the fondest and gracious people I have had the fortunate pleasure of knowing. The “jihadists,” or those who claim to kill in the name of Islam, represent a very small fraction of the over a billion Muslims worldwide. Most Muslims are devout, family oriented and peaceful people. For a few to hijack their religion and use it to promote a violent ideology is one of the greatest injustices in human history. To make matters worse, the bulk of Western society, as aforementioned with the newspapers, are ignorant towards Muslims, their concerns and beliefs. For years, the U.S. claimed their war in Vietnam was a battle to win the “hearts and minds” of the Vietnamese people. History has clearly shown that the U.S. failed to win either their hearts or minds. I just hope that Gordon Brown realize and address the roots of the problem before he tackles it head-on because it can prove to be yet another Western mistake to win “hearts and minds.” I wish him luck and hope his plan to win “hearts and minds” succeeds, but as history has shown, I reserve a right to be pessimistic about his chances of success.
