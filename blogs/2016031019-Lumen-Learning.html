<p><i>"Lumen Learning provides high quality open courseware and support for educational institutions to help them eliminate textbook costs, broaden access to educational materials and improve student success through the effective use of open-educational resources (OER)."</i> (<a href="http://lumenlearning.com/">About Lumen Learning</a>) </p>

<p><a href="http://lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning</a> is an open courseware system, primarily for higher education institutions. Through their well curated open education resources, Lumen Learning lowers student textbook costs and increases access to learning materials.</p>
 
<p>Lumen’s Waymaker is an interface between students and instructors that personalizes courses by having students reflect on their learning process and making data on student progress more visible to instructors, which enables better outreach to struggling learners. Candela, Lumen’s course system, includes carefully curated courses on topics ranging from anatomy and physiology to music appreciation. Courses include digital textbooks, with informative text, high-quality visuals, assessments, and assignments. Instructors can revise, edit, and remix the content to tailor the courses to their own style and needs. Other projects such as MyOpenMath, zELI courses, and OER Degree Programs have come out of partnerships with community colleges and other institutions that future users can adopt. 

<p>The biggest benefit of Lumen is the cost-savings to students and institutions. Through data analysis and dashboards, tracking and responding to student performance is also a plus. Drawbacks at the time of this writing include limited offerings—there are only 60-70 course options and Waymaker is only offered with four of them. Despite these limitations, Lumen offers several layers of support to their partners—choosing to invest in making Lumen work well for its users rather than broadening a learning management system with inconsistent user satisfaction and results. Founders Kim Thanos and Dr. David Wiley are passionate about open education and educational technology to drive student success and offer insightful, intentional leadership. </p>
