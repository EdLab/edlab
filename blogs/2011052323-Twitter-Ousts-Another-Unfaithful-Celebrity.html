          <p>
            As a new user to Twitter, some of the people or things I follow (besides Vialogues of course) are my favorite sports teams (e.g. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Arsenal">Arsenal</a>), and shows (e.g. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ESPNPressPass">ESPN's Press Pass</a>). Over the weekend, a few of those I follow were making inquiries about which high profile soccer player (they preferred been called footballers) in the UK had <a href=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/05/23/uk.privacy.laws/index.html?hpt=C2">taken out a super injunction prohibiting details of his extramarital affair becoming public</a>. The high profile footballer was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> of England's Manchester United. Giggs is by far the most decorated player in the history of English soccer because of his unmatched number of trophies (he has won over 25 major trophies during his nearly 21 year career and could add to that collection this Saturday if Manchester United beat Barcelona in the Champions League final). 

In the UK, anyone can take out an injunction to prevent the reporting of a story and a super injunction from preventing that such an injunction even exists. Rumors of Giggs' affair came to light when a Member of England's Parliament, commonly called MPs, exercised parliamentary privilege-rule that allows members of Parliament to make statements that would not be permitted outside of Parliament's walls-by revealing that it was Giggs who was the alleged footballer. Since the MP, the Courts and Giggs' legal team were the only ones who knew that Giggs had a super injunction, rumors are rife that someone from the media who was present during the MP's speech in Parliament tipped off a friend or colleague to post the news on their personal Twitter account, from which the news went viral that Giggs was indeed the footballer in question. Since Twitter is operated in the US, the courts in the UK don't have any legal means to prosecute the source of the leak and which seems highly unlikely considering the amount of times it has been tweeted and retweeted. 

Is it possible that Twitter and social media could be changing how celebrities live their lives off camera or how certain laws are proving outdated for today's “open information” world?
