<p><a A kit from Magical Microbes, the href="https://www.magicalmicrobes.com/collections/kits/products/mudwatt-clean-energy-from-mud">MudWatt</a> exposes students to science and engineering topics by teaching them how to generate electricity from the microbes in mud. Paired with an app that helps users measure their bacteria population and the energy generated, the MudWatt can be used in elementary classrooms or universities to help students better understand and engage with renewable energy and microbiology.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The MudWatt presents many STEM learning opportunities related to microbiology, chemistry, electricity, and environmental engineering. Between this and its engaging, hands-on nature, the MudWatt is adaptable for many different age groups. Though the act of collecting dirt may seem childish, understanding and comparing the bacteria populations that grow and create electricity within that soil certainly is not.</p>

<p>Everything about the MudWatt is engaging and exciting. The anticipation that comes with waiting for the LED you’ve installed to start blinking, signalling microbe activity, is thrilling, and being able to graph energy levels throughout the week made me oddly proud. Even the included educational comic requires you to unlock higher power levels to find out what happens next in its fact-filled adventure story. It’s far more inspiring to learn about complex concepts when you can visualize and interact with them in creative ways.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although directions for the MudWatt were generally clear, I did encounter a few technical difficulties. First, I struggled to measure my power output the first couple of days that the LED lit up. My guess is that it wasn’t generating enough megawatts to register, but there was nothing in the guide to indicate that might occur. Also, on day 11, my power output dropped 7 megawatts over the course of an hour and was back up the next time I measured it, which to me, at least, seems like a malfunction.</p>
 
<p>The price of a MudWatt could be inhibiting; one costs $39.99, and a set of three costs $89.99. While grants are available for educators, those interested in just one or a science fair pack need to be willing to invest a little.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>As an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating and tracking data from my MudWatt, and I can only imagine how much I would have loved it as a child. Conveying valuable concepts with hands-on, active learning, the MudWatt has a lot to offer scientists of all ages.</p>
