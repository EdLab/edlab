          <p>
            Just finished watching "Recount" this afternoon. It is a movie based on the 2000 Presidential Election.

The plot in 5 sentences:
How the Democratic team led by Ron Klain challenged the state  of Florida to recount some of the Dem counties' votes by hand instead of machine. The Secretary of State Katherine Harris, also a Republican, insisted on the previous declaration (Bush won) but the State Supreme Court ordered a recount in 4 counties within 5 days. Pressure mounted as recount began, 2 of the 4 counties' officers decided to give up the recount. Finally the Supreme Court of USA, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html">reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida</a> as it claimed "the standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses". Thus Gore, and Klain lost. 

If you want a more complete "plot", you can either take a look at this <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/election/magtimeline.htm">timeline</a> or just ask Hui Soo for the dvd.

As I was watching the movie, I thought about what are the things we should include in a curriculum. Here's some of my ideas:

1. A easy to understand (not like <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/legalotln/"> this</a>), perhaps an interactive webpage that explains the US legal system and the mechanisms behind it. 

What is the relationship between the county, state and the country? How can the counties officers just decided not to continue to recount? 

Part of the Supreme Court judgment is based on a ruling in 1892. Personally, it wasn't until I was a college freshman do I understand why lawyers spend a large portion of their time digging old files to search for old cases that may strengthen their argument. So I think including that "philosophy of law" part in the curriculum will be helpful. 

2. A list of the characters and what do they do

What do campaign managers do? Ron Klain, Gore's chief of staff, is the key player of this "battle". Gore, on the other hand, as portrayed in the movie, seems to play no active role in these recount struggles. 

Who were the people that performed the manual recount? 

perhaps even:

3. Statistics Fun

For the students who don't know, what's the margin of error. How are things calculated?

4. Ballots

What are the types of ballots used in 2000. What about 2008? Perhaps even: Electronic ballots vs. traditional ballots. Which is better? 

5. What happen to the people whose names are similar to felonies? Did they face the same discrimination in 2004 too?


These are just some of my ideas, and I am sure all of you will have loads of ideas too so PLEASE COMMENT~!
