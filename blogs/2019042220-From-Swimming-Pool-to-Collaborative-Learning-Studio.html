<p>In recent years, many studies have examined the effects of active-learning classrooms on learning outcomes; however, there is a lack of research regarding how well the design of active-learning classrooms supports the various pedagogical activities that take place in these environments. The researchers in this study took advantage of a newly constructed active-learning classroom to consider how pedagogy, space, and technology work together to impact learning, examining what kinds of classroom activities occurred in the space and how well the space supported these activities.</p>
 
<p>The site of this study was the recently-constructed Collaborative Learning Studio (CLS), an active-learning classroom at a midwestern university that occupies a space originally built to house a swimming pool. The CLS is a technology-enhanced space designed to promote collaborative learning. The classroom features 16 student tables that each seat 6 students. Each table is equipped with a desktop computer that can be synced with two projector screens and/or the 20-foot video wall at the front of the classroom. The video wall has the capacity to display all 16 monitor screens at once, or to show quadrants or a single stream. </p>
 
<p>11 undergraduate courses were taught in the opening semester of the CLS. The courses engaged a variety of topics, ranging from anthropology to geography to public health, and enrolled an average of 50 students. Interviews, surveys, and course syllabi revealed that while the courses heavily featured collaborative learning, most classes included some lecture elements. Instructors, for example, often opened the class with class-wide directions or contextual comments; classes also sometimes featured guest presenters. After the conclusion of the first semester of courses, the researchers employed surveys and interviews to gauge how the capacities of the active-learning classroom impacted the different learning activities that occurred during classes.</p>
 
<p>The results of the surveys and interviews indicated that both instructors and students found that group activities worked well in the CLS, in-part due to the desktop computers at each table. There was less consensus, however, about how the classroom facilitated lecture learning. While some respondents found the ability to project the speaker onto the table monitors helpful, the majority of student respondents reported that lecture activities worked least well in the CLS, citing the distracting presence of too many screens and the inability to see the speaker from certain points in the room. Faculty responses echoed similar concerns: while one teacher cited the room’s multiple-image capacity as advantageous to lecture, others complained that there was no place they could stand and see all students at once. This made it difficult for instructors to see students’ hands and to connect with the whole class while speaking. These results showed the researchers that, while the CLS effectively supports small-group learning, it is not an ideal environment for lecture. However, it is important to note that the survey questions explicitly asked students which learning activities worked best and least well in the CLS, which may have impacted students’ responses. For example, some may have thought the space adequately suited for lectures, but not quite as well suited for that activity as for group work. In that case, the label "worked least well" would be misleading.</p>
 
<p>Faculty recommendations for the CLS’s improvement focused on the need for a centralized station to facilitate lecture and more wireless capacities to enable the instructor to move freely about the room while still controlling the screen displays. All instructors also indicated the need for support in adjusting to a technology-enhanced classroom. While this study was small, it does highlight the importance of considering how a space is used when evaluating design. The study effectively illustrates that, while a classroom may feature one kind of activity prominently, other learning activities likely occur in that space. Taking different learning activities into account can help designers build spaces that foster different kinds of learning.</p>
