          <p>
            I've been doing some reading for our Systems and Workflow Project.  This is the first of a number of ideas for how we might consider reworking the obtaining of materials for our patrons. 

OCLC's World Cat Resource Sharing now includes an option for users to request delivery of books to their home or office called World Cat Direct. This feature continues the partnership between OCLC and Better World Books that began during a 2009 pilot of the service. The new option is available to libraries in the United States. 

Libraries that offer the new delivery option to their users will manage payment for the service through the Interlibrary Loan Fee Management (IFM) feature, which our library already uses.  Books are priced at two levels:

<li>The majority of items in Better World Books' collection are available for $15</li> 
<li>Newer books in Better World Books' collection are available for $25</li>

Why use WorldCat Direct?

<li>Improve service and convenience of home delivery to patrons while saving library staff time</li> 
<li>Easy return of loaned items through prepaid USPS saves time for users</li> 
<li>Library users have the opportunity to purchase the loaned items</li>
 
How WorldCat Direct works:

Interlibrary loan staff can enable access by setting up the “WorldCat Direct” option in the WorldCat Services administrative module and adding the symbols BWBKS ($15) and QUICK ($25) to custom holdings groups and paths. In addition, libraries that plan to automate user-initiated requests will need to establish or review an update a Direct Request profile.

Each book will be shipped directly to the user's address with a postage-paid envelope enclosed.  This envelope can be used to return the item to Better World Books. The due date is located on the label attached to the book. The loan period for these items is 30 days and they are not renewable. Information about how to purchase books from Better World Books is also attached to books when they are shipped to users.

When a user locates an available item, he/she can:
<li/>Place a request using the Direct Delivery option on the WorldCat Resource Sharing user form, or</li> 
<li>Place a request with ILL staff who will then place the request using the WorldCat Resource Sharing staff form on the user's behalf</li>
<li>The request is then routed for automated processing or sent to library staff for manual review. After library staff sends the request to the Direct Delivery supplier, the borrowing library's Request Manager indicates whether the item is being sent directly to the user and, if so, an e-mail notification is sent to the user. When an item is shipped to the borrowing library's user, IFM charges are debited from the borrowing library and the request status changes to "Direct Delivered" in the Request Manager</li> 
Libraries that use WorldCat Resource Sharing and OCLC ILLiad Resource Sharing Management software can easily set up resource sharing in FirstSearch to work effectively with OCLC ILLiad.

In the article “Knock, Knock! OCLC at the Door With WorldCat Direct,” Tony Melvyn, product manager of OCLC WorldCat Resource Sharing, states that although at present the WorldCat Direct service only uses books from Better World Books, other online bookstores are definitely "on the table" if the service, which only went into production at the end of May, proves successful. "It's definitely viable. We already have other vendors, e.g., Alibris. We might even sell books on the OCLC service."
