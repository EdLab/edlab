<p>There is no doubt that the edtech industry is booming, especially with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/barbarakurshan/2016/02/11/the-intersection-of-learning-and-fun-gamification-in-education/#3bb60fd31d36">educational games</a> that are <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/06/video-games-education-reform/396680/">designed to get kids excited</a> about learning, whether it’s math, shapes, or science. Edtech researchers and entrepreneurs continue to unlock new uses for developing technology, and they're focusing on learners who have been left out by initial rounds of product development.</p>
 
<p>Researchers in Tunisia recently looked at technology's potential to enhance sign language education by conducting a pilot study with <a href="http://www.signwriting.org/symposium/presentation0052.html">MemoSign</a>, an educational game designed to teach SignWriting, a visual way of writing sign language notation. They focused on nine students between the ages of 9 and 16 years old. First, they trained the students how to use the game. Then, the students played the game independently while the researchers observed their actions and reactions. Finally, the students completed a questionnaire evaluating their experience using MemoSign.</p>
 
<p>Most students found the game useful, fun, and easy to follow. When playing, students flipped a card that fell into one of three categories: visual, word, or math. Once flipped, the card prompted a 3D avatar to sign the corresponding word. Most of the students attempted to mimic the avatar after seeing it sign something on the screen.</p>
 
<p>The authors emphasize the fact that many learning games are inaccessible to learners with disabilities or special needs. They highlight that the students in this study enjoyed the game and felt that it was useful in learning SignWriting, which has substantial implications for learning sign language through games. Creating more inclusive classrooms and environments will involve dedicating more time and resources to games like MemoSign.</p>
