            This idea is written with journalism (and specifically investigative journalism in mind) but it can be extended to education (students are given a topic to "investigate" as a class with missing pieces in the narrative. they are then tasked with filling in the gaps)

The collaborative effort of Joachim, Gonzalo, Stephanie Hunt and myself.

PITCH STARTS BELOW
Collaborative Investigative Journalism

More and more the wisdom of the crowds has been put to use on the internet with positive results. Companies such as Google (implicitly) and Digg (explicitly) utilize wisdom of the crowd approaches to provide meaningful information to individual users. Investigative journalism has employed the model, with "citizen journalists" to wonderful effect. Talking Points Memo (http://talkingpointsmemo.com) combined paid reporters with citizen journalists to expose the politically motivated firing of State Attorney Generals by the US government.
We believe there is an opportunity to create an environment in which hundreds if not thousands of these investigations are created and aided by citizens around the country.
We propose to build an online system where users can choose an investigation that interests them (or start a new one) and provide information to further its cause. Users can make connections between pieces of information using different tools. These tools will indicate the type of connection being made (political, monetary etc) in a graphic manner. As an investigation develops visual connections of the information will aid in answering the question that is being posed. 
We envision an army of citizen journalists contributing to an investigation or story and helping to "connect the dots."
Users deemed to have helped the investigation reach it's goal will be given greater weight and their opinions counted more heavily so as to tamp down on users looking to contribute false information/make false connections or derail the investigation or story.

Ultimately the site will act as a repository for information regarding investigations/stories as well as a place to connect pieces of scattered information into a cohesive story.
