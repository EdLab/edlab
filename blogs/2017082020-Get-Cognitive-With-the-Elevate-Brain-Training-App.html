<p><a href="https://www.elevateapp.com">Elevate</a> is a brain training app that claims to literally elevate your mind to new heights. While it might not make you taller, it hopes to make you a quicker thinker. And in the age of endless witty quips and scrolling, who doesn’t want their mind to make connections a bit quicker? Elevate is not the only brain training app, of course, but it does provide some interesting elements that other similar products do not.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>From the beginning, Elevate feels like a scientist in a white coat keeping track of your data with a clipboard… but in a good way. The app first requires users to take a test to assess their competency levels in five different areas: writing, listening, speaking, reading, and math. These skills are then honed according to your starting point as you play Elevate games. While most brain training games claim to improve more vague cognitive skills (e.g., attention, flexibility), Elevate’s skill areas are concrete enough to seem applicable to everyday life. And the charts documenting your progress at the end of each activity are sure to boost a sense of accomplishment.</p>
 
<p>In addition, Elevate’s interface is colorful, organized, and enticing to use. It’s the type of interface that will most please intellectuals with a penchant for whimsy (e.g., me), but could even brighten the day of a more serious, curmudgeonly type (e.g., my college econ professor). In the free version of Elevate, you receive three different games (out of more than forty) to play an unlimited number of times each day. The Pro version will get five personalized games each day and unlimited access to all the others, but it also costs $39.99 annually.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although this isn’t specific to Elevate, <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/brain-training.html">there is little research that backs up the claim</a> that brain training platforms improve cognitive skills outside the app’s activities. Elevate provides <a href="https://www.elevateapp.com/research">one research study</a> on its website that demonstrates that users perform significantly better on the app after they’ve used it for one month than people who didn’t use it. So the claims for more general effects that brain training companies, including Elevate, make are often misleading in this regard. While cognitive training apps certainly won’t harm your mental faculties (and to be honest, they're quite fun), it should be noted that they might not help improve these cognitive skills in your everyday life.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>With its linguistic- and numeric-based activities, Elevate takes a more concrete approach to cognitive training than other similar apps. It’s a fun and sophisticated platform, but don’t expect the skills you practice on the app to directly translate to areas of your everyday life. While it might improve your daily cognitive functions, the research currently doesn’t back up this claim enough to assert it as true.</p>
