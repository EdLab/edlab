<strong>Title: </strong>Beijing bicycle [videorecording]

<strong>Director:</strong><strong> </strong>Wang Xiaoshuai

<strong>Produced by:</strong> Culver city, CA : Sony Pictures, 2002

<strong>Call no.: </strong><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6/?searchtype=t&amp;searcharg=beijing+bicycle&amp;searchscope=6&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=D&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=tbeijing+bicycle">PN1997.2 .S45 2002 </a>

<strong>From the Produc</strong><strong>tion Company</strong><strong>: </strong>

"Think of yourselves as the carrier pigeons of today!" instructs the  manager of a bicycle delivery service. A young man from the country  named  Guei works diligently at this new job, eager to pay off the  company bicycle and make it his own. But just before his last payment,  the bicycle is stolen and he's fired--but if he can find it again, he'll  get his job back. The emotional stakes of <em>Beijing Bicycle</em> become  amazingly gripping: after Guei accidentally discovers that the bike now  belongs to a young student who bought it used, a fight over the  ownership of the bicycle becomes downright harrowing, for the student  has a secret that threatens to humiliate him. <em>Beijing Bicycle</em> ranges from a light portrait of the kinetic poetry of a bicycle in  motion to a raw examination of violence driven by envy and guilt. A  beautiful, wrenching movie.

<strong>About the Director
</strong>

Wang Xiaoshuai is considered to be one of the most talented filmmakers in China. A graduate of the Beijing Film Academy, he wrote and directed his first features, "The Days" in 1993. The film garnered praise from Western film critics but was blacklisted by the China Film Bureau, as was the director. In 1994, he completed the independent production, "Frozen," entering it into various international film festivals as directed by "Wu Min" (Anonymous). At the end of 1995, he entered the Beijing Film Studio and made "A Vietnamese Girl." However, the film did not pass the censors. It was only after undergoing three more years of cuts (and a title change to "So Close to Paradise") that it passed the censors. "So Close to Paradise" was selected for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.
