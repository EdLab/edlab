<p><a href="http://comwriter.com/">Comwriter</a> is a platform that provides tools to make writing an academic paper less stressful. Every function in the platform works to make it easier for writers to organize their thoughts and writing. Some of these functions include templates of different paper styles and online space to upload and organize digital resources used for writing papers. Users can apply APA or MLA style to their paper even after they begin writing. There are also tools that help users monitor their progress like due date reminders and a display of the word count.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Comwriter provides a clear template that breaks the paper into sections that the user can complete and combine towards the finished paper. Writers can customize the structure and headings of this template to fit their needs. New users are shown a quick start guide that provides writing advice for each section of the paper template. The resource curation function is especially useful for writers with many resources or users who write multiple papers on similar subjects with some of the same resources. One nifty feature is that users can easily browse options for customizing the text by highlighting the section. Sections can also be easily reorganized with drag and drop.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There is a slight lag when opening a paper and the dashboard takes some time to load all of the sections. Writers also need to save their work manually as in Microsoft Word; Comwriter lacks the auto save capabilities of Google Documents. The system could also be confusing to new users who begin typing without first adding heading or paragraph sections. This pitfall could be remedied by making the add button more prominent.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Comwriter could be a very valuable tool for students organizing their ideas and resources for writing. It might be beneficial to have the writing advice in the quick start guide automatically pop up while users are writing in a specific section of their own templates. Some academic papers are written by a group of authors so adding more collaborative features could help the platform grow.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Comwriter helps students write the perfect academic paper without the stress.</p>
