<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breathe-think-do-with-sesame/id721853597?mt=8">Breathe, Think, Do</a> is a free iPad app that teaches emotional intelligence skills such as problem-solving, self-control, planning, and task persistence to kids aged 4 and up. When the app opens, users are introduced to Mando, a Sesame Street <i>monster</i> who is easily upset during everyday activities. Through a series of simple exercises, kids learn strategies for managing their emotions in common situations.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Mando struggles to tie his shoes, becomes frustrated when he is asked to take turns, and feels separation anxiety when his mother leaves him at daycare. These challenges will be relatable to many young children. Each obstacle Mando faces follows the same basic structure and the repetitive nature of this app will help reinforce new behavior patterns. First, Mando uses a breathing technique to calm down; next, the user pops on-screen bubbles to help Mando think up a solution to his problem; finally, the user is given a choice of three positive actions. This tripart strategy is what gives the app it’s name: Breathe, Think, Do! Even as an adult, I found the experience of using this app calming. While many games for kids are full of bright lights and frenetic motion, this one asks users to slow down, breathe deeply, and take a moment to think before acting. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The cornerstone of Breathe, Think, Do is a simple breathing technique which is used to de-escalate stressful moments. Kids are instructed to place their hands on their stomachs and take deep <i>belly breaths</i> as a way of calming down and becoming more mindful. My main criticism of this app is that during these deep breathing segments, users are required to continuously tap on Mando’s belly. This sends a mixed message: should kids have their hands on their stomach, or on the iPad screen? In the future I would also love to see a web version of Breathe, Think, Do, to make it easier to use in a group setting with multiple children watching and following along.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Breathe, Think, Do teaches young children an accessible strategy for handling tense situations. Its clean graphics and simple interactions contribute to its effectiveness. The app can be used by kids alone, but it also comes with good instructional materials for caregivers. While it does have a few technical hiccups, overall it is a welcome find for parents or educators working with children on de-escalation techniques, mindfulness practices, and conflict resolution.</p>
