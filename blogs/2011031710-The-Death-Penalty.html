          <p>
            I've recently heard about <a href=http://wheaton.patch.com/articles/states-attorney-berlin-responds-to-quinns-decision-to-abolish-the-death-penalty-in-illinois">Illinois' Governor Pat Quinn's decision to abolish the death penalty in that state</a>. Quinn's decision to make Illinois the latest state to outlaw capital punishment didn't sit too well with many, including DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin, who argue that abolishing capital punishment essentially grants victory to murderers and criminals as it gives them a sense of victory for the crimes they have committed. 
 
This is the latest in the ongoing debate surrounding capital punishment. The right to decide which criminal receives capital punishment is reserved to the states. Currently, there are 16 states where it is outlawed (plus the District of Columbia) while 34 states (mostly in the South and West Coast) have it on their books. Though the entire process of capital punishment is solely at the state's discretion, there are several federal laws governing which kinds of criminals can be executed. For instance, states cannot execute inmates legally declared mentally retarded nor can they execute anyone under the age of 18. 
 
<a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/abolitionist-and-retentionist-countries#1976">Globally</a>, the US continues to be one of the few remaining developed nations where capital punishment is still law; it is the only member nation (out of 28) of NATO which has the death penalty, essentially making it the only Western nation which still executes its criminals. The vast majority of countries in the world have limited (for certain crimes) or no death penalty at all.
