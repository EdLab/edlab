<p><a href="http://alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip/">Short Trip</a> is a web-based journey with carefully detailed and beautifully rendered hand-drawn graphics. It has no defined purpose and no rules. It’s just a pleasant ride in the country on a tram that you learn how to control as you go. And <i>go</i> is the operative word, because when you load this game, the only indicator that something is happening is the melody of Australian birdsong.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Short Trip is free and designed for everyone. So I invited my colleagues, an eclectic group, to test-drive the game. All but one played to the end, and everyone liked it: Caitlin B appreciated "having control of a train for once," and not being judged by the cat-like humanoids who were nonplussed as she sped through their stations without stopping to pick them up. Ryan’s experience was just, well, "Zen." Brian "loved the illustrations" and found the ride "very relaxing." And Melanie realized she "could never be a train conductor, my judgment calls on when to start and stop were terrible!" For my part, I made a discovery that none of my team did: after hitting every key on my keypad I learned that I can’t break the game and the space bar makes the conductor’s bell ring.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Short Trip’s weakness may also be its strength. When the game loads, the player is greeted with an idyllic country scene where absolutely nothing happens. To get things, going I pressed my trackpad, then the return key and, refusing to be beaten, I finally scrutinized the interface, locating the unobtrusive and barely visible information mark, which contained the only instruction: "Hold left or right to move." After that, my confidence increased and my bravery was rewarded with a journey where I was in the driver’s seat. It took a while to appreciate that there really were no surprises; none of that narrative tension and gaming violence that we have become accustomed to anticipating.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Short Trip’s creator, Alexander Perrin, describes himself as an Australian technical artist, illustrator and interactive media developer with a passion for meticulous dynamics, detailed digital rendering techniques, and cats. This game is his study into capturing the essence of graphite on paper within a digital context, and an attempt to learn more about web-based graphics technologies. Like many innovations, this innocuous game will likely find users Perrin never imagined, like my friend Nigel, a retired ICT professional from Tasmania, Australia who also agreed to play: "[it has] so much delightful intricacy, so many things to see and admire along the way, so much to inspire and delight." It’s these qualities that could make this game an important elementary tool for reaching the large number of adults around the world who lack basic computer skills and struggle to use technologies.</p>
