<i>The best way to summarize FIRST LEGO League is to say that it is a robotics program for 9 to 16 year olds (9 to 14 in US/CAN/MEX), which is designed to get children excited about science and technology -- and teach them valuable employment and life skills.</i> 


<p>
<b>League of Extraordinary Learners</b><br>
More than just a science fair or robotics experience, <a href="http://firstLEGOleague.org/">FIRST LEGO League (FLL)</a> is an international set of yearly competitions co-sponsored by <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST</a> and <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/">LEGO</a> that stress creative problem solving, STEM-focused learning and "<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/aboutus/gracious-professionalism">gracious professionalism</a>."  Groups of up to 10 young people from a wide variety of backgrounds, from homeschooling to private schools, form teams and compete in both qualifying and championship robotics events.  During these interactions teams and their coaches make use of FIRST and LEGO resources to create innovative project-based solutions to hard-hitting globally-focused problems.  As the FLL site describes, "FLL challenges kids to think like scientists and engineers ... teams will build, test, and program an autonomous robot using <a href="http://mindstorms.LEGO.com/en-us/default.aspx">LEGO MINDSTORMS®</a> to solve a set of missions in the Robot Game.  They will also choose and solve a real-world problem in the Project."   Instead of traditional "top-down" learning opportunities, whereby the facilitator leads all activities, league members are tasked with discovering solutions to a wide-range of problems; dedicated coaches/mentors are a secondary, but necessary part of the discovery process. This model of facilitation and student-driven inquiry is attempted often, but not often successfully.  FLL manages to accomplish this goal and build on FIRST’s two-decades long history of creating opportunities to inspire and engage young people with innovative STEM-focused opportunities. 
<p> 
<b>Robots First... Homework Second</b><br>
FLL teams are eligible to compete in organized tournaments like the upcoming <a href="http://firstlegoleague.org/challenge/2013naturesfury">Nature’s Fury Challenge (August 27th 2013)</a>.  The FLL site outlines the goal of this event focused on developing possible robotics-based solutions to natural disasters: "…in the 2013 NATURE’S FURY? Challenge, over 200,000 children ages 9 to 16 from over 70 countries will explore the awe-inspiring storms, quakes, waves and more that we call natural disasters. Teams will discover what can be done when intense natural events meet the places people live, work, and play."  Unique opportunities like those afforded by "Natures Fury" to "think like scientists" and tackle hard-hitting global issues set this initiative apart from the classic "exploding volcano"-based science fair.  Perhaps through these real-world-inspired opportunities young people will gain the insight and motivation necessary to launch future careers in STEM fields.
