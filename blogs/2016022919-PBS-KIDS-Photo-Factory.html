<p>How do we motivate students? The formal strictures of the classroom can drain the thrill of discovery, souring children on one of their best chances for personal growth, development, and self-actualization. 
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pbs-kids-photo-factory/id359188521?mt=8">PBS KIDS Photo Factory</a> leverages the informal learning afforded by a trusted educational broadcaster so that children can mix after school fun with real learning. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>PBS KIDS Photo Factory allows children to be placed in a photo right beside their favorite PBS KIDS characters, inspiring them to watch, interact with, and reflect on these educational programs. All of the classic shows are ready for your own private red carpet photo shoot, including characters from Arthur, Caillou, Curious George, Sesame Street, and more. Interactivity is incredibly straightforward and includes four simple steps: add a photo, edit its appearance, add a character from your child’s favorite PBS series, and share. Screen colors are bright and shiny, kid-friendly at their best. Interactivity is facilitated by large icons so that you click and zoom on screen. Even pudgy fingers unskilled in the fine art of using a tablet or smartphone for navigation can move freely with the app. It’s as easy as a click of a shutter.  </p> </p>

<p>One of the best features of Photo Factory is that it allows mini-Fellinis to make their mark with media. Adults can teach the basics of photo composition when capturing a shot. The rudiments of post-production can also be learned. The app lets kids mess around with their media without fear of messing up the original source material. Photos can be resized, rotated, and zoomed. After launching the app, you go straight from point-and-shoot photography to zigging-and-zagging post-production on the interface. </p>

<p>Also, for extended families around the country, PBS KIDS Photo Factory helps bridge the distance. Children can incorporate their friends and family into their pic as well as post a photo with their new PBS pal on social media. Far-off grandparents, as well as uncles and aunts on the move, can see your pint-sized photo-poser courtesy of e-mail, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the robust sharing functionality of PBS KIDS Photo Factory can lead tender tots to trouble. Sharing children’s pictures on social media can unfortunately make them prey for predators. However, when used responsibly, Photo Factory could prove to be a blessing—it can provide a welcome, non-judgmental entry point for parents to discuss internet safety with their children. You’re never too young to be safe. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>PBS KIDS Photo Factory is a great app. If you want your child to push their multimedia learning, personalize it, and tie it into their favorite television program, PBS KIDS Photo Factory could start them on their digital journey. Turn on, tune in, and drop a photo from your favorite show. It’s never too early to catch the photography bug! </p>
