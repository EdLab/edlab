            Hey everyone,

Demetri, Janice, and I have come up with what we think is a really cool project idea involving STEM education. Below are some of the details of our project. We would really appreciate some feedback! Let us know if you think anything is unclear, as communicating the idea can sometimes be as important as the idea itself. Thanks!

<b>Program Description</b> 

<i>Objectives </i>
STEMedia provides a context for the 6-8 market to use educational technology platforms (i.e. Vialogues and EdDias) that have been developed in the EdLab. 

<i>History behind the idea </i>
STEMedia is a response to the growing number of educational technology products and services, while there is a simultaneous lack of research around HOW those tools are being implemented.

<i>Product and feature description</i> 
STEMedia is not a product. It is a long-term program that supplements existing curriculum goals in 6-8 STEM subject classes.

It features professional development workshops for participating teachers in STEM courses AND Liberal Arts teachers (i.e. visual arts, music, photography, creative writing, etc). Both groups of teachers can come together to start a STEM focused project that has the engaging powers of the arts. STEMedia therefore features guidelines on how teachers can combine EdLab educational technology products and inquiry-based learning interventions in order to meet curriculum and extra-curricular outcome measures. 

<li>Must create a professional development course; this professional development course will be made available online via mSchool/Vialogues</li>

<li>Students can upload their content and comment on others' content through the STEMedia branch of mSchool platform.</li>

<i>Development stage</i> 
EdLab has already been developing educational technology products that can be utilized in the STEMedia program. We would be implementing Edlab products such as Vialogues, EdDias, Ednode, etc. 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>

STEMedia fits into the EdLab product portfolio as a branch of mSchool. It is a specialized program for STEM teachers AND Liberal Arts teachers to capitalize on the mSchool platform — and corresponding EdLab tools — to engage the 6-8 audience in creating and sharing educational content. In effect, the 6-8 audience will assume the responsibilities of accurately and effectively communicating STEM concepts to their peers. The educational artifacts that are produced as a result of STEMedia efforts will subsequently trigger rounded discussions about STEM disciplines not only as a subject and knowledge-set, but as applied to society.
