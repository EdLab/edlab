          <p>
            As part of my campaign for equity, I'll post my original research ideas with those of others :P  They are from a few weeks back and thus haven't been influenced by the input from the seminar yet.
They're vague, but outline the central concepts I find interesting.

<ol type="a">Research of Broader Ideas
	<li>  Defining "Social"
<ol type="i">
		<li>  Definition 1: Closeness of online networks to real world networks.  If I'm a member, are the folks I eat lunch with as well?  (Hard to measure and defined to deny the idea of "true" social connections existing online.  Traditional.</li>
		<li> Definition 2: "Interconnectedness"  The connections in the network between nodes like user and comment.  Accounts for amount of commenting, users listed in private communities (which are, ironically, perhaps more social by this definition than public ones).   Simplistic.</li>
		<li>  New definition of "social connection:"  A and B are connected if A reads B's work and B reads A's - forget comments, forget private communities, forget emails.  This definition allows for potentially anonymous information sharing, so long as it is a two way street.  This single condition prevents "free-riders" from being considered "social" and models old information sharing relationships like you may have had with the local store owner at one point in history.  Rooted in the notion that sociality is largely driven by information seeking.  Brand spanking new definition - viva la EdLab.</li>
		<li>  Definition 3: Structural similarity to "true" social networks.  Using the new definition of a social connection, we might ask if the "small-world" dynamics - recently argued to be ubiquitous among people - arise.  Principally, one should investigate average path length and degree of clustering within the network.  Brand spanking new definition - viva la EdLab.</li></ol></li>
	<li>Analyzing PK's Success as Social Software under the rubrics listed above.  
	<ol type="i">
<li> Where and why do differences arise in evaluations between the rubrics?</li>
		<li> How did PK do?  Perhaps comparisons to other software if the data is available.</li></ol></li>
	<li>Growth Patterns
<ol type="i">
		<li> How does information about PK disseminate?  Do user sign-ups bottleneck?  </li></ol></li>
	<li>What's New (and Meaningful) About Web 2.0, and How Might We Test PK on This Trait?
		<ol type="i"><li>  Self-Government!  No longer do librarians control the information of the world!  Consider PK's Author-Wiki:  The information entered here is purely by the community for the benefit of all.  Even adding descriptions to one's own profile, communities, or author items reflects a desire for others to see this information.  Thus this is a principally social endeavor.  Furthermore, truly social interactions utilize norms.  One could inspect (qualitatively) the cohesion of descriptions by form, vernacular, specific content addressed (do we always mention where someone did their undergraduate work?), etc.  This is shaky and needs to be able to beat the baseline similarity predicted by basic cognition and linguistics, but could be nonetheless interesting.</li>
		<li>  Occurrence of regulatory actions:  Basic social theory from sociology, psychology, cognitive science and biology all attest the need for punitive measures in maintaining a variety (if not all) norms.  For any system to be considered social, it must be shown that users joined (in comments, in emails, etc.) to punish a defector.  Consider rankings in most sites, the decision to charge brokers on craigslist, the common occurrence of "flaming" and the subsequent retaliations, etc.</li>
		<li>  Folksonomies:  User driven sites also allow users to tag items without references a predetermined library of tags.  This creates a great deal of freedom which seems "natural" and "social."  Members of the information technology sector are currently worried to enraged about this feature of Web 2.0.  

Idea 1:  First we could look at how much of a problem this really is in an academic repository.  One simple analysis is to have trained professionals review tags for similarity (0 for no, 1 for yes).  For example, "economic" is close to "economics," "free rider problem" is close to the "public goods dilemma," none of these is close to "programmed cell death."  One can then calculate the "unnecessarily variance" in folksonomies (the fear of librarians) by measuring (# close tags) / (# total tags) across files, cliques, or the whole system.

Idea 2:  In reality, large degrees of variety are completely unnatural in social settings.  Members of the same clique have similar modes of speech, accents, and lexicons.  This not only aids communication but, more importantly, defines group membership in a subtle way which is hard to mimic for a true outsider.  Close social behavior is as well defined by those we do not speak with as those we do.  Another test for "true" sociality is to test for norms via tag similarity with clique (literately a mathematical clique within the network).  Does PK meet this standard?  Does any site?
