            "Today [...] because knowledge is available on every Internet-connected device, what you know matters far less than what you can do with what you know. The capacity to innovate -- the ability to solve problems creatively or bring new possibilities to life -- and skills like critical thinking, communication and collaboration are far more important than academic knowledge. As one executive told me, 'We can teach new hires the content, and we will have to because it continues to change, but we can't teach them how to think -- to ask the right questions -- and to take initiative,'" <a href=”http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/opinion/sunday/friedman-need-a-job-invent-it.html?_r=3&3”>Tony Wagner</a>.

This strikes me as a very interesting point, especially because it is about what we need to know to understand things–how do we learn to think? In this short comment, Wagner captures a central question for education entrepreneurs: what is the end goal of the projects, products and innovations we are developing? If we imagine creating a toy that teaches children to learn how to code, how does the toy also encourage students to take initiative, collaborate and innovate? 

I offer a few thoughts, putting on my philosopher hat, that I hope will be helpful to the Ed Tech community in thinking about how we learn to think. Diverging a bit from Wagner, I believe knowledge plays an important role in our ability to innovate and think and we do learn knowledge in schools. But knowledge clearly isn't everything, which is I think the more important claim Wagner is making in this article. 

Reaching a ways back to think about knowledge versus thinking critically, its apparent this is not a new idea.  Montaigne, in his Essays, is adamant throughout that education must aim to make students “well-formed,” not only “well-filled.” He writes, “Let both [outcomes] be looked for, “but place character and intelligence before knowledge; and let [the teacher] carry out his responsibilities in a new way” (source: Hansen, David T. (2002). Well-formed, not well-filled: Montaigne and the paths of personhood. Educational Theory 52 (2):127-154.) 

Montaigne sees content and knowledge are important, but intelligence and character are what allow us to know what to do with that knowledge. Understanding how ancient this view is helps us think about how others and how now we, in our modern times, can continue to engage in the difficult project of teaching students to think. 

In the last sentence Tony Wagner quotes a CEO who says he is looking for employees who know how to think, a rare thing to find. Perhaps employers have always felt this way, but as Tony Wagner highlights above, as jobs are increasingly replaced with machines and computers, the new sometimes potentially unknown future jobs, will require more of an ability to think--an educational question plaguing society for hundreds and thousands of years but seems (as it most likely often does) it is a question that is all the more pressing now. How can the Ed Tech world revolutionize how students learn to think?
