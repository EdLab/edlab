<p><a href="http://www.stopdisastersgame.org/en/home.html">Stop Disasters</a> is an educational game, created by the <a href="http://www.unisdr.org/">UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction</a> (UNISDR), which simulates natural disasters in order to raise awareness of disaster prevention. The game is available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and French, and it is appropriately simple for its target audience of 9- to 16-year-olds to play and understand. The rationale for focusing on this age range is that when disaster strikes, children are one of the most vulnerable groups, and it is important for them to learn about the risks posed by natural hazards and the preventative steps which can save lives.</p>

<p>The game offers the option to run through five different types of disasters—tsunami, earthquake, wild fire, hurricane, flood—at three different levels of difficulty. Each challenge scenario is presented as a pre-populated sim map, which gets larger and more complex as the difficulty level increases. Each square of the map has clickable options and an info button that provides advice or a general risk assessment of the area. Players are provided with a limited budget to develop shelters and defenses against the impending disaster. Each challenge has a few set goals, but players decide how to develop the land. There are only five available environments at present, though the UNISDR is seeking sponsors to develop more scenarios for gameplay.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game itself is easy to play and engaging. There is an ostensible time limit until the disaster strikes in each challenge, but players can keep building until they have used up the budget or click the "Start Disaster" button to end the challenge early. The disasters aren’t specific to actual historical events, but they don’t feel generic. Key facts are available throughout game and players earn points for discovering them all, which encourages clicking the info buttons. Advice—good and bad—is proffered during the game, and players must choose whether to heed it, providing practice in critical thinking and source evaluation. The game also has a separate section for teacher resources on each type of disaster, as well as videos of kids talking about the effects of disasters on their own lives.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The directional controls are limited, which makes moving around the map somewhat awkward. The results are also a little opaque: players are given an overview after the disaster strikes, but no feedback on the success or failure of specific choices made during the game. Repeat play, using different strategies, might shed more light on the effectiveness of the choices made—and the chance to end up on the high score page may be enough to keep players coming back to each challenge.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Obviously, the subject matter is grim: death and destruction are always potential outcomes. Still, Stop Disasters manages to avoid trivializing the subject matter while remaining entertaining enough for players to want to revisit it. For the game to be a useful classroom exercise, it might be best to scaffold it with related readings or other lessons. On its own, the game is effective at getting across the key message that simple measures—such as maintaining natural defenses like mangroves, sand dunes, wetlands, etc.—are often enough to save lives. It is a good outreach effort on the part of the UNISDR to raise awareness among the younger generation who are "the future architects, mayors, doctors, and parents of the world of tomorrow."</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>  
<p>Stop Disasters may not actually be able to stop disasters from happening, but if children are able to learn about the way our choices shape the outcomes of natural events, then the game has succeeded.</p>
