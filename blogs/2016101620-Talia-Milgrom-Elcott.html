Talia Milgrom-Elcott is the Executive Director and Co-founder of <a href="https://100kin10.org">100Kin10</a>. Prior to founding 100Kin10, Milgrom-Elcott was a Program Officer in Urban Education and the Senior Manager of STEM Teacher Initiatives at the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Prior to that, Milgrom-Elcott worked at the New York City Department of Education as part of Chancellor Joel Klein’s team, where she supported the design and implementation of system-wide reform efforts. She received her BA and JD, both magna cum laude, from Harvard University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role at 100Kin10?</b><br>
<p>I went to law school with the lofty aspirations of someone who had studied <i>Brown v Board</i> and adulated the Warren Court. I believed the law was the critical tool for addressing the major social challenges of our time. I soon came to realize that by the time a lawyer or a court ever saw a problem, it was already full-blown, a <i>case and controversy</i> already fully baked. I wanted to get to the issues further upstream by dealing with the underlying root causes.</p>

<p>Education, of course, is the key root cause for many social issues, and if we could get at kids when they are bundles of opportunity and potential and help them find and realize their own strengths, we would solve a lot of the downstream social ills like poverty, violence, and inequality. Before I moved full-time to education, I spent two years engaged in law-related work. The first was with a small organizing outfit called <a href="http://www.jwj.org">Jobs with Justice</a>, where I was the only lawyer on staff and got a deep dive into the power of organizing and connected with a cross-sector group of leaders from labor, religion, business, and academia who were all committed to furthering economic equality. The second was clerking for Judge Robert Sack of the Federal Second Circuit of Appeals, where I saw legal controversies at their purest form and reinvigorated my commitment to the potency of the English language. While the rest of my colleagues went on to Supreme Court clerkships and prestigious firms, I jumped ship to work with Joel Klein at the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/default.htm">New York City Department of Education</a> and then with Michele Cahill at <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a>. They were my two greatest mentors in the education space. However, as with all great teachers, with distance and perspective, I have come to clarify my own understanding of some issues in a way that differs from theirs.</p>

<p>One final thought has been on my mind a lot now as a parent of young kids. Growing up, my mom was a Rabbi in a community that didn’t accept women Rabbis. I was an insider/outsider, a participant-observer. Though often uncomfortable and at times excruciating ("If your mom is a Rabbi, what’s your dad? A common housewife?"), my insider/outsider status might be the most important thing I took away from my formal education. It was liberating as I could do things differently than other people and challenge their assumptions. I was lucky to feel profoundly known at home and learned to rely on myself and my family while maintaining a certain distance and independence from the expectations of others. I have no doubt that almost everything I have done since my youth is a tribute to the ability to ask questions and see things that others weren’t seeing. Knowing and being fully supported by the people who mattered most to me, I felt that I might just do something worth doing. Many years later, my husband shared with me Kurt Vonnegut’s afterword to <i>Free to be You and Me</i>, which captured this idea beautifully.</p> 

<p>He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
A first grader should understand that his or her culture isn’t a rational invention; that there are thousands of other cultures and they all work pretty well; that all cultures function on faith rather than truth; that there are lots of alternatives to our society. Cultural relativity is defensible and attractive. It’s also a source of hope. It means we don’t have to continue this way if we don’t like it.
</blockquote></p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at 100Kin10 will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>In building the 100Kin10 model, we’ve taken inspiration from a range of approaches including design thinking, behavioral economics, organizing, movement building, and collective impact. But because we are trying to do something that is relatively uncharted, we are also constantly tweaking, combining, and innovating at the edges of whatever we are learning. There are a few key elements that are hallmarks of 100Kin10 and we are honored to see other efforts point to and adapt for their own work, including:</p> 
<ol>
<li>requiring that everyone who wants to participate make a bold, measurable, and unique commitment to advancing the goal, </li>
<li>intentionally inviting both likely and unlikely allies and approaches, </li>
<li>putting trust at the center, because no one will learn from anyone else if they can’t be vulnerable, and vulnerability requires trust, and </li>
<li>putting problem-solving at the center, both at the individual organizational level, which we do through our design-based problem-solving fellowship; at the network level, which we do through solution labs, opportunities for large numbers of partners to come together to collectively address or bring to market a shared solution; and at the field level, which we are doing by mapping the major impediments or <i>grand challenges</i> to excellent STEM teaching. </li>
</ol></p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The past 15 years or so have seen a microscopic focus on the student, her learning, and the influence the classroom teacher has on it. I am a deep believer in the power of teachers and teaching to change a child’s life trajectory. I have seen it firsthand and heard countless stories. But I think we have narrowed our focus on just the classroom to the detriment of the whole child and the whole community and we are going to see an effort over the coming years to correct for this hyperfocus. For example, there is new research in neuroscience that helps us better understand the effects of poverty on brain functioning. It is transforming how we are thinking about the role of schools and teaching and the importance of other community interventions, psycho-social, medical, and environmental, for our kids to be successful human beings and successful learners.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of this hyperfocus on teachers (and the associated shaming of teachers for students’ struggles), we have seen a decade-long run of trying our best to supplant teachers with personalized technology that could better help students learn. The thinking went something like, "Well, maybe we can’t get 3–4 million excellent teachers in classrooms, so let’s stop trying and instead <i>disrupt</i> the classroom model with technology interventions." My instinct is we are again seeing a correction, moving closer to the supplement-not-supplant approach pioneered by the likes of IBM’s Watson to support doctors, enhanced-technology features in cars like automatic braking to support drivers, and data-based policing. In all of these examples, the human beings are elevated as expert and supported with seamlessly integrated data that enhances instead of replaces their expertise.</p>

<p>I think we are seeing a rightful shift to the student as the driver, and not just consumer, of her learning. The ascendance of Montessori approaches (my own children attend a Montessori school), the penetration of student-based design teams, and the influence more broadly of design thinking on the education sector are all signals of a shift toward the student as the centerpiece of learning; an agent, not an object.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at 100Kin10, what are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>100Kin10 <i>is</i> my next big project. Earlier this year, we announced with President Obama that we are on track to meet the goal of 100,000 excellent STEM teachers on time, by 2021. Although there is undoubtedly plenty of work to deliver on the commitments our partners have made to the 100,000 goal, the fact of being on track opened up the space for our team to think beyond the numeric goal and to the challenges that make getting excellent STEM teachers into every classroom so hard in this country. Most people take it as a political reality that getting great teachers is hard, but why should it be? Educating the next generation is among the handful of fundamental requirements of a functioning civilization, yet this country struggles to deliver on that promise for every child.</p>

<p>So 100Kin10, working with hundreds of partners, thousands of teachers, and leaders across the sector, has taken on mapping the grand challenges and root causes of achieving 100,000 excellent STEM teachers. We have a draft map, our third version, out for comment now, as we continue to learn and iterate, and expect to share the map and potential action steps publicly in early 2017. Having committed ourselves to catalyzing the response to the goal of 100,000 excellent STEM teachers in 10 years, we are now pivoting to not only deliver on that but to name and begin to address the knottiest of the root causes that have made this challenge so hard in this country for such a long time.</p>

<p>When I’m not thinking about 100Kin10, I am hanging out with my husband and our three amazing young daughters, climbing in playgrounds, swimming in our local public pool, and heading out on adventures.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I am not on Twitter or Facebook and I have only one email address. Also, I have taken a page from my 96-year-old grandfather, an early and avid news junkie, who realized several decades ago that the daily fluctuations and curiosities that are the currency of daily papers are lost over the course of a year and moved exclusively to monthly and quarterly magazines. On that note, my husband curates the best articles for me. I get a pile of New Yorker pieces cut out and left on my bedside table. I have not seen a New Yorker cover since our second child was born. This means I can sometimes go days without knowing about a major news event, which can become awkward. But the upside is I have all of this free time and brain space to devote to things that matter to me. It is part of how I keep my life sane. But I do not live in a vacuum, in part due to my husband’s devastatingly good curatorial skills and in part because I am privileged to be part of an amazing network of women called The List, whose members continue to inspire me with their innovations, experiments, personal and professional bravery, and field-breaking prowess. The brilliant Nilofer Merchant is putting finishing touches on her book Onlyness, "that thing that only that one individual can bring to a situation," which has a section on the work of 100Kin10. Christine Wallace just wrote a profound essay in Elle about the moral and personal tensions we confront at the loss of an abusive parent. I will also read anything Adam Gopnik, Elizabeth Kolbert, or Roger Angell write.</p>
