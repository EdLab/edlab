<a href ="http://www.energyville.com/">Energyville</a> is an online web game that lets you control how you power up your own city (which you can name!), using different energy sources. The way the game is structured reminds me of <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a> (which I used to play all the time), the difference is that there is much more information on the different types of power sources you can use to power up your city, and fuel your vehicles. For every type of power plants you add to your city, there is a different effect on your city's economy, environment, and security impact level. The goals are to fully power up your city so you can go to the next level, and keep your impact levels low to get a higher score. There are three levels in this game. Between levels, certain events happen in your city that either raises your economy, environment, and security impact levels, or lowers them.

<b>Pros:</b> This simulation game is very informative and children playing this game can learn a lot about the different types of energy and their effects on a city.  It looks like the designers of this game were inspired by SimCity. The visual design of the city looks very beautiful and clean like something that will draw in users to playing this game. The fact that there are levels in the game gives the player an incentive to continue playing (reaching the next level). There's also a sort of social aspect in this game, in which you can challenge your friends. I think the most important aspect is the fact that this game sheds more light on energy sources, and gives the user a chance to learn more about them in a game setting.

<b>Cons:</b> I thought this game was a bit short. I know it's a free game meant to inform the user about energy sources, but adding a few more levels would be nice. I also wish the game was a bit more challenging as I breezed through this game in about 10 minutes. I wish the game had an increasing difficulty as you go from level to level.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This game is a lot like <a href ="http://budgethero.gather.com/">Budget Hero</a>, as both are simulation games based on serious issues we have in our country (energy and national debt respectively), and both were created to spread understanding about these issues. Energyville seemed to have much more information in every component of the game than Budget Hero. These simulation games are very popular, and who know maybe EdLab can have one about the library (It would be challenging to make an interesting game out of that).

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> When thinking about making a educational simulation game, I think you need to have the right balance of information and challenge factors. Make a game informative, but not so much so that it seems like the user is reading a book. Also keeping the game interesting by increasing the difficulty of each level, but not too difficult to make the user quit halfway through. It seems this game didn't seem to have much of a challenge factor (or maybe I'm just a really good player :P).
