Vlada Lotkina is a co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.classtag.com/">Classtag</a>, a parent-teacher platform that allows teachers to organize events, schedule conferences, and launch newsletter campaigns to maintain open communication with parents. An experienced tech executive and management consultant, Lotkina has worked at Fortune 500 Tech Companies and the Boston Consulting Group. She holds an MBA from Wharton Business School. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at ClassTag?</b><br>
I started ClassTag because I realized that there were only two things that made me successful in my journey from Ukraine to one of the top business schools in the U.S. (Wharton) and a successful corporate career thereafter. These two things were access to a good education, and the amazing support I received from my family.</p>

<p>The combination of these two factors is defining for one's career and life and I wanted every child, including my own, to grow confident, self-aware, and ready to take on whatever challenges they have ahead. ClassTag is helping teachers and parents do just that: become partners in every child's success.</p> 
 
<p><b>What has the response been from teachers and parents who have used ClassTag?</b><br>
The issue of parent engagement is not a new one. In fact, there are decades of research suggesting how important support from parents is; yet it is not happening for most children. The reason is that this problem is not easy to solve.</p>

<p>On one side, parents are overwhelmed by school communications that are often fragmented, or not timely, relevant, or clear enough to act upon. On the other side, teachers and administration are very busy, with hundreds of things they need to complete, and parent communication is only one of them. Teachers often don't hear back from parents, get discouraged, and give up.</p>

<p>All of these issues get more complicated when you add lack of Internet or smart phone access for many families, as well as language barriers, negative past experiences, etc. ClassTag's approach is to attack the reasons for the lacking parent engagement from the ground up. That's what makes it effective and successful.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
We live in an exciting time, when the speed of change is enormous. One of the most eye-opening things for me is that many of the high-demand and promising jobs in the future are the jobs we don't even know today. This represents a huge challenge of preparing children for the jobs we don't know.</p>

<p>To me, what this calls for is a strong emphasis on social and emotional learning, learning how to learn, nurturing school community, and a variety of role models for the children. It means schools would need to become "community hubs" focused on growing lifelong learners. Support from parents is paramount in this future.</p>
 
<p><b>In addition to ClassTag, what else are you working on?</b><br>
ClassTag keeps me busy. It is more than a tool, it is a community and we work relentlessly to bring the best ideas to our community to support parent engagement.</p>
