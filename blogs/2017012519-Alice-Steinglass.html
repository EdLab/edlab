<p>Alice Steinglass runs the product, engineering, and marketing teams at <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>. Her team partners with education and software companies across the industry to run the Hour of Code, a global movement that reaches millions of students in over 180 countries. Prior to Code.org, Steinglass managed the Project Management (PM) team for the User Experience (UX) Platform on HoloLens, designed APIs and developer client libraries for Xbox 360, ran an ecosystem outreach and UX team for Windows, and built project management tools.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Code.org?</b><br>
<p>I majored in computer science in college. I loved it and I love having the opportunity to share these skills with millions of students around the world.</p>

<p>After college, I worked on a number of different software projects from entertainment (Xbox), to productivity (project management software), to new technologies (VR and augmented reality). In all of these projects, I observed first-hand the lack of diversity in the tech workforce. When I learned that most schools don’t even teach computer science, I realized the lack of opportunity starts early. I started volunteering in schools. Through this experience, I found teachers who were excited to offer computer science in their classrooms but didn’t know where to start and students who couldn’t wait to make their first app or game.</p>

<p>Code.org offers these teachers curriculum, professional development, and support to bring computer science into their classrooms. My background in the tech industry helps me build software to support our teachers, but more importantly it helps me see why these tools are important.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Code.org will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Most schools today don’t teach computer science. Meanwhile, our lives are transformed by technology, apps, and the internet. No matter what career path they choose, every student should have the opportunity to understand how the internet works. It’s incredibly empowering to realize you can create apps and not just use them.</p>

<p>This is particularly important for improving diversity in the tech industry. Studies show that girls and underrepresented minorities are 8 to 10 times more likely to major in computer science if they have the opportunity to try it in high school. That makes sense. I remember feeling out of place surrounded by guys who had taken apart computers for fun since they were children. I loved creating apps and solving puzzles with code, but I didn’t enjoy installing operating systems on my computer or trying to somehow figure out how to print to the network printer. Honestly, who does? It took a computer science class to understand that these are not the same things at all! In 15 years in a tech job, I’ve never had to take a computer apart for my job.</p>

<p>But, computer science gave me the tools to create apps and solve interesting problems. I’m hoping our work will inspire new students not only in K–12, but also in university and beyond.</p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Teachers are looking for ways to empower their students to be active learners. They would like their students to approach education with an inquiry mindset and build/create. Computer science dovetails well with these movements in education. Learning computer science is a hands-on subject area where students learn by doing. Creating software is an endless loop of analyzing a problem, trying a solution, testing, and improving.</p>  

<p>Most of the teachers in our classrooms have never had a formal computer science education. They are encouraging their students to ask questions and learning along with them. They model an inquiry mindset as the lead learners in their classrooms. Through this process, they encourage their students to question, test, and try different solutions to solve their problems.</p>
 
<p><b>Apart from your role at Code.org, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>In my previous jobs, my side project was always teaching, either volunteering in classrooms or helping refugees learn English. In coming to Code.org, I was able to make my side project my main project. I’m incredibly lucky that my personal passion is also my job. Also, with three little ones at home, I don’t find I have much time for additional projects. It’s not exciting, but I spend my free time grocery shopping or playing dolls with my three-year-old.</p>
