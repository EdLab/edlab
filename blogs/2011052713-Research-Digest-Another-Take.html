            <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1177220?seq=9">Hedges, L., Laine, R., Greenwald, R. (1994). Does Money Matter?  A Meta-Analysis of Studies of the Effects of Differential School Inputs on Student Outcomes. Educational Researcher, 23(3), 5-14</a>

In another follow-up from my original post, today I'm going to talk about an exchange between Hanushek and a group of authors over his paper “The Economics of Schooling” I discussed earlier.  In Part I of the exchange, Hedges, Laine, and Greenwald take issue with Hanushek's conclusion that there's no evidence that more spending helps students learn. 
<!--break-->
Review:
They claim that Hanushek's method for doing a meta-analysis of the group of studies under discussion (vote-counting) is not sophisticated enough to draw reliable conclusions, and that the conclusions he does draw are implausible.  “For example,” they write, “if PPE and educational outcome were truly unrelated in every study, 50% of the studies would be expected to obtain positive relations and 50% negative relations by change.  In addition, only 5% of the studies would obtain results that were statistically significant, with that 5% evenly divided between positive and negative relations.  For the portion of Hanushek's data in which the direction could be determined, far greater percentages of the results were positive (as much as 70%, in the case of PPE) than one would expect from change alone.  Moreover, a far great percentage of all of his coefficients are statistically significant.” 

To draw more accurate conclusions from the data, these authors applied “combined significance tests and combined estimation methods.”  First, they begin by carving away problematic studies to create (hopefully) a more representative collection.  They correct for outliers, disproportionally represented models, etc.  Then, with the “combined significance test,” which, as one would expect, combines the significance values of a variety of studies, they conclude: “These data imply that over all the studies, with the few exceptions noted above [teacher/pupil ratio and facilities], there are at least some positive relations between each of the types of educational resource inputs studied and student outcome.”  

Now the question becomes “how strong is that relation?  How much bang can I get for my buck?”  Their effect size analysis, which, for my level of knowledge is similarly self-explanatory, finds positive strong effects for both PPE and teacher experience.  “An increase of PPE by $500 (approximately 10% of the national average)” they write, “would be associated with a 0.7 standard deviation increase in student outcome.”  

Relevance:
I found the discussion of potential problems in their approach unconvincing.  They were forced, due to the limitations of their method, to remove all studies with nonsignificant results of unknown signs, precisely those studies most supportive of Hanushek's conclusion. They believe that publication bias might have an effect in either direction, whereas it seems more likely to me that it would bias the results in their favored direction.  There are other, even more boring issues.

So I have not shaken the feeling that they may be bamboozling me.  There is something strange in the way that they can only say that spending more money helps, without being able to say that, in general, spending money on this or that will help.  On the other hand, even if they were to adjust for all my uninformed caveats, it seems probable that the end result would be somewhere between Hanushek's “PPE has no effect” and their “PPE has a very strong effect.”
