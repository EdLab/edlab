<a href ="http://thinkingblocks.com/index.html"> Thinking Blocks</a> is a free math learning tool that lets the user use blocks to visualize solutions to basic math problems from topics like addition, multiplication, fractions, and ratio. Through these games, students learn how to model each math problem, as well as identify known and unknown quantities. The problems become increasingly complex so students can develop the reasoning skills they need to transition from arithmetic to algebra.

<b>Pros:</b> This website has a lot of bright colors, which will draw in more of the younger learners. There are five problems in each subtopic which enables the learner to have a good amount of practice for one subtopic before moving on to the next one. The problems get more complicated as you go from one subtopic to another, and you have a good amount of choices for subtopics. There is a random option which mixes up the sub-topics and can be used if the user wants to mix things up! The fact that it is a free math learning tool on a website and not a mobile app means more students will have access to it, since not all students have access to iPads, and iPods, etc. This means that students can access this learning tool in computer labs at school or the library if they do not have access to a computer at home.

<b>Cons:</b> The design of the website is a bit confusing at first. When I picked a topic at the top of the site, it brought me to a screen where I can select a subtopic as well as other options. At first, I had no idea that you can select a subtopic and hope they will clarify the fact that you have the option of picking a subtopic. They could design the page in steps so the user has a better understanding of how to select topics. For example, step one would be to pick your topic, step two would be to turn on/off the progress tracking option, and step 3 is the “Begin” button.  It took me a while to find the “Begin” button, mostly because they were the same size as the other options (watch video, view progress), and on the bottom of the screen. My suggestion would be to have the “Begin” button bigger and bolder than the others so it stands out.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> This is a useful online tool that can help students transition from the straight forward arithmetic to more complex algebraic problems. It helps students understand what exactly these types of questions are asking, and how to go about finding the solution for it step by step. Students have an easier time solving these types of problems with diagrams rather than using numbers and equation.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> From what I read on the EdLab blog, there was a math app created called Math Maze, I'm not sure if this has been done before but I was thinking we can try to make a web based learning tool, or game even. More students and parents would be able to access it, and we can have more people become aware of the EdLab. On the site, we can other advertise other games or apps we might have like Math Maze or maybe more complex learning tools that requires a purchase.
