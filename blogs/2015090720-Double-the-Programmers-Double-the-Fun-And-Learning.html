<p>Pair programming is a type of agile software development where two programmers work together using a single screen: usually, one person acts as a driver and does the actual writing, while the other—the navigator—observes and offers additional expertise to ensure logic and process flexibility. Pair programming increases the effectiveness and experience of each person involved and is therefore a widely used methodology in software development, but might programming as part of a team also help facilitate student learning? A recent study in <i>Education and Information Technologies</i> set out to explore pair programming as a teaching method and test the association between pair programming and student satisfaction, sense of accomplishment, and knowledge gain. Fifty-six Master of Computer Application students participated in the study, and the researchers evaluated the effectiveness of pair programming on the students' overall learning process. </p>
 
<p>Several students volunteered to act as solo programmers, while the rest worked in pairs that frequently shifted roles and changed partners. The programming exercises were systematic and executed across separate lab sessions; for each session, students had to record their individual experiences as well as write appropriate code for each problem. Overall, the students who worked as part of a pair reported that the experience didn't make them feel inhibited at all, and in fact helped them work through multiple solution pathways to master the concepts. Researchers observed frequent contradictions between pairs of students working through the exercises, but the disagreements didn't affect students' sense of accomplishment or their perceptions of knowledge improvement. More importantly, though, is that the students also gained considerable knowledge through pair programming—unlike earlier studies, the experience led to actual learning outcomes, not just the perception of them.</p>
 
<p>Although pair programming can lead to unintended complications—some students expressed concern over the composition of teams, and incompatibility is always a risk—the technique has enormous potential to enhance computer science coursework. Furthermore, even though computer science is not often characterized as a collaborative field, real world software development requires a great deal of cooperation, communication, and teamwork. Pair programming in the classroom not only gives students a solid foundation of technical knowledge, but it also prepares them to shine as part of the modern workplace. </p>
