            The majority of citizens in most developing nations (and some developed nations), especially those in Asia and Africa, will soon live in cities. This is the result of several factors: cities as hubs of innovation, culture, employment opportunities and education. According to the <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/pds/urbanization.htm">UN Population Fund</a>, by 2030, nearly five billion of the global population will live in urban areas. The growth of urbanization has not been restricted to traditional major cities, but rather it is happening in smaller towns and cities. <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21600797-2030-chinese-cities-will-be-home-about-1-billion-people-getting-urban-china-work">The Economist</a> recently issued a special report on the rapid urbanization currently occurring in China, where nearly 70% of the total population will be urbanites by 2030. Though the report highlighted several problems that Chinese cities will face (e.g. increased pollution and social hostilities), Chinese officials are hopeful that increased urbanization will spur economic growth and opportunities for citizens. This <a href="http://countriesquest.com/north_america/usa/people/urbanization_of_america/growth_of_cities.htm">piece</a> chronicles the history of urbanization in America. 

I've lived in cities all my life so I understand most of the benefits and challenges facing cities. In Ghana, I lived in the capital Accra, a bustling city of over two million inhabitants. In a country with different ethnic groups, religions, cultures and languages, Accra represented (and presented) every aspect of Ghanaian culture. A lot of people from villages and smaller towns all over the country migrate to Accra on a regular basis in search of opportunities. In most developing countries, the vast majority of employment opportunities are usually in major cities, especially the capital. Accra is home to one of Africa's major universities (Legon), and several Western companies have offices there. However, there are a host of problems currently facing the city: homelessness is rampant, streets are overcrowded and traffic is a major headache. 

What are some ways we can teach urbanization in the classroom? What are the implications for development, especially in poor countries?
