            <blockquote style="margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;line-height:1.6em;"><p><span style="font-size:0.875rem;">Imagine walking out of a grocery store with four bags of groceries, dropping one in the parking lot, and just not bothering to pick it up. That’s essentially what we’re doing.”<br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size:0.875rem;">- Dana Gunders</span></p><p></p></blockquote><h5>Food Waste</h5><p>On average and across the globe, humans throw out approximately one third of the food that we grow--and in wealthier countries such as the United States, this proportion is even higher, at around 40 percent. Of course, the etiology of this phenomenon is complex and multi-faceted. In part, though not exhaustively, individuals and organizations purchase more food than they can eat; in part, global and national logistics systems mean that food doesn't get to a consumer in time to still make it on the shelf; in part, shallow appearance standards force grocery stores to throw out many edible fruits and vegetables; and in part, ours is a consumer capitalist culture that normalizes excess.</p><p><br />It is unacceptable that in the face of this profligacy, much of the world contends daily with chronic food insecurity. Equally troubling is the immense environmental impact of food waste, which when sent to landfills generates harmful emissions--so much so in fact that if food waste were its own country, it would be the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, behind only China and the United States. The moral imperative to act on food waste is thus a strong one.</p><p><br />I mention all of this by way of introduction to the most immediate, albeit bandaid solution, to at least the environmental costs: compost.</p><p><br /></p><h5>Compost</h5><p>In New York City, food waste comprises 21 percent of the waste stream, adding to the previously mentioned moral costs an additional logistical challenge, namely the transportation and management of unnecessary waste from some 8 million people.</p><p><br /></p><p>Fortunately, composting is an easy and effective alternative.</p><p><br /></p><p>What's more, through <a href="https://www.grownyc.org/" target="_blank">GrowNYC</a>, the organization that across the city runs the popular Green Market, residents are able to drop off their food scraps at collection sites, circumnavigating the logistical challenges that otherwise depress residential composting rates.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some more information from their website:</p><ul><li><span style="font-size:0.875rem;"><i>What happens to food scraps dropped off?</i></span><b style="font-size:0.875rem;"> </b><span style="font-size:0.875rem;">Your household food scraps will be transported to one of several NYC compost sites to be transformed into a fertile soil amendment for use on local urban farming and gardening projects.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:0.875rem;"><i>What can I bring to the food scrap collection sites?</i></span><span style="font-size:0.875rem;"> </span><span style="font-size:0.875rem;">Accepted materials include fruit and vegetable scraps, non-greasy food scraps (rice, pasta, bread, cereal etc.), coffee grounds &amp; filters, tea bags, egg and nut shells, pits, cut or dried flowers, houseplants and potting soil. (</span><span style="font-size:0.875rem;">Please NO meat, chicken, fish, greasy food scraps, fat, oil, dairy, animal waste, litter or bedding, coal or charcoal, coconuts, diseased and/or insect-infested houseplants/soil or biodegradable/compostable plastics.)</span></li></ul><p>So here's what I suggest:</p><ol><li>Check out the <a href="https://www.grownyc.org/compost/locations" target="_blank">collection site nearest you</a>.</li><li>Procure some yogurt containers or paper bags to store your scraps (keeping them in the freezer works well).</li><li>And continue doing your part to reduce impact. For example, consider changing your diet to rely less on meat, performing an informal food waste audit at home, and making more intentional decisions about what you buy and in what quantities you buy it.</li></ol><p><br /></p><p></p><h4>EdLab</h4><p></p><p></p><ul></ul><p></p><p>Finally, I'd like to float the idea that EdLab should start composting food waste, too. With a bucket in the kitchen, we could divert individual scraps and scraps from seminars, meetings, and other gatherings away from the landfill and to compost operations. (Paper plates and napkins are thankfully compostable as well, so there is reason to compost even with limited food waste in play.) Likewise, it might be interesting to perform a food audit here, to see what happens to food purchased for seminars, for example, and get a better sense of the degree of need here.</p><p><br /></p><p>There is also the possibility of composting paper towels from bathrooms, which some especially environmentally conscious schools in Colorado's Boulder Valley School District do.</p><p><br /></p><p>Logistically, I would volunteer to take scraps collected at EdLab to the Thursday Green Market at Columbia. However, I will also check with TC to see if they run commercial composting operations already, which if they did could accept meat products forbidden from the residential stream. At risk of proselytizing, I might also advocate for cutting in half the amount of meat products we purchase for all-staff gatherings, as meat has an huge environmental impact--and for many people, a moral one, too.</p><p><br /></p><p>Food for thought, as it were.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote>Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.<br />- Michael Pollan</blockquote>
