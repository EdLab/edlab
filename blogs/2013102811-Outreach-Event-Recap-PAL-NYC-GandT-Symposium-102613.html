            Private! 

This past Saturday, Jo, Brian, Hui Soo and I participated in the first <a href="http://palworkshopsnyc.org/">Parent's of Accelerated Learners NYC Gifted & Talented Symposium</a> at NYU's Kimmel Center.  

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58572505@N04/10537698435/" title="photo 1 by CuriousBrooklyn, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/10537698435_a20b652ccb_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="photo 1"></a>
Brian w/ the official symposium signage... (we are on there - somewhere!) 

<b>Arrival & Setup</b>
We were asked to arrive at 7:30 to set-up (which we did), however, the organizers were not prepared for us to arrive and setup at that time.  We killed time in the Washington Square Park area (a good place to have to do this) and finally were able to enter and setup around 8ish.  We were then confused to find the event spread over 5th & 10th floor spaces in the already confusing Kimmel Center space.  Once we finally checked-in on the 5th floor (we were told to have email confirmations ready to present - yet no-one checked these) after being told to go to the 10th, we finally found friendly staff who didn't seem to know where we were supposed to go.  

After identifying our "airport" table ourselves (really a high 2x2' round bar table) near the stage we began our setup.  Thanks to the highly organized design team, setup was a snap!  Beautiful, easy to assemble signage, printed cards and a bright red table cloth really set the "stage." (our table was definitely the best looking on the floor!)

</b>Participants</b>
Other participants on the Edtech showcase arrived throughout the AM (with some conspicuously missing).  One of the least professional elements of the event was the signage.  After sending the organizers a 10x10" logo for "large" signage, we expected much more than a 8x10" color printed piece of paper sitting on our table (we were present on a screen in a blow-up of the sign Brian is posing w/ in the 1st pic).  Everyone seemed disappointed that there wasn't even tape or a frame to display these "signs."  

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58572505@N04/10537737054/" title="photo 4 by CuriousBrooklyn, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/10537737054_578b9c1a21.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="photo 4"></a>
More signage... 

Once parents started to filter in around 11am we had already been in the showcase space for almost 3 hours.  After parents and participants started to filter-in their was a nice flow of traffic through about 2:00.  However, many of the participants refused to sign-up and instead took one of our (beautiful) app cards and candy.  

<b>Panel</b>
I had the chance to attend Hui Soo's panel moderated by Innovate NYC's Preeti Birla.  The panel was definitely the highlight of the event for me and featured the founders of <a href="http://www.gobstopper.com/">Gobstopper</a> and <a href="">Newsela</a>, as well as the Director of School Programs for <a href="http://www.tynker.com/">Tynker</a>.  Hui Soo definitely rocked this panel and provided a masterful case for both more research in the edtech space and a subtle, yet effective plug for NLT! 

<b>Takeaways for future EdLab events (although I don't think we really need these reminders!):</b> 

1) Never email expectations (arrival time, signage etc.) and then NOT provide the few things you emphatically request (expectations are everything!). 

2) Provide easily accessible water (coffee would be nice & food even better) for an all-day event (the organizers did do this after people commented)

3) Establish/display a "#" for the event

4) Be sure all staff members are on the same page before the event starts  

5) Provide printed programs to all participants and presenters (for day-long events this is a must)
