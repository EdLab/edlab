            The conference I filmed on Friday and Saturday, <a href="http://www.thirdwardtx.com/workshop.html"> Real Community is Real Art,</a> is one of the more unique and interesting conferences I have ever attended. On Friday night the organizers screened <a href="http://www.thirdwardtx.com/"> Third Ward, TX</a> and clips from <a href="http://podcast.communication.utexas.edu/RTF/agarrison/current_snakebit_trailer.mov">Snakebit,</a> a work in progress. Both documentaries focus on community development, architecture and art and the role these topics play in creating and sustaining communities. The films were a catalyst to the rest of the conference on Saturday. 

I did not realize before I attended that the films would play heavily in the design of the conference. Many of the panelists were in the films or had careers related to the issues in the film. I think this is a really interesting way to use social documentaries. 

People who work for at least 30 different non-profits in the area attended the event. There were about 80 other people who attended that were city officials or activists. The main purpose was to bring people who could actually initiate change or were already doing it to think about the issues of community development and to network with people you might not know. 

Filming this conference got me thinking about how to recreate a similar event online. Someone brought up the point that the people attending are the privileged few. Many people have jobs, kids or other commitments and are unable to attend a day long event. What are some ways that a filmmaker or community developer can create a similar dialogue online using a social justice film? I'm not sure yet, but it is something I have been thinking about. Is it even possible? Does the networking have to happen face to face and over pie? (At the end they served three different kinds of pie, yum).
