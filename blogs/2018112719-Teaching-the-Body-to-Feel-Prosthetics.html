<p>Phantom limb, or the sensation amputees sometimes have that a missing limb is still attached, is painful and confusing. But what if there were a way to manipulate this sensation so that it could be used for good? Researchers at the Swiss university École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne have developed a new method that combines VR and artificial tactile sensations to do just that.</p>

<p>The thought is that by allowing an individual to "see" their missing limb overlayed onto a prosthetic in VR, amputees can train their brains to perceive a prosthetic as part of their physical body. The researchers found that the perception of the phantom limb could be restored to its full length, rather than being foreshortened, and that this even continued for a time after the experiment ended, showing promise for extending the effect indefinitely.</p>

<p>Do you have any concerns with this technology? What other ways has VR been used to help people re-learn tasks? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/45330">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:24 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> It's slightly worrisome to me that this methodology is founded on deception. I can't see any problem with perceiving a prosthetic limb as one's own, but I worry that the practice of employing deception through AI might pose ethical concerns in other areas, especially education.</p>

<p><b>@00:41 Sara Hardman:</b> VR has been used for many types of therapy, including for <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5579/can-vr-rehabilitation-programs-shed-light-on"> stroke patients</a> and for <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3595/testing-an-autism-therapy-with-virtual-reality">children with autism</a>.</p>

<p><b>@01:36 RuthS:</b> I'm concerned with how long this effect lasts, and how exactly it benefits patients. If patients have to return to the lab on a very regular basis to receive this treatment, it might be more of a hindrance than a benefit, especially if the effects wear off quickly.</p>
