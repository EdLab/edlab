<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1941126X.2011.601224">Shen, L. et al. (2011). Head First into the Patron-Driven Acquisition Pool: A Comparison of Librarian Selections Versus Patron Purchases. <i>Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship, 23</i>(3), 203-218.</a> 

<b>Description:</b>
Demand driven acquisition policy has gained a lot of traction in recent years but the idea is nothing new. Long have librarians wished to be able to provide the resources patrons desire upon request, but for the history of librarianship we have been forced into projections in the form of careful collection development and the purchase-on-demand structures. This paper aims to investigate whether we've been doing it wrong. 

The paper explains that the current mode of DDA includes strict catalog-inclusion policies and spending caps. Catalog discovery records are either handpicked by librarians toward collection development or batch loaded based on stringent criteria for publication date and content. For the paper, the author examined a cycle of DDA purchases and compared results with subject librarian selections from the same pool of titles. 

The data showed that librarian selections fairly accurately followed desire patterns in subject and specificity. Patrons selected more titles considered “popular” by YBP and fewer that were considered “scholarly,” but the differences were not significant enough to indicate that patron driven purchasing would severely decrease the research potential of the collection. The authors suggested that the DDA program examined could benefit from price caps on the lower end (to exclude titles available in the public domain) and higher end (the five most expensive titles, ranging in price from $300-469, were not included in librarian selection lists) and careful selection of trigger-purchasing strategy. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
This topic has been heavy on my mind as we prepare to debut our own DDA program. It will be interesting to study patron usage patterns as we dramatically widen limits for patron involvement in the purchasing process. I can't wait to see if it will slash the activity in DocDel. At this point we really have no idea whether patron desire is married to particular titles or willing to experiment within a body of knowledge, hopefully this data will help inform us in all our purchasing decisions. It's going to be a big and exciting shift for the Materials unit here as it has shifted greater thinking about a librarian's role in collection development.
 
The skew on this study is that it's presented as if differences between patron-selected and librarian-selected materials are the fault of the patrons rather than poor projections by librarians. While DDA may change the face of a collection over time, it's an erosion that will create a more reflective and community-centered collection. I think greater faith in the wisdom of the cloud is the reason that DDA has increased so quickly in popularity and one of the primary existing gaps in modes of librarianship today.
