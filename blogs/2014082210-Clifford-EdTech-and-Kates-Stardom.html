          <p>
            At 5:30 yesterday a gaggle of EdLabbers set off for a 4.0 Schools event at the Scholastic office in SoHo. The energy was particularly high because our very own, Kate, was one of the handpicked judges who would decide the winner of the evenings event (and the recipient of $10,000).
<p>
Kate, Meredith, Chris, Dana, Brian, Mason, Laura and I arrived to the lobby of Scholastic where we received a chip worth between “$60-200” we were told. Another $10,000 would be distributed to the audience's top three picks. The event was held on the roof garden of Scholastic, a beautiful spot with view of downtown NYC. 4.0 founder, Matt Candler, kicked off the event with a high-energy pitch as to why innovation in eduction is not only exciting, but also desperately important. David Fu, the MC of night, introduced the judges. Then, with the impressive backdrop behind them, nine groups presented. The presentations were timed and all presenters had their speeches memorized and their power points at the ready. After every presentation, the judges were allowed three questions. The audience submitted feedback through a Google form that allowed for in-depth comments. Some of our favorites were BrightLoop, a dashboard that allows teachers to keep notes on their students more organized, and Welcome to College, a program to help colleges improve their student tours and help students have more meaningful college visits. There were many other great companies, including the winner, Kate's favorite, Operation Spark, and also one of the audience favorites, VidCode, a app the allows girls to take videos they make and code with them.
<p>
All in all it was a very high energy event, with lots of networking and excitement. The event was a great example of how to keep the audience involved by making their voice matter. The real time feedback meant we were always on the phone. Also, the fun laid back style of the MC, Fu, meant that it felt fun even though the stakes for the teams presenting were high. We look forward to more events with 4.0 schools!
