<p>How can we use digital media to prepare teachers for literacy instruction? A recent qualitative study evaluates <i>New Authors Mentoring New Authors</i>, a pilot online system developed by the College of Education at the University of Texas at Austin. The system, designed by researchers and adapted to store and display a variety of content types, lets teachers explore and discuss real-life examples of writing projects created by K-5 students. The website contains children’s writing samples organized by grade level, genre, writing purpose, central focus, language use, style, and format.</p>

<p>For instance, educators are able to search for writing samples from 2nd through 5th grade that contain examples of engaging openings and original word choice. The system helps educators to select samples and discuss with their peers and mentors in real time or across the world via reflective dialogue on the discussion board. Data from the study included a set of randomly selected writing samples as well as individual interviews with teacher participants.</p>

<p>Teachers in the study reported that the digital tool had great potential in K-5 classrooms.  They used authentic examples taken from the site to illustrate writing elements discussed in class, which helped students understand the practical applications of writing concepts. The participants in the study also confirmed that the website was a helpful reflective space for teachers to share in a community of practitioners working together to improve writing instruction.</p>

<p>The study reveals that the use of digital mentoring texts in the writing classroom can be a specific and logical way to scaffold student writing while supporting teacher community building. The study also presents a case that could inform the development of K-12 tools that are grounded in current classroom practice but disrupt conventional practices in revolutionary ways.</p>
