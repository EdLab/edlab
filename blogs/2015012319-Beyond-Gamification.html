<p>How can educators critically assess digital game-based learning in early childhood learning environments? Play is a big part of early childhood learning and game-based learning seems like a natural addition. However, much has yet to be understood about the game-design industry, the concept of the digital native, the pedagogical values of games, and the kind of professional development needed to prepare teachers to use games effectively in the classroom. The authors of a recent article, after summarizing this landscape of challenges, offer a framework to support educators in navigating the digital game-based learning space.</p>

<p>Many young children actively engage with games. Children ages 3-10 make up the largest group of video game users despite the attitudes of their parents who may see such games as negatively influencing healthy development and play. The researchers believe that parent concerns must be taken seriously and game designers must be guided to create games that support sound pedagogical visions.</p>

<p>The researchers argue that games should be designed to focus on multi-modal literacies and meaning-making as opposed to operational, skill-based technology. Play, especially in the younger years, must be for play's sake. As such, the emphasis should be on engagement and experience as opposed to narrow skill development. Autonomy and learner-initiated choices are key benefits of game-based learning. The freedom to engage and play, as opposed to the cultivation of competition at a young age, is critical. Digital game-based learning has the capacity to be individualized much more fully than traditional classroom-based learning, but digital learning games will have to be thoughtfully created, critically examined, and well-regarded by teachers and parents in order to meet their educational potential. </p>

<p>However, it will take work to realize this vision of learning games.  The researchers maintain that there is no critical pedagogy for digital game-based learning and educators are not adequately prepared to negotiate the conflicting agendas between the school curriculum and the aims of the gaming industry. Can educators and game designers meet such a challenge? How can they work together to design games to meet a range of pedagogical visions? These are key questions for moving forward.</p>
