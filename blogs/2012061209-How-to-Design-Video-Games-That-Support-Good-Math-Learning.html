          <p>
            I'm full day into my internship, and I can already tell this is a great company to work for.  Between the background reading I was doing on Latent Semantic Analysis and general EdLab stuff, I cam across a blog I found to be quite interesting (and maybe something I/we could get involved in here).  It's a blog by Dr. Keith Devlin, a mathematician at Stanford University and the Math Guy on NPR's Weekend Edition. I saw him speak at a seminar at North Carolina State University, and wanted to share some of his thoughts on how we could design video games to support good math learning.  The interesting parts of his blog (and his books on this as well) are how he highlights what obstacles need to be overcome in K12 mathematics education. Particularly, he addresses the notion of the "symbol barrier", how this is one of the main obstacles to overcome when teaching our kids math, and how video games can be designed and implemented to overcome this (and other issues as well). Here's the <a href="http://profkeithdevlin.org/2012/01/29/how-to-design-video-games-that-support-good-math-learning-level-1/">link</a> to the blog. It's a bit lengthy, but each post is very interesting in its own right.

Let me know what your thoughts are on this idea! Is there anyway for EdLab to get involved in something like this? I'm passionate about increasing the effectiveness and attitude about STEM education in the K-12 sector (particularly in engineering and math), and this sounds like a novel approach to an age old problem.
