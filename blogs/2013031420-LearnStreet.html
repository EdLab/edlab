<p><a href="http://www.learnstreet.com/">LearnStreet</a> is a web-based destination for learning to code designed to appeal to a wide audience. The tool offers a variety of courses in programming languages and applications. Beyond their learning platform, LearnStreet also offers a section for students to share their work and a "code garage" where users can tinker with existing programs. LearnStreet might serve as a missing link in code education. It seems like a good second step for intermediate coders who have taken online or in-person courses and are looking for ways to expand their code knowledge, perhaps with more practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>One of the most enticing things about LearnStreet is its focus on putting coding skills to use both on the platform and in the outside world. The site goes beyond code instruction and asks users to test their skills in working labs, play around with existing code to figure out how things work, debug programs, and use developer tools like <a href="https://github.com">Git</a>. LearnStreetâ€™s pathlessness seems to be based on the experience of self-taught developers. Instead of launching directly into code, the guided learning modules include lots of practical ideas about different coding languages to help students choose the right focus. Users also have a choice of instructional method for modules, which are offered in text or video format.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Of course, the dark side of abundant choice is that the information on the site can be overwhelming. A novice coder without well-defined goals might have to sift through a lot of information before even beginning a module, not a problem encountered on scaffolded platforms like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codeacademy</a>. LearnStreet seems best for coders with some code or tech familiarity; some of the information might be redundant to experienced students, but the real world connections and activity-based applications keep things compelling.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>LearnStreet is one of many great tools out there for code learning and there should be a lot of tools. Web development is becoming an essential skill and is <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2012/09/should-kids-learn-to-code-in-grade-school/">not often</a> included in traditional curriculums. The proliferation of <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/afterschool">code clubs</a>, MOOCs, and online learning tools seems to indicate a field of learners willing to think outside the schoolhouse in pursuit of this knowledge. As self-motivated learning online is likely to also become an essential skill, LearnStreet and its brethren seem poised to deliver.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>LearnStreet is suffused with the freedom of web development.</p>
