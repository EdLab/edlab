<b>Title:</b> Skype Me! Socially Contingent Interactions Help Toddlers Learn Language (2013)
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Sarah Roseberry, Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, & Roberta M. Golinkoff
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12166/full"> Child Development</a>
<p>
<b>Research Question:</b> Do social interactions support word learning in toddlers, and if so, how?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> Although the promise and practice of video learning has exploded over the last few decades, little attention has been paid to its potential for learning in young children (up to 3 years old). In particular, while young children don’t seem to learn language as well from video as from live interactions, little is known as to why that would be the case. 
<p>
The authors of this study theorize that word learning relies on social contingency (e.g., where the instructor directs his or her gaze), a resource often lacking in video-based learning. To test this theory, they randomly assigned a group of 36 children (between 24 and 30 months) to one of three conditions. The three options were a live video chat, a face-to-face interaction, or a recorded video lesson, all designed around word learning.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b> The sessions were recorded, including the use of sophisticated equipment to track the child’s gaze, and the children were trained and tested on the use of four new verbs. The researchers found that children in the video chat and live interactions were significantly more successful at learning the use of these novel verbs over children in the recorded video condition. In addition, children who were more focused on the teacher’s eyes during the lesson also had greater success.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b> This study highlights the importance of interaction in early childhood language training. One interesting suggestion the study provides is that, if we must teach by recorded video, it might be more helpful to record an interaction between to two characters, rather than relying on a teacher simply posing recorded questions and providing pauses for students to respond. These findings may also have implications for learning in general. Teen and adult students, much like young children, undoubtedly rely on a variety of responsive social cues in making sense of lessons, and although older learners are more capable of attentive learning without those aids, their importance should not be neglected.
