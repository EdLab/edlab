          <p>
            While thinking about the design of the Teaching and Learning Network, I came across <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2008/05/21/social-networking-learning-theory-in-action.aspx">this</a> article. Even though it is somewhat old, it provides an interesting aspect of social networks such as collaboration, optimum production, innovative uses, creativity and networking in the context of education. Following are excerpts from the article -

<blockquote>Most conventional educational environments are "Objectivist" in nature and highly structured in terms of students progress and choice. Social networking essentially requires a less controlled, user-generated environment, which challenges conventional views of the effective "management" of teaching and learning. Therefore, can social networking both as an instructional concept and user skill be integrated into the conventional approaches to teaching and learning? Do the skills developed within a social networking environment have value in the more conventional environments of learning?
</blockquote>


On production and publishing aspect of social network -


<blockquote>

Only at the graduate level do we require learners to position their work within the larger community of experts in their field. Why is this not a skill that is developed and valued long before graduate studies? Students understanding how their work compares to their peers, how their work contributes to their field, and why their work is significant beyond the immediate expectations of a course and their teacher can only enlarge the outcomes for the learner. The reality of Internet-based social networking tools that is often lost in the discussion is the "production" or "publishing" aspect of the environment. Again, this encourages learners to see themselves within a larger community and realize the impact of their contribution.
