             <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/education/measuring-economic-cost-child-marriage?hootPostID=a87fa5d47b4a3068dbb962e6024e267b" target = "blank">Child marriage</a> is perceived mostly as a social issue, and not an economic one. There are many reasons why many people would think it is solely a social issue. For instance, child marriage violates the fundamental rights of girls, limits their school attainment, and has negative impacts on their health and subsequently that of their children. Many countries have established laws that prohibit child marriage. The legal age for marriage is usually 18. However, the laws are mostly not enforced. Recently, the U. K. government and UNICEF hosted the first Girl Summit to mobilize efforts to end child, early, and forced marriage as well as female genital mutilation. Reports by UNFPA and UNICEF indicate that more than one-third of girls are married before age 18.
<p>
The cognitive and social development of many girls is at risk when they are married before turning 18. This is also true for their economic life as well. Researchers have yet to accurately estimate the economic costs of child marriage. However, studies by the World Bank suggest a range of negative impacts of child marriage on human development outcomes. In fact, if studies were to estimate the economic cost of child marriage, it might provide incentives for governments to find ways to effectively tackle this problem. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation presented $4.2 billion to research programs to measure the economic cost of child marriage.
