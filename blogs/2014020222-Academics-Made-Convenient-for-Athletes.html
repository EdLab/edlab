          <p>
            It is very evident that sometimes student athletes are left with no other option but to choose between pursuing their academic goals or working towards making it to the highest level in their respective sport. However, a lot of questions have arisen as to who should be held responsible for not creating a convenient and conducive environment for student athletes. This <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/theedge/2014/01/30/268377677/high-schoolers-hit-the-slopes-and-the-books-at-team-academy">article</a> provides an overview about an academy that provides high school skiers with a very good educational facility that is designed to be close to their training facilities as well. With both academic and sports facilities at these students' disposal, they are able to learn like other high school students and also compete in sports like any other student athletes.

This initiative in my opinion should be embraced by most academies, sports clubs and schools as well. If student athletes are provided these kinds of opportunities, they will be motivated to combine their academic work with sports as well. I will be very glad to have an opportunity like this instead of having to travel to and from campus after a tiring day of practice.
