<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>The work of the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a> is all about changing the education industry by enabling better digital teaching and learning environments through the cooperation of a very wide range of suppliers, institutions and even teachers or students. So, IMS is enabling an open interoperable learning platform that is collectively developed by the participants in the massive global education market segment. All participants can be providers of pieces of the massively connected platform – and create businesses for various types of content or tools – but no one organization owns the entirety.  It’s just like the Worldwide Web – but focused on the specific needs of education. 
<p>
My educational trajectory started deep into computer & networking technology (Carnegie-Mellon and USC) but eventually led me to more of an entrepreneurial market development business focus (Stanford) and most recently to a study of educational leadership and change (Fielding Graduate University). A certain amount of expertise in all of these areas is required for what we do in IMS because technology, market development and new educational models intersect to form the compelling need for the work of IMS Global.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have been an entrepreneur most of my career – even though I have worked for several large technology companies, as well as start-ups. Being an entrepreneur means understanding your customer – perhaps even better than they understand themselves. And it means that the only real feedback that matters is whether the customer values your product(s) – and that they are willing to demonstrate this with dollars and commitment. There are too many technologists and people in society in general that don’t have enough contact with customers. So, in my career I found the maxim that "all a good entrepreneur needs is one serious customer" to be something to embrace.  And I think if you are smart about your career you will strive to set up opportunities like that for yourself. In my humble opinion too many people have a survivalist mentality with their primary customer being their boss. While that may help you keep your job it is not going to help you reach your full potential. Working directly with customers who have challenging problems/needs to solve has been the most rewarding in my career.  I do think that it is very important to also understand the theory behind your field. I am absolutely amazed at how many people – even senior people in major organizations – who are pretty much "winging it" because they have little knowledge of the historical foundations of theory and knowledge that underlie their field. In essence this has to do with an overall "theory of education" – which I personally feel needs to be very applied for real learning to take place.  And I have spent only 4 years of my academic career (undergraduate) as a full-time student. The other 8+ years of education have been while I was working so that I could combine theory and practice.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> We are at the very beginning of understanding how learning works. Everybody learns. It’s basic to survival. However, today it’s clear that learning and education are tied to quality of life – and meeting societal challenges of the future. Are we learning fast enough? If we are we will be able to redesign our educational systems to help "us" learn how to learn more effectively.  Do we know how to do this? No. We do have some initial insights. But, today’s educational models are stuck. Most of the "reformers" are thinking they can affect education by looking in the rear view mirror and trying to perfect old models. New models of education are needed. Some of the new models are not new models at all – but old models like the purpose-driven practitioner facilitated education envisioned by educational philosopher John Dewey. But the problem is that such models are difficult to deliver at scale.  That’s where technology innovation needs to come in. We need to get people the basic skills they need rapidly – but we need to do it in a situation that has real motivation.  Technology that we have today, ranging from learning management systems to e-portfolios to new types of digital learning apps/content/tutors, mobile devices are the very beginning of a long road to enable these new models. No one can envision exactly the technologies that will be involved.  But, we do know that they won’t all come from one vendor. We do know that we need to increase the amount of investment that goes toward innovation – and not reinventing custom integrations between the various digital products over and over again – which is what is happening today.  IMS Global has the vision of plug and play digital education applications, platforms and content.  Not just in the simple-minded iTunes kind of trivial standalone app – but in digital apps and resources that can be integrated with one click into an educational enterprise or entire network of educational enterprises – thus connecting students to students, students to teachers, and all to high quality innovative institutions of learning that are rising to meet tomorrow’s educational challenges. Educational technology needs to easily connect and work together and that relatively small change will enable lots of bigger changes.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> For those who have been paying attention there have been some very clear lessons over the last couple of decades of experimenting and adoption of new models for education. Strikingly, many of the bright shiny objects that are being chased right now – like MOOCs – are counter to what has been learned. For instance, we have learned that it is the achievement of an "academic program" that is what matters. You can take a "course" and pass the course – but what does that really mean? Well, it doesn’t mean very much. Today’s world requires well-rounded and qualified people – and in education that generally accrues and is evidenced by completion of a program of study.  We have also learned that the more a program is directly related to the interests of the learner the more successful they are likely to be. And, we have also learned that if programs are structured to be more convenient for the learner the more people can be reached. So, we need more flexibility in program design – both in terms of the subject matter and the delivery models. We have also learned that educational data and analytics is most powerful if it is actionable for students, parents and faculty. So, I have nothing against assessment – in fact good assessment is essential – but it will need to be focused on providing immediate feedback to those who can influence the learning process: the student, the teacher, the mentor.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> To get to the "plug and play" learning technology future discussed previously the IMS member organizations developed something called Learning Tools Interoperability or LTI for short. The adoption of LTI has been viral across K-20 education and there are some 20 platforms and hundreds of learning tools and digital content providers now using it. The current version is kind of a 60% solution. There is a new version, LTI 2, being rolled out that is more like a 95% solution. LTI 2 should get us very close to 1-click integration into enterprise systems.  This enables IMS to work with our members to enable an "open educational app store" model that will completely free us from the vendor-specific app store models common to the consumer world from companies like Apple, Google or Amazon. Are we taking on these giant companies? Unfortunately we have to. Education doesn’t want or need the headaches – such as lack of cross platform support, lack of enterprise connectivity, lack of analytics data, etc – that are all fine for the consumer world, but are untenable for education. Education is NOT a one supplier fits all marketplace. We would prefer to not have to create an alternative to these large non-educational companies. In fact, they can simply adopt standards like LTI and become much more compatible with what education wants and needs. But, so far they seem determined to stick with the "my way or the highway" approach.  You would think that you could build an Apple iOS app that could talk to other apps using IMS standards. You can’t.  Apple literally prohibits it. That’s how closed Apple is. Personally I would think that organizations like Apple that are selling to education would not only enable open standards created by the educational segment, but would support the development of such standards. Sadly, the consumer-oriented companies are not supporting the education segment in the way you might expect.  Not to worry though. The IMS membership, 220 organizations strong (up from 50 seven years ago), is rising to the challenge to make it easy for any institution (or their educational market supplier) to provide an app store like functionality – but completely based on open standards – so that the apps can be integrated into the institutional infrastructure as well as into a functional connected teaching and learning environment.  And really LTI and the Open Educational App Store are just some of the exciting work. We are doing a ton of work in etext, analytics, e-assessment and accessibility as well.
