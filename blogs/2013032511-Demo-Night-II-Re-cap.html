Hi Team EdLab! 

First, thank you so much for helping to make our second demo night event such a success (see stats and takeaways below)!  A special thank you to Laura S., Janice, Rebecca, Megha, John, Luke, Yana, Diana, Daniel, Danielle, Gonzalo, Jo, George, Hui Soo, Brian and Gary (+ the team of help at the event itself!) for making this second event so smooth, "edtech elegant" and enjoyable to attend!  

Chalkable, TuVa Labs and Teachley all presented with aplomb and panache... without a single unintended pause or misstep!  The video, audio and amplification all went-off without a hitch (Thanks Brian, Luke & Yana!)!  Intro music was perfect & outro sequence too...  The food & drink was delicious (fried sandwiches even seemed edgy & cool!) and the setting was beautiful (Daniel, Gonzalo & Danielle)!  Overall a stellar event put-on by a rockstar team!  Thank you one & all!!!! 

<b>NLT Stats during & just after event...(Thanks Laura & Josh!)</b>
-3/16 -3/22 = 527 visits to the NLT site 
-Top article during this time period was the SiNY coverage of Demo Night 1 
-We signed-up 41 new users in the same period (16 on 3/21 alone) - Special thank-you to Rebecca & John for in-event sign-up!!!  
-We received 133 RSVP's through Eventbrite and about 90 "outsiders" attended (Kate & Rebecca will revise this # after tallying final check-in)

<b>General event takeaways...</b> 
-The process of vetting startups during seminars seems to really work! 
-Rehearsing both the emcee and presenting company's "flow" is essential... 
-The whole process went-off without a hitch or hiccup, despite last-minute presentation swaps and live demos... I have never witnessed that happen at a similar event so GREAT work demo, video/tech and emcee team!  
-Keeping the whole event in one space seemed to really work well and lead to a smoother, more natural transition 

<b>Success & feedback from guests</b>
Next, if you define success based on interest in the lab, our work and general awareness-building, I would say the event was a success!  The resounding feedback I got was: 
-"EdLab has set the bar for these events!"
-"Great startups - how did you choose them? "(explained seminar process)
-"I signed-up for NLT... can I write for NLT?" (Explained EdLab careers page)
-"When is the next demo night event?" (Hopefully soon!)

<b>Your turn!</b>
Finally, if you have pictures, comments/suggestions for another demo night and feedback you received or overheard please add these thoughts in the comments below! 

Laura co-emcees the event masterfully with me!
