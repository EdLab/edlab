Kaiser Fung has over 15 years experience as a statistician, analyst and statistical data mining methodology expert.  Perhaps most interesting to young students of statistics and the growing legion of data visualization fans, he is responsible for a whole genre of critical examinations of data and graphics found in the media, <a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts">Junk Charts</a>.  He marries his interests with both the practical and theoretical side of statistics through his work teaching students at NYU.

<b> EXCLUSIVE NLT INTERVIEW</B>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> I'm one of the lucky people who can honestly say that I'm applying what I learned at school every day. I'm a business statistician, using data to solve business problems. I started my career in management consulting, and it took a few side-tracks before I settled into my current career path, but with the rise of analytics and Big Data, this path looks bright!

<p> 
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> My experience working in the business setting has been very influential because every day I have to explain statistics to people who don't have the mathematical training and see the world in a different way. Writing presentations is a terrifically useful way to test my own reasoning because it requires me to develop a coherent theory and supporting evidence. Contrary to others in my field, I love making PowerPoint (or Keynote) presentations. Blogging is also great as I learn how readers respond to my writing.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>   

<b>Answer:</b> One of the reviewers of my book commented that it's a book about statistics without statistics. I think this statement captures very well what I hope to accomplish. Most of us are drivers, but few of us know how to build a car. We can understand and use data without knowing how to design algorithms. Through my writing, I hope to show people that statistics can be taught as liberal arts; it doesn't have to be taught as mathematics.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> In teaching of statistics, I hope that introductory courses will be developed which involve no formulas at all. With the recent development of some amazing interactive and visualization software, I believe we are closer than ever to such courses. The first thing I tell my NYU class is that there are no correct answers in statistics; once we start teaching the subject as liberal arts, we will discover different teaching tools such as case discussion, critical readings and essays.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & What is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have a second book in the works, and it should interest the educational community. In this book, I show how normal people can use simple tools to think critically about the numbers all around us. I feel it's important as the citizen's response to Big Data.
