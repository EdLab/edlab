          <p>
            I found this <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1718961">article</a> published at 2010 CSCW conference very interesting and thus I am sharing it with you.

Have you had an online shopping experience where you ended up crawling Amazon product review pages, or similar kinds of forums and eventually shopped elsewhere? Do you also find that a lot of the reviews are repetitive? In this case, is the more really the merrier? Is THAT important, why or why not?

In the aforementioned paper, the researchers found 10-15% of product reviews substantially resembled previous reviews. Latecomers basically just echo what other previous reviewers wrote. They referred to these kinds of reviews or reviewers as "deja reviewers". Why do deja reviewers spend their time and energy repeating what others have already done?

The researchers used machine-learning techniques to identify deja reviewers and then conducted follow up interviews to understand their motivations. They clustered two groups of these deja reviewers: <b><i>Amateurs</i> and <i>Pros</i>.</b>.

For Amateurs, reading other reviews doesn't satisfy their need to share the power of reacting to a product. For Pros, it's different. Pros tend not to do self-expression; their goal is to build a brand or identity within the reviewing community. Basically, <b>amateurs write to scratch an itch, pros write to advance a personal agenda. </b> The relationship to other reviewers are also different: amateurs do not mind being a brick in the wall; pros want to stand out. 

The core idea is to nudge members to contribute (provide more constructive reviews) without trampling on their reasons for contributing. But the first couple of reviews presented to the reader are going to be important, because more likely, we may ignore the rest. Currently, machine-learning techniques seem to be the mainstream platform to summarize the community feedback. But in the future, as the authors also recognized, <b>social navigation</b> is going to play a big part in this.
