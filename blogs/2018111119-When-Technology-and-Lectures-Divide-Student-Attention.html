<p>A recent study found that personal device use in class can have long-term negative effects on college students’ academic performance. Researchers examined how using laptops and cell phones for specifically non-academic purposes in class affected both short-term retention levels, such as for in-class quizzes, and long-term retention levels, such as for final exams. While many classes allow or even require technology use, many students also use their devices for non-academic tasks in class. This study focused on that phenomenon.</p>
 
<p>The study involved two identical, back-to-back college lecture classes taught by the same professor in exactly the same style. In all, 118 students participated. Each class had 25 sessions, and students could use technology for non-academic purposes in exactly half of them. One class could use technology on the odd numbered sessions; the other used it on the even sessions. In each class, students answered in-class quiz questions on the course material presented that day. Those questions were replicated on unit exams throughout the semester and on a final exam at the end of the term.</p>
 
<p>The findings showed no significant difference in in-class quiz scores between days where students could use tech and days where they couldn’t. This shows that using personal devices doesn’t affect short-term retention. There were significant differences, however, on unit exams and on the final exam. In both of these tests, but in particular on the final exam, students scored much higher on questions from lectures where they couldn’t use tech than on questions from lectures where they could. On average, allowing personal devices correlated with a 7-point score decrease on the final exam. This demonstrates that personal device usage for non-academic purposes in a class has negative long-term retention consequences. Even students who opted not to use personal devices on days when devices were allowed and used by others scored worse on these questions, suggesting that their use may be a distraction to all students.</p>
 
<p>While non-academic device surfing in class might not have short-term consequences, it does have a long-term impact on class outcomes. Both teachers and students should be aware of this. Teachers should also note that allowing personal, non-academic device use has a negative impact even on students who choose not to partake in this activity. Teachers should definitely consider this finding when designing their classes and deciding how much technology freedom their students should have.</p>
