The D.C. public school system recently released <a href="http://wamu.org/programs/metro_connection/12/04/06/dc_librarians_face_an_uncertain_future">budget guidelines</a> for the coming school year and the results are not pretty for librarians. Last year, schools with fewer than 250 students lost allocated funding for an in-house librarian. This year the bar has raised to 300 students and the funding has become flexible, allowing principals to make the call if they'd like to forego a librarian. On the heels of that announcement came the news that a school board in Nova Scotia has opted to <a href="http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/81928-board-axes-all-school-librarians">forego all librarians</a> in the coming year due to budget cuts. 

The loss of an educator devoted to promoting information literacy is significant for the students of these institutions, but the removal of school librarians also presents organizational issues. Helmless “ghost libraries” often remain after librarians are gone and slowly devolve into chaos and decrepitude. A newspaper in Tualatin, Oregon recently <a href="http://www.tigardtimes.com/news/story.php?story_id=133366369453763000">reported</a> on such a library and the attempts of concerned parents to salvage a browsable collection from the outdated ruins. The investment of time by uninitiated parents to reorganize the collection was significant, Suzanne Coggins, a leader of the movement stated “When you're putting away books and you can't figure out the system, and you're an adult, that's awful.” 

This may not be strictly ALA-approved, but it seems like outsourcing might be a good strategy for these schools. It's a wonder that companies like <a href="http://www.lssi.com/communities.html">LSSI</a>, that have been involved with the privatization of several municipal libraries, haven't been called to assist in downshifting school library services. At the very least a setup of pre-cataloged and labeled books could be auto-ordered to prevent collection obsolescence. Schools are clearly experimenting with how much librarian is needed to maintain a non-google research presence and that's something we need to know, but there's no excuse for poor planning.
