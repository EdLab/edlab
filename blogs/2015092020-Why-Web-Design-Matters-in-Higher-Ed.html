            <img class='nlt-image' src="https://cdn.tc-library.org/NewLearningTimes/6814443089_6247f725d0_b_c53c01a6fef6478eb51839e5b697426a.jpg" alt='article.title'><br />

<p>Although there is no shortage of web designers focusing on aesthetic quality, accessibility, and user experience, higher education websites are often cluttered, making it difficult for users to find the information they are seeking. In fact, mobile sites are often more usable than their desktop counterparts because they are more streamlined and only present the most crucial information to the audience. Cluttered websites not only present navigation issues, but also pose a dilemma for accessibility. For example, individuals who are colorblind may not be able to pinpoint a green button, and those who are deaf may not be able to obtain the information from videos without captions.</p>

<p>Researchers from the University of Michigan sought to address these accessibility concerns and argued the pedagogical value in strong website design by creating focus groups to test the design of a site called <a href ="http://www.beyondplagiarism.sweetland.lsa.umich.edu/">Beyond Plagiarism</a>. The site was created in order to teach students about citing sources and was intended for use by faculty members across campus. Some of the main design issues that were addressed included: visual hierarchy using headings and subheadings, chunking using separate pages to break up text, captions and transcripts, and color palettes that incorporate both white space and the university colors.</p>

<p>Beyond Plagiarism included four lessons, each of which included a quiz to test the students’ knowledge. The quiz was hosted by a separate learning management software (LMS) that was linked on the site. The two focus groups were given different amounts of time to attempt the lessons and asked questions afterward by a moderator. Most students responded with answers such as "the color palette made the text easy to follow" or "the setup was good and generally easy to use." However, the students were divided on whether they felt that metaphorical illustrations were helpful or not, with some saying that they helped them relate to the information and others saying that they were unclear or hard to understand. Most students felt that the separate LMS used to take the quiz was cumbersome and hard to use, after which the team found a way to incorporate the quizzes directly on the Beyond Plagiarism site.</p>

<p>Faculty members were also asked for their opinions on the website, with most of them finding the site useful. However, some expressed concerns over how the referencing information did not fit well with their specific discipline, especially because it was more centered around the humanities. This was a concern, because without faculty support for Beyond Plagiarism, students would be unlikely to use the site at all.</p>

<p>The importance of web design is often stressed in the business world, where companies rely heavily on the aesthetics of their websites in order to attract and relay information to their customers. However, higher education sites are still cluttered and behind the times; conducting usability tests with prospective and current students, as well as parents and faculty members, is crucial for ensuring that everyone who is looking for information about the university can find it quickly and with ease. This streamlining is also key in creating pedagogical sites that aim to teach students—and as seen in this study, design features can play a significant role in how effectively a student can learn from a website.</p>
