<p><i>"NoTosh: daring us all to design brighter learning futures.
We continually challenge the way things are. We take pragmatic steps together to make innovation possible. Everything we do has learning at its heart."</i> (From the <a href="http://notosh.com/">NoTosh</a> site)</p>

<p><b>Meet the Founder</b><br>
<a href="http://notosh.com/">NoTosh</a>, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, is a design thinking and education consulting firm. Founded by <a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/">Ewan McIntosh</a>, NoTosh works with clients in education and in creative industries. McIntosh began as a French and German teacher in Scottish high schools and is deeply committed to re-designing education to increase student engagement and improve the learning experience. McIntosh shares the following quote on his website: "educators were being told left, right and centre that creativity was important, but no-one seemed to be explaining how. NoTosh was to give an upfront, no nonsense understanding of how the people in the creative industries are creative, and how it fits with what we know makes great teaching and learning."</p>

<p><b>About the Philosophy</b><br>
The <a href="http://notosh.com/what-we-do/the-design-thinking-school/">Design Thinking School</a> is one of the key features of NoTosh. The school takes project-based learning and makes it a science, teaching participants how to think critically in collaborative spaces. The school also works to feature and implement the latest research on design thinking. Among other topics, NoTosh develops strategies for teaching "thinking skills and formative assessment toolkits [for] every learner," "robust processes for creating space for innovation," and a NoTosh OnTap program that brings NoTosh consultants in house to schools and organizations to re-image learning in the long-term in a specific place.  The firmâ€™s website is filled with videos and downloadable design thinking guides that empower anyone to begin doing design thinking.</p>
