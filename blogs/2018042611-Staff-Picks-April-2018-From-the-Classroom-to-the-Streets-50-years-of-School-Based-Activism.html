Fifty years ago this month, Columbia University students, as well as some staff, faculty, committed activists, and Harlem residents, came together to air a set of similarly heterogenous grievances. Incensed by a recent ban on indoor protests on campus, the university's collaboration with the military and defense contractors on the Vietnam War, and enduring issues of racism on campus- made more exigent by plans to make a semi- private gym out of a public Harlem park- hundreds gathered at the Sundial on Columbia's main campus on April 23, 1968. In the ensuing days, protests continued while students called a strike and occupied campus buildings. By the close of the week, more than 700 students were arrested, over 100 were injured, and hundreds of faculty members met to discuss resolutions for and against the university administration. These events, and what immediately followed, transformed the university and signaled a sharp escalation in the uprisings sweeping the country in the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.

While the faculty's resolutions on the administration were tabled in favor of one to create a body that would "<a href="https://exhibitions.library.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968/consequences" target="_blank">return the university to its primary focus of education</a>,” the CU strike, as well as other student protests covered in this collection, illustrate the inherent educational value of political organizing. Students have often been categorically overlooked as having no political agency, given their relative inexperience and circumscribed political rights. But during these protests, the youth made their voices and their values heard loud and clear. Many of the sit-ins and protests led to concrete change in administrative policies and beyond. April's Staff Picks collection, From the Classroom to the Streets: 50 Years of School-Based Activism, explores the events not only at Columbia in 1968, but those in primary and secondary schools in the following years, as well as the general nature of student protest. To commemorate the impact of the uprisings on our campuses, Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscript Library is also hosting a Conference and has curated an exhibition entitled 1968: The Global Revolutions.

<a href="https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/rbml/2018/03/14/conference-get-the-full-program-for-50-years-after-the-revolution/" rel="attachment wp-att-29923"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-29923" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2018/04/1968-Conference-Program-663x1024-1-194x300.jpg" alt="1968-Conference-Program-663x1024" width="194" height="300" /></a>Today, student activism and action is at the forefront, with student occupations occurring most recently at the <a href="https://vtcynic.com/news/waterman-takeover-ends-protesters-return-home" target="_blank">University of Vermont</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/howard-students-have-ended-their-occupation-what-comes-next/2018/04/09/e3bbae8a-3bfc-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.385d3e0548b0" target="_blank">Howard University</a>, and once again, here at <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2018/04/20/students-begin-occupation-of-lerner-hall-demanding-creation-of-24-hour-health-centers/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>. Of course, students at Parkland, Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have sparked a national student movement to address gun violence, building on the work of movements such as Blacks Lives Matter, #MeToo, and Moms Demand Action Against Gun Violence.

If any one lesson can be gleaned from this history- from Columbia in 1968 to Howard in 2018- it is that student organizing and occupations can bring not only an optical advantage, but success. The Columbia protests resulted in the end of plans to construct the new gym; engendered the University Senate, a significantly more representative policy-making body; and terminated the university’s weapons research contract. At Howard, students report that eight of their nine demands have been met, forcing the university’s hand in changing a housing deadline, putting students in advisory positions, and making a recommendation to the governing board that tuition rates be held flat for the next year. As high school students in Southhampton, NY, declared in their underground newspaper <i>Up Against the Wall</i>, “If the school is to be run for our benefit, we should start exercising our power as students.”
