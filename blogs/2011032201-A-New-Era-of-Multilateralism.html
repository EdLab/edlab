            Now that some of the big global powers have agreed to launch air strikes against Libya's Moummar Qaddafi (or whichever spelling of his name you prefer), there is some belief this is going to usher in a new era of multilateralism when it comes to dealing with global affairs. This was a topic of discussion on several of the weekend political shows. 

The uprisings and revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa started and ended rather peacefully in Tunisia and Egypt, but jubilant and euphoric scenes of happy Egyptians parading their national flag around Tahrir Square has been replaced with a hard dose of reality for other aspiring revolutionaries across the region. Crackdown by government forces in Bahrain, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran and most famously in Libya reminded the protestors that freedom often comes with a huge price in the Middle East and North Africa. 

Most of the world's global powers, though staunch in their disapproval of the aforementioned regimes using power to maintain their grip on power, have been idle in terms of action, that is until now. What prompted the swift decision to attack Qaddafi and his forces? The answer to that is surely open to debate as some have speculated this could be the result of Qaddafi's long standing feud with the West (though he has tried to become more friendly with the West in recent years) and his previous actions (bombing of PanAm flight over Lockerbie, Scotland and bombing a club frequented by US soldiers in Germany during the 80s, etc.) against the West. Whatever the reason, for once, most of the Western nations have agreed almost in unison to use force to protect civilians from non-Western nations. 

Much of the charge often directed at the UN is their lack of military involvement in situations such as the one we are currently witnessing in Libya. Critics will note that UN troops stood idly by during genocides in Darfur, Rwanda and Kosovo. Under its rules, all five permanent members (USA, UK, China, France and Russia) of the UN Security Council must approve all matters of peacekeeping and military action by the other member-states. The self-interest of each member state of the UN trumps the collective interest of the organization and as such, it has become practically impossible to achieve a consensus among the five permanent members on issues involving military action. For instance, China was reluctant to agree to any key resolution on Darfur since the Chinese government and Chinese companies are some of the biggest investors in Sudanese oil. One of the reasons often mentioned about the US's lack of involvement in Rwanda was their fear of another incident similar to that of the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mogadishu_(1993)">Black Hawk Down</a> a year earlier in Mogadishu, Somalia.

The success or failure of the current mission in Libya may go a long way in shaping future multilateral military action against despots or oppressive military juntas, but Libya is a start.
