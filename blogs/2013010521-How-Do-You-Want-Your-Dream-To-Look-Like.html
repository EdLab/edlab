            Some of us have certainly had dreams in our childhood of how we want schools to be, essentially the school of our fantasy. For many years now, educators and policymakers have somehow tried to innovate America's education system in order to meet 21st-century needs since dropouts have remarkably increased. In this <a href="http://www.good.is/posts/what-does-the-school-of-your-dreams-look-like/?utm_campaign=goodtweet&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social">article</a> from GOOD, Sir Ken Robinson shares his vision of a dream school that he would call Explore Academy.

According to Sir Robinson, Explore Academy would be opened to students of all ages, with programs starting late in the evening as opposed to the regular 8 to 3 schedule for most students. Students would also be spared from a pile of homework as he believes they need breaks from their studies. Great teachers are certainly an important factor for students as they bring motivation and help them score in preparation for exams, but Sir Robinson also believes that bringing others such as artists, scientists, and business leaders is essential in order to help students develop other skills in the outside world. For Sir Robinson, a great school would be a mix of all the elements in a good community. His idea of a school highly fascinates me as I sometimes wonder how much I would learn if I was to create a school of my own.

How would you create your dream school?
