          <p>
            Starting next school year, the New York City Department of Education will adopt new ways to provide services to students with disabilities. This move, driven by the  <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/SpecialEducation/reforms.htm"> special education reform</a>, comes with the idea that students with special needs will usually do better in school when they learn with their classmates on the general education track. As claimed by the reform goals, this new policy is:

-	To close the achievement gap between students with disabilities and their peers without disabilities;

-	To provide increased access to and participation in the general education curriculum;

-	To empower all schools to have greater curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of students with disabilities.

250 schools have been piloted the reform so far this year. The major debate for the time being is about the lack of access and resources for both students with special needs and school administrators. And that is one of the most important issues addressed in the reform mission. Additionally, parents of disable students usually face more pressures but the DOE is organizing <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/SpecialEducation/News/Understanding+the+New+IEP+Form.htm">information sessions</a> to acquaint parents with the new plans and get them involved.  I think there are three advantages following new insights of the reform:

-	Students with special needs are likely to achieve greater education outcomes if placed in an inclusive classroom, as is shown in <a href="http://www.lifespan.it/client/abstract/ENG197_XIII_3_1%20pdf.2.pdf"> this study</a>. 

-	Students with special needs are able to obtain well-round support from teachers, school administrators, parents and peers as being involved in an inclusive environment.

-	The general education school system will be undergoing a positive change in establishing a more inclusive education environment, which may also help in addressing access and equality issues in other perspectives (i.e. race & ethnicity, gender, socio-economic class) of educational development.

Build up an inclusive environment for students with special needs. Are you ready for it?
