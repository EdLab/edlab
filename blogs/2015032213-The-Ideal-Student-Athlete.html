            Academic scandals involving student athletes is nothing new. The scandal at UNC Chapel Hill, where student athletes reportedly enrolled in fake classes has created a firestorm. However, several schools have indicated that academic scandals should not be generalized because they have measures to prevent academic scandals. It is quite evident that the scandals are overshadowing the concept of the ideal student athlete. The issue of whether "student athletes" really exist has been the center of criticism for some time now. 
<p>
This <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/college/2015/03/20/Behind-the-Madness-Colleges-go-by-the-book-with-student-athletes-even-during-tournament-time/stories/201503200257" target = "blank">article</a> expands on this argument. Several schools ensure that student athletes take their academic work very serious. In order to prevent academic scandals, the athletic department is void of any role in the student academics. For instance, when students are supposed to take exams while they are away for tournaments, academic departments provide proctors. Student athletes are provided with study halls during tournaments, during practice breaks and even before games. Many argue that scandals involving student athletes doesn't change the fact that there are many who combine academics and athletics efficiently.
