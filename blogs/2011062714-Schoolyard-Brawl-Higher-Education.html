          <p>
            For those of you who missed it, here's a link to the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5963">latest Schoolyard Brawl Podcast</a> on the state of higher education.

One of my favorite commentators on the state of education, and higher education in particular, is Matt Yglesias, who came out with a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/27/254394/going-to-college-is-very-valuable/">response</a> to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/sunday-review/26leonhardt.html">David Leonhardt's column</a>, which Fred has <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5976">just posted</a> on. 

What Yglesias emphasizes I have a problem with:
<b>"college has big benefits even in many fields where a degree is not crucial."
"Education helps people do higher-skilled work, get jobs with better-paying companies or open their own businesses."</b>
This clearly smells of selection to me. Employers are inclined to give the raise to the applicant with "more polish" and better-paying employers are all the more likely to recruit the applicant with more polish, ceteris paribus. This is an ex-ante way of looking at things anyways. Does giving raises to more educated students imply that educated students are more productive and produced more after the raise than if the raise had been given to the less educated? The answer might be yes, but I could easily see the answer being no. Higher education does do a good job at filling in the gaps that exist in secondary education with regards to  mathematical and logical reasoning as well as reading comprehension.
Nevertheless, to see my point, just read further down: <b>"Thinking about plumbers, I guess I would say that knowing how to fix pipes is one thing and knowing how to spot and take advantage of business opportunities is another thing."</b>
Really? Colleges are great at teaching people to spot and take advantage of business opportunities? That's news to me. Yglesias further declares:
<b>"General skills in reading, math, communication, and analytical reasoning are going to help you ply your trade more effectively even if your trade doesn't itself involve much in the way of reading, math, etc."</b>
Shouldn't these skills be taught in secondary schooling? Middle and high school seem to be more appropriate settings to teach such skills, especially given the lack of tracking in the U.S. system. 

Yglesias stands firm against "the idea that going to college isn't worth it", but emphasizing this quote in his blog post obscures one of the larger and more detailed points he makes. Is college worth it? Compared to not going to college, then yes. I am sure that, beyond all of the selection effects that likely exist, most students acquire valuable skills when attending college and that these skills are hard to acquire elsewhere. But are colleges providing honest value that is worth the tuition universities charge? No. The problem is the lack of viable alternatives within higher education and the sad state of primary and secondary education in the United States. 

One of the topics Fred and I failed to cover in our podcast was how U.S. higher education is affected by the sorry state of U.S. secondary education. That we need an expensive institution like higher education to teach communication and basic reasoning skills is both inefficient and pathetic. There's no reason to think that a high school diploma should be the be-all and end-all for most students, but it is also not hard to imagine circumstances under which a high school diploma might actually reflect real skills gained.

Leonhardt and Yglesias make a reasonable case to each individual deciding on whether to attend college. Moreover, they are right to criticize the "College is not for everyone; vocational training is more appropriate for most" crowd. Unfortunately, if we solely focus on making a bachelors degree about 'critical thinking' skills, we will be on the road to making a college degree only marginally more meaningful than a high school diploma was 50 years ago. What we really want is for our students to be learning more on the aggregate and productively applying what they learn to add value for society. This discussion about whether students will earn more over their lifetime if they attend college obscures the real problems at hand.
