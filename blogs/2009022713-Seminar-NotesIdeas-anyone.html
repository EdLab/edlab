          <p>
            Here are the notes that Doug and I took during the seminar on Wednesday. Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

How's the pitch? Does it make sense? What sense do you make of it?

   Stephanie: really wanted there to be some kind of abstract: before the goals---'we're working on a new series called 'etc etc'---this works with these kinds of groups to produce a video that _______.

ex--from Skye's email:

"I am currently working on a documentary project that will explore non-traditional and non-formal learning environments in NYC, and I thought the Lower East Side Ecology Center would fit well into the doc. Presently we are in pre-production for the project, and I was hoping you might have a few minutes to chat about the Lower East Side Ecology Center's educational program. I have cc'd my colleague Doug Beacom, who is also working on the project."

Gonzalo: It is important to choose the stories that will accurately and would best represent the organizations that we highlight. Make sure there's transparency so that the organization feels a part of the production process. How will you cover explicit "challenges" or "problems" that may arise?

Usage? would it be linked to a youtube channel with smaller, rougher videos, supplement the whole/main story?

this could be confusing in terms of knowing where the video lives---

Ways to engage audience during PRE/POST production?

what are other ways to engage audience beyond comments and video? facebook apps? NING? something more social.

Ways to publish the video? one 20-30 min shot? shorter, 5-6 min chunks?

seems like its very focused on going from community to community--going to one, then another

maybe look at themes-- ex. 'how are human rights taught?'---for 20' episode, then include AdLab and few other approaches. 

if shorter videos...how do we keep the audience engaged on that story?
make it really compelling and not boring for viewers--

Cinema Veritae or VO approach? what do we feel is most important? Expert Interview to tie-together content?

how should this show break down? episodic? 

Gonzalo: I would highly recommend a narrator to give unity to the story; it will be a way to tie the different groups together.

Adam: Think about a protocol to employ so that the different sections look and feel similar, even though they are different contexts.

Jess: The participatory aspect of the project is really great. I think it's a good idea to involve the students as much as you can in the production process.

Gonzalo: Here are a few ideas I have as a protocol, or structure for telling you story--

1. Location: first establish the context in which the educational setting exists. Why here? Where is it? History of location?

2. Introduce the problem: what is the problem that this educational program addresses? How has the problem existed in the past? In the present? Why are you interested in this problem?

3. Introduce the character(s): who are we watching? Where is/are she/they from? How is/are she/they involved in the the setting? How is/are she/they coping with the problem?

4. Show the process of overcoming the problem: (Students working in the project, teacher's experience)

Ting: Important to decide the story first, then choose cases.

How will this video be used? as a teacher? as an academic? as an organizational leader? as students? for documentary film makers? 

educators--people/professionals in the field of education--looking for cutting edge/peripheral activities going on--

also, (re: LES ecology) art/technology issues could be overlapping--DIY kits demonstrating energy harvesting, composting, etc.  hooking up with those types of people/projects could be a really good way to get kids into exploring those ideas for themselves. 

**which gets back to the THEMATIC focus--do we put out a call

Adam: It would be great if you could have a video response to the segments, or allow students/teachers to post. Students could post videos recommending new experiences, teachers could post videos for pedagogical ideas.

Pranav: Having an embed feature that's easy to use will be important.

could each video have a theme/icon that fits with the Acronym (TEACH Global)

GlobalizEd vs. TEACH Global (out of four people)

Teach Global sounds like something thats going to be foreign-oriented, teaching in other countries...

Globalized gives me the picture of 'globalization' or foreign trade (gives me a very international expectation)

Possible Leads

**Reach the World --> Classes follow sailboats as they sail all over the world. Problem-based learning model; students interact with the people on the boats via blog/email etc. Jess has a contact.

**Penny Harvest (Adam & Simon have contacts) as a community component

** CSA conference this spring--Community Supported Agriculture org by Just Food--ties in TC, local farmers, hooking up people with local food--community supported Agro, and not just Greenmarket system.  (also participate in Americorps )

** Art project (few years old) Drink Pee, Drink Pee--converst urine into drinkable water (kit form)

** Censorship/Free Speech with Web 2.0 (firefox plugin to simulate )

**Professor interested in Activism (Jersey Citizen) Dr. Anna Brown St.Peters College (email from George) works different organizations and grouops

**topic of carreer/skill-shift in response to the economy, job market

the city making a big push to retrain people form the financial job market (Teach NYC, Newton Fellowship, $45 mil to retrain investment bankers who have lost WallStreet jobs) *using education and re-training to keep job core here (in NYC, the US) instead of leaving to find work elsewhere. 

**Sommerville, MA health project to discourage Obesity (modeling in other schools across the country) (stephanie knows people in this communituy)

**MIT tech startups to develop things/devices/systems to assist other countries with health issues (low cost eye care)

** Amy Smith Lemelson Center @ MIT--clean burning cooking fuel, cheaper systems for purifying drinking water.

**NY2NO --website, facebook presence 

**computer programmers in the art world who get together to do this Web 2.0 'knitting circle'--technologically adept people who STILL value their F2F interaction to supplement/support their 'virtual identity'  

** computer displays (conference on Holography) people from Harvard, Womens Hospital--holographic imaging in the health/medecine world--using new imaging technology to better locate tumors, etc--

**re: YouTube--what makes me want to watch these short videos??

if it IS little segments that we shoot--can we single out a 'character' from a shoot, and have them kind of 'star' in the video for that week---'just teach me something' ---each-one-teach-one type videos.
