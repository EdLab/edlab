            The Program for School Improvement (PSI) is aimed at empowering schools to take charge of school based management. In other words, the program has been created in such away that principals can take action towards school improvement without consulting the Ministry of Education. One good aspect about the PSI is that the community is allowed to take part in projects meant to improve the quality of public schools. For instance, in Sri Lanka, parents, teachers, former students, and well wishers from the local community of Galewala have been supporting the principal to improve school infrastructure. The introduction of PSI has also led to the introduction of school-based management and teacher management. These two managerial programs were presented to 40 percent of education zones in Sri Lanka during 2012-2013. Overall, the establishment of school based management and school based teacher development resulted in improving public schools by producing quality teachers to teach students.

Normally, there is so much less that a community can do to improve the quality education of a school. However, the teachers, parents, well wishers, and former students in Galewala showed that a community can contribute so much if they are empowered and given the green light. Moreover, parents who are involved in this program are doing it because they want to do the best they can to support their children's education.
