<p>There’s a new restaurant in London where everything inside is 3D printed… including the food. That’s right, guests at <a href="http://foodink.io">Food Ink</a> eat on 3D printed plates with 3D printed utensils, and watch their food get squeezed out of printers right before their eyes. Luckily, the ink is tastier than in normal 3D printers; potatoes, avocados, chocolate, and passion fruit paste are used throughout the 11-course meal.</p>

<p>The creator of Food Ink thinks that 3D printing food will become commonplace in the future. "It’s the logical next step in terms of convenience, efficiency, sophistication," he said, "and also doing things that couldn’t quite be possible with the human hand, but are possible in our imagination." The company also claims that 3D printing food could help feed the world’s growing population. Perhaps this is true for the future, but for now, each guest pays 250 pounds (roughly $326) to dine on this high tech cuisine. If the company is right and the trend does catch on, however, maybe one day we’ll all have 3D printers wedged in between our microwaves and toasters.</p>

<p>What are the practical applications that 3D printing food could have? Do you think this trend could catch on or do you think it’s a passing fad? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/31038/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:15 dinosossi2:</b>If there are low cost, safe, abundant, and edible raw materials that could be converted into nutritious food, 3D printing could help alleviate food shortages.</p>

<p><b>@01:44 AimeeLee:</b>With advances in food tracking (apps like MyFitnessPal), I could see more people engaging in close-level monitoring of their diets. If someone isn't getting enough Vitamin D or protein, supplementing meals with a 3D printed item that contains their missing nutrients would be an easy and beneficial way to balance diets.</p>
