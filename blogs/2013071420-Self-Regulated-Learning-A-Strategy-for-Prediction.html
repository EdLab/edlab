<p><b>Title:</b> Utilizing Dynamic Bayes Nets to Improve Early Prediction Models of Self-Regulated Learning (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b>Jennifer Sabourin, Bradford Mott, & James Lester</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jlrobiso/papers/umap2013.pdf">User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization Lecture Notes in Computer Science</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
Can we predict self-regulated learning behaviors?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Self-regulated learning is an essential skill for digital students as instructional technologies become more learner-driven and individualized. Self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviors are characterized by students’ motivation, the accuracy of their self-assessment, and their evaluation of appropriate steps towards learning goals. The presence or absence of these behaviors can determine whether students need additional scaffolding to be successful in adaptive learning environments. The authors of <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jlrobiso/papers/umap2013.pdf">Utilizing Dynamic Bayes Nets to Improve Early Prediction Models of Self-Regulated Learning</a> previously published on the identification and prediction of SRL behaviors and this study sought to improve on their prediction strategy.</p> 

<p>The authors studied SRL behavior by observing eighth-grade students engaging with <a href="http://www.intellimedia.ncsu.edu/ci5.html"><i>Crystal Island</i></a>, a microbiology-themed learning game that allows students to play the role of a scientist investigating the origin of a mysterious disease. Players must navigate the island, control their character’s movements and objects, take notes, operate a virtual lab, and collect clues from other characters. 260 eighth-grade students played 55 minutes of <i>Crystal Island</i> for the study. The authors examined written tests administered before and after the game along with game play data to establish 49 indicators of SRL behavior. In their previous work, the authors were able to accurately identify the presence or absence of SRL behaviors in 43% of students during game play. In this study, they sought to improve their prediction rate by identifying key variables and determining the minimum game play time required for SRL identification.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors discovered that their new prediction model performed significantly better than their previous research, with a predictive accuracy of 83.1%. The model created scores in resource use, planning, and monitoring behaviors. Because planning and monitoring impact future behaviors, the authors used a dynamic prediction network and found that the results significantly outperformed those of the static one. Their model was most accurate at identifying students who exhibited low SRL behaviors and could identify these students even if they played only a short time. The model also accurately identified students with medium and high SRL scores, but this took more game play.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study’s focus on time is important; if educators and instructional designers can quickly identify the students that need additional scaffolding, these students will spend less time floundering in educational games. This also means that students with medium and high SRL capabilities will be able to move more quickly through the game and maximize learning without additional frustration. Self-directed and individualized learning is an exciting possibility that has the potential to improve motivation and engagement, and studies like this will help instructional designers develop better adaptive methods. This study had promising results, but a more generic framework could help researchers evaluate and improve on all adaptive learning technologies.</p>
