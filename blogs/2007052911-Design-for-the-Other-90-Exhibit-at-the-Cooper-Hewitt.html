          <p>
            Here's an exciting <a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/index.jsp?fr_story=15f568b60ac9c568d21a17fafca72c6f26afde32">NY Times video</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/science/29cheap.html">NY Times article</a> about an exhibit at the  <a href="http://cooperhewitt.org/"> Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum</a> that talk about designs catering to the 90% of the world's population who make less than $2 a day. These designs are pretty ingenious (well at least as far as I can tell) and still have that Bauhaus dogma of <i>form follows function.</i> 

There is also a comprehensive <a href="http://www.educatorresourcecenter.org/">Educator Resource Center</a> on the site which has lesson plans (with assessments!) with activities that are relevant to many academic subjects.  I believe you have to sign up in order to view them. I wish I had seen this research before I dove into student teaching.  As I read them I got excited.  Some interesting ones were 

-Design Your Own Building: Rhode Island State Police Headquarters
-www.me.com
-Musical Math-terpiece: The Art of Piet Mondrian
-Play on Words Design
-Turn Off the Tube
-Work Hard and Work Smart: Designing for Athletes
-I Like It! Discovering Your Personal Style

There are also <a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org/EDU/av_edu.asp">Videos for Educators</a> as well as curriculum guides, educational programs and even a MA Program in the History of Decorative Arts and Design.  

All in all this museum has many facets, goals and new ideas that are relevant to EdLab's MDC and our galleries. This is my next museum trip to do research and just to plain drool.  But I am hoping for a (ahem) group field trip.
