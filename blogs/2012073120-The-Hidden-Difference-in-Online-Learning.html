<b>The Hidden Difference in Online Learning</b>
</p><p>
The potential benefits of online education in producing a more streamlined, equitable, and effective educational system are obvious to many. But what often gets lost in conversations surrounding the future of digital education are the enormous barriers, both practical and political, standing in the way.  The struggle for online education is as much about clearing away institutional resistance as it is about developing actual programs and curricula. One potential cause of this resistance is uncertainty regarding how effective online educational approaches may be compared to more traditional routes.  
</p><p>
In the service of exploring this issue,  <a href="http://www.ithaka.org/">Ithaka S+R</a>, a digitization research and consulting group, recently conducted a
<a href="http://www.sr.ithaka.org/research-publications/interactive-learning-online-public-universities-evidence-randomized-trials"> study </a> on the effectiveness of online education.  They partnered with a handful of public universities in the Northeast to conduct a randomized trial of a new "hybrid format" introductory statistics course.  Participating students were randomly assigned to either the traditional course, taught entirely through face-to-face instruction, or to a hybrid course, taught mostly through machine-guided instruction, although still retaining an hour of face-to-face instruction a week.  
</p><p>
The results were unsurprising for anyone who has been following the growth in usage and capability of online courses; there was no statistically significant difference in achievement between the two classes, in grades, completion, or test scores.  This parity holds when controlling for any conceivable difference in students, and in the face of the fact that students in the traditional class were spending more time in the learning environment. Students in the hybrid course also claimed to have worked harder for their grades.
</p><p>
In addition to providing insights into learning outcomes, the authors of the report also attempt an analysis of how much cost savings a university could expect in switching away from the traditional model.  Although their results are both preliminary and speculative, they suggest such savings could be as high as 50% of the cost of traditional classroom courses. 
</p><p>
For a long time it’s been apparent that our education system will, eventually, evolve, but when and how are still up for grabs.  What has been missing, so far, are tangible incentives for higher education institutions to change. The coming flood of experimental innovations in higher education that prove to be more cost-effective and at least equally as effective in terms of educational achievement (of which this study is an early example) should provide plenty of ammunition for reformers to put pressure on these traditional institutions, and lead them, one way or another, towards a long-awaited revolution. Only time will tell whether society’s most research-based institutions are themselves immune to the results of research.
