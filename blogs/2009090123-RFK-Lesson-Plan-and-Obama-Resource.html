            One of the big features we will eventually incorporate into the Barack Obama resource is a lesson plan based largely on his life, ideas and principles. I am sure some of you have seen ads on the subway by the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) about the lesson plans they have created about former U.S. Senator and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (RFK) on its website.
 
I decided to check it out for myself. There are three different lesson plans, each designed for a specific grade level. Each lesson plan contains an introduction to the concept of social justice, one of the primary causes of RFK's political life. Furthermore, each lesson contains specific examples of injustices such as the civil rights movements and disenfranchisement to serve as a case study and the lesson plans can be used in various courses. Check out the lesson plans <a href="http://www.nysut.org/cps/rde/xchg/nysut/hs.xsl/rfk.htm">here</a>. 
 
As we all know, a big part of the Obama story is his work in community service. He made it one of the focal points of his first autobiography Dreams From My Father and often reminds any willing ear of his work with residents on Chicago's South Side not long after his college graduation. We can possibly create a whole lesson plan based solely on activism and the importance of community service in our ever changing democracy. The RFK model can serve as an example of how we might want to focus on a specific subject or theme such as the meaning of democracy. What do you think?
