Rob Wong is the Vice President of Product at Udemy, an online skill-sharing site, where he manages the company's product and design initiatives. Prior to Udemy, Rob held positions that ranged from Executive Vice President of a ride-sharing company to Head of Product at Hulu. He received his MBA at Wharton and his BSE in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. We asked him a few questions about his predictions for the future of learning. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>I’ve always loved tinkering with things and figuring out how stuff works. In college, I majored in mechanical engineering because I thought I wanted to be an inventor. I had even gotten into my top grad school choices in engineering when I was recruited by McKinsey and decided to try my hand at management consulting. From there I’ve switched careers a few times: from management consulting to investing to product management and design. At each of those transition points, I’ve had to jump in and learn new skills and capabilities, everything from financial modeling to doing due diligence.</p>
 
<p>At a certain point, I realized I’d strayed too far from my original passion: building things and technology. That’s when I left Wall Street for Silicon Valley and have been working in various aspects of the tech industry since then.</p>
 
<p>This entire process—from my college education to multiple career shifts—really cultivated in me a love of lifelong learning. It was only by embracing learning at every stage of my career that I’ve been able to progress as I have. Today, I’m passionate about helping people keep up with the changing times since I’ve been through those tricky transitions myself. At <a href="http://bit.ly/1N4piss">Udemy</a>, we’re able to help people all over the world keep pace with the innovation in the workplace that’s making lifelong learning even more relevant today.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>At Udemy, everyone is aligned around the same mission: that anyone, anywhere can build the lives they imagine through relevant, accessible, and rewarding courses. That belief that accessible online education can transform lives is what motivates us and keeps us working tirelessly day to day to improve and expand the platform.</p>

<p>To do this, we are empowering experts to share their knowledge with interested students around the world. Rooted in the idea that the best teachers are not always found in a traditional classroom, Udemy has pioneered the leading online marketplace for learning where everyday experts are empowered to share their knowledge with the world. Today, we offer courses in 80+ languages and are reaching over 10 million students in 190 countries. Those are huge numbers and we’re proud of that progress, but it all comes down to changing the learning landscape one student at a time. The rise of online learning can help level the playing field worldwide, and we want to make learning more relevant, accessible, and rewarding to everyone out there.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I’m really interested in competency-based learning and signaling. The overall education industry is becoming more focused on outcomes. While it’s challenging to allow students to demonstrate mastery of a subject at scale, it will ultimately make it much easier for them to drive positive outcomes for themselves. It’ll also help employers better find the right people for their needs.</p>
 
<p>In the working world, another new trend is companies realizing the need to make a greater investment in their employees’ learning and development in order to stay relevant and competitive in today’s marketplace. Businesses have been taking action in a variety of ways to make sure their companies don’t fall behind the times, but one of the exciting ways I’ve been part of this is through our corporate offering, <a href="http://bit.ly/1SJCFuH">Udemy for Business</a>, which offers a scalable learning platform that’s being implemented everywhere from high-growth startups to Fortune 500 enterprises.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>Online learning is still in its infancy so there are a lot of exciting things to work on. One thing we’re focused on is improving our course discovery experience. As an open marketplace with over 40,000 courses, it’s extremely important that we allow students to easily connect with the right course for them. We’re also very focused on our learning experience—how can we make it more engaging, interactive, social and ultimately more effective at helping you gain the skills you need to achieve your goals?</p>
 
<p>One of the specific ways we’re evolving our platform to increase interactivity is through our <a href="http://bit.ly/25V2phh">recent acquisition of TalentBuddy</a>. Many of our coding students had shared with us the need for more hands-on practice and interaction to actively engage with and absorb content. Through this acquisition, we anticipate being able to strengthen our experiential learning capabilities which will, in turn, translate into better learning outcomes for our students.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I had the pleasure of working with <a href="http://bit.ly/1VNwT00">Fred Wilson</a> at my last job and find him to be a really smart investor, as well as being a genuine, down-to-earth guy in general. <a href="http://bit.ly/22p1dOD">Aaron Levie</a> is a riot, insightful, and surprisingly funny for a CEO of an enterprise Saas company. <a href="http://bit.ly/1qE4TQY">Moden Seinfeld</a> is always good for a few laughs.</p>
