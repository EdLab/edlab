            Digital design agency smashLAB <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/04/chapp/">announced that they're building a new topic-based chat platform</a> they're calling <a href="http://chapp.is/">Chapp</a> (chat + app) which marries the functionality of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> with the accessibility of a browser. Though still in the experimental phase, Chapp aims to be as simple to use as Facebook or WhatsApp but with a specialist bent to allow users interested in topic-based discussions to connect with each other.

It's not hard to imagine Chapp being used as an educational tool: hashtagged topics can allow students and teachers to connect to discuss lessons and learning in real time, in and out of the classroom.

Additionally, a mobile-based application has the potential to narrow the digital divide between low-income and middle-to-high-income students in a way that non-mobile online discussion spaces do not.
<!--break-->

According to a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/02/28/how-teachers-are-using-technology-at-home-and-in-their-classrooms/">recent Pew Research survey of Advanced Placement and National Writing Project teachers</a>, 73% say that they and/or their students use their mobile phones in the classroom or to complete assignments, while 43% use tablet computers in the classroom or to complete assignments. The teachers also reported concerns about the digital divide, noting that some students have access to tools at school but not at home and vice versa. Access to devices is significantly different across low- and high- income schools and students, with <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/03/for-low-income-kids-access-to-devices-could-be-the-equalizer/">lower income students barred from using their devices</a> at school in greater numbers than high income students.

An <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/06/26/main-findings-9/">older Pew Research report</a> found that cell phones fill access gaps for people who don't have computers or broadband at home.

The survey looked at cell internet users, and found that 79% of adults with household incomes less than $49,999 go online mostly using their phones. Pew broke down the figures even further: the percentage of cell-mostly users with household incomes less than $30,000 is 43% â€“ the difference is striking compared to the 21% of cell-mostly users who earn above $75,000.

"Cell-mostly" users gave various reasons for why they mostly used their phones, but the report teased out that 30% of "cell mostly" users do not have broadband connections at home and highlighted the differences between "cell-mostly" and "cell-occasionally" internet users.

So how does this relate to Chapp?

Low-income students seem to have more access to mobile devices than they do to at-home broadband computers, and many online discussion forums traditionally used in education settings (Blackboard, Moodle, etc.) are not optimal for mobile devices. Right now, Chapp supports text-based chat and enables users to create public and private chatrooms, but smashLAB aims to grow it towards real-time web technologies -- I think this is where the educational uses of Chapp have the potential to shine. By allowing students to connect with teachers and other students in a native or mobile web app discussion forum, Chapp -- or another tool like it -- could be an equalizer in and out of the classroom.
