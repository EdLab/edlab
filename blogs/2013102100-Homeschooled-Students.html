            School choice is often one of the most important choices parents must make for their children. Some parents choose public or private school while others decide to homeschool their children. Like other school children, home school students can attend college and most parents have to prepare their children for college. The best time to start planning home school students for college is when they are in middle school. They also have to make sure their students have a brief idea of what they want to study in college and make sure they meet the college requirements. Most public school students start preparing for the SAT during their sophomore year while some homeschool students start preparing in their last year of their middle school. During the SAT or ACT, homeschooled students have to score two higher than those of public or private school students. 

The parents of homeschooled students also have to keep test scores, grades, and the courses their children take since colleges require transcripts and homeschooled students can't provide one. The parents are also the ones responsible for keeping track of the projects, volunteer works and others like educated trips and outside courses. Schools are usually the ones to keep track of the SAT scores and others but with homeschooled students, the parents have to make sure to keep track of all of their children's college going process and requirements.
