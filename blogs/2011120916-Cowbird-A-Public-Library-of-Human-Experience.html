            Check out this incredible new story-telling tool! I posted about it on <a href="http://navigatingmedia.tumblr.com/#!/post/13981481384/humanizing-the-news-this-is-how">my personal media blog</a> , but I'll share here as well:

<a href="http://cowbird.com/about/">Cowbird</a> calls itself a public library of human experience, and it really is. It combines the best social media tools out there into clean, beautiful design to create a new, human, crowd-sourced community. 

What can you do? Keep and audio-visual diary of your life using text, photography, sound, subtitles, maps, tags, timelines, characters, roles, and dedications (all explained on the site). Document “sagas,” that is, big events going on the world, through collaborative journalism. Contribute to a public library of simple human stories.

It was developed by a fantastic team including Jonathan Harris. He writes: “We are focused on a slower kind of storytelling than the frantic world of tweets and social networks. We use these tools (they are part of our consciousness now) but we also feel a craving for a longer-lasting kind of self-expression, so we have designed a space for self-reflection and deeper connection – a place for personal stories. Stories allow us to untangle experience, make sense of our lives, and find meaning. They are containers for wisdom and lifeboats for memory – helping us not to forget, and then later, not to be forgotten.”

And why is it called Cowbird? Best explanation ever: “We chose the name Cowbird to express the combined qualities of a cow and a bird. Cows are slow, steady, and grounded, while birds are fast, free, and full of joy. Most of the Internet – including websites like Facebook and Twitter – are all bird and no cow, while more traditional formats like novels and operas are all cow and no bird. Cowbird combines these two extremes to form a new kind of storytelling medium – mixing the slow, deeply rooted, contemplative idea of a cow with the fast, efficient, playful idea of a bird.”

You need an invite to sign up, which you can get by submitting a <a href="https://cowbird.com/request-invite/">mini-application</a>.

The first story I read, and loved: <a href="http://cowbird.com/stories/most-viewed/#/2499">The 1%</a>. 

Also check out <a href="http://number27.org/">Jonathan Harris</a>. His work is incredibly interesting and I hope we can see him at the lab one day. Until then, I'll work on reviewing something by him on <a href="http://dar.pressible.org/">The Data Art Review</a>.
