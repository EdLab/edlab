<p>In a country as geographically vast as the United States, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the majority of country roads haven't been digitally mapped. While this challenge is nothing new for people, it does present a technical challenge with the advent of self-driving cars. Autonomous vehicles rely largely on 3D maps that include the exact locations of lanes, curbs, and signs, information which isn’t available for many country roads. This makes self-driving cars far better suited to cities and other well-traveled areas.</p>

<p> To address the problems these vehicles face on unmapped roads, MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory has created a system called MapLite, which only requires GPS and a series of sensors that detect road conditions. The researchers hope that this technology will increase the feasibility and safety of autonomous vehicles in more rural areas.</p> 

<p>Do you think this technology will be able to solve the problems that unmapped roads pose for self-driving cars? Would you trust a car to drive more safely in the country than a human? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/43947">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:00 Betsy Harrington: </b>I have no doubt that technology will soon be able to create self-driving cars that can drive safely on all roads. No matter how advanced AI becomes, however, it will be difficult for a self-driving car to earn my trust. I know that human error accounts for most accidents, but trust is not an algorithm. Just like I would have a hard time trusting a robot to babysit my children, it would be difficult for me to hand over my responsibility at the wheel to a self-driving car, especially if kids are in the backseat.</p>

<p><b>@00.44 Sara Hardman: </b>As someone from an area with a lot of curvy country roads up and down the side of mountains... I'd be worried about using self-driving cars on this terrain, to say the least. This is especially true when it's raining, or when the roads are covered with a dusting of snow. The sensors on this car would never be able to read the edges of the road!</p>
