Marissa Lowman is the Executive Director and a co-founder of <a href="http://learnlaunch.org/">LearnLaunch</a>, an initiative that creates support and growth for edtech and learning companies in New England. Most recently, she worked in sales and marketing at mobile payments startup AisleBuyer, which was acquired by Intuit. Lowman taught in Germany on a Fulbright Fellowship, worked for Teach For America and helped grow the National Partnership for Educational Access (NPEA) at the <a href="http://www.tsf.org/">Steppingstone Foundation</a>. She also served as a member of the steering committee of Boston Leaders for the Future of Education (BLFE). In addition, she served as the Marketing Director for <a href="http://dartboston.com/">DartBoston</a>, which helps emerging entrepreneurs start companies. Lowman received her BA from Johns Hopkins University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> My background is in both education and technology, so I think my current work is a culmination of the diverse experiences I have had. While teaching abroad, both in Germany and Honduras, I noticed that students had very little access to technology. Many of them had computers at home, but their school environments were not that different from mine growing up - i.e., physical textbooks, handwritten quizzes, etc. I also noticed this trend when I worked with non-profits and schools across the country at <a href="http://www.tsf.org/">The Steppingstone Foundation</a>. The programs were doing amazing work, but struggled with how to manage student data and how to easily share it with parents, students, and teachers. 
<p>
Shortly after moving to Boston, I became involved in the local startup community and realized that technology could really help the education sector thrive. I honed my technology skills at AisleBuyer, a mobile payments startup that got acquired by Intuit. Working there increased my awareness of the challenges startups must overcome in order to successfully launch a new product in an industry that is averse to change. We were trying to change ingrained habits in both customers and companies by convincing them that it was faster and more cost effective to pay for items on their mobile devices.
<p>
I decided to found the organization EdTechup to bring together the diverse stakeholders in the edtech community. I organized monthly events for edtech entrepreneurs to connect and build relationships. As I grew EdTechup, there began to be a larger demand for technology in the classroom and the edtech industry suddenly became trendy. I ended up meeting my co-founders through this organization and we collaborated to build something bigger: an edtech ecosystem.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> When <a href="http://learnlaunch.org/">LearnLaunch</a> first started, there were around 150 edtech startups in New England. Nearly two years later, there are over 300 edtech startups in the ecosystem. I believe that LearnLaunch plays a crucial role in helping these companies, most of which are early stage startups, grow into successful businesses. We offer classes, Meetups, conference, peer learning groups, and other opportunities that help support and grow the local edtech ecosystem. In addition, we have a selective accelerator called <a href="http://learnlaunchx.com/">LearnLaunchX</a> that works with 6-8 companies per class to help them refine their product and be investor ready by the end of an intensive 3-month residential program.
<p>
In turn, these companies are improving the learning landscape by providing schools and parents with tools to help students learn more effectively. Successful companies help raise awareness about the unique challenges edtech companies face and bring more investment dollars to an industry that investors have traditionally ignored.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> I think mobile learning is a trend that has already taken off in developing countries and will continue to spread as more people have access to educational content on their mobile devices and companies build educational apps that multiple platforms support. Companies that offer students the option to easily switch from one platform to another (i.e., mobile device to tablet to laptop) are the most likely to be successful because they are catering to the way a new generation of learners has become accustomed to interacting with technology. 
<p>
I also see data-informed instruction as a trend that will impact learning in the future. Right now, teachers have more access to student data than ever before, but they still need tools to easily manage and interpret that data. In the future, I hope teachers will spend less time grading and more time determining the best ways to help each student improve his or her weaknesses. 
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am currently working on expanding the LearnLaunch community to reach more educators. I think it is really important that early stage edtech entrepreneurs have the chance to get feedback from educators about their products so they can build products that educators truly want and need instead of products they think educators want and need.
<p>
We recently held a Beta Teacher event that showcased emerging edtech products to local K-12 teachers. We have found that many teachers want the opportunity to try out new technologies but don’t have time to research the overwhelming number of available options. Events like these allow teachers to meet startup founders, many of whom are former teachers themselves, and interact with products before purchasing them. We plan to offer more opportunities for educators and entrepreneurs to connect in the future.
<p>
My next big project is organizing our third annual Across Boundaries conference, which will take place on January 23-34, 2015 at Harvard Business School. The conference brings together educators, entrepreneurs, investors, industry experts, and students to discuss the future of education technology and learn from one another. We are excited about next year's conference because it will be bigger and better than ever - we plan to have over 500 attendees.
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> In terms of edtech news, I think both <a href="https://twitter.com/Getting_Smart">@Getting_Smart</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/EdSurge">@EdSurge</a> offer unique content and provide insights into the industry as a whole.
<p>
If you’re looking to buff up on your knowledge of history and geography, I would recommend checking out <a href="https://twitter.com/HstryOrg">@HstryOrg</a> since the company tweets a lot about those topics. They have also live tweeted historical events, which is a great way to get middle and high schoolers engaged in learning about history through an immersive experience. Last April, they tweeted Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride in real time.
