            What would a manifesto for online learning contain if it was written strictly from the learner's perspective?  How would it differ from one written from an instructor-driven perspective?  <a href="http://www.education.ed.ac.u /swop/manifesto.html">This manifesto</a> was created by teachers and researchers in online education at the University of Edinburgh, MSc in E-learning 2011 and aims to do just that...

Favorite lines: <i>Visual and hypertextual representations allow arguments to emerge, rather than be stated.  Distance is not a deficit, but a privileged perspective. Assessment is a creative crisis as much as it is a statement of knowledge.</i> 

Listed below is my attempt at a learner's manifesto - <b>feel free to add your own in the comments below!</b>  Lets generate ideas to use as inspiration for our mSchool course delivery platform! 

<b>Learning 3.0 Manifesto...</b>
-Students are consumers of media/learning/knowledge and should be treated with the same respect and individual attention you would give a client or customer. 

-As a consumer of learning I demand to be offered 24hr access to my learning materials, platform and discussions related to the course. 

-The best "tools" and techniques for the job should be sourced and integrated into all materials, whether this is video-based lectures, adaptive learning technologies or advanced discussion boards.  

-Let the best content creators win... whether big-name, small boutique or an individual.  The proof is in the quality of the material.

-BYOD... I demand to be able to access my course materials on the device of my choosing, or one rented from an institution.  

-Grading and assessment should be both qualitative and quantitative.  Given throughout course delivery with frequent opportunities for all parties to pivot and provide remedial help based on micro-tests, not simply 2-3 x's a semester after a major exam.  

-IQ and EQ will be united... through the quality of my engagement with others in online discussion boards and peer feedback. Self assessment will play a larger role in my experience as well...

Is this too much to ask of online learning?  Or learning in the classroom?  Perhaps. But it never hurts to ask!
