<i>Our mission is to create really fun toys that develop spatial skills and teach basic engineering principles. By designing construction toys from the female perspective, we aim to appeal to a broader audience of children and parents who previously considered engineering a "boys club." By challenging this stereotype, we hope to inspire more girls like Debbie, like Goldie, to become engineers </i> (<a href=" http://www.goldieblox.com/">Goldieblox</a>). 


<p>
<b>Toys for Change</b><br>
<a href="http://www.goldieblox.com/">GoldieBlox</a> hopes to provide unique, self-guided, engineering-inspired construction toys and books for girls. This "engineering toy" and corresponding book collection attempts to create more hands-on, project-based play that will ultimately inspire young women to pursue STEM-related careers.  <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2012/10/05/meet-goldie-blox-goldilocks-long-lost-cousin-the-engineer/">Ms. Magazine’s blog</a> describes the main character Goldie as, "a young inventor who builds her way to solutions" and appropriately, the toys were created by Stanford-trained Engineer, Debbie Sterling.  Sterling shares with NLT the focus for the initial toy set and subsequent ones currently in development, "The first story introduces engineering broadly as a career and tells how Goldie comes from a family of engineers. Future stories will explore different facets of engineering, from mechanical to electrical to software engineering."  GoldieBlox is still in production (slated for delivery in Spring 2013) and the initial prototype was promoted and successfully funded this past fall on crowd-funding platform <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/16029337/goldieblox-the-engineering-toy-for-girls?ref=live">Kickstarter</a>.  Sterling describes the reason for this success to NLT, "I think the Kickstarter campaign was successful because GoldieBlox fills a major void in the toy aisle. Girls deserve more options than dolls and princesses."  
<p>
<b>Massively Underrepresented</b><br>
Nationally and internationally a wide range of groups are attempting initiatives to encourage young women and girls, who are currently massively underrepresented in STEM, to engage and pursue these increasingly in-demand fields.   The White House even recently created the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/24/fact-sheet-equal-futures-partnership-expand-women-s-political-and-econom">Equal Futures Partnership</a> which is focused on, "a renewed commitment to opening more doors to high-quality education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for women and girls, who currently hold only one-quarter of all US jobs in these fields despite making up nearly half of the total US workforce."  Even globally through PSA’s <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/3957">like this one</a> created by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a>, groups far and wide are attempting to STEM the rising tide of male-dominance in these fields. Beyond government initiatives, over 5K parents and other backers voted with their wallets and enabled Sterling to raise over $285,881 in a matter of weeks through <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/16029337/goldieblox-the-engineering-toy-for-girls?ref=live">her Kickstarter campaign</a>.  This funding enabled her to place the initial minimum order necessary to produce GoldieBlox.  Sterling noted the transformative potential motivating funders, "People recognize that GoldieBlox is more than just a toy, it's about shifting a paradigm." 
<p>
<b>Pink-washing</b><br>
Despite widening interest in increasing female engagement in STEM through dedicated toys (check-out this <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/31">NLT Review of Little Bits</a>) and national and global initiatives, there have been recent disappointments.  In particular, <a href="http://www.lego.com/">Lego</a>, a traditionally gender-neutral maker of open-ended construction sets, recently released a girl-focused offering, <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">Lego Friends</a>.  Comprised of "cute" minifigures with budding breasts and pink and purple fashion-forward clothing, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/04/lego-friends-feminists-think-twice">many women rejected the toys</a> as "pandering" and lacking the same emphasis on open-ended play found in Lego’s classic ranges.  Toy industry experts even questioned the product’s placement in the <a href="http://www.globaltoynews.com/2012/01/lego-friends-excites-target-disappoints.html">"girl’s section"</a> as opposed to keeping the sets in the same space as the other Lego construction kits.  If you have explored Lego’s "Friends" <a href="http://friends.lego.com/en-us/Games/default.aspx">site</a> it is clear that the career opportunities they feature are limited to food service, beauty or animal care, all traditionally "nurturing" female-friendly careers.  Those fields included in the STEM pantheon (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) are conspicuously missing, and yet, omnipresent in sets <a href="http://powerfunctions.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx?icmp=COUSFR30PowerFuctions">like these</a> aimed at male Lego consumers. While still embracing "soft textures, curved edges and attractive colors which are all innately appealing to girls" the GoldieBlox set keeps the focus firmly on engineering and open-ended construction.  Sterling is clearly sending a message that pink and purple are perfectly acceptable colors for girls’ toys, as long as they can wear pink and purple lab coats while they calculate the trajectory of their unique STEM careers.

<b> Exclusive NLT interview with GoldieBlox founder, Debbie Sterling </b> 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What do you hope to accomplish with GoldieBlox in the next year?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> We have two big goals for the next year: 
1. Getting GoldieBlox on the shelves of stores worldwide to give as many girls as possible the opportunity to play with Goldie. 2. We are working to expand into an entire series of books+construction toys that explore different engineering principles and new characters.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What kind of learning objectives are you hoping GoldieBlox will create and facilitate for girls? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> We hope GoldieBlox will instill an early interest in engineering, teach them about simple machines and inspire them to tinker and build whatever they dream up.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Why do you think your Kickstarter campaign was able to raise and exceed your goals?  Is the time ripe for STEM-focused toys for young women?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> I think the Kickstarter campaign was successful because GoldieBlox fills a major void in the toy aisle. Girls deserve more options than dolls and princesses. They deserve toys that challenge their minds and get them interested in science, technology, engineering and math. People recognize that GoldieBlox is more than just a toy, it's about shifting a paradigm. I couldn't be more passionate about this on a personal level, and I think that authenticity really showed through in the video. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How is GoldieBlox unique from other girl-focused toys like "Lego Friends?"<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> The main reason why GoldieBlox is unique from other construction toys is that it has a narrative. Instead of the traditional instruction manual that accompanies most construction toys, GoldieBlox comes with a story about Goldie, the girl inventor who loves to build. As girls read along, they get to build what Goldie builds. The story is quirky, humorous and relates to girls' lives. It makes engineering accessible and relevant to them. The other uniqueness about GoldieBlox is that the construction pieces themselves are designed to mimic common household items and craft products. Girls already have familiarity with these tools, which makes them even more excited to build with them.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Your sets include pinks and purples... can you describe how you worked to differentiate them from other toys with similar color schemes?   What careers and iconography do you use in the sets?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> The GoldieBlox color palette is quite unique from everything we've seen on the market. Construction toys are typically done in either primary colors or pinks and pastels. GoldieBlox has a modern color palette featuring marigold yellow, sky blue, persimmon, rouge and mint. We did this intentionally to offer something different, and plan on expanding the color palette as we grow. The first story introduces engineering broadly as a career and tells how Goldie comes from a family of engineers. Future stories will explore different facets of engineering, from mechanical to electrical to software engineering.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What were your favorite toys growing up?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> My favorite game growing up was Pictionary. I used to play it for hours with my family.
