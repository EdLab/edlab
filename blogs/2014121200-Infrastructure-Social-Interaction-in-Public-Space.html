            Urban infrastructure has been an essential part of the development of cities. It is important to determine how seasons and time affects the use of public spaces and infrastructure. According to this <a href="http://www.publicspace.org/en/text-library/eng/b003-collective-culture-and-urban-public-space">piece</a>, infrastructures in public space impact and affect social interaction between people of different ages, culture, and ethnicity. Generally, the presence of people in a place is a good enough reason to start some sort of interaction. New York City is highly populated and infrastructures such MTA, bridges, schools, community centers, parks, malls and sports arenas all play essential roles in interaction in an urban environment.

Infrastructure in public space encourages social interactions. A prime example is a person going to a Yankee game. The stadiums, alongside public transportation systems, are vital in promoting a vibrant environment and encouraging interaction. It also contributes to the needs of the neighborhood. It allows local shops to thrive and bring in new businesses such as food carts and t-shirts stands. The game brings people of different ages, cultures and social class together. Most of the people watching the game are just fans that came by public transportation or cars. The Major Deegan highway is perfect for bringing people in and out of the neighborhood to see the game. The immediate area during a game allows for interactions between fans and local businesses such restaurants, and pubs. The interaction is influenced by social and cultural context. Interaction ranges between adults, children, social classes and gender. Many infrastructures promote social welfare for the residents in the neighborhood.
