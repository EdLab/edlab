<p>Social media is everywhereâ€”including emergency rooms. A new study from </i>The American Journal of Surgery</i> is a pioneering examination of mobile technology use within the high-stakes setting of emergency medicine. This study embedded the <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">popular messaging service WhatsApp</a> within an emergency surgical team. For those who are unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a cross-platform mobile messaging app with 500 million users who can exchange messages for free.</p>
 
<p>Research was conducted at a London hospital using a mixed-method approach. All 40 members of an emergency services team used WhatsApp continuously for 19 weeks to report on their duties. Modes of communication as well as response times were monitored. </p>
 
<p>Analysis of 1,495 medical events from over 1,110 hours of communications concerning 636 patients led to two major findings. First, attending physicians were the team members who initiated the greatest number of instruction-giving communications. This contrasted with interns, who asked the most clinical questions. And second, in terms of message receivers, residents were typically the team members who responded most quickly to questions sent by interns and attending physicians. Respondents reported that they felt that WhatsApp flattened the hierarchy of team communications. The study concluded that WhatsApp is a safe and efficient communication technology, which could prove foundational in improving hospital care using mobile phones.</p>
 
<p>Smartphones are making inroads into classrooms from the elementary to graduate level. As a result, any studies that provide insights into their use in dynamic environments like emergency rooms are welcome. A useful analog of an emergency room would be potentially combustible situations in traditional educational environments. These could either be on a macro school-wide level (e.g. using smartphones to monitor students during unpredictable recess periods) or a micro classroom level (e.g. reporting student misbehavior to administrators). Perhaps smartphones could help manage difficult situations, like behavioral outbursts, in a more effective manner. The text-based nature of messaging services could also make a permanent record of behavioral events to allow follow-up and prevent teacher liability. If teachers could communicate to educational mentors regarding acute management or curricular problems in real-time, smartphones could alleviate the professionally isolating environment that new teachers often experience in the classroom.</p>
 
<p>There are potential problems in the widespread adoption of mobile technology for classroom purposes. For example, spotty connectivity could be an issue if school staff members begin to rely exclusively on smartphones or other communications devices like walkie-talkies. An obsessive social media user may also neglect more important professional duties (e.g., teaching, mentoring, etc.) due to excessive smartphone use. Finally, secure networks would be necessary to preserve the integrity of sensitive student data. </p>
 
<p>Given these competing arguments, if staff can negotiate a thoughtful, nuanced, comprehensive, site-specific smartphone policy, this would allow further exploration of an exciting new tool for not only emergency rooms but also schools, colleges, universities, and beyond. </p>
