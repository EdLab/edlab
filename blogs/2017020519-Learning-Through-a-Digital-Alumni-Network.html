<p><i>"Tassl is made up of passionate alumni, technology enthusiasts, and engagement specialists looking to change the game when it comes to building network engagement"</i> (<a href="https://tassl.com/team">About Tassl</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>No Longer Sink or Swim</b></p>
 
<p>Learning doesn’t stop when you graduate. However, it does seem more difficult when you have been pushed into the world all alone. Isolation after graduation can be daunting, so technology that engages former students beyond the occasional <i>donate</i> letter is necessary. Universities find it incredibly difficult to retain meaningful engagement with students once they have graduated. <a href="https://tassl.com">Tassl</a> is a new platform that plans to change all that by creating mini ecosystems for alumni networks. The app could provide a useful service for universities seeking to cultivate a stronger school identity, culture, and opportunities for ideas to be exchanged.</p>
 
<p><b>Alumni App Engagement</b></p>
 
<p>Tassl works with schools and students to help plan meetups, share professional accomplishments, and provide resources. The network also quantifies engagement data so colleges can see if their graduate outreach is effective. Built-in Tassl points, awards, and challenges create incentives for alumni to attend conferences and cultural events, and participate in charities within their universities and the greater society. Unlike applications like LinkedIn, on this platform people are able to create more authentic connections that don’t reveal your information to potential employers (unless you end up working for a former classmate). Your network only consists of university peers, so you are able to share ideas and engage freely.</p>
 
<p><b>Alumni Building School Culture</b></p>
 
<p>Research has pointed to the effects of school culture on learning. This explains why building a community around a school through technology has the potential to affect current students and alumni. Many learners chose to attend a particular university because of the culture and people they would encounter. Alumni who remain connected to the school offer current undergraduates the opportunity to learn from individuals who participated in the institution and garner strong social networks that could lead to partnerships and employment. </p>
 
<p>Alumni are some of the largest group of neglected learners. When they are not in a classroom or an office, opportunities for them to develop and connect with others are rare. Using technology to keep this group engaged is a low-barrier, cost-effective method that is guaranteed to benefit schools and students. Tassl is pioneering the cultivation of postgraduate networking techniques.</p>
