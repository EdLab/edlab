<p><a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva </a> is a graphic design tool for iPad that lets users create professional looking graphics with premade layouts, stock images, and powerful photo editing. This free app has many applications for teachers, students, and entrepreneurs and boasts its own robust instructional section to help even novices create exceptional designs. Canva's simple interface, intuitive editing gestures, and superlative portability truly make this application an essential asset for professionals and design newbies alike.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Users can start editing, creating, and playing with existing designs the moment they open the application. Simply click on a design layout type to begin transforming a blank canvas with a number of pre-loaded backgrounds, texts, layouts, and other document elements that are sure to catch the eye of even the most-experienced graphic designer. Designs are entirely customizable and pre-fabricated templates can be tweaked and edited to accommodate all kinds of media including PowerPoint lesson slides, poster presentations, blog graphics, and social media collages; users can even create business cards to ensure their "brand" is consistent across all media. Advanced designers can also generate their own template, specifying dimensions for their specific graphic needs.</p>

<p>For users who need a little extra guidance, Canva offers an impressive collection of tutorials, tips, and tricks in their "Design School" section. Each tutorial provides detailed instructions and examples of excellent designs, covering important elements like font selection, color relationships, and photo editing. Additionally, teachers and educators can benefit from Canva's targeted lesson plans, formulated to inspire students to think and express themselves creatively. One of the best features of Canva is that it automatically saves projects to the user's account; this means that projects started on an iPad can be finished in the application's web interface. Users can edit on the fly and rest assured that their designs are both safe and instantly accessible no matter where they go.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The biggest drawback of this application is that it is not available on Android, mobile, or other tablet devices yet. The website suggests that an Android version could be available in the future, but there are no immediate plans for its development. Premium images, graphics, and backgrounds cost extra; at $1 each, a simple poster or presentation can turn expensive rather quickly.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Canva is an exceptional design tool and resource for those looking to up their creative ante. Not only is it a free tool, it enables users of all skill-levels to produce high quality, attractive designs on one simple application. The resource makes designing an attractive and eye-catching presentation, approachable and even fun. </p>
