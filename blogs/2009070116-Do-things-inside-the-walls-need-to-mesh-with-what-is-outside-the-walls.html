            a couple things on my mind. i mentioned the big lab notebook in my first post but then was directed to this talk at columbia on open notebook science. fastforward to 20 minutes in to see Jean-Claude Bradley's work using free tools for chemistry online and open. Very inspiring.

http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/open-science-good-research-good-researchers

Also related to this are these notes regarding the using of free services in libraries for the declining economy.

http://theshiftedlibrarian.com/archives/2009/03/05/pcma-presentation-embracing-free-technology-in-a-global-recession.html
<blockquote>
"the #1 rule is that the organization totally loses control in this environment. if someone wants to say something bad about you, they don't need your site/platform to do it so embrace it.
do you use free or proprietary and build your own?"
</blockquote>
I've seen a lot of great tools built by the edlab. Are these usually designed to work with existing web services or as separate walled off areas? Is the default behavior to be open or closed? Is there a concensus here or an ongoing discussion?

Also, earlier last week I got to meet with Patricia Renfro and Kenny Crews who work with the main Columbia library system. Costs for journal licensing is over $10 million a year for their library. Obviously this is changing and how does it happen? Does it happen by bringing these journals systems under control of the library? or does it happen by building a completely different system of documentation for scholarly communication? Of course, if we agree that it is likely to be distributed, then how do these systems need to play with each other? RSS/tags/comments/XML/import/export/etc?
It seems to me there is a lot of room for meta layers that use existing free systems but provide more linking between them. Something like a more configurable and customizable version of friendfeed which would show all the distributed portions of a project and how they evolve. In this particular option, you would leave the photos to flickr, the video to youtube, the blogging to blogger, and then assembly and tracking would be a layer on top. I think these new tools are very exciting for their ability to change the focus of the academic tenure system from products to process. 

And I will tack on 2 other articles I recently came across regarding the challenges faced by the university system.

http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge288.html#tapscott
<blockquote>
"The old-style lecture, with the professor standing at the podium in front of a large group of students, is still a fixture of university life on many campuses. It's a model that is teacher-focused, one-way, one-size-fits-all and the student is isolated in the learning process. Yet the students, who have grown up in an interactive digital world, learn differently. Schooled on Google and Wikipedia, they want to inquire, not rely on the professor for a detailed roadmap. They want an animated conversation, not a lecture. They want an interactive education, not a broadcast one that might have been perfectly fine for the Industrial Age, or even for boomers. These students are making new demands of universities, and if the universities try to ignore them, they will do so at their peril." </blockquote>

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27taylor.html
<blockquote>
"GRADUATE education is the Detroit of higher learning. Most graduate programs in American universities produce a product for which there is no market (candidates for teaching positions that do not exist) and develop skills for which there is diminishing demand (research in subfields within subfields and publication in journals read by no one other than a few like-minded colleagues), all at a rapidly rising cost (sometimes well over $100,000 in student loans)."
</blockquote>
