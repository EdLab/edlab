<p>Have you ever wanted to become famous on social media? For anyone who has, there are programs aimed at teaching the skills required to become the next big thing online. One such program is the 10-day immersive Creator Camp in Los Angeles that caters specifically to teens and young adults. This overnight camp teaches young people skills such as directing, lighting, marketing, and networking to prepare them to be the internetâ€™s next social media influencers.</p>

<p>Being a social media influencer means that you have collected a large enough viewership base to get offers from companies to feature sponsored content and advertisements. Essentially, you are using your status as a social media star to influence viewers to buy certain products. And while this might be an elusive goal, if reached, it can be a lucrative one. YouTubers with seven million followers can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2017/04/10/earning-power-heres-how-much-top-influencers-can-make-on-instagram-and-youtube/#2833111a24db">make as much as $300,000</a> per ad campaign. True, seven million is a difficult number to achieve, yet even 100,000 Instagram followers could land you $5,000 per sponsored post.</p>

<p>Would you send your child, or yourself, to a social media influencer camp? What might be the benefits or the negative repercussions of a camp like this? Answer these and more questions <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/39948">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@03:44 GeorgeNantwi:</b> Part of how individuals become social media influencers is their charm, talent, and credentials. None of these were mentioned in the video. I believe it gives a false sense of potential fame for people who lack in all these areas. Not everyone can become a social media influencer.</p>

<p><b>@03:58 RyanAllen:</b> I went to space camp as a kid. While I didn't grow up to be an astronaut, I did gain valuable insights in science that I could draw on in school later on. How can this camp translate these skills to something else valuable for the campers? Perhaps something in PR and advertising or organizational planning?</p>
