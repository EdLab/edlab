            “They are the Ritz-Carlton of video discussion sites.”

Pushing monetary criticisms aside, this is a grand comparison to make; regardless of industry, this is the one that company service teams the world over strive to achieve. The Ritz-Carlton is legendary for its praiseworthy customer service, with thousands of travelers a day indulging in the favorable displays of hospitality. 

Perhaps none were more appreciative of the signature M.O. than the little boy who lost his beloved stuffed giraffe, Joshie. 

When the father of this boy, Chris Hurn, learned of the loss (over anguished cries from his son, no doubt), he promptly pacified his son by telling him not to worry, that Joshie merely decided to extend his vacation at the Ritz-Carlton and that he would return soon. Shortly after he told his white lie, the hotel called to inform him that Joshie had been found amidst the laundry! Greatly relieved, Chris tried to push his luck even further. He told the person on the other end of the phone about the lie he told his son, and asked that person if there was a way that they could take a picture of Joshie by the pool (to support his “extended stay” story).  Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly, for anyone who was aware of their reputation before), the staff person on the other end of the phone agreed to do it. 

Fast forward a few days, and Chris receives a package from the Ritz-Carlton's Loss Prevention Team. Among the items inside was a photo album.... starring Joshie! The staff over at the Ritz-Carlton didn't just stop at the pool photo; apparently Joshie met other stuffed buddies, drove a golf cart, and even became a member of the Loss Prevention team himself (he has the ID badge to prove it). Needless to say, Chris and his wife were floored by the effort put forth by the staff members at the Ritz-Carlton.

Going above and beyond the call of duty shows customers that you are willing to make them a priority.  Becoming a top-notch customer service organization is invaluable to a brand. 

The following lessons garnered from the actions of the Ritz-Carlton should be heeded as sage advice to burgeoning (and established) businesses:

<!--break-->

<b>1. Reputation is everything.</b> According to Pete Blackshaw, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Satisfied-Customers-Three-Friends-Angry/dp/038552272X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212266775&sr=1-1">satisfied customers tell 3 friends, angry customers tell 3000.</a> Although, in the age of blogs and microblogs, I'd argue that the scales are near-balanced. Hyperbole aside, the message is clear: people like to talk. The way they describe their experience with a company colors the perception of the people they are talking to. While not everyone will walk away from a service exchange with feelings meriting a public display of adoration, it's probably better than the alternative.

VS.

<b>2. It's a competitive advantage.</b> Sure, low prices are a draw but people are willing to pay more for higher quality service. Customers place higher value on companies that offer excellent service and  feel that these companies have <a href="http://about.americanexpress.com/news/docs/2011x/AXP_2011_csbar_market.pdf">“earned their business.”</a>
 
<b>3. Customers can spur innovation. </b>It wasn't long ago that parents of toddlers complained that they didn't want their kids wearing diapers any more nor did they want them to wet the bed. The result: the Huggies pull-up diaper. Being attentive and empathic allows companies to see things from the customers' perspective. Like their customers, companies may begin to question why certain policies, features, and products do (or do not) exist. 

They say no press is bad press, but good press is better press! To be known as an exemplar of service across industries is a noble achievement, and one that the team behind our own Vialogues is willing to commit to. Maybe someday someone will even dedicate a blog post to <i>our</i> commitment. 

“They are the Vialogues of luxury hotel chains.”
