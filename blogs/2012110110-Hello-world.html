            Hi there! This is Nara, the newest EdLabber! I'm really excited to be here on day 1 of what I hope will be an incredible journey. I'm looking forward to collaborating and contributing and meeting the rest of the team.

I hope everyone weathered the storm okay! I live uptown (on the east side) so nothing really happened, didn't lose power or anything at all. I did host a friend who had preemptively evacuated her place in Brooklyn, so we spent a cozy 3 days inside while we waited for things to go back to normal. She still had to work so I didn't want to distract her with the TV or anything, so I spent most of my time reading. It's been a while since I spent that much time just reading and nothing else; it was a nice change!

One of the books I read (or re-read, rather) was <i>Little Women</i>, which was actually one of the first complete novels I read in English. I'm originally from The Netherlands and my native language is Dutch, but my family moved to Germany when I was 9, and my parents enrolled me in an international school, so I had to learn English. I actually /hated/ English at first, and actively rebelled against having to learn it, but I was blessed with a very talented 4th grade teacher, Ms. Powell. She liked to tie in creative writing projects with all of our English grammar and reading lessons, which inspired me to work hard at mastering English because I had a wild imagination and a lot of stories to share. I went from basic vocabulary and barely being able to remember the conjugation of the verb "to go" at the beginning of the school year to perfect fluency, reading novels like <i>Little Women</i>, and having written a short "novel" of my own by the end of the year.

Anyway, I just thought that little anecdotes reflects perfectly the EdLab's mission to improve education &mdash; so that hopefully one day all students will be able to have the same great learning experiences I had!
