            On the eve of a highly contested and bitter election season, it is worth noting few, if any of the contesting politicians, have made education one of the priorities of their campaign. With the health of our economy chief among voter concerns followed by national security in the wake of new threats, education has been essentially relegated to the bottom of the list. Considering the recent buzz surrounding the educational reform documentary “Superman,” school bullying and controversy surrounding for profit colleges, one can argue education should be among one the major issues this election cycle.

With Republicans presumably set to gain the majority in one or both chambers of Congress, we could be left with a lame duck Congress for the rest of the year until a new and very different looking Congress reconvenes in January, a move that is bound to have some sort of effect on education, especially the financing of many of President Obama's educational goals such as the Race to the Top. A lame duck session is when Congress convenes a sessions following elections in even numbered years in November. Since there is always a turnover in membership, those lawmakers sitting in these sessions are considered lame duck since they wont participate in the next Congress the following January. 

Congress has yet to act on an <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2010/11/03/10congress.h30.html?tkn=STQFXuNxmXUcwpialCh%2BpZ85zGhWzF2x0reL&cmp=clp-edweek">educational budget for the 2011 fiscal year</a>, which was set to take effect on October 1st. The budget was extended through a short-gap measure that expires in early December.  Should Republicans gain control of one or both chambers as expected, they can delay the education spending bill until they assume power in January, where they can flex their newfound legislative power against the President and his measures. The result could mean a highly divided Washington where new bills and those up for renewal often take longer than usual. A host of education related bills, including the Child Nutrition Act, are also up for renewal. Tuesday's night results is seen as a referendum on the two-year performance of the Obama administration but could also have huge implications for the educational funding in K-12 public schools as well as grants and financial aid for college students.
