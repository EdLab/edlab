There's a growing practice in schools where students can use their cellphones or any electronic device (laptop, tablet) in classrooms. This movement is being called BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and it's similar to the movement that is being used with employees in the financial sector. For the education sector, this would allow students to bring in and use their smartphones, laptops, tablets, etc., in the classroom. It's an interesting concept that while it sounds very innovative, has its drawbacks. Some say that it could potentially save schools alot of money, but others believe that the cost just shifted from school to parent. For students that do have the device however, many educators have started accepting the use of devices, instead of confiscating them, and started integrating them in their classroom activities.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> This is an interesting move by educators that would teach students how to utilize their technological resources for educational purposes. The popular notion is that cell phones, and other devices, <i>only</i> serve as a distraction for student. I do not believe this to be true anymore as there are many ways the devices can be used for educational purposes. I do not see this movement making much of a change in the future of STEM education as there are not many students that can afford smartphones and other devices needed to use educational applications (like classroom polling, watching educational podcasts, etc). Smartphones are pricey and data plans are even worse, although if the school has Wifi, the problem would be rectified. But this doesn't mean we should abandon this idea, for it could still serve a great purpose for the future of STEM education. We should still find more ways for students to embrace technology and hope that it will inspire them to keep walking down the path of fulfilling a career in a STEM field. Maybe this can also lead to ultimate mobile learning, where all students can have access to a mobile device that will allow them to keep learning even after school. Let's dream big everyone.
