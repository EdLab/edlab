            Part 3: Interview with Paula Kerger — CEO of PBS 

How has new media impacted traditional broadcasters like PBS?
-	Audience for TV portion has declined — no longer a monopoly for a few broadcasting stations. 
-	Now have multiple channels to distribute your content — TV, web, on-demand. This can be good b/c you can distribute it virally and through other means. 
-	Much of their content is “evergreen” -  can sit around for long time and still have demand. 
-	Television audience: above 50. Online audience: under 35. 
-	People don't consume content through multiple channels. Rather, it is different demographics that are split across different channels (older people on TV, younger people primarily through web, etc.). 
-	Online content: creating a different experience compared to television. Allows users to click through different pieces of a story rather than presenting a linear stream of content. 
-	Challenge for news organization: interviewees don't know where their content will be used (in some specific program or as content in some other challenge), which creates challenges when getting them to acquiesce to providing interviews or insight. 
o	Creative commons content to address this. 
o	“Sandbox” place where content is put up and internal groups can take it and mash it up for different purposes. 
o	Put content in multiple places so they will find them when they need it and will find in the medium they happen to be looking for it. 
o	Children — look for opportunities where you can best reach them. In many cases, this happens to be with SMARTPHONES. This leads to things like Curious George iPhone app and other related apps. 


Education: would like to deliver content that is tailored to the needs of teachers and can be split up in to different parts. Rights issues that can get in the way. 
â†’ eg. $1 million dollar cost to clear the rights for “Eyes on the Prize” series last year. 


How does a non-profit public service organization measure success in the media convergence space â†’ impact (audience, number of awards); impact in communities. 

One revenue source for PBS is sponsorships for corporations. What are the rules and how are they changing with the new media? PBS maintains specific rules (can't break shows, regulate what the ad contains, etc.). Online space is more unregulated and they will be entrepreneurial in raising money. Nevertheless, PBS values being perceived as a “trustworthy” source of content and it needs to make sure it doesn't violate that or be perceived to violate that with advertisements (still selective on what ads they take; don't take ads for children's spaces).
