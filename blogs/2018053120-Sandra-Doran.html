Sandra J. Doran is the founding CEO of Castle Point Learning Systems (CPLS), a software company focused on increasing student success in college-level mathematics through educational technology and based on principles of artificial intelligence. By understanding how students learn mathematics, and in particular Calculus, CPLS developed the <i><a href="http://www.gradarius.com/">Gradarius Calculus Learning Platform</i></a>. Doran also serves as Director for the New England Board of Higher Education, where she specializes in engaging online learning. Prior to leading CPLS, Doran held positions in both academia and business: President of American College of Education, Vice President and General Counsel of Lesley University, Senior Counsel at Holland & Knight LLP, and Vice President and General Counsel of Shaw’s Supermarkets.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at
Gradarius?</b><br>
<p>My career choices have allowed me to fully develop the core competencies that are required to lead an enterprise. When I started my career, I looked for challenging opportunities that would provide me the opportunity to grow, and the ability, desire, and willingness to lead has been my career constant. Every leader has their own style and strategy, with leadership approaches and methodologies varying because of market challenges and the internal corporate ecosystems of individual companies. There are myriad qualities that define leaders. The ones critical to my approach are focus, honesty, accountability, optimism, and inspiration.</p>

<p>At Castle Point Learning Systems, the entirety of my leadership skills needed to be deployed as we brought our core product, Gradarius, from a professor’s theoretical concept to a fully realized SaaS application. Far surpassing existing calculus software, which was primarily focused on assessment, memorization, and preparing for tests, Gradarius nurtures the skills needed to solve calculus problems logically while simultaneously offering instructors not only student solution data, but also information about the student’s thinking behind each approach. To be able to practice and learn to solve problems on their own, students need intelligent software that provides immediate and focused feedback on every step of each solution. Gradarius fulfills these needs, with an ultimate goal of improving Calculus education and outcomes.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from learners who have used Gradarius?</b><br>
<p>Feedback from students and faculty has been extremely encouraging. Gradarius allows students to enter their solutions in a free-form manner, without any predefined structure or restrictions. Students have gained a deeper and more complete knowledge of mathematics and the logic involved in solving complex problems. The software is unique in its ability to identify the logical reasoning involved in a student’s solution, validating each computation in the solution and identifying the underlying reasoning behind any mistakes. By recording and analyzing each step of the solution, we were able to provide the appropriate feedback to students while also developing an effective learning environment, which allowed students to thrive.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The continued growth of online educational models, increased badging and micro-credentialing, the expansion of what the word <i>education</i> means for employers, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence in course design and implementation, and the contraction of the higher education landscape, with institutions of 2,000 students or fewer particularly at risk. Increasingly, we live in a world where the vision of traditional classroom education is changing. New technologies enable learning in a variety of locations and contexts throughout a community, not only during school hours but far beyond. The information revolution has created opportunities for learners of all ages to take advantage of new digital tools that offer individualized instruction, supplemental study materials, and continuing education resources. As a result, the need for truly connected communities is urgent.</p>

<p><b>Why did you choose calculus as the core subject Gradarius focuses on?`</b><br>
<p>Calculus evokes a primary emotion in many college and high school students: fear. Approximately 20-30% of these students fail calculus in the current academic environment, and since calculus is a gateway subject to engineering, the hopes and dreams of many college students were being derailed. Additionally, students who graded well in calculus could not necessarily apply calculus principles to complex problems, a deficiency that would prove to be a significant challenge were they to pursue higher-level coursework. As educators and academic leaders, we knew that the most effective learning and comprehension results were achieved when students received immediate feedback on their work. Working with mathematicians and calculus professors at Stevens Institute of Technology, we witnessed first-hand the positive effect on learning outcomes that occurs when meaningful feedback was provided to students.</p>

<p>To address this problem, we created Gradarius, the next generation of intelligently responsive tutoring software. This web-based tool mimics a human tutor, but is always available and provides immediate, individualized, and dynamic feedback. Gradarius provides state-of-the-art analytical tools that enable educators and students to receive a real-time assessment of a student’s understanding of a solution process. The result is a fundamental shift from memorization to the development of problem-solving skills.</p>
