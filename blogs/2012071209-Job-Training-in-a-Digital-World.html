          <!-- Post Content -->

          <p>
            Yesterday, there was <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/open-education-for-a-global-economy/">an Opinionator piece</a> in the New York Times about online education in our global, digital world. The focus of the piece was on <a href="http://alison.com/">ALISON</a>, a freemium platform for online education focusing on job training and language skills. As the Times points out, ALISON offers certificates and diplomas in areas like customer service, accounting, marketing, and various computer programs. They also have a wide geographic reach, including parts of Africa and the Middle East, Malaysia, the Philippines, as well as the US and UK.

From the article:
<blockquote>ALISON works to leverage and redirect the large supply of for-profit courses, searching for high-quality vocational offerings and inviting publishers to put some of their courses on ALISON, available free. For example, it carries hundreds of hours of English and French language instruction from the British Council and Alliance Francaise. (It never offers short “teaser” courses that link to paid sites, only modules at a minimum of a certificate level.) </blockquote>

Towards the end of the article is, I think, a very important takeaway, especially as the EdLab works to develop its mSchool:
<blockquote>Just as there is great variability in teacher quality, online education is a mixed bag. “There's an enormous amount of learning out there,” notes Feerick. “There's also an enormous amount of rubbish. It's hard to make out the difference if you don't know what's coming. We turn down a huge number of courses that are low quality.” What does ALISON look for? Feerick's staff members ask the following. “Is it good content? Is it interactive? Does it ask you to do something? Sometimes the content really lends itself to video – like language learning where you need pronunciation help. Does it flow logically? Is the content from a reliable source? Is there a way to assess the learning?”</blockquote>
