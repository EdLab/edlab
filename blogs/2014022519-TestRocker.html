<p>The three letters S.A.T. are usually enough to induce panic for many high school juniors and seniors. The thought that one standardized exam could determine their immediate future is certainly enough to raise the stress levels of most students. SAT prep courses, both in-class and online, are now a high-stakes game with more competitors than ever before. Enter <a href="http://www.testrocker.com/">TestRocker</a>, a new online site, developed by <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/-1707619.htm">Suniti Mathur</a>, the self-proclaimed "ultimate private tutor," an educator who has had over 15 years of experience tutoring students around the world. TestRocker offers preparation for both the SAT and the ACT exams.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Customization is the name of the game for TestRocker. Students start by a taking a diagnostic exam when they first register on the site. Based on their score, a personalized study plan is developed for each student based on their strengths and weaknesses. As they go through the course, students take a series of practice quizzes. Suniti Mathur offers detailed video explanations to over 1,200 math and verbal questions. Students can go back and review the questions that they struggled with at any time. TestRocker can be accessed from any tablet or mobile device. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>TestRocker is available for 6 months at a cost of $699. Students can sign up for either the SAT or ACT prep course. For a cost of $999, students can have access to both services. The cost also includes the grading of two essay questions. While the element of personalization is a great feature of TestRocker, essentially students are paying for access to the video test bank. Users will also have to be comfortable with Sunitiâ€™s teaching style, as she explains all of the test questions and answers.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>The individualized experience that students receive from TestRocker is one of the key features that differentiate this site from other online options. Since each student has a customized plan, certain parts of the exam can be emphasized in order for students to maximize their study time focusing on the areas they need to improve. Suniti and her team also publish an online blog with added tips and advice for students as they go through the course and prepare for the big day.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Test prep for the busy student on-the-go.</p>
