<p>Hsing Wei is the co-founder of <a href="http://www.nycmakery.com/#about">The Makery</a> in NYC, a makerspace for inventors of all ages. She is an interaction designer, convener, and tinkerist. Hsing enjoys thinking about and developing technology-enriched experiences that solve problems, connect communities, and enable novel ways of interacting with the world. She has been on the startup team of various creative games and digital learning initiatives, and co-founded The Makery.</p>
 
<p><b>What inspired you to co-found The Makery?</b><br>
Reflecting back, it was a confluence of my life's experiences. A combination of my own personal excitement about maker mindsets and entering into the tangibility of physical computing and fabrication after primarily working in digital media and programming; encountering interactive projects from both technical and artistic standpoints that helped me see the opportunity to meld both; spending time with organizations starting progressive new public schools; and meeting like-minded educators all combined to create an itch to bring these ideas directly to kids, adults, and families to experience too.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope The Makery impacts the children and adults who participate in its classes and workshops?</b><br>
Every learner comes in with their own prior experiences and self-conceptions of what they are capable of and leaves with different takeaways. At a basic level, I hope that everyone experiences the fun of learning by making in technical domains they might not have explored before. For those who don't see themselves as engineers and programmers or for those who don't see themselves as designers or creative people, I hope our workshops encourage their potential to be all those identities. I also hope that our environment encourages participants to play with questions, know it’s okay to mess up while trying, and get a taste of making one's ideas into a reality. </p>
 
<p><b>Which trends from The Makery do you hope will have an impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
Although The Makery uses new technologies as our medium, many of our core practices aren't what I'd describe as new or a trend. At heart, it’s very much an inquiry-based and constructivist approach to teaching and learning. Perhaps one atypical characteristic is that it offers an informal educational makerspace that extends beyond traditional hours and blurs into the social and community sides of life. We also expect missteps, failure, and iteration as part of the practice of making, which perhaps also contrasts with how education and achievement is typically framed. </p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>My current work stretches outside of STEAM education, and is focused on the design of connected communities, smart infrastructure, and technology products that enhance urban experiences. I still play a leadership role at The Makery and am usually there on Sundays.</p>

<p>The Makery is equally driven forward by my stellar teammates Oya Kosebay and Jaymes Dec. The Makery's current big projects include growing a community in its new location in Brooklyn, developing a new after school club, and getting ready for our first solo booth at Maker Faire NYC. </p>
 
</p></b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
Embarrassingly, I'm not often on Twitter. I will do a plug for <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMakery">@nycmakery</a> and those who it follows :)</p>
