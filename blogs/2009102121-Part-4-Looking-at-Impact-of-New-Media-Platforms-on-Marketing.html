            Final Session: Looking at Impact of New Media Technologies on Marketing. 

For marketers, last decade has ushered in the largest change in the media/marketing space as compared to previous decades. This is partially due to technological changes, but much more so because of changes in people's behavior in response to these technologies. These changes have also affected marketers and their work and careers in big ways. Biggest change has been the explosion in new channels to connect with consumers and marketers' expertise in these platforms (using them, evaluating them, etc.) is now not as sophisticated as with traditional “advertising” platforms. 

Google, Twitter and MySpace panelists:

Media 1.0 was very disruptive ads that took you out of the activity that you were doing. Media 2.0 improves in this by engaging and entertaining at the same time (serving ads and brands while you deliver content).

With Twitter, they found that people were not using their technology directly for advertisements, but rather to come in to a customer service relationship (eg. Technical support conversations). Lesson: ‘the more genuine and human an organization looks, the better the relationship'. 

Latest marketing techniques with new media: attempt to enter in to a conversation and relationship with customer, rather than just pushing ads to them. In many cases this involves allowing company to effectively communicate two-ways with consumers; in other cases it involves melding content with commerce (ie. Branding/ads). 

Twitter: no business model yet to monetize the fact that companies and consumers are connecting in large numbers through their platform. Taking a patient approach to finding the best way to commercialize the way that people are using their system. Don't want to overlay a business model that is too narrow or that discourages use for some subpopulations. 

Google: search is foundation for overall marketing model. Now see opportunities for display and new ad formats. Four areas for marketers: personalization (localized content), consumer-generated content (through social media), measurements (where you use consumer data to help make decisions), engagement in some way (entertainment, productivity, etc.). 

How to monetize customization of content and engagement parts of Google?
