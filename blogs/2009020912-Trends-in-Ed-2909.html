            <b>Teachers to Get Onboard @ Classroom Learning 2.0</b>
Students today (esp. K-12) are far ahead of the game in adapting new online tools compared to their teachers.  Well, maybe not anymore.  <a href=http://www.ctap1.org/ctap1/site/default.asp>California Technology Assistance Project</a> and <a href=http://schoolibrary.org/res/library_2_0.htm>California School Library Association 2.0 Team</a> just launched <a href=“http://classroomlearning2.blogspot.com/>a free online tutorial for teachers</a> to learn about some of the most popular web tools that students use on a daily basis. The tutorial is formatted to self-teach how-to's about blogs, flicker, RSS feeds, technorati and tags, wikis, YouTube, podcasts, eBooks, and more.  Classroom Learning 2.0 also provides ideas on how to create e-library and begin curriculum collaboration with other teachers. For those interested in receiving academic credit, they can do so by registering for Continuing Education Units at Fresno Pacific University.

<b>Having every child online “is not the panacea”</b>  
<a href=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/04/EDK215MHD6.DTL/>Todd Oppenheimer</a>, the author of <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Flickering-Mind-Education-Promise-Technology/dp/0812968433/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/>The Flickering Mind: Saving Education from the False Promise of Technology (2004)</a> wrote an op-ed on the San Francisco Chronicle urging the Obama administration to curtail any ungrounded investments in hard+software for classrooms.  While he does not entirely dismiss use of the internet, he states that: <i>throughout [the campaign to integrate latest tech into classrooms], educators and the technology industry have been searching madly for solid evidence of whether the computers were boosting achievement.  So little has been found that this data has become education's WMD.</i>  His argument then raises a simple question, is there really a lack of research results making a case for using computers and online tools in classrooms?  A quick search on Google Scholar says there's plenty, but I prefer to leave the judgment on quality and persuasiveness of those studies unanswered for now.      

<b><i>*iPhone app-a-day*</i></b> 
<b>Goodbye 3x5 index cards, Say Hello to flashcards on your iPhone/iPod</b>
There are many iPhone apps out there concerning education, but the problem is that there are so many and it takes time and energy (+ stress for some) to actually choose one that's good (+ appropriate for you) out of the increasing number of apps.  This is just a trial segment of Jo & Arianna's Trends in Ed.  The goal is to share what apps are getting extra kudos by users themselves and why.
<a href=“http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2009/02/07/creating-custom-iphone-and-ipod-touch-flashcards-with-gflash-and-google-documents/”<b>gFlash+</b> and <b>gFlashPro</b></a> allow users to create custom flashcards.  Praises come from the fact that it has three easy download options for whatever the user wants written on his/her flashcards.  Instead of typing in each vocab word or multiplication fact, the user can download data from Google Docs, <a href=“ http://www.gwhizmobile.com/Desktop/Home.php/”>gWhiz Catalog</a>, or <a href=“ http://www.studystack.com/”>StudyStack</a> to create his/her own stack of flashcards — this allows the user to shop for free learning materials that's already posted online for sharing.
