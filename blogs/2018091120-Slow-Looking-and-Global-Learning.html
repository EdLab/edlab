<p>This study reports the experience of two kindergarten classrooms connected through <a href="https://learn.outofedenwalk.com/">Out of Eden Learn</a>, a free online learning platform designed by Harvard’s Project Zero, focused on learning through storytelling. The project encourages global competence by inviting students to slow down, observe their surroundings carefully, and share their perspectives with peers throughout world. </p>
 
<p>This case study observed and reported the learning experiences of two kindergarten teachers who used Out of Eden Learn in their classrooms: Ms. Victoria in Miami, Florida, and Ms. Kiriaki in Piraeus, Greece. Based on their observations, the researchers grouped the classes’ learning gains into five broad categories: resilience, perspective taking, cognitive engagement, empathy, and communication. For example, the platform helped Ms. Victoria’s students (95% of whom were children of immigrants) develop resilience through deeply connecting with their own experiences, and using this engagement as an impetus for expanding their English vocabulary. Ms. Kiriaki’s students (also predominantly from immigrant families) learned to enhabit others’ perspectives by listening to adult community members’ stories about the history of their neighborhood. Ms. Victoria and Ms. Kiriaki’s students exchanged questions, comments, and experiences with each other in a global online conversation.</p>
 
<p> At the conclusion of the Out of Eden Learn curriculum, Ms. Kiriaki asked her students to draw and explain the most important experience of their Out of Eden learning journey. Based on their conversations and drawings, she used a rubric to measure her students’ capacity to slow down, their development of curiosity, and their ability to define themselves in a global context. Twenty-one out of twenty-four students reported that slow looking helped them appreciate their neighborhood, twenty out of twenty-four related increased curiosity about other people’s lives, and twenty-one out of twenty-four indicated their perception of themselves as part of a global family. This study, while small, suggests that detailed observation helps develop reflective abilities, which leads to curious and connected thinking.</p>
