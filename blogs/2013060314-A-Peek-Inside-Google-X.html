          <p>
            For those of you who wondered what division created both Google Glass, autonomous cars AND did not develop a fabled "space elevator"... the answer is [X].  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-22/inside-googles-secret-lab">Google [X]</a> that is.  The group also hosts an annual TED-like conference that convenes "<a href="https://www.solveforx.com/about/whatisamoonshot/">Moonshot</a>" thinkers, called "<a href="https://www.solveforx.com/">Solve for X</a>."  

Led by an individual named, <a href="http://www.astroteller.net/">Astro Teller (family with deep science roots - Manhattan Project etc.)</a>, and involving Sebastian Thrun of Udacity fame among others, the lab is literally a meta "skunk works" within Google (or just adjacent to).  With an ethos that embraces the "moonshot idea" and does not intend to take every one of those ideas to market.  Google X labs resemble a modern mash-up of the original Apple product dev teams and US tech-focused think tanks like Xerox Park or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a>.  However, hopefully, unlike the later, hopefully many Google X products will eventually go to market and thrive (come-on Glass deniers, they look COOL!).

<b>EdLab Takeaways</b>
What struck me the most, besides the fact that EdLab should take a field trip to "X", is that they similarly embrace the ethos of REALLY big ideas in a highly collaborative, open environment.  Ideas that are so "Moonshot" as to be considered REVOLUTIONARY by the general public, fellow tech community and everyone in-between.  In this way, I was reminded of the founding mission of <i>New Learning Times</i> and our desire to explore and cover those truly transformative ideas, people, products and movements that have the potential to shape the future of education.  Basically, I found great inspiration and a similar set of goals and mission in a lab called "X"!  What are your thoughts?  What roles could/should innovation labs play in shaping various fields and disciplines?  What is unique about a "lab" environment that makes it conducive to these types of ground-breaking discoveries and ideas?
