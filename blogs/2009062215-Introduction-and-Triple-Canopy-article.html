            Hi! I'm Dan Torop, one of the new EDAR residents. I'm sitting over by the design people, trying to make a digital/sound project through August 15... The plan is to make a talking computer. It'll look over information retrieved from library databases and come up with compelling speech from what it sees. I'm doing a brief presentation at the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2811">new resident's event</a> at 4PM this Wednesday. Do stop by.

Just to mention, last year I spent six months at a residency trying to make a <a href="http://dantorop.info/project/bowery_birds/">virtual recreation of the Bowery</a> between Houston and Delancey street. The simulation was written in Lisp, an old AI language. Somehow it ended up having a few hundred swans flying overhead. Anyhow, I wrote an article about this, it's published (online) in the <a href="http://canopycanopycanopy.com/6/virtual_bowery">current issue of Triple Canopy magazine</a>.

If there's a role-model for the project, it is the work of <a href="http://www.robertashley.org/">Robert Ashley</a>. Since the 1970's, Ashley has made what he calls “operas”. They generally consist of a series of monologues rhythmically spoken by an ensemble of about five performers. I saw three of them in January at <a href="http://www.lamama.org/">La MaMa E.T.C.</a>, and was so impressed. Part of why I so much want to work in reference to them is because they combine humanity and emotion with the odd emptiness of technological interaction.

In an <a href="http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$tapedetail?ROBERTASHL">interview</a>, Ashley says his work has been a movement from vulgarity ("it's easy to be vulgar") to abstraction ("I thrive on abstraction"). He says we're attracted to the modern European classical tradition because it "recognizes the possibility for abstraction." Perhaps this makes him sound really stodgy? But if abstraction means lucidity and beauty and wonder, then that is quite good, yes? His operas are also vital, funny, and worldly. If anyone wants to hear some of them, do stop by.

Anyhow, it's great to be here. Wish me luck.
