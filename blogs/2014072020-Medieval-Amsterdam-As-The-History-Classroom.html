<p><b>Title:</b> Storification in History Education: A Mobile Game in and About Medieval Amsterdam (2009)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanne Akkermana, Wilfried Admiraal, & Jantina Huizenga</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131508001498">Computer & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What can students learn from an augmented reality history game?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Using narratives to organize historical information and put them into context is an effective strategy for students learning about history. Digital technologies can also provide innovative approaches for students to learn history through narratives and storification. This study investigates the potential benefits of <a href="http://freq1550.waag.org/">Frequency 1550</a>, a mobile game about the history of Amsterdam in late medieval era.</p>

<p>Participants were 216 secondary students, divided into groups of 4-6. Within each small group, students were assigned to a city team and asked to explore the city with a GPS-enabled mobile device and collect information. There was also a headquarters team, whose work involved analyzing data and producing narratives. The researchers collected observation field notes and conducted group interviews during the 10 game days. Data from the game (e.g., text messages, documents, pictures, and assignments) and videotaped final group presentations were also collected for analysis. The researchers then attempted to derive main themes from this qualitative data.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors identified three types of storification in the game design and practices: receiving a story, constructing a story, and participating in a story. Frequency 1550 was not an effective tool for receiving the story because students paid more attention to the procedure and technology. However, the game invited students to construct history through seeking information for their narratives and making sense of media and artifacts collected in the city environment. In addition, this game allowed students to participate in the story while walking through the city, capturing pictures or videos, and experiencing vocabulary from the historical period. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Memorizing fragmented facts about historical events and figures has long been a common experience of history education. GPS-enabled mobile technologies and augmented reality games can create engaging learning experiences and invite students to construct and participate in narratives about the past. Constructing historical narratives facilitates a unique perspective, while participating in historical stories creates meaningful connections with the narrative elements. Balancing these two approaches in similar mobile games is crucial for the success of this engaging approach.</p>
