<a href="http://pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2012/PIP_Cell_Phone_Internet_Access.pdf">Smith, A. (2012). <i>Cell Internet Use 2012.</i> Pew Internet & American Life Project.</a>

The <a href="http://pewinternet.org/">Pew Internet & American Life Project</a> published a new report last week on “cell internet users,” that is, people who own a cell phone and use thier phone to go online. 


According to the survey numbers, 88% of U.S. adults own a cell phone; 55% of these cell phone owners use their phones to access the Internet, and 31% of these cell internet users say that they mostly go online using their cell phone, not using another device such as a laptop or desktop. (For the record, <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Smartphone-Update-2012/Findings.aspx">46% of all U.S. adults own a smartphone</a>.)  So, that means 17% of all adult cell phone owners are “cell-mostly internet users.

The survey reports the demographics of cell-mostly internet users. Unsurprisingly, this includes 45% of 18-29 year olds, as well as a notable racial disparity: 51% of African-Americans, compared with 24% of whites, and 42% of Latinos. Additionally, people with an annual household income of less than $50,000 per year and people who do not have a college degree are more likely to use their phones for most of their online browsing.

Cell-mostly internet users give three major reasons for their usage. First, 64% mention factors related to the convenience, availability, and speed of mobile phones. Second, 18% say that their online habits make their cell phone a more effective choice for going online, including 6% who say that they simply find their cell phone to be easier to use than a traditional computer. Third, 10% report a lack of other access options, e.g., don't have a computer, no other internet access.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>

While not groundbreaking, this report provides data confirming the trend toward accessing the internet on mobile devices. It also shows that there is plenty of room for growth, as even more people are likely to become at least "cell-sometimes" internet users over the next few years. As detailed in the recent <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7846">NMC Horizon Report</a>, mobile devices and apps are well on the way to becoming widely adopted educational tools, especially since they are cheaper than more robust hardware. As EdLab continues to research, design, and develop tools for the future of education, this data should encourage us to continue to look for ways to make our products mobile. I think it is especially interesting to consider how new technology might provide opportunities to reach people with lower levels of income and education.
