            <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/07/13/science.1207745.full.pdf">Sparrow, Betsy., Liu, Jenny., Wegner, Daniel M. (2011).  Google Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips.  Science 333 (6040), 277.</a>

A couple of weeks ago, Science published a paper titled “The Effects of Google on Memory,” which made a small splash.  I thought it was nice that in the wake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393072223">several</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Not-Gadget-Manifesto/dp/0307389979/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1311886252&sr=1-1">books</a> decrying the damage that our brave new Internet world was doing to our minds, some psychology professors actually went out and tried to quantify the effects, if any.  
<!--break-->
Description:

From the start, the paper is deflationary.  “Storing information externally is nothing particularly novel,” they assure us, and go on to detail how humans tend to distribute information storage, rather than trying to hold everything in their own brain.  “The present research explores whether having online access to search engines, databases, and the like, has become a primary transactive memory source in itself. We investigate whether the Internet has become an external memory system that is primed by the need to acquire information. If asked the question whether there are any countries with only one color in their flag, for example, do we think about flags–or immediately think to go online to find out?”

To test this hypothesis, they ran a series of experiments on how people remember information, and how they remember where that information can be found.  The results, although they are fairly small-scale, seem to indicate that, in situations where you're confident you'll be able to easily access a piece of information whenever you need to, you're less likely to actually remember that information, although you will remember where you can access it.  Although there are different ways of interpreting the implications of such a finding, the authors of this study are cautiously optimistic: “One could argue that this is an adaptive use of memory–to include the computer and online search engines as an external memory system that can be accessed at will.”

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:

Distributed cognition is in some ways the purpose for much of the work (Ednode, for instance) that goes on here at Edlab, and I think the model that the authors implicitly espouse might offer suggestions for improvement on that line, although at the moment I'm having trouble coming up with something that isn't really bland (e.g. make easy paths to information!).  On the other hand, moving from information storage/presentation to actual education, it would seem that if you actually want to teach somebody something, you should do your best to convince them that they won't have an easy time finding that information again in the future.  This may mean that, for instance, a course where you can't rewind or look back at previous sections will be more effective, although further study is certainly needed!
