<p><b>Title:</b> Spread of Academic Success in a High School Social Network (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Deanna Blansky, Christina Kavanaugh, Cara Boothroyd, Brianna Benson, Julie Gallagher, John Endress, & Hiroki Sayama</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Studies show that there is a correlation between K-12 students' behavior and academic achievement. <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0055944"> Spread of Academic Success in a High School Social Network</a> sought to investigate whether students’ social behavior could also influence academic performance. The authors were given access to participants’ school-reported grades and cross-checked them with an online student survey of friendship groups. In the survey, the students were given a list of other participants and asked to assign them a rank of best friend, friend, acquaintance, relative, or stranger. The researchers then constructed a linear regression model based on different friendship levels and academic rank. They used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulation method</a> to verify their model. By generating 500 independent simulated cases and comparing the correlations with the 158 self-reported cases, they found the actual correlation coefficient was larger than the largest simulated coefficient, which indicated that the GPA had a true correlation with the student’s academic progress.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The regression analysis revealed that the correlation was most significant at the friendship level, while the correlations at acquaintance and best friendship levels were not as significant. The correlation tells us that students whose friends’ average grade point average (GPA) was greater than their own had a higher tendency to increase their academic ranking over time. The opposite was also true, a lower GPA among friends caused students’ grades to decrease. This indicated that social contagion of academic success took place in the social networks. This kind of contagion effect is similar to studies of other socially-influenced behaviors like <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa066082">obesity</a> and <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2338">happiness</a>. The results also suggest that one could predict a student’s academic progress without a large-scale survey or complicated social network analysis, and instead through a simple index of self-reported friendship.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The authors found convincing results, but more research is needed as the participants were predominantly white and all lived in suburban or rural areas in Upstate New York. Future studies should examine other socio-cultural variables and demographics. It would also be interesting to study this phenomenon in an online environment. Social ties in online courses have traditionally been less influential, but the adoption of new, more social technologies may increase the importance of online relationships in student performance. In light of this study, parents of high school students should be aware that social groups likely influence student GPA. One of the most important roles of in-person schooling is social connection, students and those that care for them should be aware that school friendships are academically significant.</p>
