<p><a href="https://www.blendspace.com/">BlendSpace</a> is a course design platform that lets users organize any digital learning resource on the web into a lesson. The site could be very beneficial for teachers who are flipping their classrooms, employing project based learning, or moving towards blended learning. Any type of resource from the web can be implemented in the lesson, including media platforms like Vimeo, Flickr, YouTube, and Google Drive. Teachers have the power to arrange these resources in a particular order and students can comment on each resource individually, which is useful if teachers are posing a question or requesting feedback.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>BlendSpace provides an online space to bring together any online learning resource on a single webpage. The platform does not limit the type of digital resource that can be added to the lesson. Analytics such as views, quiz answers, comments, and likes or dislikes are available for teachers to view. There are several ways to share a lesson through social media, email, website embed code, or QR code creation.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Digital learning resources are ordered in a list and students go through them one by one making the lesson very linear. It would be interesting to see a more adaptive lesson that provides different learning paths for students depending on their actions. Some resources take more time to load and others must be opened in another tab or window. It could be beneficial to try and load all resources in the same tab or window so students remain in the learning space which would allow them to have access to the resource alongside instructions and space to comment.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>BlendSpace enables teachers to take full advantage of the diverse learning tools that the web has to offer and use them to teach a specific learning concept. Creating an engaging lesson requires teachers to have the necessary research skills to find the right resource for their lesson, but the freedom offered by BlendSpace offers teachers nearly unlimited possibilities for building lessons. This customization lets teachers create a unique space for their class. While BlendSpace does not yet offer the individualized learning paths of adaptive learning, the platform is unique among more standardized and structured online learning spaces.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>BlendSpace gives teachers the space to add any learning resource from the web.</p>
