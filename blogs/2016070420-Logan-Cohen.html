<p>Logan Cohen is the co-founder and Co-CEO of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kudzoo/id883533727?mt=8">KÜDZOO</a>, a free mobile app that enables students to convert their grades and report cards into virtual currency. Cohen was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 in education class of 2016. She also teaches a weekly entrepreneurship class for 14-to-16-year-olds at the Science Leadership Academy in Philadelphia. Cohen received dual degrees in Finance and International Business from Florida International University. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your work now at KÜDZOO?</b><br>
<p>My business partner and I started KÜDZOO right out of college. The degrees I obtained in finance and international business built a solid foundation for my entrepreneurial journey. Additionally, extracurriculars and campus involvement prepared me with the necessary skills to grow and maintain a business. I am part of Delta Sigma Pi, an international co-ed business fraternity and I was also student body president. Through these positions, I was given the opportunity to learn from mentors and experiences about how to effectively network, write intro emails, balance a budget, and manage investor relations. </p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at KÜDZOO will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>KÜDZOO's goal is to engage students in their own education by leveraging the relationship they have with their smartphones and social media. Students check their phone over 150x a day, KÜDZOO ties together the fun of social media with recognition for academic engagement. </p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p><ul>
<li>Utilizing mobile phones as a tool of opportunity rather than a forbidden fruit.
<li>The rise of blended learning. Revisiting standardized testing and leaning towards personalized learning. 
</ul></p>

<p><b>Apart from KÜDZOO, what else are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I am working on KÜDZOO full-time. One of the many things I enjoy about startup life is the <i>next big project</i> can be a functionality, app update, or promotion in the company.  KÜDZOO's new, improved version is launching this summer. I am especially excited for it since we based all the new functionalities directly from recommendations by our student achievers across the nation.</p>
