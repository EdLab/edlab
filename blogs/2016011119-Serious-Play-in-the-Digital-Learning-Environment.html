<p>Mimi Ito is challenging the assumption that students aren’t learning when they are playing or are online. On the contrary, she argues, student engagement online needs to be understood as a significant site of learning. </p>

<p>Ito identifies three modes of online participation, each with their own learning opportunities: hanging out, messing around, and geeking out. Hanging out is characterized by friendship driven participation and takes places largely in the realm of social media. Messing around is characterized by experimentation with basic technical skills for creative production and expression such as through creating YouTube pieces or podcasts, that leads to the development of more sophisticated technical literacy. Geeking out is characterized by participating in an expert peer culture centered around specialized forms of technical and media literacy.  </p>

<p>All three of these modes of online participation need to be valued and understood for their unique learning opportunities. Ito emphasizes that adults also need to understand that though their presence is not always welcome or appropriate in those spaces, they do need to be active in supporting students’ intellectual and civic development in online activities. Ito’s findings on how students engage in learning while they’re playing online has huge implications for educators. </p>

<p>What do you think of student engagement with online activities? Tell us about your experiences in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23044/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:53 jennyshen: :</b> I think young people engage in social media networks out of need for communication, whereas they use YouTube and podcasting because they want to exercise and exhibit their creativity. This is an important difference and I agree with Ito that the latter can really be a hub for creative media literacy.</p>

<p><b>@06:00 gheehan:</b> As we design classroom experiences, it is important for us to consider how our students are learning in the home and peer environment. This may lead to better student engagement and participation as we harness the potential of new media to foster intellectual development, media literacy and other 21st century competencies.</p>
