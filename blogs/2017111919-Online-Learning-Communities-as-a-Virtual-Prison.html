<p>Research into uses of social media in education tends to focus on its value as a learning support tool rather than its capacity to influence behavior. But, in this study, the medium proved highly influential when students were required to make assessable work visible to people other than the teacher.</p>
 
<p>To see how students felt when making their work visible on social media, researchers conducted focus group discussions with 20 students (between 20–40 years old) enrolled in undergraduate courses across three Australian universities, then examined how visibility shaped, and was shaped by participation in their learning communities. The analysis was informed by notions of surveillance and performance, specifically, the panopticon, or an ideal prison structure where a tower is encircled by prison cells enabling guards to observe activity without being visible to inmates. This research further examined the effect of such a setup on communities of practice, or common domains arising from shared experience, tools, and resources.</p>
 
<p>Awareness of audience emerged as a strong theme, with 50% of participants revealing it made them want to spend more time on the assignment to ensure quality work. However, students expressed anxiety about the audience as a ‘motivator’ for their performance, especially when ‘rough’ or early work was made available. Participants were also adept at crafting their work to align with the identity they were prepared to share, despite expressing concern about creating a reified persona.</p>
 
<p>The findings support the researchers’ argument that making assessable work visible on social media can be likened to a virtual panopticon in a community of practice, and that this has important implications for designing pedagogical environments that still protect the students’ fundamental right to manage their own levels of visibility online.</p>
