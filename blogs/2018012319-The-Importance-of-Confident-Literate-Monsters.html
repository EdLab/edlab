<p><a href="https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com">Teach Your Monster to Read</a> is a phonetics and reading game that assists children during their first two years of learning how to read. Three different game options exist to cater to different ages and levels, and all are available for free on any laptop or desktop computer. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The framing of this game is very clever. Players create a unique monster avatar and then find themselves responsible for the progress of their monster. The player’s sense of ownership and investment in their monster’s success is heightened by a storyline where their monster’s spaceship has crashed and it can’t read the instruction manual to fix it. It is up to the player to teach their monster to read. Instructions like "help your monster complete the sentence" emphasize the agency of the child, and frame their magical adventure through space not as one in which they are learning, but one in which they are teaching their monster to learn.</p>

<p>This is clearly a high-production game. A very enthusiastic and encouraging British narrator leads children from island to island and planet to planet, and a whimsical cast of characters teach letter-sound recognition, blending, segmenting, simple spelling, and sentence reading and completion. The graphics are colorful and fun, and a multitude of games exist that test speed, reaction time, and coordination in addition to literacy skills. Beyond the high levels of pomp, circumstance, and confetti that greet successful mission completion, prizes for your monster are chosen and earned throughout the game, and range from beautiful cakes for your monster to happily devour to stylish new clothes and accessories for them to wear.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Teach Your Monster to Read automatically saves your progress, there is no pause button, meaning the player must quit every time they want to stop playing the game. This results in repeated instructions or unsaved results if the player quits part-way through a segment.</p>

<p>Additionally, sometimes there is no way to repeat instructions or target words/sounds the player needs to find. Allowing this repetition would be helpful for children who might need additional support.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Teach Your Monster to Read successfully combines literacy learning with fun, entertaining games. With its unique framing of the child as educator, this game empowers players and builds reading confidence while engaging them in creative activities.</p>
