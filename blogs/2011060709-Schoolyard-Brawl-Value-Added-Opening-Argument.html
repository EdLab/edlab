So much has been said about value-added in the past year that I am not sure where to start. Value-added modeling is a system for assessment by which non-teacher-related factors such as family income and demographics are controlled for in order to determine how much value a teacher added to a student's academic achievement. This is measured by measuring the difference in test scores year over year for each student. Since the non-teacher-related effects are likely embedded in the initial and final test scores, those effects can be controlled for and the teacher's contribution can be better isolated. Of course factors such as family income play a role even during the year; one need only consider the case of a student who must work one or two jobs to help support his or her family to understand why students of low SES might show less improvement year to year. Thus, the value-added score for a teacher is not an outright difference of test scores but a more complex formula. 

It seems to me that value-added assessment is the best way to judge the performance of a teacher and should thus be at the center of all recruitment, retention, and salary decisions. Most systems do not use objective metrics for judging the quality of their teaching workforce. Too often these decisions come down to the sympathies and emotions of principals and administrators. Yet this problem is certainly common among those sectors where output is not directly observable. One of the products of this lack of observability is a lack of accountability. Teachers are paid based on inputs, such as certification and experience, and not on their output, namely student achievement. From my perspective, value-added largely ends this problem. Value-added offers quantitative and objective assessments of teacher quality and finally makes a teacher's output observable. Now we can finally have an education system that holds teachers and administrators accountable to students and families.
