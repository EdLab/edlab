<p>Introducing the learning capability in robots reduces the need for human guidance when performing robot tasks. In educational robotics, the ultimate objective of robot learning implementations is to educate students. Therefore, active participation of students in robot training is essential.</p>
 
<p>To see if the challenge of implementing robot learning could be used as a thread for teaching robot intelligence technologies to students, researchers had students implement a robot task in which the desired behavior could not be pre-programmed but must be learned by the robot. The task involved university students applying reinforcement learning (RL), 3D modeling, and cloud communication to create a scenario in which a humanoid robot learns to manipulate multiple joints to maintain its stability when lifting different weights.</p>
 
<p>The experiment was the third in an ongoing multi-case study at the Technion Center for Robotics and Digital Technology Education in Israel. Participants were 1st and 2nd year students on summer internship projects, high school students participating in outreach activities, and Technion students studying technology education. The robots were constructed by students using the ROBOTIS Bioloid Premium kit, and software tools including the 3D modeling system Creo Parametric, and the IoT platform ThingWorx.</p>

<p>In the first phase, university students taught a humanoid robot to adapt its body tilt angle for lifting different weights. In the second phase, high school students constructed animal-like robots and implemented different RL scenarios, utilizing the RL approach tested in the first phase. And in the third phase, undergraduate students constructed and programmed a humanoid robot that could cope with the new challenge and learn to lift an unknown weight through a series of trials and errors.</p>

<p>Researchers found that learning robots successfully engaged engineering students in machine learning, parametric design, digital prototyping and simulation, and connectivity, and that these concepts and technologies are within the grasp of understanding of college freshman and high school students.</p>
