            As students in the United States continue to lag behind in the core subjects as compared to their counterparts from other develop nations, it has become imperative that educators come up with new means of reforming the current educational system.  Various initiatives have been proposed in an attempt to remedy the ongoing problem. They include the implementation of standardized <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1947019,00.html">testing</a> as a way of accessing student performance, increasing teacher <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/does-merit-pay-really-increase-teacher-retention/2012/02/01/gIQAydluhQ_blog.html">pay</a> in hopes of retaining dedicated instructors, and performing teacher <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203961204577267562780533458.html">evaluations</a> as a means of identifying the best instructors. If education is truly going to be reformed in this nation however, a major factor will lie in the utilizing of new tools brought forth by technology.  Unfortunately, many school districts as well as educators across the country have been skeptical about introducing these new learning tools.

Edlab's own Professor Natriello explores the nationwide reluctance to adopt these tools in this <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/07/05/36natriello.h31.html?tkn=SSWF4OeWS%2F35Tmrqc3d2sGsHBUJ%2B4zr5Big5&cmp=ENL-TU-NEWS2">editorial</a> written for Education Week.  Dr. Natriello begins by stating the need to demonstrate to those skeptics the true educational potential which new technology holds. Next he identifies three “critical steps” needed to be taken by educators in order for these new technological tools to be to successfully incorporated into the classroom. Those three steps are, in the appropriate order; 1) finding the appropriate technological learning tool to meet the needs of the student, 2) creating a databank for sharing data formulated by these tools, 3) advocating for legislation aimed at broadening the use of technology in schools. Finally he ends the editorial by noting that new technology should be seen as a supplement as opposed a mere replacement of the physical teacher. With these two modes of learning working together in sync, students will be able to enjoy a much efficient form of learning, one which could very help the U.S regain the title of boasting the best educational system in the world.
