<p>Youâ€™ve probably heard of Bitcoin. This cryptocurrency has no central bank or nation controlling its flow or creation. Instead, network users authenticate and validate each individual transaction. The technology behind this innovation is called Blockchain. How does it work? </p> 

<p>Blockchain is a kind of public ledger that stores information across a network of computers, decentralizing the entire system through wide distribution. No one entity or organization owns the system and anyone can use it or monitor every transaction. For instance, every Bitcoin transaction can be seen on so-called <a href="https://blockchain.info/">Bitcoin explorer websites</a>. </p>  

<p>Each user has a small amount of information called blocks stored chronologically on their computer. Through advanced encryption, the information cannot be duplicated or counterfeited because everyone else in the network can see the records. With this decentralized distribution, Blockchain systems are highly resilient to attacks or breaches. </p>   

<p>Bitcoin is only the beginning. In the future, entire companies can be run through Blockchain technology. How can you see Blockchain impacting education? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/40852">on Vialogues</a> </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:01 Buster Wainwright:</b> Anything that cuts out banks has my vote... however, I'd like to see a greater uptake of this software before I embrace it. I am encouraged by the Bitcoin example (despite the global criminal investigation into its beginnings) which seems to be winning the battle by the establishment to shut it down. I'll take a wait and see approach for now. Very interesting clip though.</p>

<p><b>@02:01 RuthS:</b> It seems like Blockchain technology could have an important role to play in many fields in the future. Is it being taught at schools today? It might be a subject that students will one day need to feel proficient at in order to use it for their careers or to be "citizens" of the internet.</p>
