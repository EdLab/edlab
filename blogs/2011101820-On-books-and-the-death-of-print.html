          <p>
            For  years I’ve proudly declared myself a print enthusiast, the kind of  person who cringes when hearing the phrase “print is dead,” and yet I  have a perhaps morbid (ahem) fascination with the e-book reader debate.   In particular, I find it curious how many <em>New York Times</em> writers  publish nervous pieces about their worry over the death of the object  they hold most dear--and I tend to cheer these writers on.  Granted, I  read these articles online, because I find the printed newspaper  unwieldy--the print rubs off on your fingers, the pages are too large,  and after you’re done you’ve got a pile of thinly sliced dead tree to  recycle.  <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/10/BW_Newspaper_Stack_0.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13145" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/BW_Newspaper_Stack_0-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="99" height="99" /></a>But reading an entire book digitally seems dreary to me, and  riddled with limitations.  Plus, I love my books.  Wooden shelves overflowing with books cover  nearly all of the wall space in my apartment--when I feel the need to  decorate, I consider another bookshelf.  When I sit on the couch,  surrounded by brightly colored jackets, I feel comforted, as though the  books are... well, if not friends, a little like friends. Could a  digital reader inspire a homey, cuddly sensation, or is the e-reader  just a convenient, robotic substitute?

What happens to footnotes, for instance?   In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/will-the-e-book-kill-the-footnote.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2">Will the E-Book Kill the Footnote?</a> author Alexandra Horowitz describes her horror at discovering the  e-book version of her book about dogs doesn’t include her footnotes.   She discovered this after receiving angry letters her readers sent her,  accusing her of intentionally poisoning her dog.  Without the  footnotes, her readers only read her story about giving her dog grapes,  but not the footnote where she acknowledges the small levels of toxicity  grapes contain.  Horowitz goes on to describe the joys of reading  Nicholson Baker’s <em>The Mezzanine</em> (which, as an aside, I recommend everyone read.  Baker delights in  minutia in a dizzying, gleeful fashion).  Footnotes abound in <em>The Mezzanine</em>.  Horowitz points out that a hyperlink, the digital equivalent of a  footnote, is not the same because there’s nothing in particular  compelling you to click it, whereas a footnote is a visible component of  any text, hard to miss.  Horowitz is right, of course, but surely those  who format e-books will realize their error soon and include them.   Right?

Similarly, last February, <em>The New York Times</em> published a piece about the death of annotating, entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/books/21margin.html?emc=eta1">Book Lovers Fear Dim Future for Notes in the Margins</a>,  which discusses a brief history of marginalia studies, and mentions  famous margin-writers throughout history (Mark Twain, Charles Darwin,  Nelson Mandella).  There are societies and clubs devoted to celebrating  and preserving works that include hand-written annotations in the  margins, like the Caxton Club, a group founded in 1895 and still growing  strong--they held a symposium and recently published a book called <em>Other People’s Stories</em>--a  compilation of works marginalia. Considering the wonders of marginalia,  I can’t help but recall the scene in Heathers (the 80’s movie starring  Winona Ryder and Christian Slater)<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/MV5BMTkyMTI5MTYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk0MDkwMw@@._V1._CR0018631863_SS99_.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13142" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/MV5BMTkyMTI5MTYxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk0MDkwMw@@._V1._CR0018631863_SS99_.jpg" alt="" width="99" height="99" /></a> where Veronica and J.D. flip through  Heather’s “meaningfully marked up copy of Moby Dick” (quotation by  memory) for clues on how to make her death look like a suicide.   Somehow, their clicking through her Sony e-reader just wouldn’t pack  the same punch.  There is something human and tangible about seeing a  person’s handwritten mark on the page--far more interesting than it  would be to read an author’s type-written annotations in their preserved  Kindle after their death.  Will anyone want to preserve authors’  Kindles?

Well,  maybe.  Emory University’s Salmon Rushdie archive holds Rushdie’s  complete works--including handwritten journals, book covers,  manuscripts, and most intriguingly, his hard drives. <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/RushdiePressConf.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13144" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/RushdiePressConf-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="106" height="106" /></a>Visitors to the  archive can see his computer screen the way he saw it when drafting his  works, including his sticky notes, comments to himself, and even his  journal entries detailing his thoughts about the technology change and  how computers affected his writing. His is among a new rash of archives  collecting “born digital” material.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/books/16archive.html?pagewanted=all">The New York Times </a>article  goes on to note the challenges digital data poses to preservationists,  and the possibilities digital material presents researchers.  As writer  Patricia Cohen points out, “To the Emory team, simulating the author’s  electronic universe is equivalent to making a reproduction of the desk,  chair, fountain pen and paper that, say Charles Dickens used, and then  allowing visitors to sit and scribble notes on a copy of an early  version of ‘Bleak House.’”  Pretty cool, right?

Maybe  we’re all being a little hysterical about the print is dead cry.   Perhaps every format has its role to play.  Print, after all, is a  technology.  Consider another New York Times article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/opinion/sunday/17gleick.html?_r=3&amp;ref=todayspaper">Books and other Fetish Objects</a>,  in which writer James Gleick makes a claim for access, speed of  delivery, and the fact that more researchers can study an object if you  can view it online, rather than making a trip to another state or  country where a rare original document is held.  He challenges  historians to stop fetishizing objects when what’s most important is the  information the object carries.  And interestingly, he ends his article  with a reference to death: “An object like this — a talisman — is like  the coffin at a funeral. It deserves to be honored, but the soul has  moved on.” I disagree with him, but I think his article is meant to  serve as a wake up call, a plea for book enthusiasts to lighten up.

Last  week, I ordered a Kindle.  I ordered it because I’m intrigued to see  what it’s like to carry a slim, practically weightless object on the  subway, rather than the pounds of books I tend to carry in my bag.   Traveling from home to school, school to work, and back home again  with my backpack, I feel like a 5th grader or an encyclopedia salesman.  We’ll see how it goes with the Kindle, but regardless, the paperback  book friends I already own are staying right where they are on the  shelves.

(And two days ago, <em>The New York Times </em>published an article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/technology/amazon-rewrites-the-rules-of-book-publishing.html?pagewanted=all">Amazon's new role as a publishing house</a>.  Ah!  Is this the death of publishing, too?  Questions for another time.)
