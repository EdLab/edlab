            	Is the show supernatural based on reality? The show is about two brothers that lost their mom and dad to a demon. To avenge their deaths they become demon hunters like their father, putting ghosts and demons to rest. 
	Surprisingly the show has some truth to it. The demons and urban legends that they encounter throughout their hunts are real legends found in folktales across America. One the episodes was based on a really childhood story about Bloody Mary. If you say Bloody Mary three times into a mirror, she will appear out of the mirror and kill you.  Native American folktales such as shape shifters also appear in two of the episodes. 
        The setting of the show is dark and eerie all the time. The show presents bits of blood, but nothing that is rated R. Monsters, demons and spirits lurk around every corner. It is their job to vanquish and take care of the situation. Many of the creatures are based on actual folktales and legends. The role play on the show is very life like and realistic. They have psychics, genies, shape shifters, and the spirits that haunt places across the country. 

Can any of this be true?
       
       Many different channels such as PBS, Discovery Channel, and the History Channel have done specials on the paranormal. People believe that these things are real. 

The next question is, if they are real, then do we worry about them or be afraid? Are spirits vengeful?

If not, what are they doing in the mortal realm? 

       The movies such as Ghostbusters depict the stereotypical fictional ghosts. In reality they are probably tormented souls in human forms doomed to walk the earth until salvation saves them. 

But if such things are real then what leaves us to believe that the Bermuda Triangle is not real? What is the reason for spirits to take out their anger and frustration on the living?
