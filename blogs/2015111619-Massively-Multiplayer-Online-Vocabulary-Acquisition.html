<p>Gamers rejoice—research studies are continuing to provide evidence that videogames have certain educational benefits. In this particular study conducted by researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, World of Warcraft—a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG)—was shown to be a helpful tool in vocabulary learning for English language learners. MMOGs are often known to provide users with the opportunity to work collaboratively and to communicate effectively in order to achieve a shared goal. This feature became the focal point in this study in attempting to understand how gameplay allowed for developing language proficiency.</p>
 
<p>The researchers draw from past studies that show gameplay provides a "situative embodiment" experience, where users enter the game in a narrative way that allows them to engage in actions with consequences to learn English through "first-order languaging." The concept behind first-order languaging is that gamers are able to interact with real-time occurrences alongside other users to decode a language system through this immersive experience.</p>
 
<p>This study focused specifically on a Japanese national user who had studied English for nine years. He played the game alongside one of the study’s authors who spoke English fluently. One example of language acquisition during gameplay was when he accidentally looted an enemy due to his misunderstanding of the word "loot." He apologized for the mistake and the English speaker explained what "loot" means and how the word is used in contexts outside the game as well. </p>
 
<p>Although the researchers support their argument for gameplay-based language learning with examples of other research and provide ample transcripts from this study, this particular setup still seems like somewhat of a specialized environment. Not everyone who plays World of Warcraft may be willing to carefully explain vocabulary words that players do not understand, and there may more trial-and-error involved for those who are struggling with the game due to the language barrier. Even so, as the authors emphasize, playing and being invested in a video game may provide English language learners with the chance to "learn to be" through language rather than "learn about language" in a traditional classroom setup, where they are stuck memorizing grammar rules and correcting their spelling errors.</p>
