Could an abundance of librarians make students more persistent? The authors analyzed data from ARL member libraries to show that the ratio of professional library staff to students had a positive impact on retention and graduation rates when controlling for factors like socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity. 

<b>Description:</b>
The review of the literature reveals that few studies have been done on library effectiveness in retention beyond traditional input/output measures. A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133307001243">2007 study</a> found a positive correlation to measures like library expenditures and salaries to student retention and the authors' aim was to replicate the results while controlling for non-library retention factors. The authors found that schools investing in professional librarians have better retention rates regardless of sex, race, and financial aid status. They concede that more staff on campus in general, the ratio between staff and students, and university spending on student services both in and outside of the library contributed to higher retention and graduation rates. Support for professional librarianship may not be directly responsible for these increases, but it functions as a barometer of health in the university community. 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
A <a href="http://ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=tfh&AN=9409260313&site=ehost-live&scope=site">study</a> mentioned by the authors identifying factors of retention and satisfaction in universities seems particularly applicable; students were more satisfied with experiences that gave them a sense of community on campus, like orientations and peer groups. The library is an important community tool and creator of community tools, especially in a commuter campus like TC. If we can manage to decentralize the kind of community-building and access created by a librarian-heavy university, we can attempt to negate the effects of a shrinking professional librarian force.
