<p>The college experience is meant to be one of the most social periods of a person’s life. Yet, students nowadays often face the "fear of missing out." From Facebook invites, to email listservs, to announcements on bulletin boards, or just word-of-mouth from friends, sometimes it’s simply too hard to keep up with everything that is happening around campus. Enter <a href="http://www.campusquad.co/">Campus Quad</a>, a new location-based app, geared towards today’s mobile-savvy college student. With listings that update in real-time, students will now be able to better manage their social calendars.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Students can selectively choose which people and groups to follow and engage with, so that each user has a personalized experience with the app. Users can also access classifieds, coupons, and other promotions, based on their location on campus. Campus Quad allows users to easily post announcements and create mobile flyers to help promote their own events. These can be shared with a select group of users, an organization, or with the entire campus community. The app can integrate with Facebook, Twitter, online listerservs, and text messaging, so that information can be easily and instantaneously shared across multiple platforms. There is also a strong social media component with Campus Quad. Users can post pictures, message each other, and share "likes" with the app.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>The goal of Campus Quad is to be a one-stop listing for all campus happenings. However, this may prove challenging as it requires buy-in from users at all levels. Students, organizations, clubs, and university administrators must all choose Campus Quad as the primary source to post their event announcements and updates. This can be difficult if users are already accustomed to using other, more traditional methods. There is certainly the potential for more widespread usage in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Campus Quad is all about driving engagement with students. From the perspective of an organization or club, they can easily monitor student usage and they can instantly connect with their users. From the student perspective, they are no longer inundated with event listings and announcements that may not appeal to them. They can easily find exactly what they are looking for, whether it’s a social event, a study group, or just free food on campus! Easy integration with existing platforms is also a big plus.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>The campus bulletin board goes mobile.</p>
