          <p>
            It seems that things are not so smooth this semester. 

Pranav and I had a difficult time putting TC mobile into production. At first, the version of php on Lois was not enough for Device Atlas, which is used for detecting mobile devices, and so that we couldn't decide whether to redirect the web page or not. As we didn't want to update php on Lois, we decided to transfer the whole library website to SilentBob, a Linux server which takes less workload. We tried a whole day to update php on this server and Pranav subsequently solved this problem by updating php manually since automatic FreeBSD update is no longer available. Afterwards, we found there was still a problem with Device Atlas when it applied for memory, and this problem was solved by modifying its source code. Cheers! Device Atlas is finally working!

But this was not the end of the story. We found that linking to Room Reservation did not work on SilentBob. This was mainly due to an improper name we set for the folder. After solving this problem, we could see the login page but found that WIND system was not redirecting back to our page after checking username and password. We still need some research on this problem, but I believe it should be the last problem for this task as of now. So cheers! Success is ahead for us!

I felt the repository was kind of messy when I was doing the course project so I removed the whole repository and tried the latest version. I don't know what actually happened, but the updating was unsuccessful and the project folder disappeared and since I had set the model of my recycle bin as "delete directly", I could not easily find my source. I was so upset as I had spent a month working on this project. I sent an email to my boss about the problem and he offered an extension on the project. However, I still didn't want to rewrite a project that I have been writing for a month, so I downloaded a file recovery system and fortunately, it worked and after two hours, I had recovered all my files. Cheers!

So I hope this could be a turning point of my luck and I wish everything will be successful in future!
