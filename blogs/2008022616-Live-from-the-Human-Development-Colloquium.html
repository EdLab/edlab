          <p>
            Today, Eric, Ching-Fu and I attended the first seminar of the Human Development Colloquium where <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/7>Professor Gary Natriello</a> and <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/?facid=jbb21">Professor John Black</a> were to speak on “Technology and Learning from the Perspectives of Sociology and Cognitive Science”.  Somehow time got away, and we never actually got to hear Professor John Black's portion of the talk on Technology and Learning from the perspective of Cognitive Science.  In any case, it was a terrific introduction to EdLab, its goals and philosophies (particularly for myself, having only been here for a week).

Here's a quick run down of the seminar:

11:35 AM  A pretty sizable audience begins filing in, comprised of students, faculty, and staff.  People begin eating lunch (sandwiches, chips and really good cookies).  I'm estimating that there are at least thirty people in the room.  

11:42 AM  Professor Black makes an introduction and announces that this is the first seminar in the 5-seminar Human Development Colloquium Series.  A schedule is passed out.  

11:45 AM  Gary Nariello begins his talk by stating that it is important for sociologists of education to be more engaged in the rapidly changing nature of technology in the classroom and society.

He makes an impressive, three-part presentation of EdLab and its many facets and philosophies, divided by three questions and the corresponding EdLab projects seeking to tackle the answers:  

1. How might we rethink knowledge and authority structures? 
2. How might we rethink learning institutions and networks? 
3. How might we rethink learning encounters? 

In response to his first question, he discusses three EdLab projects: Teachers College Record, PocketKnowledge, and AfterEd.  Teachers College Record, the online version of the print publication, he explained, preserves some of the traditional authoritative structure, but allows for some "talking back", where users can read an article and post comments.  PocketKnowledge, the "social archive of Teachers College" on the other hand, is a deliberate attempt to "cross boundaries", meaning anything can be uploaded to the site, from dissertations to a John Dewey collection to "wedding photos of an MA student".  Lastly, AfterEd, is an attempt to communicate knowledge beyond traditional print articles, and to invent "new genres" and experiment with mixing categories.  AfterEd seeks to put intellectual work into new forms of publication, using media to capture and convey good content (not just videotaping lectures).  

In response to his second question, he discusses three more EdLab projects: Teaching "The Levees", NED (Networked Education Database), and The Digital Atelier.  Teaching "The Levees" is an experiment on distance modeling (what we think teaching would be like on this topic), remote professional development, and interaction networks (promoting activity among professionals).  NED (Networked Education Database) is an attempt to use online course platforms such as blackboard, moodle, and WebCT already deployed in colleges and secondary schools to gather data in one place.  And lastly, the Digital Atelier--the space in which EdLab exists, is an experiment in face-to-face environments.  The way that the EdLab is set up, with its no-walls, open, and "workshop" style is meant to provide a setting where roles and work can be leveraged and shared.

In response to his third question, he discusses three more EdLab projects: Meety, EditJam, and the Collaborative Solutions Group.  Meety, a tool for "classroom augmentation", seeks to enhance the face-to-face experience and provide additional means for connection.  EditJam, is an experiment with combining tools, roles and forms with youth.  And the Collaborative Solutions Group seeks to orchestrate interactions, concentrating effort, and compress time to fill a wide range of research and consulting needs.

12:45 PM  A somewhat intense Q/A Session begins.  People were concerned with issues such as the effectiveness on learning and educational benefits that the EdLab projects actually have, what legitimate data the EdLab is collecting, and why EdLab seeks to create more discussions when there are already so many.  There was also some discussion on the subject of authority and power, and who should have it.

I'm personally very psyched about all of this.  It seems to be a very genuine attempt at creating more democracy, more opportunities, and better communication in the world of education and youth.  I like knowing that EdLab exists for the purpose of seeking change and growth, and think people will eventually catch on.  EdLab has amazing potential to make great waves in the world of education. I also thought Professor Natriello was very effective in articulating the need for Sociologists to participate in this study of emerging technologies and the way in which it affects education and social change. Especially given the experimental and research seeking nature of EdLab, it only makes sense that sociologists of education would make rightful partners in the endeavor.
