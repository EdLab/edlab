            With a new year comes a new set (or for some a continual) of hot topics and debates in education. This <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-ferlazzo/educationrelated-predicti_b_802949.html">Huffington Post piece</a> predicts the top 10 stories in education this year.

1)	In a political move and with the ante for the 2012 election set to increase, the Obama administration will lower its tune of educational reform to support (through changes in the proposal) of but not authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Act, which Congress will put off until after the elections

2)	The movement by mayors to gain controls of their schools districts will decrease

3)	The public and political backlash from Cathie Black's appointment as New York City's schools chancellor will prevent the appointment of non-educators to influential administrative posts in education.

4)	<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5130">The parent trigger movement</a> will die and fade quickly.

5)	Somebody will develop an effective online program that will help English Language Learners improve their writing abilities.

6)	Former head of DC schools Michelle Rhee's Students First organization wont accomplish much in terms of reform but will rather become a radio show and make a TV commentator.

7)	One of the two state programs that are preparing the "next generation" of assessments will make a strong effort to get teachers involved in their development.

8)	California's newly elected governor Jerry Brown will make significant and major cuts to the state's education budget. 

9)	The number of document cameras (the latest evolution of the overhead projector and allows anything placed on it -- student work, book pages, etc. to be projected on to a screen) sold will take a huge leap upward as more and more schools see it as an extremely cost-effective way to use technology so that it benefits students.

10)	 Teaching 2030, the new book from The Center For Teaching Quality, will become the most discussed and useful education-related book this year.
