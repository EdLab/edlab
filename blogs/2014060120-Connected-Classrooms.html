<i>Connected Classrooms aims to make it easier for teachers to access exciting educational content to share with their students. In addition to virtual field trips, teachers who visit the Connected Classrooms site will have the opportunity to join a Google+ Community with other educators to collaborate on field trips and share best practices for using digital tools in the classroom.</i> (Quote from the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/11/google-explore-world-right-from.html">Official Google Blog</a>)<p>

<b>Field Trip 3.0</b><br>
From <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ctat0l35jjtf4iv6j2su8iakr50?e=PersonalizedSul">NASA</a> to <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/107535210529060675394/posts">PBS</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/edu/">Google Education</a> team has recruited a diverse roster of partners to take part in their <a href="http://connectedclassrooms.withgoogle.com/">Connected Classrooms</a> virtual field trip initiative. Built on the Google+ <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">"Hangouts on Air"</a> platform and launched in November of 2013, <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/cc-faqforteachers.pdf">the initiative</a> involves "...live video conferences with up to 10 participant screens that are broadcasted on Google+, recorded onto YouTube, and are fully embeddable on external websites." 
<p>
The initiative provides curated content tailored to the needs of K-12 educators and learners while hosting a dedicated community hub for sharing best practices. These free, open resources paired with access to otherwise inaccessible locales and far-flung experts from a variety of fields create a unique combination of accessibility and discovery that is unparalleled in the virtual learning arena. Additionally, the platform’s seamless integration with other free, Google-developed tools, including <a href="http://www.google.com/edu/tools-and-solutions/index.html#collaboration">Apps for Education</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3yA8nDwraeOfnYfBWun83g">YouTube EDU</a>, Google Docs, and the recently announced <a href=" http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/previewing-new-classroom.html"> Google Classroom</a> makes Connected Classrooms a viable addition to an educator’s roster of affordable, future-focused learning tools.  
<p>
<b>Connecting the Cash-strapped Classroom:</b><br>
Virtual field trips give students access to "rock-stars" in a particular field and are  increasingly useful as <a href="http://www.csg.org/pubs/capitolideas/sept_oct_2012/educationbudgetcuts.aspx">cash strapped education programs</a> face fewer opportunities for off-site excursions. The traditional field trip, long a feature of public school education providing cultural experiences to students regardless of financial background, is beginning to decline in popularity. 
<p>
<b>Google Lures Groundbreaking Talent</b><br>
Beyond the affordability of a Connected Classrooms field trip, the draw of the "<a href="http://www.rankingthebrands.com/The-Brand-Rankings.aspx?rankingID=118&year=763">Google brand</a>" ensures that the initiative attracts the "rock star" talent necessary to engage with the community. As Lisa Jiang, Manager of Google+ Education Partnerships, explains to <i>New Learning Times</i>, "We invite classrooms to participate in virtual learning experiences in places or with people that students otherwise wouldn't get an opportunity to see." (For more from Lisa, read her exclusive NLT interview below). For example, a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c9agonlhb3vp9sbm5c0u2fqrr00?e=PersonalizedSul">recent Connected Classrooms Hangout with Ken Burns</a> to mark the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address united educators and learners from around the country in a live conversation with the award-winning film maker. As one participant, retired teacher Carolyn Stanley, commented, "This Google+ hangout with Ken Burns and students truly showcases how important it is to incorporate technology and social media into our classes. Even watching this as an archive, I felt as if Ken Burns was speaking to me." It is this intersection of openly accessible technology with the potential to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+baseballhalloffame/posts?e=PersonalizedSul">interact with a "legend"</a> that just might make Connected Classrooms the stuff of learning legends. 
<p>
<b>Exclusive NewLearningTimes.com interview with Lisa Jiang, Google+ Education Partnerships Manager at Google:</b><br> 

<b>Question:</b> How does a Connected Classrooms Hangout On Air field trip differ from other types of hangouts?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Connected Classrooms is a K-12 program offered by the Google+ Education team. The use of Google+ Hangouts is no different from other types of Hangouts, but the content of these videoconferences is geared towards K-12 aged students. We invite classrooms to participate in virtual learning experiences in places or with people that students otherwise wouldn't get an opportunity to see. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What is your guiding criteria for picking field trip partners?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> There are a lot of factors that go into picking our Connected Classrooms partners, but the ultimate goal is to connect students with the most amazing people, places and things! 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How might a classroom with less than 1:1 ratio of tablets best engage with/plan for a hangout?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> It's not a problem at all since the only requirements for using Hangouts are the following: a strong internet connection<computer (or mobile device) with the Hangout plug-in, and a webcam and microphone.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What is one of your most inspiring Connected Classrooms "case studies"?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> That's a hard question! A couple of my favorites are:<br>

<b><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/ckib564jui958el5k11ahokg0d0?e=PersonalizedSul">White House Holidays</a></b>: A virtual field trip to the White House during the holidays, hosted by the pastry chef and chief decorator to the WH.<br>
<b><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c9agonlhb3vp9sbm5c0u2fqrr00?e=PersonalizedSul">50th Anniversary of the Gettysburg Address with Ken Burns</a></b>: Documentarian, Ken Burns, recited the Gettysburg address live in a Hangout.<br>
<b><a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cp8upbg0aul3t5vtkdc6c301nb4?e=PersonalizedSul">Oscar-Nominated Visual Effects Demo</a></b>: Really cool Hangout with oscar-nominated visual fx artist who transformed a regular guy into the Lone Ranger.<br>
