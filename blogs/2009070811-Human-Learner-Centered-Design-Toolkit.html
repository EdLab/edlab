            <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/alissa-walker/designerati/human-centered-design-toolkit-shares-information">Fastcompany</a> announced yesterday: 
<blockquote>As designers working to improve the quality of life in other countries, the firm IDEO has spent more than 10 years creating a methodology focused on designing for the user. And now, IDEO wants to give all of that methodology away. A series of PDFs that are free to download, the Human-Centered Design Toolkit hopes to empower organizations and design firms by giving them their field-tested tools for social impact in a way that focuses more on sharing information than authorship.
</blockquote>

IDEO created a toolkit for applying Human-Centered Design to inspire new solutions to difficult challenges within communities of need.

<blockquote>Human-Centered Design is a process used for decades to create new solutions for companies and organizations. Human-Centered Design can help you enhance the lives of people. This process has been specially-adapted for organizations like yours that work with people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Human-Centered Design (HCD) will help you hear people's needs in new ways, create innovative solutions to meet these needs, and deliver solutions with financial sustainability in mind.
</blockquote>

The Toolkit is divided into four sections:

The <b>Introduction</b> will give an overview of HCD and help you understand how it might be used alongside other methods.

The <b>Hear</b> guide will help your design team prepare for fieldwork and understand how to collect stories that will serve as insight and inspiration. Designing meaningful and innovative solutions that serve your customers begins with gaining deep empathy for their needs, hopes and aspirations for the future. The Hear booklet will equip the team with methodologies and tips for engaging people in their own contexts to delve beneath the surface.

The <b>Field</b> Guide and <b>Asporations</b> cards are a complement to the Hear guide; these are the tools your team will take with them in order to conduct research.

The <b>Create</b> guide will help your team work together in a workshop format to translate what you heard from people into frameworks, opportunities, solutions, and prototypes. During this phase, you will move from concrete to more abstract thinking in identifying themes and opportunities and back to the concrete with solutions and prototypes.

The <b>Deliver</b> guide will help catapult the top ideas you have created toward implementation. The realization of solution includes rapid revenue and cost modeling, capability assessment, and implementation panning. The activities offered in this phase are meant to complement your organization's existing implementation processes and may prompt adaptations to the way solutions are typically rolled out. </blockquote>

Why a Toolkit?
“This kit doesn't offer solutions. Instead, it offers techniques, methods, tips, and worksheets to guide you through a process that gives voice to your constituents and allows their desires to guide the creation and implementation of solutions. Human-Centered Design is  a process broken into a set of tools. This is so that you can pick and choose which techniques work best for your context and situation.“ (p. 7)

My vision is to have a Design Education (DesignEd) guide with different methods and techniques available in the future to develop a designedly way of thinking as well as skills for generating innovations in education — on a learner and on a teacher level. The challenge of the organizational development and skill training has still to be addressed but the toolkit definitely can serve as a seedling ground for it to design an environment to facilitate educational innovation.
Let's collaborate on Learner-Centered Designs in Education in our DesignEd Bootcamp!
