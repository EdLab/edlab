<p><b>Title:</b> Towards an Understanding of Affect and Knowledge from Student Interaction with an Intelligent Tutoring System (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Maria Ofelia Z. San Pedro, Ryan S.J.d. Baker, Sujith M. Gowda, & Neil T. Heffernan</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The state of flow in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/dp/0061339202">Csikszentmihalyi’s Flow Theory</a> is characterized by a balance between challenge and skill which leads to intensive engagement. Flow represents a match between task difficulty and knowledge; overwhelming challenge can lead to anxiety or frustration, and insufficient challenge can cause boredom. Empirical studies of traditional classrooms have shown that students experience the highest engagement when they perceive their skill as high and tasks as challenging. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~rsb2162/AIED_SBGH.pdf">Towards an Understanding of Affect and Knowledge from Student Interaction with an Intelligent Tutoring System</a> tested this theory and other aspects of flow by analyzing student interactions with an intelligent tutoring system for middle school math called <a href="http://www.assistments.org/">ASSISTments</a>. The system creates a formative assessment of student work and provides detailed information to teachers. On the student side, ASSISTments provides scaffolding, help, and feedback. The lessons in the system correspond to the skills and concepts covered in relevant state standardized examinations.</p> 

<p>The study took place over 5 years and examined 1,568,974 student interactions in the ASSISTments system. It was based on log data only, as no physical sensors were used. The authors applied a <a href="http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF01099821.pdf">Bayesian Knowledge Tracing</a> model to estimate students’ knowledge. This model was used to predict difficulty levels for each problem and each student based on the skills required for that problem and students’ past work. In this way the model could predict correct answers when student skill was higher than current difficulty, incorrect answers when current difficulty was higher than student skill, and regular probability of correctness when difficulty and skill were in balance. The authors also estimated engaged concentration, boredom, and frustration based on student behavior in the system to calculate the possibility of flow. According to the theory of flow, anxiety in participants is also worth noting, but this is not measured in ASSISTments because the literature has shown that anxiety is rarely observed in classroom use of intelligent tutoring systems.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors found that boredom, defined as disengagement from the material, was less common than expected in high skill students. Boredom was more commonly correlated with students at any skill level encountering unfamiliar material. This is in contrast to flow theory, which predicts that high skill students will be bored with low-level material. The authors found that these students actually were engaged, but became angry and frustrated when repeatedly presented with low-level material. Frustration was common both for very difficult material and very easy material in all student skill levels. Engaged concentration was more frequently encountered in high skill students, but the authors found that ASSISTments often inspired engaged concentration regardless of student skill level.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
From these findings, it seems that students have expectations for intelligent tutoring systems that they may not have in traditional classrooms. Instead of becoming bored with material that was too easy as predicted by flow theory, the students became angry at the system. ASSISTments regularly inspired engaged concentration, but the disengagement students felt when faced with new concepts could be a problem unique to this particular intelligent tutoring system or a more general phenomena of student interaction with online material. Though the study was limited to a single tutoring system, it provides evidence to challenge an educational psychology theory, and the results raise questions about applying learning theories developed in traditional classrooms to new and evolving instructional environments.</p>
