          <p>
            This article notes that Romania is  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/getting-the-it-education-you-need-without-the-debt-could-studying-abroad-be-the-answer-7000034546/" target = "blank">one of the cheapest countries</a> to have an education at a high-class level. I think people in the US hesitate attend foreign universities because they think the quality of education is not as good. Additionally, employers and other institutions might not highly rate overseas degrees. In European countries like Romania, scholars come from other parts of the world, including the US, for an education. The cost for students coming from the countries in the European Union (EU) is $1140 a year and for foreign countries, it cost $342 a month or $3,078 a year.
<p>
Romania has a very low cost of living. Only $253 a month is needed to buy all necessities and three-quarters of students who graduate in their field from universities find a job. It can cost you $8.87 to take unlimited rides for a month and average food cost is $3.80. Foreign foods like pizza, salads and Arabic cuisines are served. One negative is that only 20% of part time jobs can accommodate a student's schedule but there are a lot of jobs that students can try to fit in your schedule.
<p>
Finally when academic reputation, employer reputation, staff-student ratio, citations per faculty, proportion of international students, and proportion of international faculty where taken into account, several institutions in Romanian and other European countries such as Belgium, and France were ranked among the top 800 in the world. This is not bad considering the amount of higher education institutions in the world.
