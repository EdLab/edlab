            The education system in South Africa has yet to excel, even in the post-apartheid era. According to Angie Motshekga, South Africa’s Education Minister, the education system is in crisis. To some degree, Motshekga might be right. For instance, out of 800,000 students, 213,000 failed their end of school year examination. Such shocking statistics speaks volume. Some people believe that not enough money is invested in schools in South Africa. However, about 6% of the country’s GDP is used to fund education, more than any African country. 

One major reason why South Africa's school system seems in disarray is that people believe the idea or legacy of apartheid still exists. For instance, black children are packed like sardines in mini-busses and driven to schools. In today's world, children do not need to travel 19 miles to go to school. This is the case in South Africa because all the better schools are located in predominantly white suburbs. This can affect student's school performance. 

Individuals who can’t afford to travel long distances only attend schools in the townships. However, many of the schools lack quality teaching. Besides quality teaching, language is also another area of concern. There are 11 official languages in South Africa. Students often struggle to write exams in a language other than their home language. The large increase in teacher’s absence also affects students. If teachers are not showing up for work, students in turn are not learning. All of these are some of the major factors preventing South Africa’s education from reaching greater heights.
