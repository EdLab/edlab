Not to be confused with <a href="http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/">Columbia Universitie's student health Q&A site</a>, <a href="http://www.alice.org/index.php?page=what_is_alice/what_is_alice">Alice 3</a> is a free, decade-old computer programming teaching aid (the third version recently launched & is reviewed here), geared towards young women.  The virtual learning environment is the brainchild of Carnegie Mellon University faculty, in particular, the famed and much missed CMU professor <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/beyond/2008/summer/an-enduring-legacy.shtml">Randy Pausch</a>, as well as an assortment of other institutions, including Stanford.  Learn more about the team behind Alice 3 <a href="http://www.alice.org/index.php?page=people/people">here</a>.  Inspired by a need to engage young women in computer programming, Alice was created and still endeavors to allow users to develop, animate and interact with 3D worlds using simple drag & drop, object-oriented, production-focused and text-based programming languages and actions.  Learn more <a href="http://www.alice.org/index.php?page=what_is_alice/what_is_alice">here</a>.  

<b>Pros:</b>  Alice is a great introduction to computer programming for young women, as the STEM subjects continue to experience a <a href="http://www.aauw.org/learn/research/upload/whysofew.pdf">decline in female graduates</a>, this is still, a decade later, an important initiative.  The drag & drop method of interacting with the interface to "program" your avatar to make a variety of movements all but eliminates the frustration of coding for learner who might otherwise be turned-off by the intricate rules of programming.  Instead, users are exposed to basic high-level concepts and through a fun, engaging interface, can receive instant design gratification and feedback from the system. 

<b>Cons:</b> The interface feels dated and seems a bit more like a clunky version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second Life</a>than an engaging world for young learners.  Also, the Alice logo reminds me a bit of a <a href="http://www.bratz.com/">Bratz doll</a> & is perhaps not a great, universally appealing image for young women.  I know that this project is over a decade, old but as we move into an era when we need to encourage young women to participate in STEM subjects even more, perhaps CMU and their partners could re-invest design time in further updating the look & feel of the program. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> As we consider ways to engage learners in virtual learning environments, this is yet another example of the benefits of low-barrier to entry design and the value of simplifying a normally complex process for the sake of an immersive introduction.  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> Alice provides a great example of multi-university collaboration, and shows us how a long-term project can grow and continue to be relevant when the basic premise is relevant to a growing population of users and the basic feature set is strong... 10 years is a long time for a learning environment to exist in any form!  Perhaps this is a great model for EdLab to follow as we develop and track out projects and eventually seek-out partners at other universities.
