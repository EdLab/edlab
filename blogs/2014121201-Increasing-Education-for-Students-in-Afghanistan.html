          <p>
            The social differences between men and women are still a problem in many parts of the world, especially remote and impoverished communities. In some of these communities, females are not allowed to attend school. They are usually married off at a young age and spend most of their time performing household tasks while their husbands work. This <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/5485d4496.html">piece</a> offers an inspirational and encouraging effort by a woman in war torn Afghanistan who completed her education despite numerous obstacles. The young woman, educated in a refugee camp, wants other Afghan girls to also have an education. She initially faced difficulty in persuading the parents.

She was eventually able to start with a few students and taught them in a small tent. In time, she was funded by NGO's and other organizations. As a result, the number of students grew and members of the community started seeing the value of an education. Due to her efforts, 900 girls and 650 boys have graduated. Many of them are doctors, engineers or employed in other occupations. This story highlights the importance of education in changing lives. This is even more important in impoverished and war torn countries, where education can play a major role in improving that society and the lives of citizens.
