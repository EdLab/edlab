<a href ="http://www.k12math.org/doc.php?doc=4pillars-w"> Brenner, Mathew A. (2011). The Four Pillars Upon Which the Failure of Math Education Rests (and what to do about them), (July2011) p49-59.</a>


<b>Description:</b>
In this paper, the author gives his reasons about why math education has failed according to him. Compared to the rest of the world, we are ranked very low when it comes to math and science education. One reason he gives is that students are to used to the ritual of mathematics, meaning that when a student looks at a problem involving math they begin by writing down a set-up for the solution that they would use for similar problems. While this might help the student solve the problem, it shows that they are not thinking about finding a solution for that specific problem. One of the examples the author gives is if a problem involves graphing, the first thing a student will do is draw a graph with an intersecting pair of axis, even if a problem will not need the use of the negative axis. While this may not seem like a big deal to most people, it shows that instead of understanding what the problem is and finding a custom solution for it, the students are just solving the problem by doing what they did for similar problems. I believe this to be true, since I catch myself doing this sometimes, before realizing it. Many teachers still teach their students to solve math problems using the same set up used for other problems.

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b>
I strong believe in moving away from a “ritual” type of teaching, and educate students on understanding how they are solving a problem. This is an example of the <a href ="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/494"> factory style</a> teaching that still lingers in our schools, and with more jobs requiring understanding and creativity, and less of being able to follow instructions, we need to stop this type of teaching. I would like more teachers to teach students to understand a problem and solve it, rather than teaching students to get the right answer to a problem.
