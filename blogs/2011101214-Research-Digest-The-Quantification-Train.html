Arne Duncan has announced a new <a href="http://www.ed.gov/teaching/our-future-our-teachers">Teacher Preparation Plan</a>, outlining the Obama administration's goals for the future of teacher education.

<b>Review</b>:
The report identifies a few problems, including: 

There aren't enough smart people going into teaching.
There isn't enough hands-on clinical training in teacher education
There aren't enough teachers in the STEM fields

They identify a few programs that they think are doing things right, including Kansas' Emporia state university, where clinical experience “begins in a student's sophomore year and continues through to graduation.”  Although the federal government is restricted in how specific its demands can be in this arena (education is still fairly decentralized), they also offer their agenda to supplement state action.  

Their plan seems to be to start modestly with data collection, and from there scale up to a method for rigorously evaluating teacher training programs, and figuring out which “work” (in the sense of producing teachers whose students learn quicker and better), and which don't.  To get smarter people into teaching in the first place, they're also going to “revamp and upgrade the existing TEACH grant program” to offer scholarships to “the best students in the best [teacher-training] programs.”  There are also funds slotted to increase minority presence in the teaching field.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
It's interesting that this report came out just around the time Jerry Brown (the Governor of California) <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/louis-freedberg/brown-standardized-testing_b_1004248.html">vetoed</a> an education bill that would have added more data collection and evaluation to the California educational system.  There is certainly a split on this issue in our governing class, but it looks to me like the “quants” are winning, and that there are going to be a lot of opportunities in the next few years for data collection/analysis in the educational system.  Is there some way we can jump on that train?
