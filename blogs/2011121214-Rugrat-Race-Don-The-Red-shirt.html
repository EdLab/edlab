            When it comes time for parents to start thinking about sending their kids to school, one perplexing choice they will face is whether or not to engage in “redshirting.” This is the practice of holding your kid back for a year before enrolling them in kindergarten.  When they do get to school, they'll be older than all their peers, which, in theory, should give them a leg-up in school performance (and, I suspect, social performance as well).  The New York Times, along with many others, has run <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/06/12/whos-ready-for-kindergarten?ref=sunday">plenty of</a> <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E2DC1430F930A35755C0A9619C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1">articles</a> on the question over the year, and I thought the issue looked serious enough (and contentious enough) to be worth discussing as the first Rugrat Race post.

Some <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17085.pdf">researchers in Canada</a> found a helpful natural experiment when, due to a series of abrupt policy shifts, a cohort of students in British Columbia were separated into two groups, one of which starting kindergarten late, one starting kindergarten early, with a total gap of about a year between the two groups.  The paper is ostensibly about the effects of kindergarten itself, but the authors conclude that entering kindergarten as an older student is associated with lower rates of grade repetition and (fairly minor) increased test-score performance.

In a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.srcd.org%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_docman%26task%3D%2520doc_download%26gid%3D120&ei=FFnmTsikEMbs0gGKvrmwDw&usg=AFQjCNGxyQKlUllcoKsRfy1gy1Wy89mgLA">literature review</a>, Deborah Stipek concluded that there is a small advantage to redshirting in test performance, which mostly fades out after a few years.  On the other hand, redshirted kids may end up misbehaving more.  She's careful to make clear that “The evidence that exists does not support this practice [redshirting] as a general rule… The evidence is too meager and open to interpretation to be used as a guide for individual decision-making.”

Of course, regardless of whether or not redshirting is beneficial to individual students, it seems likely that it's a positional, zero-sum game.  If everybody redshirts, there'll be no individual effects, except that entire school system has been shifted one year back.  It may be that redshirting can be appropriate for helping fit kids of varying maturity levels into their proper place (Leonard Sax argues <a href="http://www.education.com/magazine/article/Are_Todays_Kindergartens/">here</a> that boys, who mature later, would benefit from redshirting for this reason), but this seems unlikely, and rarely offered as an actual justification. Stipek argues that we don't really have a good way of telling which kids are ready for school, and, at the end of her article, writes “the research reviewed in this report does not support a policy of moving the birth day for school entry to increase the average age of children entering school.”

So when making that individual decision, what factors should you take into account?  What kind of alternative learning you can provide seems to be a big one.  There are, as one might expect, big educational gains to a year in school, so if your kid is going to be missing out on that, it might be a good idea to try to make up the gap with home-schooling, tutoring, etc.  Also, and this is more speculative, it seems like it might be a good idea to get the more social, active, and dominant kids in school right away to be socialized, and let the shy, retiring kids wait a year so that they won't be so intimidated by peer interaction.
