Next week, I'll be teaching a class on programming to a group of middle school students at The School at Columbia University. The idea of bringing powerful tech skills to a younger generation is something we talk a lot about at the lab, so I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me out with some advice. Classes will run 5 hours a day each day next week. I expect there to be on the order of 10 or so students, each of which has their own Macbook through a school laptop program. The class was requested specially by the students who are participating.

In the short amount of time I have, my goal will be to validate and expand on each of the students' self-professed interest in programming and technology. I'd like to be able to communicate a set of critical high-level programming concepts, and since the course will necessarily have a project component, there will be an emphasis on application. My intent is to find some sort of framework in which the students will be able to apply concepts and see immediate feedback (think LEGO Mindstorms, Scratch, etc.)

I expect this to be a bit of a challenge, but I'm also really excited by the opportunity. Now I said this post was a plea for advice so here it is. If anyone has any ideas about how I might make this course a success, please leave them in the comments below. These could include how I might leverage Vialogues, Pressible, or other EdLab tools to aid in course direction. If you're familiar with the terrain, suggestions on programming teaching frameworks would be greatly appreciated. If you've recently read about a pedagogical technique that you think would apply really well here, please let me know. I'll take any and all advice you have to offer. I see this class as an exciting learning opportunity for all involved. In my case, that includes investigating notions on what it means to teach high tech concepts to kids. Thanks in advance for your help!
