<p><b>Title:</b> 
Is a schools' performance related to technical change? A study on the relationship between innovations and secondary school productivity
(2012)<p>
<b>Author:</b> Carla Haelermans<p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Innovation gets thrown around a lot in educational circles, but how much does it really contribute to learning? <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/science/article/pii/S036013151200084X">Is a schools' performance related to technical change? A study on the relationship between innovations and secondary school productivity</a> explores diverse facets of innovation like curriculum changes, experimentation with different teaching methods, equipment and facilities upgrades, teacher professional development, and school organizational structure changes for evidence of learning impacts in Dutch secondary schools.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/eurybase/national_summary_sheets/047_NL_EN.pdf">Dutch educational system</a> is quite different from US schooling in several ways. Most students attend private schools, which are more like charter schools than US private schools. The Dutch government must fund private and public schools equally and private schools tend to differ from public schools mostly in cultural or pedagogical ideology. Mandated schooling begins at age 5, but many students who have language or cultural factors that might negatively impact learning attend a pre-school from ages 2-5. From ages 5 to 12 students attend a graded primary school based on age, but after age 12 students are separated based on the results of an attainment test written by the National Institute for Educational Measurement. Students are routed to one of four professional tracks for secondary school: pre-university (VWO), general professional (HAVO), pre-vocational (VMBO), or practical (PRO).</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Schools are evaluated each year by the Dutch education inspectorate for evidence of student achievement and productivity. These numbers were compared to a questionnaire about classroom and school innovations to calculate whether such changes had an impact on student work and productivity. Specific innovations like teacher professional development and the introduction of technology into the classroom had significant impacts on student productivity and achievement. These results were only applicable to students in their first years of secondary education and, to a lesser extent, practical education (PRO). Secondary education students in VWO, HAVO, and VMBO programs were not significantly affected by innovation. The authors suggest that the positive implications of innovation on lower secondary students might be related to age or experience in education; everything is new to these students, so they are open to the influence of innovation on learning while more experienced students ignore change.</p>

<p><b>Moving forward:</b>
The study also found that school-level changes, like the introduction of new courses and changes to the branding and ideology of the school, were associated slightly negatively with student performance. This suggests that schools with goals to improve student achievement should focus on innovation at the classroom and teacher level.</p>
