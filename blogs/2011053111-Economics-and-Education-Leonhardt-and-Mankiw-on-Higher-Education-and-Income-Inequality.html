          <p>
            I've been meaning to write this post for a few days now because it fits in perfectly with one of the major themes one can find in my blog posts, namely the tradeoff in higher ed between alleviating income inequality and offering a rich intellectual and social experience.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/economy/25leonhardt.html?_r=1">Leonhardt says</a> we need to build a better meritocracy in higher ed, especially since lower-income students remain underrepresented at elite universities. That means giving more credit to lower-income students who achieve as much as higher-income students on tests such as the SAT, since higher income students have greater access to tutors and thus the SAT more often reflects higher inherent ability in lower-income students than it does in higher-income students.

<a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/05/regression-i-would-like-to-see.html">Mankiw notes</a> in one study that there is actually a positive correlation between college achievement, as measured by GPA, and family income, holding entrance examination scores constant [ACT scores in this case]. Thus, all things equal, family income contributes to college achievement.

My two cents are that the study Mankiw notes is just from one school. Nevertheless, I think the family-income college achievement correlation is deeply flawed. It would help to see where the correlation holds when broken down by discipline. It's also not surprising that this correlation holds; if income level is positively correlated with achievement in secondary schooling, those from higher income backgrounds probably come in with more knowledge than those of lower-income backgrounds. In studying such correlations, the ideal discipline to look at would be one that involves little to no subject-specific skills gained in secondary schooling. 

I think it's also worth pointing out that college GPA is hardly a great measure of college achievement. I don't think the following hypothesis is true, but what if rich kids just took easier classes? On the other hand, it is more likely the case that the upper-income  student who took calculus at Exeter is likely to have the higher GPA and lower inherent ability than a student from Bed-Stuy who didn't take calculus but received a 700 on the math section (which highlights another flaw: the SAT math section does not reflect college-level math). There are too many flawed metrics to cast judgment at this point. I'd rather see the correlation done between major GPA and family income holding AP/IB scores in the relevant discipline constant. AP/IB scores are also flawed, but far less flawed than SAT and ACT scores in this context.
