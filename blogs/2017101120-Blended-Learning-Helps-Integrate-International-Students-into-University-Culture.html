<p>Universities around the world now routinely integrate blended learning into their courses. The approach uses a combination of formal, structured learning management systems, such as Moodle or Blackboard, and informal social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. In a new study, that explored students’ attitudes toward online and in-class formative assessment feedback models, blended learning environments were found to play a significant role in helping students overcome learning barriers, particularly international students who find it hard to participate in face-to-face discussion.</p>
 
<p>Researchers trialled three feedback techniques over one year and two courses: staff-to-student feedback in class, peer-to-peer feedback in class, and peer-to-peer feedback online, via the Café, an e-learning application hosted by Facebook. Every two weeks, students were required to bring work-in-progress to tutorial classes and discuss their work with their peers and tutors. In alternating weeks, students posted work-in-progress to a forum in the Café and critiqued their peers’ submissions.</p>
 
<p>The results, compiled from an online post-semester questionnaire, revealed online student feedback was generally more in-depth and critical than feedback provided in class, and more aligned to assessment criteria. Students also benefited from the opportunity to provide their peers with feedback, rather than simply receiving feedback themselves, and, after critically considering a peer’s submission, students returned to their own work with new ideas for revision, leading to the production of stronger work.</p>
 
<p>In exploring attitudes toward the feedback models, researchers noted that international students responded more favorably than local students to giving and receiving feedback via the Café. They also utilized the online learning environment to a far greater degree, highlighting the importance of providing students, particularly first-year students from multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural backgrounds, with both in-class and online learning environments for integrating into university culture.</p>
