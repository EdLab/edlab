          <p>
            The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/education/schools-try-to-match-the-jobless-with-3-4-million-jobs.html?pagewanted=3&ref=nationalspecial2">New York Times</a> gives a report of how colleges and universities are finally realizing that we're still in a deep recession, and that they would need to change and enhance their programs in order to prepare students for the new job market. This has led to a potentially beneficial trend where colleges and universities are adding programs like “global sustainability” which teaches students about renewable energy and green marketing. This is just an example of how colleges are changing their programs so that they are more focused and market-driven. This demonstrates how college has evolved from an experience to learn and explore different subjects to a 4 year training period for your future job.

Of course, a story about education wouldn't be complete without talking about the political and business influences that are pressuring schools. For example, continuing education programs teach students the necessary skills to make them viable candidates in the job market. It also helps them to keep their skills sharp.  This continuing education deal allows students to get certifications for their new skills without receiving formal academic credits or degrees. It seems that we are trying so desperately to lower the unemployment rate and keep jobs from going overseas; colleges are making it easier now for anyone to get the proper training for a job and are cutting the time it takes to get that training. Is this necessarily a good thing?
