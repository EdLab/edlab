<p>Chromatik is a web and iPad app that provides music learners with the essential learning tools needed to create better music. It’s also an invaluable asset in the connected music classroom. The app includes music teaching tools like sheet music, electronic recorders, metronomes, and tuners. Students are able to record themselves, play back their recordings, share them with peers and instructors, and receive feedback through commenting. Collaborative musicians can upload, annotate, and share their sheet music online. Music teachers are also able to annotate the shared digital sheet music on the app to give their community instantaneous access to feedback. Chromatik has a technology partnership with the reality television show American Idol, which uses the app <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/6622">behind the scenes</a>, and recently gained financial support and endorsement from musician  <href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/11/15/chromatik-nabs-1m-from-bruno-mars-to-help-musicians-harmonize/">Bruno Mars</a>.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app fills a need in the market for a digital tool specifically designed for music learners and collaborative musicians. Music teachers often have large classes and technology like Chromatik can enable communication among these groups with the instant sharing and annotation function. Digital sheet music lets teachers streamline assignments and assessment in ways unimaginable to a paper-based music classroom. The app takes learning outside the classroom by allowing students to record their practice, share it with other users, and receive feedback at any time.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The app may seem stark to a first time user. Navigation is simple but a lack of direction makes it difficult to use the app’s great features. While it is easy to create a new playlist or upload a music sheet, the sharing function is not easy to discover without fully exploring the app. Implementing Chromatik in a music classroom may be too costly for some schools as every student needs access to an iPad. The app will be available on Android tablets in the future which may make it accessible to more schools and sympathetic to BYOD.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Chromatik is a valuable digital tool for music learners and a powerful way for teachers to bring their classrooms into the 21st century. While there are many tools that increase feedback and communication between learner and educator, there are few specifically designed for music learning. Chromatik shows that an app does not need a plethora of fancy functions to be a valuable app for learning. An educational app’s value lies in its ability to solve pressing issues in specific learning fields. Chromatik is a simple app that focuses on solving the problems of a modern music classroom.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Chromatik lets you learn, share, and create beautiful music.</p>
