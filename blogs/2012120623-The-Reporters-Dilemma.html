          <p>
            I'm sure we've all heard the tragic story of the Queens man who was <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/killer_blame_victim_E9Bvuskhmb7kKlOJXxxoZL">pushed to his death</a> earlier this week by a homeless street vendor on a subway platform in Times Square. The event garnered further controversy when the NY Post ran a <a href="http://www.petapixel.com/2012/12/04/photograph-of-doomed-man-on-subway-tracks-sparks-outrage/">picture</a> of the victim on the tracks with the looming train under the headline “DOOMED”. The picture provoked outrage and anger among readers and in the Twittersphere as people questioned why no one stepped in to help the man and instead took photographs. Further anger was directed at the NY Post for publishing the photo along with the aforementioned headline.

The photographer who shot the haunting picture is R. Umar Abbasi, a freelancer who usually shoots for the Post. He has borne the brunt of the criticism but defended has stated that he was too far away from the man to have helped and thinks those closer to him should have done more. I've read before that journalists, like other professionals, are told to focus on reporting the story and not to interfere at any point. It seems Abbasi was invoking his journalistic principle when he took the picture and left the fate of it to his superiors. Many argue that the right and ethical thing to do was to put work and profession aside and do your best to help a dying man. This story seems eerie similar to that of Kevin Carter, a South African photojournalist who won a Pulitzer prize, among other awards, for <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/vulture-stalking-a-child/">this harrowing picture</a> of a frail and starving Sudanese child been stalked by a vulture. Carter would commit suicide months later and many attributed it to the backlash and personal pain he felt about not helping the child (he did claim to scare the vulture away).

Should journalists always keep to the task at hand of reporting the news as it is or should they intervene when there is need to do so? What about the NY Post, were they right in publishing the photo?
