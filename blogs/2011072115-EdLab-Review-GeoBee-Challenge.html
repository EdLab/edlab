            <img width="175" height="175" alt="GeoBee Challenge by National Geographic" class="artwork" src="http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r1000/049/Purple/a0/01/c8/mzl.agpxbcpa.175x175-75.jpg">

Recently I blogged about <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6173">NAEP geography scores</a> and the relationship between rote memorization and drawing connections in geography education. GeoBee Challenge, from the people at National Geographic and the National Geographic Bee is app that offers a suite of geography quizzes combined to form a 15 level challenge.

Pros: The set of questions is constantly changing each day and the question set is large enough that if you play multiple times in the same day, you should not come across to many repeated questions. The app makes good use of touch features on the iPhone to zoom in features to make certain quizzes easily possible. For instance, for many of the quizzes, you have to touch a point on the map when asked to locate a city. The closer you point to the city, the more points you receive (kind of a rip from the Traveler IQ Quiz application on Facebook but far more adeptly executed with the help of zoom in and touch features). The touch features were quite good for the iPhone; I can only imagine this to be even better as an iPad app. They imported most of the game dynamics from <a href="http://openfeint.com/>OpenFeint</a> and Apple's Game Center. Nevertheless, the game dynamics are reasonably good, full of leaderboards, bonuses, leveling up, and achievements. Given that they have imported their game dynamics, I doubt we'll see much in the way of imaginative dynamics.

Cons: I wish each level had more focus so that a user could then build up his geographical knowledge in a certain area much more easily. As it stands, this is a very good educational trivia app, and not a great educational app itself. On the questions where they show a famous site and then ask you to touch the point on the map where the site is located, if you get it wrong, you have no way of knowing the name of the site, only where it is located. For most educational apps, there is usually some way to learn more about a specific topic if you get a question wrong. There is an annoying bug that penalizes you're identifying a pacific island and choose the wrong hemisphere. While maybe this is nitpicking, the reason I complain is in line with the biggest negative about this app...it's not free. It's 1.99 at the App Store.

EdLab Relevance: This app definitely has enlightened me about some of the features that need to be highlighted when addressing the needs of the math project. Both are intended to be applications that make no secret about being educational; these are not in the vein of Sudden Industries, which is focused on building enjoyable apps that just so happen to be educational. However, that should not imply educational apps can't have an enjoyable game layer; this is precisely what GeoBee Challenge achieves and what the math project aims to be. On the other hand, part of what makes a great educational app is the need to point the learner to additional resources when there are gaps in knowledge. Also, the need to maintain focus is key if the user/learner/student is to see real gains in knowledge, as opposed to simply learning a set of arbitrary facts.

Our Takeaway: If you're genuinely interested in geography or have a kid who could use some increased exposure to the subject, this app is probably worth it, especially given that content is constantly updated. Otherwise, there is probably little use in paying the two bucks.
