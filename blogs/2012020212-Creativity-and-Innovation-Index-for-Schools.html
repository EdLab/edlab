            California, Massachusetts and Oklahoma are leading the pack in the implementation of a "creativity and innovation index" for their schools.  The index would be a way to balance US school's emphasis on preparation for high-stakes testing and help to measure the availability of resources deemed to foster creative thinking, both in the classroom and after school.  

As outlined in <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/02/02/19creativity_ep.h31.html?tkn=SMUFdXaNBomkRUnCvlSH8fTPvj3k5JlB24b6&cmp=clp-edweek">this EducationWeek piece,</a> Massachusetts Sen. Stan Rosenberg explains the thinking behind <a href="http://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2010/Chapter240">his chamber's proposed bill</a>, "We're tapping into a very clear need, as expressed particularly by employers, to reincorporate into the curriculum and school experience many opportunities for young people to develop creativity-oriented skills."  

Supporters of a "creativity index" cite benefits ranging from increased creative-thinking to entrepreneurship-related skills, all with the aim of making US students more competitive with their global peers.  Detractors, however, express concerns that the index will be used punitively to punish schools and will simply focus on quantitative rather than qualitative measures of creativity.  

I am sure <a href="http://www.instituteofplay.org/">The Institute of Play's</a> <a href="http://q2l.org/">Quest to Learn schools</a>, who recently presented <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6578">a seminar here at the EdLab</a>, would get top ratings if NYC schools adopt a similar index.  How would other NYC-based public schools compare?  Would charter schools have an unfair advantage?  Do you think that this proposal could help increase American student's ability to be future innovators and entrepreneurs?  How do you really measure creativity?  What are concrete ways teachers can increase this kind of problem-solving and create a more creative lens for students to look at the world?
