Frank Bonsal III is the Director of Entrepreneurship at Towson University. His host of responsibilities in that role includes teaching and leading the school’s entrepreneurship programs. He is also prominent in Baltimore’s burgeoning edtech scene. Prior to Towson, he served as a general partner to New Markets Venture, where he focused funding edtech companies. Bonsal holds an M.Ed and an MBA from Vanderbilt University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role as Director of Entrepreneurship at Towson</b><br>
<p>My role at Towson University (TU) is merely another extension of my roles as education technology investor and, before that, middle and high school teacher and coach. My compass point is intact; I am merely taking another angle on the problem. My primary end user is either a university student or an entrepreneur who has a problem they must solve, often in education; sometimes, these end users are one and the same. With plenty of ‘scar tissue’ from both the boardroom and the classroom, I believe that I can add value to both end users.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work as an angel investor and Director of Entrepreneurship will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>My professional life has been as ‘practice coach’ whereby I help players, students, entrepreneurs ready themselves for the game, the work, the company build. My hope is that I might add value to people and teams who might positively impact education and entrepreneurship ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The most important, sustainable learning trends will focus on the personalized blend of human and algorithmic inflection and must be based in a flexible pathway that tilts to competency over time. Predictive analytics will guide but never wholly replace the subjective, moral input that humans bring to the mix.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Towson, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Other than my most important work as father and spouse, my base at TU tends to avail an authentic platform for all that I do in education innovation. My efforts with a small team at TU to architect and iteratively grow a thriving education innovation cluster in Greater Baltimore is my BHAG. Part of that is a robust, diverse network that might test and validate the efficacy of education products and services. We have miles to go there but are progressing.</p>
