<p>*Mic check* Hold onto your vocal chords, ladies and gents, and get ready for a singing coach app that will get you ready for the stage (even if that stage is just your shower). <a href="https://vanido.io">Vanido</a> will teach you how to stay on pitch, follow along with music, and potentially expand your range, as well.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>As someone with years of vocal training experience, I was impressed with the responsiveness and pedagogical tools used in Vanido. Each day, the app gives you three vocal exercises to master. One great aspect of this is that the app works with a scaffolded learning system, meaning it starts your singing training with the most basic vocal exercises and works up to the more advanced ones. In addition, the exercises are all tailored to your vocal range, which Vanido identifies as soon as you open the app for the first time.</p>
 
<p>The exercises are easy enough to follow along for even the least musically experienced people. Notes glide across your phone screen in multicolored rectangles spaced apart in distinct chord progressions, where the higher rectangles represent higher notes. Individual notes are played along on the piano, and your voice is converted into a line. Like this, you know whether you’re on pitch by ensuring your vocal line matches the placement of the rectangles.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Keep in mind that Vanido is intended largely for beginners and non-professionals. While it’s great for those without much singing experience, anyone with more training under their belt will likely find some features of the app frustrating. This includes the fact that the exercises have difficulty identifying vibrato, so if you sing operatically it will likely think you’re missing the mark. The app could also have more pedagogical reach if it included simple songs for users to practice with rather than limiting itself to chord progressions.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Vanido is a great choice for anyone interested in improving their voice but not ready to commit to in-person singing lessons. That said, even experienced (albeit rusty) singers (like me) would enjoy the tailored vocal exercises delivered to your phone each day. If you commit to using Vanido, I have no doubt that before long you’ll be singing your <i>do, re, mi</i>’s at the top of a mountain, or your <i>Black Velvet</i>’s in the karaoke lounge (whichever comes first).</p>
