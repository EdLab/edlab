            Republican presidential hopeful, Donald Trump has been under the spotlight for several controversial remarks regarding religious and minority groups. Trump previously stirred up controversy by doubting President Obama's natural born birth. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that he has opened another chapter of this birther issue by targeting his rival for the Republican candidacy, Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Cruz was born in Canada to a Cuban father and an American mother before moving to the United States. The Constitution states that an individual has to be a "natural born citizen" in order to qualify to be elected as president. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/01/natural-born-citizenship">This issue</a> has been analyzed by arguably two of the best law professors in the country.
<p>
Fordham law professor Thomas Lee and Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe both share a similar view regarding Cruz's eligibility for the White House. Cruz has indicated that he is a huge supporter of "originalism" and he will not hesitate to appoint an originalist judge to the Supreme Court should he become president. The theory of originalism requires that children born outside the United States, citizenship must be obtained through their fathers only. Perhaps the "originalist" judge that Ted Cruz will nominate might declare him ineligible to be president. The professors were quick to add that this is just one of the political issues that add to the atmosphere during election season but in reality there is no way Cruz can be deemed ineligible to run for president. Trump's assault on Cruz has led to a scholarly debate he didn't even anticipate.
