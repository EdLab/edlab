Paul T. Hill, in <a href="http://www.edexcellencemedia.net/publications/2011/2011_CreatingSoundPolicyforDigitalLearning/20111116_SchoolFinanceintheDigitalLearningEra_Hill.pdf">a working paper</a> for the Fordham institute, takes a crack at diagnosing the issues with our current education system, and offers a few ideas for reform as well.  I thought this might offer a different perspective on issues raised at our Tuesday D&R.
<!--break-->
Description: 
Hill believes that our K-12 system is unable to take advantage of new technological possibilities due to its outdated funding system.  “Our system,” he writes, “doesn't fund schools, and certainly doesn't fund  students. It funds district-wide programs, staff positions, and so forth. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to move money from concrete facilities, established programs, and entrenched staff roles to new uses like equipment, software, and remote instructional staff.” 

His proposed solution is to match funding with individual students' educational outcomes.  Each student would have a certain amount of money to spend on education (based on their originating district's educational budget), which they would then spend on whatever educational resources/products they desired.  

The basic idea is to eliminate all education middlemen and bundlers, entities that are by their nature conservative.  Of course, people themselves are pretty conservative, but I suppose institutional barriers can't help.  Under his funding system, entrepreneurs would require less “buy-in” to get their ideas off the ground.

</b>EdLab Relevance<b>: 
This is obviously a much more radical move than, for instance, the charter school movement, and with correspondingly less likelihood of being enacted (and he doesn't, to my mind, adequately address all of the potential downsides), but the paper allows us to think a little more clearly about obstacles in the way of adopting better educational technology.  

In the K-12 world, there isn't the consumer base for new ideas and new technology the way there is in other industries/fields.  In that case it may make sense to target innovations on this level to more flexible aspects of the system, such as charter schools and homeschooled children.
