NoRedInk is attempting to make grammar learning relevant to students. The site has a separate login interface for students and teachers. Students can practice good grammar by reading sentences, evaluating them for grammatical errors, and correcting mistakes. NoRedInk makes the sentences relevant to student hobbies and interests by initially asking users to choose interests from a list and input Facebook friend data. The site hopes to engage students through personally relevant content and a cast made of the user’s online friends. Teachers are able to create classes, quizzes, and assignments and engage students in these activities via an invite code. Teachers can also chart student progress and assess understanding of each grammar concept. 
 </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Relevant and engaging content is not NoRedInk’s only trick; the system is also instructional and adaptive. Struggling students get a second chance to answer with a deeper explanation of the concept. Problematic concepts are reiterated until mastery is achieved. Teachers are able to view a basic analysis of their students’ progress and performance. Teachers could use this data to create lessons around difficult concepts and assess general understanding.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The hints given by NoRedInk are sometimes a bit confusing to understand. The site may want to include links to a glossary to define unfamiliar acronyms. NoRedInk uses TV and movie characters and famous figures in sports and music as subjects for sentences. These computer-generated phrases occasionally and jarringly describe something that might be out of character for the subject. Students may have little patience for this rough edge. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>NoRedInk is tapping into a burgeoning trend in online education. Personalization for greater engagement in learning is also being used by sites like <a href ="http://www.yummymath.com/"> Yummy Math</a>, a math resource website for educators and language learning site, <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/87">Voxy</a>. These personalized systems hinge on bringing existing personal digital content from social sharing sites to new applications. NoRedInk could offer more sophisticated personalization in the form of an ongoing narrative learning experience for users or more careful use of user-selected interests, but they have an innovative start in a traditionally unimaginative subject. 
</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>NoRedInk makes learning grammar personal.</p>
