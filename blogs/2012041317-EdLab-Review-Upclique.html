            <a href="http://www.upclique.com/index.php" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/Screenshot2012-04-13at52845PM.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

<a href="http://www.upclique.com/index.php">Upclique</a> is one of several new startups aimed at presentation and networking in the student set. Upclique is an <a href="http://www.internsushi.com/">Intern Sushi</a> for the college discovery and application process. Students are able to make a visual portfolio and enter profile information to get personalized school suggestions. The site can also nudge students towards contacts at their school of choice or the services of a school counselor. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The site makes a legitimate stab at education around networking and the admissions process. It's very streamlined and clean, but their education section might be augmented by mini video lectures and alternative resources. Ditto for their financial aid education. It's a clean, informative presentation but might benefit from additional resources for students who want to know more. The side-by-side comparison tool is nice for an audience used to shopping online and the site demonstrates some nice collapsibility in the college views. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The site has a strange UI that may not resonate with the young folk. There are a lot of popups that recall an older Windows experience:

<a href="http://s1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/?action=view&amp;current=Screenshot2012-04-13at45731PM.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/Screenshot2012-04-13at45731PM.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

The site is also new and while there are contact buttons for every school, very few of them have registered users behind them. It might be beneficial for Upclique to blast email any publicly available admissions address for the school to inform them when students attempt and fail to contact them. This would make the experience seem more meaningful from the student side and potentially gain users on the university side. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The connection feature on the site is very like Ednode. It allows users to connect with school representatives and open up their profiles to admissions representatives. If it can attract interested students, it may be a powerful new marketing tool for university outreach. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Upclique is a solid offering in an emerging sector.
