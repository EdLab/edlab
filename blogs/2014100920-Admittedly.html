<p><a href=" https://admitted.ly/our_story">Admitted.ly</a> is a platform that allows students to browse college rankings personalized to their interests, preferences, academic goals, and career pursuits. The site additionally breaks down the top ranked schools into reach, target, and safety schools based on the studentâ€™s resume and standardized test scores.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The site is free, which is a huge plus for high school students. In addition to developing personalized rankings, the site also has a feature called <i>Major Match</i> that helps high school students find a major that fits their personality. The site is bright and easy to navigate with a great Q&A forum where students can ask questions and see the questions other students have asked. The enrollment process for the site is lengthy: students have to answer many quiz questions to determine the best fit for them, but the style of the questions is fun and casual.</p>
<p>Addmitted.ly plans to unveil a college visit planner to help high school students get the most out of their college visits. They also plan to add an application manager and an essay advisor in 2014, with additional modules focused on financial aid & scholarships, test prep, and improving each student's chances of getting into the school of their choice.  The site also features resources for college counselors so they can track student progress.</p>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site is still developing with lots of features yet to come. Though it is a great resource for Q&A and a helpful resource for developing a list of schools to consider, it is not yet a one-stop-shop for college planning. </p>
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Admitted.ly is a great place for students to turn to when they begin to think about college. For basic questions it is very helpful. It is also helpful for students who have no idea where to start when considering majors. Indecisiveness in the undergraduate years comes with a major price tag for students who have taken out loans. Eighty percent of college-bound students <a href=" http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10154383/ns/business-personal_finance/t/college-freshmen-face-major-dilemma/#.VCXOQSldXQk">have yet to pick a major</a> and the transfers and duplicate credits that may be involved in major switching can add years and tuition dollars to a student's college experience. Admitted.ly helps demystify the process and supports students in making more informed decisions that might be likelier to stick over the course of four years.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>  

<p>Kick off your college hunt with Admitted.ly to get things started on the right foot. </p>
