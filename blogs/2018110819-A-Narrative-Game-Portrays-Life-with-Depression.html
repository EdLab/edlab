<p><a href="http://pleaseknockgame.com">Please Knock on My Door</a> is an interactive narrative game focused on the life of one individual and his struggle against depression. The game design and play are simple, but the issues confronted are not. The goal of the game is to keep the main character functional and improve his mental state as much as possible while confined to the limits of his apartment and office. In doing this, players gain a better perspective on the lived experience of depression. It is available for purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/613450/Please_Knock_on_My_Door/">Steam for $14.99</a>.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Please Knock on My Door offers a dynamic narrative experience with three possible gameplay options. Players can choose the story mode, which does not keep track of points and leaves all choices available; the game mode, which keeps track of points and limits choices accordingly; and the experience mode, which keeps track of points and limits choices, but without showing you the score.</p>

<p>The point system refers to your character’s "mental fortitude," and it increases or decreases based on the actions you complete. For instance, taking a shower generally increases mental fortitude, while staying up too late decreases it. Some actions are only available once your mental fortitude reaches a certain level. While the maximum mental fortitude score I achieved was 60, I couldn’t call my father until I reached a score of 80. I could wash the dishes though, which only required 20 points. My lowest low had me in the teens. This depicts how even simple actions can prove incredibly energy-consuming or difficult for people afflicted with depression.</p>

<p>As your character travels between work and home, his backstory becomes more concrete. Narrated ruminations pop up at various times and play out memories, regrets, or insecurities. In all such moments, you have the choice to either lean into those reflections or repress them. About halfway through the game, the narrator’s voice shifts from a downtrodden tone accompanied by white words to a malicious one accompanied by red words. The latter generates terrible thoughts that become increasingly unavoidable. Soon, your choices become much more limited; you no longer have the option to wash the dishes, and you often lose your appetite halfway through a sandwich and leave the remainder to attract flies. This sudden lack of decision-making power mirrors a common symptom of depression and made me feel how consuming a severely depressive episode is.</p>

<p>Overall, the game’s simple play and design lent itself to an intimate and emotional story where gameplay limitations effectively conveyed common symptoms of living with depression. Without giving away spoilers, there are three different endings to the game: a best case scenario, a mixed situation, and an almost tragic one. My gameplay led to the latter, which I understand is hard to avoid. I felt like I had failed, but of course, that is also reflective of struggling with depression.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There aren’t many criticisms I have for Please Knock on My Door, but I did find one element of the gameplay frustrating, although I admit that the game was intended to be this way.</p>

<p>I tried to ruminate, shower, and feed myself, but I ended up feeling helpless as I spiraled downwards. I wish I could have accessed help even from rock bottom, and that, as the player, I could have learned about what to do in that situation, rather than having to resort to self-medication and oversleeping just to function. Again, this is likely intended to mirror the experience of living with depression, but I was a bit concerned that the game wasn’t educational enough regarding how to reach out for help if players encounter this situation in real life.</p>

<p>In addition, the music, in trying to set a depressive tone, was intense. It was fine for me, having not suffered from clinical depression, but for others living with depression who want to play this game, the music might be too mood-inducing. Having an option to turn the music off would make it easier for people who have depression to play this game without triggering a depressive episode.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Please Knock on My Door offers a brutally honest and intimate portrait of what it’s like to live with depression. As the public becomes increasingly aware of the seriousness of mental health issues, it’s important to educate people on triggers, symptoms, and lived experiences of depression. I can see this game being used in college health settings as a tool for awareness or by families and friends of people suffering from depression as a tool for understanding their loved one’s situation. It’s difficult to fully comprehend an illness as personal as depression, but Please Knock on my Door doesn’t just tell us what that’s like; it makes us feel it, and by the end of the few hours of gameplay, we understand a little bit more.</p>
