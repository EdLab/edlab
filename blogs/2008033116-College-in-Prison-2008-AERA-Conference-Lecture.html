            Figuring Identity and Agency in the Lives of Student Inmates was one of the several lectures that I had the opportunity to attend during the 2008 AERA Conference. 

This lecture focused on the past, present and possibilities of a student inmate's future. Some of the student inmate stories gave me the chills.  It was a very small audience but very engaging.  Amongst the attendees were people who worked or were interested in Prison Education system.  There were also curious attendees like me who left more enlightened about sub-world of prisons and its systems.  

It is inspiring to hear stories of teacher and how they found positive ways to the fill a gap in the student inmate's lives with education. 
They also referred that in some places for some people “Schools some times are like prisons” “Extreme teaching” was constantly mention, extreme does not equal danger, equals  lack of resources.

Schooling inequities definitely impacts the perception and importance of education. Most of the inmates did not feel that going to school will impact them economically. This issue lead the Q&A and many questions were asked some went beyond school in prison but they were worth to hear. 

The highly recommend to check into www.360degrees.org , an organization that challenge the perceptions about who is in prison and why. You can find Video stories about inmates and the people that are involved in the inmate live while in prison. Also they came up with PICTURE PROJECT  an online spaces for voices traditionally overlooked by mainstream media Though the approach is technologically savvy, Picture its an innovative web-based tools for social and political reform.
