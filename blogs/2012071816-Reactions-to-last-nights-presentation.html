Hi Everyone,

As you may have already seen <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8000">here</a> on the blog, Kate, Janice and I attended an EdTech meetup at The Hatchery last night. We enjoyed networking with entrepreneurs and the founders of a range of startups and we found aspects of the panel interesting. But, we also agreed that the panel discussion was far from perfect. We thought it would be beneficial to share on the blog (privately) our reactions to the talk. I think it's great to learn from the mistakes of others and to constantly be thinking about how we can make our own presentations amazing!  

Below are a list of problems we identified from last night and what we think would be good solutions to the problems.

 
<b>Problem:</b> Sound quality of mics for both panelists and audience.
<b>Solution:</b>  Double-check mics and sound night before. 

<b>Problem:</b>  Moderation was unclear and it was difficult to tell who was speaking. 
<b>Solution:</b>  Have visuals on screen to designate who is speaking along with their title and relevant Twitter handle. 

<b>Problem:</b>  Audience was not given enough time to ask questions and be involved with the discussion until the very end. 
<b>Solution:</b>  Have a Twitterfeed on the screen with audience thoughts scrolling, use vialogues to share a dialogue around the event & use this to structure questions at the end. 

<b>Problem:</b>  Came-across as too much of a pitch for CCNMTL with answers like: "At CCNMTL we..." "CCNMTL's new project..." 
<b>Solution:</b>  Be sure the EdLab and our tool's take a back-seat during the panel & limit "promos" to the beginning & the end. 

<b>Problem: </b> Space was too narrow and long with a screen that was way too small for the space. 
<b>Solution:</b> An open more "square"-shaped space with a large screen(s) is crucial to audience satisfaction.  

<b>Problem:</b>  There were no visuals used to compliment the panelists.
<b>Solution:</b>  Give each panelist the opportunity to visually share tools they plan to discuss during the discussion.


I also wanted to share a <a href="http://www.davidleeking.com/2012/07/10/reminders-for-frequent-speakers/">blog post</a> by David Lee King that may be useful to look at before presenting or participating in a panel discussion.
