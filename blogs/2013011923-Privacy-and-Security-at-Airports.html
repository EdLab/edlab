          <p>
            Airports around the world have for many years now reinforced their security system in order to prevent terrosist attacks by planes. The U.S has one of the, if not the best airport security system around the globe and this has only increased since 9-11. Ultra technological scanners and metal detectors have been in place to avoid tragedies such as highjacking of planes but with these strict security measures come the matter of privacy.

This <a href=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-18/naked-image-scanners-to-be-removed-from-u-s-airports.html>article</a>, notes the U.S Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will be removing body scanners from their security lineup as some passengers have claimed it invades their privacy. Failing to keep certain images off the scanners' screen, Rapiscan, the company in charge of the body scanner have already removed 76 machines from airports and will be removing the 174 remaining. The contract between the U.S Transportation Security and Rapiscan will come to an end with after it received several lawsuits, and will be turning to its other supplier L-3 Communication Holding Inc, for new scanners, which will blind passengers' privacy.

Though passengers' privacy may have been invaded, Rapiscan's scanners have been able to avoid tragedies at busy airports around the United States. Is it worth banning them from airport because of privacy violation when it save lives?

I would like to hear my fellow EdLabbers' opinion of this issue, what do you think?
