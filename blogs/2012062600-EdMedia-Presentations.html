            Greetings from smokey Denver! 

Zhou and I have been preparing for our talk tomorrow as well as gathering a list of the talks that we are interested in attending. I've copied some of them below. Feel free to look through the <a href="https://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/sessions/index.cfm?fuseaction=PresentationSearch&confID=3050&confID=3050&CFID=12488192&CFTOKEN=bc5117a6663a0748-867E1959-CBDC-3332-954730A249588E49">presentation list</a> and suggest any others you might like us to report about.

Using Data Visualization Tools to Support Online Discussion Facilitation
ID: 36212
Type: Best Practices Session   Topic: Improving Classroom Teaching
Room: 3
Tue, Jun. 26 2:45 PM-3:05 PM

Authors:
Bridget Arend, University of Denver, United States
Abstract:
Online asynchronous discussions can serve as an effective medium for reflection and critical thinking in online, hybrid and on-campus courses. However, text-heavy discussions can become cumbersome and facilitating online discussions can be a time consuming and arduous task for even the most conscientious instructor. Data visualization tools are available to support the instructor's facilitative role and allow quick and easy snapshots of student participation as well as discussion themes and paths. This paper will describe lessons learned from the use of open source data visualization tools over eight iterations of a professional development course for online faculty.

Game-Based Learning Instructional Design from Teachers' Perspective
ID: 36217
Type: Full Paper: Conceptual & Empirical Study   Topic: Teaching/Learning Strategies
Room: 4
Tue, Jun. 26 10:00 AM-10:30 AM

Authors:
Jie Huang, Boise State University, United States
DongUk Cheong, Korea National Univ. of Education, Korea (South)
Abstract:
The research focus on instructional design of using digital games and game characteristics in classroom by investigating how Game-Based Learning instructional design (GBLID) might differ from traditional instructional design (TID) based on ADDIE model from teachers' perspectives. Considering of pervious researches, and results of survey and interview of 36 elementary and secondary school teachers, we re-organized GBLID principles and insert into ADDIE instructional design model, form a framework of GBLID by considering teachers' views of the differences between GBLID and TID, and how these differences might be informed and integrated into the existing framework of instructional design.

Coordinating Professional Practice with Course Pedagogy in the Design of a Serious Games course
ID: 36273
Type: Brief Paper: New Development   Topic: Improving Classroom Teaching
Room: 3
Wed, Jun. 27 11:35 AM-11:55 AM

Authors:
Dennis Charsky, Ithaca College, United States
William Ryan, Ithaca College, United States
Abstract:
The design of serious games is having a enormous impact on the employee training (Aldrich, 2005) as well as on the education of future instructional designers (Charsky, 2010b). The presentation will detail the results of a study that explores the practices of professional instructional designs that have created a serious game for employee training. The data from the interviews will be analyzed to determine the methods and processes for communicating content, ways to measure effectiveness of both instruction and game play, utilizing representations, and employing game features. The results of these interviews will inform the design of a undergraduate level serous game course. Assessment of the course project, where students have to design a serious game, and surveys of students on their learning and design process will be presented. The study has the potential to influence the theory and practice of serious games and the pedagogy for college level serious games courses as well as the professional development of instructional designers.

PD for ML in HE: Embedding mobile learning in a university context

ID: 36960
Type: Brief Paper: Other Â  Topic: Instructor Training and Support
Room: 11
Authors: Anthony Herrington, Curtin University, Australia Judy Schrape, Curtin University, Australia Kim Flintoff, Curtin University, Australia Jacqui Kelly, Curtin University, Australia Kuki Singh, Curtin University, Australia Diana Taylor, Curtin University, Australia
Abstract: Mobile devices are becoming ubiquitous in university settings. While online learning using desktop and laptop device has seen significant growth over the last decade, the next decade will see an increased use of online learning via mobile devices such as tablets and phones. However, the spread of mobile learning in universities is patchy, and thought needs to be given to approaches that will foster widespread uptake. In this paper, we highlight the potential for mobile learning (ML) in higher education (HE) and the ways in which professional development (PD) can be enacted to develop guidelines for mobile learning and embed practices across an institution.

ALICE: Adaptive Learning via Intuitive/Interactive, Collaborative and Emotional Systems
ID: 37104
Type: Corporate Showcase Â  Topic: Multimedia/Hypermedia Systems
Room: 2
Authors: Santi Caballe, Open University of Catalonia, Spain Nicola Capuano, University of Salerno, Italy
Abstract: ALICE is a project co-funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Program. It aims to build an innovative and adaptive environment for e-learning by combining research in the innovative areas of Collaborative Learning, Simulation and Serious Games, Storytelling, Affective and Emotional Approaches, New Forms of Assessment, and Adaptive e-Learning. Such a learning environment is interactive, challenging and context aware, and provides users with empowerment, social identity and authentic learning experience. ALICE strongly contributes to the overcoming of the current e-learning systems and contents' limitations. ALICE developed software components are integrated in IWT (Intelligent Web Teacher). IWT is a complete e-learning and knowledge management platform that delivers personalized courses based on learner's previous knowledge and preferences, allowing learners to learn only required concepts through the most feasible learning resources.

Exploring the Application of Gaming and Gaming Principles in Education
ID: 36183
Type: Panel Â  Topic: Implementation Experiences
Room: 2
Authors: Lisa Heaton, Marshall University, United States Jake Bolen, Marshall University, United States Amy Carlson, Marshall University, United States Kay Lawson, Marshall University, United States Debra Lockwood, Marshall University, United States Rikki Lowe, Marshall University, United States Melissa Rhodes, Marshall University, United States Sherri Shafer, Marshall University, United States
Abstract: What do you think about gaming and what does it have to do with education? The potential ill effects of gaming and video game content are widely discussed. However, a few authors like Gee (2007) in What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy and Johnson (2006) in Everything Bad Is Good for You consider the other side of the story. Johnson suggests that we look beyond the surface (content) of video games to the underlying “cognitive workout.” Gee discusses this workout in terms of 36 learning principles that he asserts are present in some of the most popular video games. After participating in a pre-reading blog regarding their opinions of gaming, discussing the work of Johnson in class, and reading Gee's book, doctoral students in a Technology and Curriculum course were asked to experience gaming by interviewing an avid gamer or playing a cognitively challenging game. Panelists will discuss their resulting research findings and implications for teaching and learning.
