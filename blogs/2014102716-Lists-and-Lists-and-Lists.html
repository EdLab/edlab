          <p>
            I am a fan of lists and advice. Aren't we all.  We all must have our reasons, but for me, it's often a reminder of what I'm after. Sometimes I vociferously disagree with the lists, sometimes I wholeheartedly agree and think “I thought of all of those things before, why didn't I write it down in a list and publish it?”

If the list is something we've been thinking about, it's a good way to get a refresher and renew one's project of saying writing or staying in shape.  If its something we've just started or are hoping to start, the <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2010/06/17/10-ways-to-find-inspiration-to-develop-content-for-your-blog/
" target = "blank">list</a> offers a good beginning point.

Sometimes I wonder, what comes after the list? In a recent post on what makes a creative person, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/04/creativity-habits_n_4859769.html
" target = "blank">article</a> professed there are 18 things that all creative people do (the lists of what make a creative person are one of many):


The list got me thinking. I do many/ most of those things. Am I creative? To put it another way, just because I do those things, does that mean I am creative?  To get to the heart of my question, what happens after the list? 

I realized I have to remember that the list cannot promise to be more than it is: a list. (Though in marketing they often want you to think it is more).  In fact, a list merely some things the author were salient points on the topic, but must always be viewed as jumping off point for further discussion (with others or with oneself).

I was reminded of this in a recent discussion about top changes in 2013 in Education Technology. The list was interesting, not everything, and in the end proved a provocative instigator for discussion.
