<p>Dad, are we there yet? Family trips across the U.S. may have become a little smoother with <p><a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geography-drive-arcade/id760972519?mt=8">Geography Drive Arcade</a>, a mapping app that includes a variety of games to help players learn different aspects of the geography of every U.S. state. Geography Drive Arcade offers an accurate, bird's-eye view of all of the states as well as their flags to jazz up the look.</p>
 
<p>The app divides play into four games that deal with different geographical concepts pertaining to each state. The themes include geographical shapes, political flags, state capitals, and spelling. Each game has been realized with a varying degree of success. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Geography Drive Arcade is stylistically a great app. Colors are consistently vibrant and the country-inspired music makes you feel like you’re at your local state fair. Icons are positioned in a user-friendly manner and are sufficiently big for easy manipulation, and users can easily swipe between games to find their favorites. Trophies reward successful game play, while sound effects are appropriate; success is met with a chiming sound, failure with a gentle negative tone.
 
<p>Geography Drive Arcade could gently nudge students who may not naturally be interested in geography; however, they need to <i>love</i> being challenged by difficult games and should not be afraid of failure. The app could also prove to be a helpful relief for parents with highly energetic kids during long car rides when they cannot stop fidgeting in the back seat. Instead of playing yet another generic first person shooter, this app allows users to learn about their surroundings and become more interested in their country. Also, due to its vibrant display and folksy music, Geography Drive Arcade appeals to visual and aural learners to broaden the educational appeal of the content.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although it has the potential to be a fun app for avid game players, Geography Drive Arcade may have limited demographic appeal due to the simplistic look of its gaming interface. Older students may find it too childlike and shy away. This is a shame because of the factual content, although a wider breadth of information would be nice. Also, being limited to only four games could discourage use. This app feels too limited in the breadth and depth of information it provides. Adding content from other educational disciplines would scale up its potential usefulness for players of any age, including adults.</p>
 
<p>In terms of specific games, The Ace of States Award and King O’ the Capitals are equally unappealing. The first invites users to identify states by their shape. The second asks for names of state capitals. These objectives have limited use. For example, is there any utility in knowing the shape of a state, especially the minute details between square ones that are virtually identical? Also, both games provide users 50 possible options for answers, so users have to scroll through the interface endlessly to find possible responses, increasing cognitive load. Further, users cannot save their progress. You either finish and succeed with all 50 responses or you start from scratch the next time you play.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Geography Drive Arcade provides an inconsistent gaming experience that may prevent the desired educational outcome of helping kids learn more about U.S. states. Scaffolding learning by focusing on regions first may help users by limiting options to a more digestible amount. For those with low thresholds of failure, this app could be easily discarded after little play. To make the game more of a success, more information would ideally be included, such as state history, weather patterns, and sociocultural information. Given these issues, if you know children who are interested in geography, love difficult challenges, and are not afraid of failure, Geography Drive Arcade could be a useful complement to more traditional methods. And family trips could be much smoother, with more peace and quiet for parents. </p>
