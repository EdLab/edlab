            I'm an older sister. That means that I “experience life” (whatever that means) before my younger brother, and live to tell about it. 

As an older sister, part of my duty entails: nagging, worrying, giving girlfriends the third degree, embarrassing said younger brother (both intentionally and unintentionally), listening to his woes when said girlfriend (who I never approved of to begin with) dumps him for her ex-boyfriend, and giving him advice (whether or not it is useful is another story). 

My brother will be departing for the University of Buffalo this fall. Though he's all rosy-cheeked and deliriously excited at the prospect of underaged drinking and late nights without parents, he can't fool me. I've been there, done that. Hence! Here is my sisterly advice on the non-academic aspects of college … 

<b>1: Easy Mac, Ramen, and Fast Food are their own food group</b>

Behold! Though you may deplore and sneer at these microwaveable and greasy/oily/disgustingly high fat content food, I kid you not, when you find yourself about to internally combust with hunger one night and remember that the dining halls close freakishly early — you will regard these boxed foods as your saviors. So don't turn up your nose, you'll find that these are vital food staples, and you will mostlikelyprobably eat these late at night, which leads me to my next point … 

<b>2: Freshman 15 (or 50) Really Does Exist</b>

I've overheard some witless freshmen in the dining hall swear (during the first month) that they will never let themselves go. That was before they discovered the joys of finals week, late night delivery, and what “beer belly” really means. Urban legend had it that it was usually girls that gained 15 while boys lost, but I think I can safely attest that these days, <i>everyone</i> gets a little pudgy around the waistline before going home for Thanksgiving break. Not to fret, it happens. 

<b>3: Liquor before Beer, All in the Clear. Beer before Liquor…</b>

Never been sicker. 

Need I explicate or reiterate? No. Just do as it says. 

<b>4: Don't Take Candy from Strangers</b>

Yeah, we've all heard it ever since we were kids, but taking candy isn't necessarily what I'm warning about. It's your drink. Don't. Take. Open Drinks. From. Strangers. Unless you watch them open it right in front of you. And if you happen to put your drink down, don't drink from that container again — just get a new one. 

<b>5: Always On Your Side</b>

We all hear stories about the kid who passed out from drinking and choked to death on his own vomit in his sleep. Assumptions, preaching, and lecturing aside — if you've had too much to drink and feel sick, but simply must sleep — sleep on your side. Lying on your back or face could be fatal — if you were to vomit, you'd choke. (Did I mention you'd die?) And if you see someone else passed out in drunken stupor, take a few moments to turn them on their side as well. 

<b>6: It's OK to negotiate with your roommate</b>

It's difficult, and often it's a prickly situation you'd rather not get into, but if your roommate's behavior and actions are making you (for whatever reason) feel uncomfortable, it's okay to ask them to cut it out. If you have to go to work by 8 AM and have three classes in a row right after you get off, but your roommate goes to bed at 3 in the morning, keeps his light on and types like a moose in toe shoes, it's perfectly sane if you ask them to please try to turn in a little earlier. And no one will hold it against you if you ask for a room transfer if things go very badly. Or if you wake up in the middle of the night to find your roommate licking your toes or something creepy like that. 

<b>7: Separate Whites from Colored</b>

This just may be the soundest piece of advice I've ever heard. Believe it or not, some kids have never done a load of laundry before coming to college. Many just wing it, others just blindly imitate what their fellow classmates are doing and hope for the best. I've gotten into arguments about the virtues of cold and hot washes, if softeners actually make a difference, if the temperatures of the dryer can damage clothing, and if jeans should be turned inside out before being washed (they should if you want to preserve color). But here's one thing people have agreed on — unless you want pink socks and stained shirts, separate your whites from coloreds when doing laundry. 

And depending on how ghetto your school is, you might want to keep an eye on your Diesel jeans — sometimes people go clothing shopping in the laundry rooms, if you know what I mean.
