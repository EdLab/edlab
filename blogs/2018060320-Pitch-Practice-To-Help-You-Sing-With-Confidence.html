<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tone-perfect-pitch-training/id1139019670?mt=8">Tone</a> is a perfect pitch training app. Through practice and quizzes at a variety of difficulty levels, Tone helps musicians become better at identifying pitches and, hopefully, attain perfect pitch.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app’s simplicity is one of its greatest strengths. Upon opening the app, you can adjust difficulty level, display, and sound features, but otherwise you are launched directly into a pitch recognition activity. You can set the recognition activity to practice mode, where you are not timed, or set a time limit for each answer, but the objective either way is consistent and clear. The straightforward challenge the app presents makes it addictive.</p>

<p>After using this app for a week, I can see improvement in my pitch recognition and identification skills. I took two ear training classes in college, but I am still extremely reliant on a reference pitch when it comes to correctly identifying pitches chromatically. The longer I use this app, the more confident I am with my ability to sing a middle C on cue, even after having listened to a variety of music beforehand.</p>

<p>Another fantastic thing about Tone is that it’s entirely free. There are no advertisements and no in-app purchases, an especially rare find in the world of music apps.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>I think it’s important to stress that gaining true perfect pitch from this app is largely aspirational. While studies over <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2015/05/28/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults">the last few years</a> have challenged previously held beliefs that perfect pitch cannot be learned, I find it unlikely that everyone who uses Tone is going to come out of it being able to pull a G-sharp out of thin air within a few weeks. What Tone definitely does do is teach relative pitch. While relative pitch is arguably more important for musicians, clarifying what exactly Tone teaches could help curb disappointment and frustration.</p>
 
<p>While there are many different ways to customize Tone, there are a few additional setting controls that I would have found useful. For example, while you can conduct the listening activity across two octaves, the visual representation only covers a single set of 12 piano keys, making the activity less intuitive. Additionally, while the reference pitch option is nice, I found it annoying that I couldn’t customize its frequency; it was either before every given pitch or nonexistent.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Tone packages the process of learning something inherently difficult simply and effectively. For any musicians working to improve their relative pitch or aspiring for that ever-elusive perfect pitch, this is definitely an app to try.</p>
