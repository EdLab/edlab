            So AERA finally came, and for me it was a bitter-sweet experience. Having had my proposal accepted for presentation, I somehow came to the (mis)understanding that I was to make a POSTER presentation. So I took things in stride - waiting to print my posters at least a day or two before the opening day of the conference (I guess the CIES conference also took some of my attention). It was just 3 days to the start of the conference that I checked and realized my presentation was actually a PAPER session, and I was to have uploaded my finished paper way back by March 1! Worst of all, my presentation was scheduled for the very first day of the conference! Did I panic? No, but I must confess that sleep eluded me on the night my "discovery."

Having gotten the bitter part out of the way (I was able upload my paper on Thursday night), I then decided to make the best out of whatever AERA had to offer. After registering for the conference on Monday morning ($ 115 - whew!), I spent the rest of the morning trying to visit a few sessions as my presentation was at 2.15pm. I actually ended up staying at only one session that had four participants who made presentations on the theme: Technology, Math and Science Teaching.

Well, 2.15pm finally came and I was the last of four presenters on the theme - Access and Participation in Web-Based Learning Environments. The first two presenters discussed issues on Web 2.0 in University life in the UK, and contextualizing web content for learners with special needs respectively. The last presenter before me spoke on website accessibility, and pointed out that of the over 50 higher education institutions' websites that she reviewed, only one met all the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">W3C web content accessibility guidelines</a> (I was hoping that this would be the TC or EdLab site, but I doubt it). She did not mention the particular institution anyway. The presentation however made me recollect that sometime last year, we discussed the issue of website accessibility during one of our EdLab seminars, especially pertaining to the PK site. I'm not sure if we have made any progress in this direction, but it is an issue worth revisiting. 

And my own presentation â€¦ that is coming up
