Frank Mulgrew, President of the Online Education Institute (OEI) at Post University, <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2845">paid EdLab a visit earlier this year </a>to talk about how he’s building a program that, he believes, will have a heavy impact on the way in which we teach and learn in the near future. </p><p>

During the presentation, Frank walked through a history of Post University, including its tumultuous middle years, and brought us up to speed on its current state. When describing his time at Post, Frank said it has been "the best experience of my life; it’s also been the most challenging (<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2845#time=497&comment_id=29273">@8:17</a>)." He was brought on board to spearhead the OEI initiative during a point in the university’s history that demanded a deeper integration of technology in the lives of students and educators.
</p><p>
Immediately upon joining Post University, Frank made it his duty to increase the number of online courses available to students and strengthen the online learning program; he saw the success of the university as contingent upon the growth of the Online Education Institute.  At the beginning of his tenure in 2006, 179 students were registered in an online program at Post. Presently, the OEI boasts a total of 10,000 registered students. 
</p><p>
Frank Mulgrew’s EdLab seminar sparked many interesting questions regarding online education: What current innovations exist in this space? What are the next steps in enhancing online learning? Who will be the first to raise the bar?  As long as online educators continually strive to answer these questions,  then the online educational movement will continue to push forward, improving upon prior practice that ultimately will benefit its learners.  </p><p>
