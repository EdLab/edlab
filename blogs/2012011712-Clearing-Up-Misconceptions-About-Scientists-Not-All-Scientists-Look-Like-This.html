Ask any young student to draw a picture of how a scientist would look like, and most of them would draw someone with glasses, a lab coat, and hunched over a set of beakers and graduated cylinders. If you ask them to describe a scientist most will say they are nerdy and geeky, and will mean it in a negative way. There might be some who see them as the cool people depicted on shows like CSI, or superheroes like Batman (yes he's a scientist too!). It seems that a lot of students have a big misconception when it comes to how they view a scientist, whether as geeky person in a lab coat, or the heroic kind they see on certain shows. This can dissuade younger students from having an interest in science, and eventually becoming a scientist. As educators to younger students, it is imperative to clear these misconceptions and give them a clear view on what a scientist really look like and how their work is very cool.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> Clearing these misconceptions will definitely help more students become interested in science and potentially other STEM fields as well. A great way to do this is to show students what real scientists look like and the projects that they work on. Students become more interested and engaged when school subjects are connected to real world situations. Once students see that scientists look like normal everyday people, they can better relate with them and dream of becoming scientists performing cool experiments. Let's keep dreaming, everyone.
