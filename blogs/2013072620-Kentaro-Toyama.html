<a href="http://www.kentarotoyama.org/profile/default.htm">Kentaro Toyama</a> is a visionary with a background in physics, computer science, educational technology, and transformative values and ethics.  Toyama is a visiting researcher in the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley and a fellow of the <a href="http://thecenter.mit.edu/">Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT</a>.  Toyama is also working on a book advocating that human and institutional wisdom be the main focus of international development.  Beyond these experiences, Toyama co-founded Microsoft Research India in 2005 and was the assistant managing director until 2009. Also, while at MSR India, he started the Technology for Emerging Markets research group, with a special focus on interdisciplinary research devoted to understanding how the world's poorest communities both benefit from and interact with technology. Prior to this work with MSR in India, Toyama was active in the field of computer vision and multimedia research and taught mathematics at Ashesi University in Accra, Ghana. Kentaro holds a PhD from Yale in Computer Science and a bachelors degree in Physics from Harvard.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’m lucky to have been born to parents who appreciated education in a broad way, and to have been raised in countries with exceptional educational opportunities (Japan and the United States). Everything that I am was strongly influenced by that upbringing.
<p>
My parents were generally relaxed about academic achievement, but the "tiger mother" in them came out with respect to learning the piano. They started me on lessons when I was five. I hated to practice, but my mother forced me to continue through high school, often sitting next to me while I practiced. I have an early recollection of my father telling me, "You may never become a professional pianist, but the effort will teach you a lot of other things." At the time, it sounded to me like so much adult mumbo-jumbo, but looking back, I realize he was right. Through piano, I learned a range of things: how to memorize pages of information; how to practice complex skills; what goes into artistic creation; how to handle the anxiety of performance; how to interleave intellect and emotion for aesthetic goals; etc. Most importantly, I learned that I could learn just about anything with sufficient practice – perhaps the most valuable lesson of any good education. Music, of course, is hardly the only way to learn these things. Others learn similar things through dance, visual arts, sports, academics, and various pursuits that involve long-term engagement and practice.
<p>
That upbringing has influenced my professional work in the following way: I’m critical of simplistic approaches to education, especially those that suggest that some new technology is going to transform the way we learn. Technology projects tend to focus narrowly on the specific knowledge to be gained, or at the other extreme, as an open virtual playground where students – entirely on their own – can pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Of course, good teaching aids are important, but no technology lessens the primacy of excellent adult guidance, which is usually where the bottleneck is in education. In a perverse way, the more we focus on technology, the less attention we pay to good adult supervision.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Between 2004 and 2009, I helped Microsoft set up a new research lab in India, where my group focused on exploring ways to use computing technologies to support the world’s poorest communities. We did a lot of work with education in low-income schools: methods of allowing multiple students to interact with one PC; video-recorded lessons by master teachers; software to convert PowerPoint slides into discs for DVD players; presentation tools designed specifically for busy teachers; educational games whose content could be customized by editing a simple text file; inexpensive clickers that permitted instant polling and tracking of student understanding; etc.
<p>
Throughout all of that work, what I noticed was that our successes depended less on our technology and more on our educational partners. Where administrators were capable and teachers were dedicated, they could put our technology to good use (or, in some cases, summarily reject them as a distraction). But where administrators were weak and teachers were indifferent, technology had little impact – in some cases, it made things worse. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that technology only amplifies underlying human intent and capacity (as opposed to necessarily adding to it), and that in the case of education, it’s the institutional substrate that is critical.
After coming to these conclusions, it made less sense to me to work at a technology company, so I quit, and I’ve since been spending time digesting what I’ve learned and writing about it.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I hope my work will deflect the undeserved hype and attention that goes to technology and other forms of what I call "packaged interventions" – cookie-cutter projects that are supposed to be easy to replicate at large scale. We should instead keep our focus on the foundations of education which appear to be caring parents, a decent early childhood, good school administration, and excellent teachers. Nurturing people and institutions is hard work, but that’s what it takes.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’m a big fan of work by Berkeley professor of public policy, David Kirp. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/opinion/sunday/the-secret-to-fixing-bad-schools.html">recent article by him in The New York Times</a> demonstrates how New Jersey’s Union City school system was turned around with a focus on the basics. Kirp writes, "What makes Union City remarkable is, paradoxically, the absence of pizzazz." To me, this isn’t paradoxical – we shouldn’t be distracted by glamour, by glistening gadgets, or by innovation for its own sake. Instead, we should focus on high-quality implementation of programs that are known to work. It seems simple, and yet we seem ever so attracted to the "sexy" and not the effective: Entrepreneurs want to sell new products; academics want to develop novel pedagogies; policy makers want catchy sound bites; and the general public seems too dazzled by the latest iGadget. Yet, having at one point had the world’s best educational system, America definitely knows what works!
<p>
What could turn things around? In Silicon Valley, some high-profile technology executives send their children to exclusive private schools where the teachers are top-notch and electronic technology is banned until the eighth grade. If more parents aspired to that kind of education for their children, that could have a dramatic impact.

<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’m working on a book about what it means to turn away from packaged interventions in global development. The hard part is finding a publisher for it, which is much more difficult than I anticipated. Once the book is done, I’m thinking about becoming a blacksmith.
