            So, I have been testing an EdLab iPad on some learning tasks as well as some natural tasks that I am interested in. Overall the experience is good, but not outstanding enough to persuade me to buy one for myself. I really like iPad's portability, excellent screen display, as well as the multitouch and accelerometer capabilities. Shopping (or windowshopping) at the app store is also a nice experience, except that the apps specifically designed for iPad still cannot meet my expectations in terms of availability and quality. However, I really hate the fact that Apple is having so much control over the iPad and user behaviors. Next I'd like to share my experiences and thoughts in some tasks I have tried.

<h2>Apps store</h2>

The App Store app is perhaps the most used app on a new iPad, as everyone would want to customize a comfortable and efficient working environment on a new computing device. I love the fact that there are a lot of free apps that I can install and try, and I indeed keep some apps that are cool and useful. For apps that cost money, most of their prices are reasonable (for example, $0.99 for GoodReader, an eBook reading app; $0.99 for Angry Birds, an addictive slingshot-pig game). Best of all, every app has descriptions, screenshots, user ratings and reviews to help me choose which apps to purchase. Also worth mentioning that iPhone apps can also run on iPads (although iPad apps can't run on iPhones), so even if I cannot find my desired iPad app, I may find an iPhone app as a temporary alternative.

The thing I find not so nice is that the only place I can get apps is the Apple App Store -- unless I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jailbreaking_for_iPhone_OS" target="_blank">"jailbreak"</a> the iPad, which would void the iPad warranty. This kind of control can surely help prevent software piracy, but it also obstructs users from seeking a personalized, comfortable experience. For instance, I cannot install the <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/" target="_blank">Cydia app</a> which is not allowed in the App Store to enjoy the pleasure of multitasking. I cannot customize my desktop appearances. I also cannot transfer files of various formats easily between iPad and other devices (unless you install a file sharing app). This is often annoying to me, and makes me feel this is Steve Job's iPad but not my own.

In addition, although it's normal that you can use the trial version of a Windows or Mac application for free for a period of time, I didn't find it possible for iPad -- and iPhone as well -- apps. This makes me wonder why.

<h2>Internet browsing</h2>

Internet browsing is not as comfortable as on a PC. I cannot open any website that streams videos using Adobe Flash (unless that website has an iPad app, such as YouTube). Some webpages do not function or display properly. The packaged Safari browser doesn't have tabbing capabilities so that it is difficult to switch between webpages. In addition, it is sometimes difficult to accurately press small or crowded objects on the screen.

Worst of all, unless to use the iPod app, I cannot listen to music while browsing the website because iPad doesn't allow multitasking. I cannot have an Internet radio app such as Pandora or Slacker running in the background while browsing web in Safari. A lot of people are complaining about this limitation because it is what most people would do while browsing the Internet. There's rumor that this limitation will be removed in the next release of the iPad and iPhone firmware. But it is the biggest con that prevents me from buying an iPad for myself right now.

However, internationalization is great on iPad, just like the Mac machines. There is no problem to view Chinese websites, and it's very easy to enable Chinese input method on iPad.

<h2>Reading</h2>

Reading is one of the best experiences on iPad. The screen is big and nice, feeling much more confortable than on a computer screen. I can read in the couch, on the desk, in bed, on subway, and so on so forth thanks to iPad's portability. And there are tons of channels to find books to read. iPad is built with an iBook app which is Apple's own digital bookstore. One can also install the apps of many book resellers for free such as B&N and Amazon. I tested the Amazon Kindle app -- worked great, and I can access my book collections with no problem after logging into my account. In the App Store, there also are many nice eBook, magazine, and newspaper apps including many Japanese and some Chinese publications for free or at a modest price.

It is also possible to read my own materials on iPad, although it requires some effort at the beginning. The first thing to do is to find a file sharing app because iPad isn't built in with any app to transfer files of multiple formats via USB or bluetooth. There is a free app called Drop Box (also available for Windows and Mac) that allows you to store up to 2G stuff online and share between devices. But uploading and downloading large files from the web can be slow. What I find more helpful is an eBook reading app called Good Reader that supports file sharing by itself. Right now it has an introdutory price of $0.99, so I didn't hesitate to buy it. With this app, I can use iPad's USB cable, bluetooth, and even WiFi to transfer files of various types from my desktop to iPad. Good Reader itself supports many eBook formats as well as some audio and video formats. You can also choose other apps to open the transferred files from within Good Reader.

What is annoying, though, is the multitasking issue previously mentioned. I cannot listen to streamed music while reading eBooks.

Besides, the eBook reading apps for iPad appear to be more recreational than educational. Only limited interactivity such as searching, bookmarking, annotation, and sharing are supported. More advanced activities such as online collaboration, discussion, academic writing etc. are not possible. In addition, typing long texts on iPad's touch screen is painful. Therefore it appears iPad is not there yet to be used for academic learning.

<h2>Gaming</h2>

Gaming is also a great experience on iPad. There are tons of games in the app store to choose from, and some are free. The fact that iPhone games can run on iPad at original or 2x sizes expands the resources tremendously. I really appreciate the capability of the multitouch screen, which is more intuitive and gives me a totally different feeling than playing with mouse and keyboard on a PC. The accelerometer also adds a lot of fun. One addictive game I played for an hour today is called the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a>. And I imagine it to be great fun to use iPad to play the <a href="http://www.crayonphysics.com/" target="_blank">Crayon Physics Deluxe</a> game that I <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2135">blogged about</a> a while ago.

Think about what this 10-inch touchscreen tablet offers -- an interface that resembles traditional archade games where parents can play with their kids, and children can play with their buddies. You can find a lot of YouTube videos where parents play iPhone or iPad educational games with their children or even their pets. This is good opportunities that parents can help their children learn. Unfortunately, I didn't see many games in the iPad app store that truely exploit this potential.

<h2>Video</h2>

Apple claims videos-watching on iPad is an unprecedented experience. Indeed, to watch videos wherever you go on this big, crystal-clear screen is awsome. But it's ironical that I cannot enjoy this experience easily. First of all it is difficult to transfer my video collections to iPad because I simply cannot plug the USb cable and copy-paste videos into iPad. I had to buy some file sharing app to do so (for which I used Good Reader). Then keep in mind I can't use too much storage of this $500 device because it only has 16G harddrive, and it is impossible to use an external harddrive or SD card to expand the space. Finally, after I managed to transfer some videos to iPad, I realize I can't play them because these AVI videos are not supported by iPad (I didn't find any video player that plays AVI in the app store)! The bottom line: frustrating!

To summarize, iPad is a great device with great technologies. But is it what you want for $500 or more at this moment given the fact there are so many limitations imposed by Apple? If Apple wants to prevent the "unhonored" user activities, it should first make possible a reasonably wide range of "honored" activities. Anyway, iPad is still new. I'm waiting to see if this situation will improve in the near future. Most users including me don't want too much from a device like iPad. We just want to use it comfortably.
