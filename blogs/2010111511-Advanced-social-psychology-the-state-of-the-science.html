            <strong>Title:</strong> Advanced social psychology : the state of the science
<strong>Editors:</strong> Roy F. Baumeister, Eli J. Finkel
<strong>Publisher:</strong> <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/?view=usa">Oxford University Press</a>
<strong>Check it out:</strong> <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/c?SEARCH=HM1033+.A38+2010&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">HM1033 .A38 2010</a>

<strong>From the Publisher:</strong> Social psychology is a flourishing discipline. It explores the most essential questions of the human psyche (e.g., Why do people help or harm others? How do influence professionals get us to do what they want, and how can we inoculate ourselves against their sometimes-insidious persuasion tactics? Why do social relationships exert such powerful effects on people's physical health?), and it does so with clever, ingenuitive research methods.

This edited volume is a textbook for advanced social psychology courses. Its primary target audience is first-year graduate students (MA or PhD) in social psychlogy, although it is also appropriate for upper-level undergraduate courses in social psychology and for doctoral students in disciplines connecting to social psychology (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior). The authors of the chapters are world-renowned leaders on their topic, and they have written these chapters to be engaging and accessible to students who are just learning the discipline.

After reading this book, you will be able to understand almost any journal article or conference presentation in any field of social psychology. You will be able to converse competently with most social psychologists in their primary research domain, a use skill that is relevant not only in daily life but also when interviewing for a faculty position. And, most importantly, you will be equipped with the background knowledge to forge ahead more confidently with your own research.
