          <p>
            Hello and goodbye beautiful people,

I am sad to say that my time here at EdLab has come to a close. Well not a close, let’s say a pause. As I stepped in the elevator and pressed the illustrious and exclusive 5th floor penthouse button, I was surprised to feel a combination of nostalgia, pride and indigestion (late night pizza run). From winning the trivia challenge at my first seminar down on the basement floor to Jo and Brian’s halloween Spooktacular D&R event to Chris and Gary’s Hogwarts team seminar to our EdLab cookout where we reminisced in the courtyard about our younger days of debauchery, my experiences here have been ones that I will never forget. A lot of the time it did not feel like a job, but more of a community working towards a common goal and it truly saddens me that I won’t be a part of it anymore! I want to thank you all for the impact you have made on me and the consistency that you have provided to me for the past several months. 

I want to give a SPECIAL shout out to some people:

@Dina - We were oftentimes separated by multiple floors, but my bamboo tree (Desiree) always gave me a reminder of you and your welcoming demeanor. Stay smiling and much love!

@HuiSoo - I couldn’t be more serious when I say thank you so much because your “Good Mornings” have meant a lot to me. I’m not much of a morning person, but anticipating you turning around and greeting me to start off my day gave me more energy than you know! Thank you for always having encouraging words and for being supportive in me and my work here at EdLab.

@Brian - You eased me into this position with your helpful tips and explanations of best practices. I appreciate your ability to engage a full audience with your keen wit and eloquence. I’m also quite envious of your impeccable posture lol Much respect to you!

@Chris - Boy, oh boy, Wednesday's were my favorite day because of the food that you ordered. Food is a unifying force, and your consistency in ordering delicious delicacies really impacted my psyche (and my stomach)!

@George - You know what it is. Been the homey since Day 1. Thank you for your advice and real life/relevant Google Chat discussions. Most of all, thank you for bringing the soccer player back out in me. I’ll definitely be back out on the pitch with you next summer. We’ll link up!

@Dino - You crack me up. 70% of my laughs came from you, which is egg-sactly what I needed. Your wit and humor combined with the egg-ceptional dedication and hard work that you put into your job is admirable and I am egg-stremely glad that we have gotten the chance to bond these past few months. Hold down the egg while I’m gone!

Last but not least, @Jo - Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo. You’ve been the best mentor/supervisor during my time here that I could have asked for. No matter when or where you always had the time to answer my questions and help me out when I was in a bind, with that signature Jo smile and giggle! I truly am lucky to have had you there in my corner during my time here at EdLab and you have taught me some lessons that I will take with me as I continue to embark on my journey. You are doing amazing things here and I have no doubt you will continue to impact everyone that you come in contact with. Love and respect!

And a huge thank you to everyone else! Sorry, when I get sentimental I get sappy and when I get sappy I just want to let the love be felt by all around me! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING, EDLAB SQUAD. You all are the best. This won’t be my last time in EdLab. I still live on campus and I will be around to crash a seminar or two. If there is ANYTHING that anyone needs from me (a student perspective, a friend, a point guard to add to the company basketball team), do not hesitate to ask! Keep doing #TheWork and continue prospering. I’ll always be around in spirit!

Until we meet again,
Pat
