<p><a href="https://gismart.com/hello-piano/">Hello Piano</a> is an app that aims to make learning piano and music theory more entertaining and attainable through 15-minute daily challenges. The curriculum focuses on 4 main skills: rhythm, ear training, playing technique, and reading music. It also includes stats so you can follow your progress, and gives you points for practicing. The game has a free seven-day trial and then costs $7.99 per week.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I appreciate the fact that Hello Piano doesn’t simply teach note names and finger positions; while these things are included, the app creators clearly value a more holistic music education, as they include plenty of theory and ear training exercises. Requiring users to work on building these skills daily alongside piano-specific skills demonstrates the equal importance of theory and practice in building good musicianship. As a former piano teacher, I can attest to the importance of this.</p>

<p>The games seem to strike the right balance between fun and educational. While the cute, colorful graphics are engaging, the activities are clearly grounded in skill-based learning. The regular positive affirmations and badges earned when certain achievements are complete were also a nice touch.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Though Hello Piano is free for the first seven days of use, it is an expensive app if kept beyond the trial period. I understand that the cost of piano lessons is steep, and though eight dollars a week is significantly cheaper than having a physical teacher, this app doesn’t actually teach you piano. The transfer of skills from app to the keyboard requires additional time and training that I doubt this app could fully provide.</p>

<p>A problem I continually have with music learning apps is the teaching of rhythm. A musical instrument is responsive in a way that even the newest smartphones can’t replicate. Even more importantly, Hello Piano values tempo over rhythm; you can play a rhythm accurately, but if you don’t play it at the demonstrated tempo, you are given a very low score. Especially for a new music learner, tackling these two concepts separately first is essential for differentiating between them.</p> 

<p>In general, I was frustrated with how new concepts would be introduced very briefly and then immediately followed by a complex comprehension activity. Expecting users who’ve never read music before to identify any note on the piano after being introduced to a single graphic of a two-octave scale is highly unrealistic. Hello Piano did not demonstrate depth over breadth, which is not a very effective teaching method, especially for beginners.</p>

<p>The intended audience for this app is unclear; it is definitely aimed at beginners, but because of the heavy reliance on technical written explanations, particularly in theory lessons, it doesn’t feel practical for anyone under the age of 14. While this is fine, a clarification in the app description would be nice, as the graphics originally made me think it was for young kids.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Though I appreciate what Hello Piano tries to achieve, I don’t recommend this app as a substitute for real piano lessons. Though it could supplement lessons, your money might be better spent elsewhere.</p>
