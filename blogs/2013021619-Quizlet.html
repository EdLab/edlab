<p><a href="http://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a> is a leading digital flashcard tool which <a href="http://quizlet.com/mission">boasts</a> over 12 million unique visitors a month with most spending 8 or more minutes on the site. The mobile version is consistently among the most popular educational apps in the iTunes store. Quizlet’s simple mission focuses on digital adaptations of classic learning tools like flash cards, word match, and quizzing. The tool was <a href="http://www.theinnovationeconomy.org/_layouts/IEC/InnovatorsCorner/InvCrnDetails.aspx?IcrnId=2&LinkId=2&videono=7922161&Vdesc=7">created in 2005</a> by then high school sophomore Andrew Sutherland for his own use while cramming for a test. Several years and iterations later, Sutherland <a href="http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-deals/2012-11-28-no-vc-education-startup-quizlet-makes-the-grade-going-it-alone/">dropped out of MIT</a> to work full time on the increasingly popular site. Sutherland is still CTO of Quizlet, but he brought on an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/08/in-the-studio-quizlets-andrew-sutherland-quietly-built-a-classroom-juggernaut/">experienced CEO</a> to run the company while he was attending college and the organizational decision seems to have worked; the site has accepted no venture capital and thrives on ad-based revenue and their $15 per month ad-free subscriptions.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Though the idea behind Quizlet is very simple, the success of the site is in the details. The system offers mobile options, text-to-speech capabilities, an image database for study material augmentation, and support for 18 languages. The loyal following has created a good community and a large base of study materials across many disciplines and subjects. The site is not fancy, but has a standard, simple design that its furiously studying users seem to appreciate. Quizlet seems sustainable and wholesome, it works for users and has for many years.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Quizlet could do a bit more with metadata and ranking as it grows. At this point study materials are grouped only by subject and ranked only by time created. Adding an upvoting feature and crowdranking would help grow the community and make the tool more effective for students. Tying study sets to particular textbooks or classrooms might also help connect study materials to the right students.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Quizlet is not revolutionary. Its focus on memorization-based techniques is not breakthrough learning and it is not going to train the next generation of creative professionals, but it executes its purpose cheerfully and successfully and it does so online. The user numbers speak to the necessity of a tool like this for real life, at present learning and the site makes this learning maximally shareable and available for improvement. Quizlet may not be exciting, but it is disruptive and it’s quietly making the digital shift in the lives of hundreds of thousands of students and teachers every day.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Quizlet is going digital with classic study methods.</p>
