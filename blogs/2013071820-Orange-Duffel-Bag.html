<b>From Real-Life Experience to Helping Others</b><br>
While foster care systems are considered the next best thing to a potentially dangerous or life-threatening family home environment, once children turn eighteen, they are pushed out of foster care and into the "real world."  In order to help increase these "aged-out" teens’ chances for success and lessen the opportunities for prostitution and theft, <a href="http://orangeduffelbagfoundation.org/">The Orange Duffel Bag Foundation</a> has provided mentoring and training to help put these teens on track towards a better future and the possibility of higher education.  After growing up watching his step-father molest his sister and getting involved with drugs himself at age eight, <a href="http://sambracken.com/">Sam Bracken</a> decided later in life to help children forced to go through what he understandably considered to be a nightmare upbringing.  Not only did he write his book, <i>My Orange Duffel Bag – A Journey to Radical Change </i>(See the <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10434">book trailer</a>) to create awareness about the all-too-common experience of "aged-out" youth, but he also founded Orange Duffel Bag with Echo Garrett to help enrich young, disadvantaged lives.  Orange Duffel Bag aims to bring awareness regarding real-life situations and provide the guidance these teens, who are often overlooked and abandoned, need to have a better future.
<p>
<b>Afterschool Coaching Programs</b><br>
Only 3% of youth in foster care continue school after the age of 18, but Orange Duffel Bag aims to change that.  This mission is supported by a number of businesses and organizations (including <a href="http://www.everychildusa.com/">EveryChildUSA</a>, <a href="http://csicreativesolutions.com">Creative Solutions Inc</a>, and <a href="http://wellsfargo.com">Wells Fargo</a>), in partnership with a variety of educational institutions. Orange Duffel Bag offers <a href="http://orangeduffelbagfoundation.org/resources/our-programs/">afterschool coaching programs</a> to support at-risk youth.  (Learn how a Columbia Professor <a href="http://www.good.is/posts/purposeful-storytelling-how-designing-with-instead-of-for-promotes-understanding">uses it as an example</a> to tackle social problems with storytelling).  These 12-week programs help foster teens create a life plan to graduate from high school and either further their education or find employment afterwards.  From learning how to overcome obstacles, to figuring out the type of work they want to explore, program participants are able to learn from their peers and also develop lasting and healthy relationships with other students and mentors.  One of the major benefits of this program, beyond the availability of in-person resources, is the laptop they are awarded after graduating from high school to further their education, an often overlooked necessity that more often than not, is out of reach for at-risk teens.  If Orange Duffel Bag can guide children away from homelessness and into education, perhaps they can help transform the lives of many disadvantaged teens.
