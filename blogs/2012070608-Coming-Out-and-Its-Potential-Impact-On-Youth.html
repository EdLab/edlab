            Homosexuality continues to have a stigma in certain places in our country. Even though the Obama administration recently expressed support for gay marriages, there is a sizeable amount of Americans who are opposed to same sex marriages. 

This past week might have been a key moment in terms of <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2012/07/05/anderson-cooper-and-frank-ocean-a-tale-of-two-comings-out/#ixzz1zoqh8PSu">how we view homosexuality and whether it should determine one's success</a>. CNN's Anderson Cooper, one of the most well known journalists confirmed that he was gay and that has never affected how he reports or view the many subjects he has covered over the years. On the other side, highly touted R&B singer Frank Ocean also admitted to being gay. For most, Ocean's admission, at a time when he is on the cusp of superstardom, was seen as career suicide, especially in the African American community, where homosexuality is very much still a taboo. Ocean, who has written songs for Beyonce, Kanye West and Justin Bieber and has one of the most highly anticipated albums of the year, was frank and said he can now focus on his music without anything to hide or fear. 

I recently blogged about cyberbullying and its impact on young people, some of whom may be sensitive to certain things people joke about, including their sexuality. Additionally, most young people who are homosexual or bisexual are often secretive about their sexuality as they do not want to be bullied or stigmatized by their friends, family, community and groups they are part of. By coming out, Cooper and Ocean may have inspired young people who are homosexual to be confident in their sexuality but more importantly see it as a strength not a deterrent in whatever endeavor they pursue, whether it is mainstream pop music or CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
