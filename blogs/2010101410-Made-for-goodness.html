            <strong>Title</strong>: Made for Goodness: and why all this makes a difference

<strong>Author</strong> : Desmond M. Tutu and Mpho A. Tutu  
<strong>Publisher</strong>: New York : HarperOne
<strong>Call number: </strong><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=made+for+goodness">BJ1521 .T88 2010
</a><strong>From the Publisher:</strong>
South African Nobel Peace Prize–winner Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, who lived through South African apartheid and helped to clean up its criminal consequences by chairing the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, could write a grocery list and people would get something out of it. With his daughter Mpho Tutu, an Episcopal priest in Washington, D.C., the retired Anglican archbishop writes a relatively personal book about his fundamental, faith-based beliefs about human nature: people are basically good because they are made in God's image. He maintains this in the face of the horrific events he has witnessed in his country and elsewhere, and he bases his belief in part on simple experiences throughout his life that have involved family and, significantly, his failures. Tutu's humility is striking; he is comfortable in his own skin despite being raised in a culture that officially deemed his skin color second-class. This book is not nearly as dramatic or compelling as <em>No Future Without Forgiveness</em>, based on his work with the Reconciliation Commission; on the other hand, it is heartening to know, or remember, that faith can be learned, reinforced, and expressed as much around the dinner table as in the public square.

<em>
</em><strong>About the authors:</strong>

<strong>Desmond Mpilo Tutu</strong> (born 7 October 1931) is a South African activist and Christian cleric who rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid. He was the first black South African Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, and primate of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now the Anglican Church of Southern Africa).

Tutu has been active in the defence of human rights and uses his high profile to campaign for the oppressed. He has campaigned to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, homophobia, poverty and racism. Tutu received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism in 1986, the Gandhi Peace Prize in 2005,  the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.
