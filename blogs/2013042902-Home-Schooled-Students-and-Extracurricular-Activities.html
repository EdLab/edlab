            Sports are very important in the lives of many people around the world; it allows people to bring out certain aspects of their character they may not have noticed before. In Alabama, a bill called the “Tebow Bill” (named after NFL quarterback <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow">Tim Tebow</a>, who was homeschooled for most of his K-12 years) is set to make it easier for home schooled students to take part in <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/schooled_in_sports/2013/04/tebow_bill_faces_opposition_in_alabama_support_in_texas.html?cmp=SOC-EDIT-TWTRSS">sports activities in public schools</a>. Supporters of the bill argue that since parents of the students pay taxes, then they deserve to participate. Opponents of the bill are educators who feel the new bill will destroy the high school athletic system. 

Cullman County Board of Education Superintendent Billy Coleman argues that activities outside of the classrooms are privileges and not rights. Coleman understands that the parents of students being home schooled pay taxes just like any other student in public school. He stated that a problem will develop when the parents of the students being home schooled start to pick and choose what athletic team to join. In many states such as Arkansas, portions of the Tebow bill passed, which allows homeschool students to participate in public school extracurricular activities but they are not guaranteed a position on the sports team.
