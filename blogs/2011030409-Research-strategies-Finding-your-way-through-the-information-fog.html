Do the demands of carrying out research in today's high-tech environment leave you baffled? Did the grade on your last term paper leave you doubting that getting an education was worth the effort? As a student in higher education, do you long for a simple, comprehensive guide to research?

Here it is. Now in its third edition, extensively revised and 32-percent larger than the second edition, <em>Research Strategies</em> is your indispensable guide to informational research.

With his concise, empathetic, witty manner, William Badke shows you that research does not need to be painful. You'll learn the skills that are essential to the success of any research project so that you can take control of the research process and make it work for you. <em>Research Strategies</em> is as friendly as a puppy, as informative as your friend's Facebook account, and as helpful as a personal servant. Don't start your research project without it.
