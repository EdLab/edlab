            <img class='nlt-image' src="https://cdn.tc-library.org/NewLearningTimes/prepped_1b56ad9123304a078eb07e2d8d2ab6fc.jpg" alt='article.title'><br />

<p><a href="http://www.alwaysprepped.com/">Always Prepped</a> is an educational data aggregator and tool for analysis that helps teachers organize their various data streams from sites like <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/about">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.engrade.com/">Engrade</a>, and <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/223">Socrative</a>. The site organizes the data to give teachers a clear overview of their students’ activities in these educational tools. Teachers can use graphs from the combined data to get a better sense of how students are performing around the web. Always Prepped’s inclusive data will become more beneficial for teachers as the library of online educational resources available for students continues to expand.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Time is valuable and Always Prepped was designed to save teachers time in gathering student activity data. Teachers can freely use their favorite educational apps and the Always Prepped dashboard will automatically gather and display the data without extra steps. The data graphs created by the site can help teachers analyze student performance and identify students who need extra remediation or more challenging activities.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Data from the connected sites doesn’t appear on the Always Prepped dashboard immediately and can often take several hours to sync. The site currently connects to Khan Academy, Engrade, and Socrative, but teachers will want Always Prepped to sync with more learning apps. Partnership for a new startup is challenging, but the site’s performance depends on flexibly syncing with a variety of apps.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Always Prepped is a one stop source for edtech data. As online educational tools become more ubiquitous and numerous, it is becoming too time consuming for teachers to analyze data across tools. Always Prepped not only tracks student activities in educational apps but also gathers data on behavioral elements like attendance to connect real life behavior to performance on tests or quizzes. Student trouble at school or issues at home may have an impact on performance in class or on edtech apps and Always Prepped attempts to present an analysis of student activity that reflects both online and in-person activity. It will be interesting to see how this site will grow and stand out in a competitive edtech data analysis market. Other competitors in this field include tools like <a href="http://www.getontract.com/">Ontract</a> and the <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/11/prweb10150048.htm">the major educational publisher Pearson</a>. There is certainly a place for data aggregation tools in education and Always Prepped is a strong tool. The site takes care of all the data gathering so teachers can focus on action.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Always Prepped creates a single location for data from different online learning tools.</p>
