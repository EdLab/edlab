<p>Museums are changing educational spaces. While some remain direct pipelines to the past (like the Louvre), newer museums have become places to experiment with design and innovation as exhibits become more interactive for visitors. Local Projects is an NYC-based studio dedicated to creating experience design exhibits in museums. They’ve designed exhibits around the city, including at the 9/11 Memorial Museum and the Cooper Hewitt.</p>

<p><a href="http://localprojects.net">Local Projects</a> connects architecture, technology, and media to make installations immersive, interactive, and collaborative. Its founder, Jake Barton, says that his studio designs experiences to be shared because, unlike the digital space, people visit museums in order to learn together. Experience design allows visitors to interact with both the exhibit and one another. They become actors within the museum space rather than passive absorbers. This means that instead of learning by seeing, visitors learn by doing and creating collaboratively.</p>

<p>How could experience design enhance or detract from visitors’ learning experiences at museums? How is the field changing the learning landscape of museums? In what other contexts can you see experience design being used? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/37290/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:26 Nantwi:</b> Experience design has enormous potential for many industries such as education. I can imagine a science or social studies class embarking on an experience design tour in a museum to learn more deeply about something they covered in class.</p>

<p><b>@02:02 RuthS:</b> Experience design seems to have a lot in common with social media and the newfound term, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/the-information-age-is-over-welcome-to-the-experience-age/">the experience age</a>. People are less concerned with information now and more with experiencing and sharing those experiences with others. Learning spaces like museums can leverage that to make visitors more engaged.</p>
