<p>The wide range in both quality and quantity of sex education in the U.S. has led to serious gaps in knowledge for many young people. Racial and ethnic minorities face a particularly severe risk from undereducation in sexual health, as they are disproportionally affected by HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). One way to increase opportunities for teens to learn about sexual health is through gamified intervention. In order to determine the effectiveness of such a strategy, a Yale research team developed and tested a video game with the help of hundreds of minority students. </p>
 
<p>Over the course of a year, 300 students, ages 11-14, were evaluated after playing either the Yale-developed game or a non-education focused control game for 6 weeks. The game, called PlayForward, is a role-playing adventure game focused on how individual choices in particular environments/social contexts impact short-term and long-term goals. As the player navigates the game, they make decisions in a series of narratives for their avatar, navigating risky behavior in social situations with the main goal of not developing HIV. The study was conducted in 12 urban community-based settings where participants played their respective games for 75 minutes twice a week.</p>

<p>Overall, teens who played the Yale-developed game demonstrated improved sexual health attitudes and knowledge. While rates of sexual initiation among players after completing the game varied, it was proven to successfully increase the teens’ sex IQs, especially in regards to STIs.</p> 

<p>One interesting observation was that in several of the communities, PlayForward had a stronger impact on the sexual attitudes of male players than female players. While the researchers are not entirely sure why this is, it is likely tied to the fact that male players reported feeling more connected to their avatar than their female counterparts did. </p>

<p>Yale’s study with PlayForward proves that video games can make theory-driven sex education and STI prevention accessible without requiring extensive teacher training or financial resources. While there are still many ways in which PlayForward can be strengthened, it demonstrates that despite the many barriers facing sex education in American schools, there are innovative new ways of breaking them down. </p>
