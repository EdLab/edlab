<p><a href="https://www.chineasy.com/learn/app/">Chineasy Cards</a>, a free app recently released by the award-winning Chineasy company, takes the methodology employed on their website and packages it for fun, easy Chinese language learning on the go. On a game-based journey, users learn Chinese characters through illustration and associative learning, focusing on only 4-6 words at each level during short breaks throughout the day.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Chineasy Cards are excellent for those wanting to engage in casual, introductory, self-directed language learning. Designed for mobile users, this app delivers lessons in short segments that can usually be completed in five to seven minutes. After learning four words and their corresponding characters, you are quizzed, and earn dumplings to feed your "learning buddy," Bao. The guilt that comes from starving Bao is a strategy to keep you on track by engaging with the app daily.</p>

<p>The visual approach, documented in our review of the <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1006/chineasy">Chineasy website</a>five years ago, is a clever way of connecting etymology, orthography, and meaning, especially for visual learners. The app allows the user to tap between the character and it’s illustrated counterpart while listening to and reading about it. It’s fun to learn and easy to swipe back and forth to review what you’ve completed. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While this is an excellent app for learning to read and write in Mandarin, it isn’t very effective for improving speaking and listening skills. While the pronunciation is given by a real human voice, the spelled phonetics don’t always line up with the sounds users hear. Sometimes this has to do with consonants in the latin orthography that don’t mesh with Mandarin sounds, and sometimes it has to do with the fact that Mandarin is an extremely tonal language. At the very least, an introduction to basic Mandarin pronunciation, phonetics, and tonality is required.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Chineasy Cards is a fantastic, fun free resource for anyone interested in a short daily dose of reading and writing practice in Mandarin. However, you might want to look elsewhere for improving oral skills. </p>
