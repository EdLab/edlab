A <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> alum and success story, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/martha-girdler/8/289/a2b">Martha K. Girdler</a>, is the poster woman of female engineers who have beat the "brogrammer" system and gone on to become a leading voice in the software engineering field.  Girdler describes her experience at Hacker School to <i>Forbes</i> as, "At Hacker School I learned that programming is not so different from writing a great paper or learning a foreign language… When you approach programming with an intense willingness to learn, amazing things will happen."  And it is this "intense willingness to learn" that has taken her from engineering roles at digital companies ranging from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> to <a href="https://www.uber.com/">UBER</a> (among others). Girdler holds undergraduate degrees in Art, Art History and Design from Auburn University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I studied Art, Art History and Design as an undergraduate, which has little to do with my current work as a Software Engineer. However, having a non-traditional CS background has vast advantages. First, I’ve yet to interview any CS graduate from CMU/Stanford/Berkeley/etc. who was equipped to write software at a professional level. They learn the practical aspects of Software Engineering at their first job (which is why I’m such an advocate for paid CS internship programs). Secondly, Engineers are often trapped in a narrow worldview and that <i>has</i> to change. The people building software, starting companies, and pitching products to VCs are not diverse. Diversity combined with opportunity will create the healthy kind of competition we need to keep pushing forward.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>


<b>Answer:</b> <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> (explore our "Seen in NY" coverage of Hacker School <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/701">here</a>), in many ways, was the beginning for me. Hacker School is a free, full-time, immersive school in New York for becoming a better programmer. It supports the collaboration of curious, thoughtful, and intelligent people, and it was there I first fell in love with programming. Hacker School is radical because it allows the student to direct the learning process. Which, coincidentally, when you fill a room with intensely curious and intelligent people - you don’t need to direct them. It’s brilliant.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Personally, I hope to change the learning landscape by increasing the visibility of women. I believe young girls can’t become what they can’t see. I run hack days focused on women and girls that make programming look fun, unintimidating and empowering. I offer my network to them and make introductions. I want to see more people stepping into this role.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> The availability of free/inexpensive material on the internet is a strong trend - one that I hope continues. MOOCs are interesting - but I’m not certain how to fully utilize them for long-term gain. Programming boot camps are a great solution in the interim - but again, the long term gains from these kinds of programs will only matter if employers respect them and offer entry-level positions for these students to land.
<p>
Monolithic, expensive, and slow evolving 4-year institutions aren’t practical for technical education anymore. I <i>know</i> there are better ways. I’d love to see traditional 4-year institutions offer specialized degrees that take a year to complete at a low price point. I think that would bring "legitimacy" to these special programs, and could be compelling for people seeking job specific training rather than a broad liberal education.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Right now I love the work I do at Uber, and the problems the engineering team is solving are incredibly interesting. My next big project is under-wraps for now...but It’s a fun collaboration with my friend, mentor, and role model Leslie Bradshaw.
