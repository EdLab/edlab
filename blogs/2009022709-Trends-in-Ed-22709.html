            <b>More reports on the future of libraries than you could ever wish for</b>
Blogger John Dupuis (of <a href=http://jdupuis.blogspot.com/2009/02/twenty-nine-reports-about-future-of.html>Confessions of a Science Librarian</a>) has put together a list of 29 reports that have implications for the future of libraries.  It's a lot of info to sift through, but it's a great resource to have. Here are a few that I found interesting:

<i>How Readers Navigate to Scholarly Content: Comparing the changing user
behaviour between 2005 and 2008 and its impact on publisher web site design and function</i>
<li>Nearly 60% of library patrons surveyed thought that technology deployed by their institution's library affected how they navigate to e-journals</li>
<li>From the conclusion: “A key measure of publisher success is the usage of its e-journals, which can
be maximised by influencing and enabling all the routes to its content. Library
technology plays a key role in user navigation, as well as the more apparent
starting points such as Google or major subject A&I databases.”</li>

<i>The Next Generation of Academics: A Report on a Study Conducted at the University of Rochester</i>
<li>From the executive summary: “In sum, the graduate students we interviewed navigate large bodies of literature using any tools they can find to the best of their abilities, often risking technology failure or experiencing the limits of their proficiency and knowledge. Sometimes they turn to each other for help but rarely do they seek help from library professionals, preferring to rely on themselves or on whatever help their supervisors give them. Their work-related needs are many, offering the library a range of opportunities to help”</li>

<b>Inspiration by Innovation </b>
Stuck in a rut?  Maybe you need yourself an innovation room.  <a href= http://www.madison.com/wsj/topstories/438467”>Professors and architects at the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> have jumped on board the latest trend train in academia, which is to support collaborative learning. Along with providing cutting edge technology, the “innovation room” is also luxuriously comfortable-- it's equipped with a plush couch, coffee table, and candle-rimmed flat-screen TV (yes, candle-rimmed; no, there were no pictures). The room is located right in the middle of the biomedical engineering department.  Professors and administrators hope it will stimulate deep thought amongst students and will allow them to create new ideas.  Just throwin' it out there… but I think that back room of ours is screaming for a makeover.  <a href=” http://hubpages.com/hub/What-Not-to-Wear”>Stacey and Clinton</a> are collecting undercover footage as we speak.  

<b>iPhone App-a-Day</b>
Luminosity's latest game, <a href=” http://www.itunes.com/app/memorymatrix”>Memory Matrix</a>, is one of the newest apps claiming to improve your [working] memory. Here's how it works: You're presented with a screen made up of squares, and among those is a matrix of shaded squares.  The shaded squares fade away and now you must identify which squares they were. It gets progressively harder and keeps track of your progress.
