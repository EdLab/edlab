          <p>
            If you have only enough cash to buy just one magazine this month, make it the August issue of <i>National Geographic</i>.   It's worth it alone for the impressive pull-out map on p. 46 showing the exact locations of the more than half a million people in and around New Orleans currently living below sea level.  It's an invaluable resource for educators trying to convey the complexities of New Orleans' geographic makeup to their students. The map accompanies a wonderful piece on <a href= http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0708/feature1/index.html>“New Orleans: A Perilous Future,”</a> detailing the combined threats of a rising sea-level, global warming, inadequate levees and, perhaps most importantly, the disappearing coastal wetlands, to the future viability of New Orleans.

The story also features a phenomenal <a href=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0708/feature1/gallery1.html>photographic essay</a>, offering the crisp,  thought-provoking images it seems only the <i>Geographic</i>'s photographers (in this case Tyrone Turner) are able to produce.  There is the eerie image of Robert Green's FEMA trailer virtually the only point of light in his Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood, a stunning view of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet as it merges with the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, a distraught Nikksha Neapollioun being consoled by her son outside her devastated home, white-suited members of the Big Nine Social Aid and Pleasure club performing a second-line parade past empty homes.  

The article, by <i>Geographic</i> staff writer Joel K. Bourne, Jr., also provides an update on community activist Tanya Harris and her grandmother, Josephine Butler, both featured in <i>When the Levees Broke</i>.  (Hint: they're not yet giving up on New Orleans.)

Much of the article is available free of charge on the magazine's website, and there are extra features aplenty, including an <a href=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0708/feature1/map.html>interactive map</a> of ten trouble spots in the Louisiana levees system and several videos, including an interview with University of California at Berkeley engineering professor <a href=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0708/feature1/video2.html>Robert Bea</a> (he's the engineer featured in <i>When the Levees Broke</i>, whom Spike Lee asks, with reference to the film <i>Marathon Man,</i> “is it safe?” to return to New Orleans.)  But the “Lives Still at Risk” map does not appear to be available on the website, and is well worth the $4.95 cover price.

The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for <i>Time</i> Magazine's August 13 cover story, <a href=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1649290,00.html> “Why New Orleans Still Isn't Safe.” </a>  To be sure, <i>Time</i>'s story points an important finger at the “misguided policies and bureaucratic bungling” that created such an inadequate flood protection system for New Orleans in the first place and are showing clear signs of recurring in the aftermath of Katrina. Managing Editor Richard Stengel notes in his <a href=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1649299,00.html>“To Our Readers”</a> column that five of Time Inc.'s major publications (<i>Time, Fortune, People, Sports Illustrated</i> and <i>Essence</i>) will be devoting significant coverage to New Orleans as the second anniversary of Katrina approaches.

This is commendable, but in the same column, Stengel makes a comment about the Katrina coverage that is deeply troubling.  “Someday,” he writes, “historians will find in the saga of New Orleans a 21st century morality tale about wealth and poverty, black and white, man and nature.”  <i>Someday? Time</i> all but ignores these critically important questions in its story, focusing instead on missteps in the reconstruction of the city's flood prevention system, as if Katrina were a story entirely about engineering and, well, “infrastructure.”  (See my blog of August 6 for a discussion of the dreaded “i” word.)  It's true that the rebuilding of the levees and the city are of major importance, but even with the most carefully constructed protection systems, disasters are inevitable.  The editors of <i>Time</i> seem to think that the Katrina story is only about New Orleans and flood walls, and not about taking stock of how such a devastating series of events — many of which took place <i>after</i> the levees broke — could have happened in the most prosperous nation on the planet. How our nation will respond in the wake of the next disaster — whether it is a flood, an earthquake, a terrorist attack or an epidemic disease — is every bit as important to the story, but you wouldn't know it to read <i>Time</i> this week.
