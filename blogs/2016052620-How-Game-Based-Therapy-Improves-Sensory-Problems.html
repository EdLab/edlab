<p>Sensory integration dysfunction (SID) is a neurological disorder that affects a person’s physical capabilities and is increasingly being diagnosed in children. With impaired physical capacity, children with SID usually have difficulties in play, productivity, or in-school motivation. Therapy is available for children with SID, but it may not be accessible, frequent, or engaging enough to be effective.</p>
 
<p>With these obstacles in mind, a research team in Taiwan wanted to improve therapy options for children with SID. They developed a model that incorporated motion-sensing digital games. The researchers wanted a device that was accessible and could be installed in any home so that families wouldn't have to travel for therapy, so they focused on playing Wii Sports with a Wii Board.</p>

<p>Observing five participants over three months, they found that their therapy system improved bodily-kinesthetic skills across the board. The areas that benefited the most though were balance and lower body sensory integration, using tasks like hopping in circles and doing jumping jacks. Also, Wii Sports kept the attention of the participants throughout the three months of the study, which pleased both children and parents. The researchers believe that with increased physical ability, the children in the study will be more motivated and capable during in-school learning.</p>

<p>The study found that not only is using a Wii for SID therapy more convenient for families, it also provided better results than traditional SID therapy. The game-based platform keeps children engaged, and the Wii’s built-in motion sensing made tracking progress easy. Children with SID can be socially and academically disengaged because of their limited physical capabilities, which is why therapies like the one used in this study are so important for them. With increased access to fun and engaging therapy, children with SID can take their learning to a new level.</p>
