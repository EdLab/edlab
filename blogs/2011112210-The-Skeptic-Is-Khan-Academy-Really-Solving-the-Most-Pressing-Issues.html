          <p>
            Welcome to The Skeptic, a new content stream that I will be piloting for potential inclusion in New Learning Times. The content stream is self-explanatory but if I must, I see it as serving a valuable function in the ed-tech community. The ed-tech community is full of idealists; after all, what could be more noble than being a self-made entrepreneur and working to solve the pressing issues in education? Yet with all such communities borne from genuine idealism, lack of skepticism can lead to wasteful bubbles and long-term cynicism of ed-tech's potential.

Khan Academy continues to be gaining publicity and with each week or two, some new feature arises. Steve blogged earlier about how they are refining their algorithm for gauging mastery. I love Khan Academy and wish it continued success, yet I doubt whether it will actually revolutionize education, barring some radical change in their approach. 

If you look at the demographics of who is willing to spend time and other resources on education, it is typically those towards the top, the academically inclined and the wealthy. Yet among those competing for top spots at selective private schools and universities, performance on Khan Academy exercises serve as no more than a supplementary tool. How a student does on AP Exams, SATs, and extracurricular competitions carry much more weight in terms of earning valuable credentials that will lead to a secure high-paying job. These demographic groups are also not at the epicenter of the educational problems that plague this country. 

Now of course someone will point out that Khan Academy is making advances in terms of facilitating and promoting superior pedagaogical approaches as well as creating significant raw efficiency gains. I would agree to both but I would also throw caution to how impressive these advances really are. I'm not sure if Khan Academy is doing things so fundamentally different that it can turn C-students into A-students. On this point, I will allow the evidence to convince me. The efficiency gains are probably a tad overrated  because the credential weight of going to a highly selective school has to outweigh the benefits of saving money in learning content through Khan Academy. Remember, education isn't just a mechanism for human capital; it functions as a signal in the labor market.

On a final point, <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/16/salman-kahn-the-new-andrew-carnegie/">Annie Murphy Paul's piece in Time</a> probably best reveals the hype about Khan Academy. The reach Carnegie had on everyday lives was truly impressive. Khan Academy has the potential to reach out to everyone and yet the real question is who will take advantage of Khan Academy .
