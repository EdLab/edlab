            Duke University is the new name to the list of organizations and institutions <a href="http://www.rdmag.com/News/Feeds/2011/01/general-sciences-duke-joins-global-effort-to-boost-economics-educat/">aiming to better understand the global recession and changing the way aspiring economists are educated along the way.</a> The university's Center for the History of Political Economy has been awarded by a three year, $750K grant by the Institute of New Economic Thinking (INET), an organization heavily supported by billionaire George Soros. The center at Duke was launched in 2008 with the aim of promoting and supporting the teaching and research of economic thought. In its inaugural year, INET received over 500 applications from initiatives helping to promote its mission.  Only 34 applicants were selected and it awarded over $7 million towards those initiatives. Five Nobel laureates currently sit on the board for INET.

The grant will allow Duke's center to serve as one of four task forces by INET and the will provide the center to expand its program, workshop and lunch series, speaker series and annual conferences. The absence of a new generation of economic thinkers is one of the primary causes of the decline in economic thinking at universities across the world, according to Bruce Caldwell, an economics researcher at Duke. “As historians of thought retire, they are not being replaced, too many economists fail to recognize the importance of a knowledge of how their discipline developed, and, lacking that knowledge themselves, they do not realize that many of the questions being debated today in fact have long histories,” argues Caldwell.
