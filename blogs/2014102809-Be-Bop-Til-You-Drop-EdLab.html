            Does listening to music at work make you more or less productive? As much as I prefer to toil to the glorious sounds of absolute silence, recent research has inspired me to plug in and hit play. 

Mindlab International, on behalf of MusicWorks, challenged 26 participants to complete a series of action-oriented tasks over the course of 5 days. While doing so, they listened to one of 4 genres of music (or nothing at all). 

The results were surprising. For one, people who listened to nothing were found to make more mistakes! I would've thought the quiet would allow for more accuracy. Little did I know I've been making a mess of things for years. 

More highlights <a href="http://www.musicworksforyou.com/news-and-charts/news/269-music-hits-the-right-notes-for-business-success" target="_blank">from the study</a>:

<b>Classical music</b> helps you solve mathematical problems with accuracy. (You listening, Xiang?)

<b>Pop music</b> helps you improve your speed on those data entry tasks. It's also good for spell-checking accuracy!

<b>Ambient music</b> is best for people who are solving equations. 

<b>Dance music</b> was the genre linked to the highest overall accuracy and speed across a variety of tasks (solving equations, spell-checking, mathing). It's especially good for those of you who are proofreading.

So next time you hear sweet dance beats leaking out of BSweet's earphones, go ahead and marvel at his productivity. Better yet, ask him what he's listening to! 

What music puts you into a flow state? Do you go lyric-less or do you just need some Beyonce to get it done?
