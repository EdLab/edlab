          <p>
            With a host of colleges and universities now hosting some of its classes online, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131311934">historically black universities</a> are now also looking to use that medium to create new avenues for the universities and its students.  A 2007 study by the American Education Council concluded that black students comprised just 11% of all higher education enrollment but represented 21% of students at for-profit colleges, where most classes are offered online.

One of the major reasons black colleges are lagging behind in the online courses movement is most are tuition dependent as a result of low endowment and lack the infrastructure to create and maintain online courses. There are also concerns about whether black colleges, with low retention and graduation rates, even need an online platform for its students since most often advertise a personal and intimate environment for its students. 

Companies such as HBCUsOnline.com and Education Online Services are leading the efforts to put courses online for students at black colleges. Despite concerns about whether an online platform is needed, the aforementioned companies note they are targeting adult learners over 25 since they represent an ideal market: only 17.5% of blacks in that demographic has a bachelor's degree and most are working professionals looking for an avenue to continue their education and work full time.
