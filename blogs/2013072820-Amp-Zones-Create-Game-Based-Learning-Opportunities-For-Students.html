At <a href="http://www.pvschools.net/smhs/">Shadow Mountain High School</a> in Arizona, teachers and students have the ability to game in the media center using "amp zones" to support their curriculum.  These zones feature large-screen monitors with high-tech software and internet connections that provide access to lifelike simulations and educational games. The purpose of these amp zones is to facilitate game-based learning with the belief that if students are more interested in what they are learning, they will perform better. Because of the engaging aspect of the amp zones, students are motivated to compete in games that are challenging and conceptual, many at a college-level difficulty.  Teachers find that students aren’t leaving the amp zones even when class is over; instead, they continue by inviting friends to join during their lunchtime. <p>

When it comes to learning, are games the answer? What can we learn from Shadow Mountain’s Amp Zone experiment? Watch the video and <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9816">join the discussion</a> on Vialogues.  <p>

<b>@00:00 welmer:</b> How do amp zones prepare you for standardized tests? These are not computer games.  You still need the practice in reading a question and coming up with an answer. A textbook might help too. Where were the books for those kids in the video? <p>

<b>@00:41 mabel.zhuang:</b> The technology is awesome in its ability to engage and [its] interactive nature. However, I wonder about the schools that aren’t able to afford such state-of-the-art educational tools. <p>

<b>@02:39 dani100:</b> "Getting people involved in the amp zone to further their education and social life after school." <p>
