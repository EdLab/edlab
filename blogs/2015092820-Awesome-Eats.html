<p><a href="https://www.wholekidsfoundation.org/kids-activities/awesome-eats/">Awesome Eats</a> is a game developed by the <a href="https://www.wholekidsfoundation.org">Whole Kids</a> foundation to teach young players about how to nourish their bodies while also protecting the environment. The game focuses on sorting vegetables and fruits that whiz by on conveyor belts. The game fosters hand-eye coordination and quick thinking as well as an appreciation for nature’s harvest as players swipe the produce into the proper baskets. A bonus level requires the players to sort garbage into the correct recycling bins. The goal of this game is to get students to comprehend that their food choices and waste disposal affect both the nutrients and general health of their bodies as well as the overall "health" and state of the earth.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Between each level, a fact or tip about nutrition is offered to educate kids about good eating habits. This ensures that players don't just view the game as a healthier Candy Crush. Instead, they learn about the nutritional properties of food and how cutting down on certain foods improves their health as well as decreases harmful pesticide use.  The gameplay itself is captivating and will hold the student's interest even through the learning parts of the game. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Sometimes the game is difficult. The speed kicks into high gear in some of the more advanced levels while the conveyor belts switch directions and birds try to steal your produce. Although it does present a challenge, it can also be a bit frustrating for those without super speedy fingers.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>This game is entertaining and provides nutritional and environmental knowledge. By including facts about nutrition and health, the app’s creators cleverly educate players with information that players may not have sought out on their own. By making gameplay a kind of reward after learning a new fact, Whole Kids epitomizes one of the most effective ways to get students to learn through gaming. Blending knowledge with entertainment is Awesome Eats’s biggest strength. Although it would be an even better app if the gameplay itself also required some type of thinking about nutrition rather than just sorting produce for arbitrary reasons, this game is definitely worth checking out for anyone who wants to practice their mental speed and to learn about nutrition and our footprint on the environment at the same time.</p>
