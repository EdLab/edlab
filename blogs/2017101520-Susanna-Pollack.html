<p>Susanna Pollack is the President of <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org">Games for Change</a>, the leading global advocate for the power of games and virtual realities as drivers of social impact. In her role there, she produces the annual <a href="http://festival.gamesforchange.org">Games for Change Festival</a>, the largest gaming event in New York. This year she spearheaded their new <a href="http://festival.gamesforchange.org/festival/festival-vr-for-change">VR for Change Summit</a> as part of the Festival. Susanna works closely with organizations that are actively pursuing digital games to further their public mission. For clients, including American Express Foundation, United Nations, the Women's Sports Foundation, and the Smithsonian Museum, she has initiated dozens of programs to advance the games-for-good sector.</p>

<p>With a commitment to learning and education, Susanna also developed the Games for Change Student Challenge with the NYC Department of Education. The NYC pilot attracted world class partners including the New York Times, NYC Mayor's Office, ACLU, X Prize, and Unity Technologies to bring a game design challenge to middle and high school students across the city. This year the program is now scaling nationally. Prior to Games for Change, Susanna worked across both the commercial and public sectors. Over a 12 year period, Susanna held various senior level positions at BBC Worldwide Americas, and was most recently SVP of the TV Distribution Division for the U.S. She was also the SVP of BBC Worldwide Children’s Division where she led the strategy for all youth related initiatives in the U.S.</p>
 
<p><b>How has your education and previous professional experience shaped your current work as President of Games for Change?</b><br>
The connection for me is all about storytelling. As a young person, I loved reading books, writing fiction, and anything to do with the theater arts. I graduated from a small liberal arts college with a theater degree. While a life on the stage was not ultimately the career path for me, I found great satisfaction working in theater in nonprofit management, then moved to independent film, and finally ended up working in television. What drove me at each step of the way was the connection to storytelling on different platforms.</p>

<p>For 14 years I worked at the BBC where I was responsible for helping put together all the amazing BBC television programs that you see in the U.S. It was a great experience, and I got to work with some of the best storytellers in the world. About five years ago, I was introduced to interactive media and games. And it all came together for me. Games are the new way to tell stories and engage audiences with meaningful content, and I wanted to help these storytellers get their amazing work out there.</p>

<p>This led me to Games for Change. When I first joined, I was in charge of partnerships and business development, which allowed me to leverage my expertise in bringing projects together, raising money, and developing new opportunities for growth. Now, as President, I am responsible for all of that and more.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you believe that games and game development can impact social change?</b><br>
Like other forms of entertainment, games are a powerful medium for social change. Documentaries, dramas, books, art, and games; all can address social issues in an accessible format to the consumer. However, unlike other forms of media, games offer a level of interactivity for the player that allows for a different kind of experience. In a game, the player is given a sense of agency where they can direct the action of the story and impact the outcome.</p>

<p>We also look at the types of outcomes a social impact game can provide. A game can be used to educate, build awareness around an issue, help solve scientific problems through crowdsourcing, change behavior, and even improve cognitive behavior.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope that your work with Games for Change will impact the learning landscape at large? </b><br>
There are two ways we see the positive impact games can have on the learning landscape. First is the adoption of game-based learning in the classroom. Games have proven to be an effective conduit for teaching all kinds of subject areas from math, to social studies, to science and the humanities.</p>

<p>The second is using the practice of game design to develop STEM and 21st century skills. In addition to the fact that the making of a game is a great applied learning opportunity for students in computer science programs, the process of making a game helps students exercise skills like critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication.</p>
 
<p><b>What is next on the horizon for Games for Change?</b><br>
G4C is busy launching our 3rd annual G4C Student Challenge. The Challenge is an annual digital game design competition where middle and high school students create original games about real-world issues impacting their communities. By combining students’ passion for video games with civic problem solving, the Challenge advances STEM learning, digital storytelling, and empathy, and promotes acquisition of 21st-century skills. Each year, the Challenge reaches thousands of underserved students. In 2017–2018, the Challenge will take place in New York City and Los Angeles. Free game jams and workshops, game design courses, and after-school programs for underserved students, mentorship, and online resources contribute to the growth and career development of individual students, while enhancing the overall learning ecosystem of each city. The Los Angeles Challenge is supported by the Annenberg Foundation and hosted in partnership with Annenberg Learner.</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you follow on Twitter?</b><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a>! Lady Gaga’s foundation, <a href="https://bornthisway.foundation">the Born this Way Foundation</a>, is a theme partner on our Student Challenge where we invite students to design games around kindness and inclusion. I love her music and what it stands for!</p>
