<p><b>Title:</b> Discourse Patterns During Children's Collaborative Online Discussions  (2007)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Il-Hee Kim, Richard C. Anderson, Kim Nguyen-Jahiel, & Anthi Archodidou</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701413419#.U1lh-OZdWb8">Journal of the Learning Sciences</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What kinds of argument stratagems are found in online discussions, and are they the same as those in face-to-face discussions? Do argument stratagems spread among discussants in online discussions—that is, does snowballing occur—in the same way as in face-to-face discussions?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Discussion is a popular and important social learning activity. Collaborative reasoning is a discussion method in which participants address a controversial issue or a moral dilemma and present their arguments with reasons and evidence to persuade others. Unlike debate, it does not emphasize winning and losing, but rather encourages a collaborative search for solutions to the presented contentious issue or situation.  Many studies have demonstrated that a variety of argument stratagems emerge in face-to-face collaborative reasoning discussions and there is a snowball effect of the spread of argument stratagems within these discussions. However, less is known about whether and how discourse patterns appear and spread in online discussions.</p>

<p>57 fourth and fifth grade students from three socioeconomically dissimilar public schools participated in this study and were assigned to ten online discussion groups. During the six-week period, students interacted with their groups online and engaged in collaborative reasoning around dilemmas that were drawn from two class readings.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b> A variety of argument stratagems appeared in the online discussions in this study. Stratagems that make arguments explicit (e.g., express one’s position with supporting reasons) appeared frequently in these virtual communication environments. This might be due to the lack of nonverbal cues in text-based online communication, which creates a bigger need for this type of stratagem. In addition, once an argument stratagem was used in an online discussion, it was very likely to be adopted by other participants and used with increasing frequency. This snowball effect is similar to behavior observed in face-to-face discussions. Lastly, peers had greater influence than adult moderators in these discussions, and adult facilitators who assumed the role as an equal participant and made shorter, less didactic posts evoked the most responses from students. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Given the finding that argument stratagems emerged spontaneously in children's online discussions in this study, the authors suggest that phrase scaffolds aimed at prompting selected types of thinking and reasoning strategies should be optional or be used carefully to leave space for participants to create their own discussion strategies. The snowball effect of discourse patterns spreading and peer influence in online forums echo the broader trend of participatory culture in the social media world, and suggest that educators rethink their roles and approaches to effective facilitation in online communications.</p>
