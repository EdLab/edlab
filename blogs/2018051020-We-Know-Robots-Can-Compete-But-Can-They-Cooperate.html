<p>Spurred by the work of scientists, the media, and popular culture, the fear of AI surpassing human capabilities is pervasive in the 21st century. From autonomous cars to chess-playing robots, it sometimes feels that artificial intelligence is less of a help to humanity and more proof that we are doomed to be replaced. However, computer scientists at Brigham Young University have complicated this conversation by pointing out the need to learn from human-machine cooperation so that AI can develop the ability to create working relationships despite conflicting interests.</p>
 
<p>In order to understand the mathematics behind human cooperation better, and hopefully apply it to improve AI interaction and collaboration skills, researchers created an algorithm that could generate and respond to relevant signals that humans could understand. Taking into consideration how intuition, cultural norms, emotions, signals, and pre-evolved dispositions to cooperate factor into collaborative relationships, one of the unique things about the algorithm developed was its ability to employ "cheap talk," or playful and competitive remarks like, "in your face!" and "curse you!"</p> 

<p>After programming robots with the algorithm, the researchers conducted a series of three studies with 220 participants to determine the ability of the algorithm to create cooperative relationships. Over the course of 472 repeated two-player games, researchers ran through a series of machine-machine, machine-human, and human-human teams to see how well each type of group cooperated. Participants played the game on a computer and were therefore unaware of who their competitor was.</p>
 
<p>Results revealed that across all three types of games, the presence of cheap talk doubled the chances of mutual cooperation experienced, meaning AI was just as effective as human players in forging cooperative relationships when utilizing human behavioral and signaling strategies. In fact, many participants were unable to distinguish between the algorithm and a human player when engaged in the game. Even when not utilizing communication at all, AI was just as successful at achieving cooperative relationships, making machines generally more reliable in cooperative endeavors.</p>

<p>Not only do these results demonstrate the potential of AI to work alongside humans to find compromises, but the algorithm the researchers developed can help us learn more about how humans can improve cooperation. The study found that humans lied more frequently, and were generally less honest and loyal than robots, who have no behavioral reason not to compromise. Perhaps humans can learn a thing or two from robots when it comes to effectively working together.</p>
