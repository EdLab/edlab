<p>Kids become Internet Awesome with Google’s new Internet safety game <a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/interland">Interland</a>. Released in June of this year, Interland was designed to teach kids how to make smart decisions online, such as how to deal with cyberbullies, create strong passwords, and know who to trust. There are four islands on which players must complete different activities to become Internet Awesome: Kind Kingdom, Reality River, Mindful Mountain, and Tower of Treasure.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The games on Interland are fun, challenging, and well designed. But they’re more than just entertaining: many of the activities are direct enough that kids will come away from the game feeling like they’ve learned some important skills. I thought this was the case in particular with two of the games. The first, on Tower of Treasure, teaches kids how to create strong passwords that incorporate different letters and symbols, yet are still easy to remember. The second, on Reality River, quizzes players on who to trust online and who to block. This involved information on chain emails and sketchy messages asking for personal information, as well as how to tell if a site is secure.</p>

<p>Google also released a companion curriculum for Interland that aligns with ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) standards. This makes it easy to include in the classroom and can be a fun activity for young students to complete together. Also available are Internet Awesome pledges students can sign and Certificates of Awesomeness for completion.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While many of the skills tested in Interland seem directly transferable to real online activities, a few activities might not translate as seamlessly for children. For instance, in the Kind Kingdom, players are instructed to grab a microphone to report (and defeat) cyberbullies, but kids might have difficulty translating this slightly abstract task to actual social media platforms. I don’t at all think this makes the activity unimportant or unworthy of play, but I do think it means that teachers and parents might need to provide an extra level of explanation to secure this piece of knowledge for their kids.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Internet safety is incredibly important to teach, and Interland is a solid platform on which to do so. It’s a fantastic balance of entertaining and educational, hitting the sweet spot in what researchers call <i>invisible learning</i>. Whether in school or at home, parents and teachers who want their kids to be Internet Awesome should definitely check out Interland.</p>
