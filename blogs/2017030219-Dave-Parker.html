<p>Dave Parker is a serial entrepreneur who is currently the CEO of <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">Code Fellows</a>, an immersive and in-person code school that offers job-ready web and mobile software development training. Parker previously served as Senior VP Programs & Peoples for UP Global. He launched the Pay It Forward scholarship program, which funds opportunities for women, underserved minorities, and veterans. Parker holds a degree in communications from University of Washington.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Code Fellows?</b><br>
<p>My Bachelors degree is in Communications from the University of Washington. When I went to college it was a critical path to future success. Today, the promise of a degree doesn’t carry the same weight and we find ourselves in a market with a discontinuity of educational value. In startups, "discontinuity of information" creates opportunity and competitive advantage. I’m not sure the same is true in education. In today’s market, students overpay for college degrees that don’t help them get a job. I’m afraid that a liberal arts degree and the college experience may help you learn to "think better" but won’t help you get a job in the new economy.</p>
 <p>Consequently, I’m a big believer in lifetime learning and being a student of your industry or the industry you want to develop in your future career. You can never stop learning or the market will, in essence, lap you. The mechanics for learning are also changing in the short term; immersive programs have a huge benefit for adult learners. Online programs still offer tremendous opportunity, but the completion rates are abysmally low. I think there is still a convergence that needs to take place there.</p>
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Code Fellows will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I think it’s still too early to tell. Code schools, while having an early impact, have two significant challenges. The early impact can be tracked in two categories: reporting (placement rates and starting salaries) and challenges (accessibility and sustainability).</p>
<p>Reporting, or I should call it industry self-reporting, needs to start before federal regulators request it. We’ve been working with an industry group to lead how the top programs report on industry placement rates.</p>
<p>Placement rates are easy when schools start; you can help nearly all of your students get jobs. Over time, as that number grows, the law of large numbers will impact percentages. Also, programs like these aren’t for everyone. Even with a freshly minted set of technical skills, people who are socially awkward will still have significant challenges getting a job. The work of getting a job is still work. Also, middle-aged white guys, a category I am part of, still find it difficult to find work in a market that favors youth.</p>
<p>Starting salary is also a measure of program outcomes. No employer wants to hire junior talent. But access to talent is a huge challenge which means they do hire junior talent anyway. In hot hiring markets this continues to be true. It will be interesting to see the outcomes over time and in smaller markets that may favor startups versus large company hiring.</p>
<p>As for accessibility and sustainability, the industry has a challenge in that it’s still expensive and people who would want to pursue careers in tech are limited, given current funding mechanics. This is especially true for women, underserved minorities and veterans.</p>
<p>That is why we’ve invested over $600k in scholarships in the last year and committed $5M in scholarships over the next five years as part of the Tech Opportunity Fund we announced at the White House a few months ago.</p>
<p>Our industry has a lot of competition and new companies right now. So I’d say look for some consolidation in the coming year or two. We’re a state regulated industry, so we have to be licensed in all states where we provide classes. While Code Fellows is licensed as a code school, only about half of the other code schools currently in Seattle are licensed. That’s bad for consumer protection.</p>
<p>I don’t think the founders of ITT Tech started out with the intent to take federal money and jam people into student loans. Though, somewhere along the way, they slid that direction. Favoring profit over placement rate is a risky proposition.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>We still haven’t seen the impact of online learning yet. Today, only 3-5% of people complete an online course that they start. Immersive programming works, but isn’t accessible to a broad range of students because of costs. This is also true in underdeveloped markets. We have a group of developers from Africa coming in for the January cohort to upgrade their skills.</p>
<p>It seems like the low completion rates with online learning shouldn’t have to happen in the internet age, but it’s still a hinderance that hasn’t yet seen a breakthrough. Maybe Augmented Reality can help change that, where a headset can project our classmates around us and we can still learn together without travel and housing costs impacting the outcome.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Code Fellows, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>There are always side projects. I’m working on a book on entrepreneurship called Startup Proof. 90% of startups fail. The numbers are staggering. What should you know about your startup idea before you leave your day job? That’s the premise of the book, teaching the tools and information that can be known before you make a leap of faith to the great unknown.</p>
<p>Seasoned entrepreneurs don’t take risks at all costs, we mitigate the risks as much as possible prior. The challenge is that first-time entrepreneurs fall in love with their one and only (often bad) idea and can’t or won’t ask themselves the disciplined questions about viability. I hope the book will change the math.</p>
