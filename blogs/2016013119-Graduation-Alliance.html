<p><i>"In partnership with educators, economic development agencies and community leaders across the nation, Graduation Alliance provides versatile pathways to high school graduation, fosters college and career exploration, and connects job creators to skilled and ready workers."</i> (<a href="http://www.graduationalliance.com/about.html">About Graduation Alliance</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Making the Transition</b></p>

<p>Everyone’s educational pathway is different. <a href="http://www.graduationalliance.com/">Graduation Alliance</a> provides resources for those who are on a path that might not be so close to a traditional route—though with how much the education system continues to change, who’s to say what counts as "traditional" anymore? With Graduation Alliance, students who are looking for alternative education can find ways to learn through dropout recovery and alternative programming.</p>

<p>The Dropout Recovery program gives students local mentors and online classes so that they can work toward a high school diploma, while the Credit Recovery and Accrual program provides an expansive list of course offerings for students who need to fill course requirements in their path toward graduation. And, in the name of flexibility, Graduation Alliance also provides Alternative Programming for students who cannot attend school in the typical schedule that most schools demand. This model consists of coursework through a variety of districts and remedial curriculum best suited for each individual student.</p>

<p><b>Into the Workforce</b></p>
 
<p>However, despite these educational initiatives, sometimes a high school diploma is not enough to break into the workforce. With credential inflation, it can be difficult to find a job even after graduating. Graduation Alliance therefore also offers a Workforce Diploma, which can serve as an accredited addition to the resume of anyone who left high school before graduating. Through this and other programs, Graduation Alliance is offering a diverse set of resources for students looking for alternative education.</p>
