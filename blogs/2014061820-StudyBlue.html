<p><a href="http://www.studyblue.com/">StudyBlue</a> has a simple concept: it provides a space for students to share notes and obtain study materials from site-curated and student-created content. The site has a more global view than other collaborative cramming spaces like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/90">OpenStudy</a>; StudyBlue helps students connect across schools and classes to build a personal library of notes based around a subject rather than a specific course at their school. The site is also well-designed and pleasant, which means a lot for a tool that students are meant to use as frequently as they study.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>StudyBlue’s inclusive organization lets students connect via discipline rather than location, meaning that high school students taking the AP English exam are able to study together and share materials even if they are in different grades, classes, and locations. The site also creates content, providing study guides to every class that has more than three students. These guides contain the best of student-made flash cards and notes and can be purchased from the site so students can print or download them for offline use. The site’s features also include a progress bar, customizable sorting techniques for flash cards, and the ability to fork other student’s decks and adapt them.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>StudyBlue has stiff competition among collaborative study sites and their success depends on obtaining a critical mass of students at a particular school or in a particular discipline. The site has a bit of an advantage in that it is aimed at middle and high school students rather than the flooded college market. Their teacher ambassador program could further cement this niche.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>StudyBlue has all the functional components for effective flash card making and note sharing and a few extra features that make it easy to share and adapt content. The ability to study with students across the country might be particularly advantageous to middle and high school students as curricula become more standardized. StudyBlue should innovate in this area to align with the Common Core and partner with schools. A collaborative study solution aimed at younger students could be an exciting prospect.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>StudyBlue has the basics down and greater focus could make them a standard.</p>
