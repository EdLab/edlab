<p>When babies first learn to walk, they undeniably look a bit like zombies. Staggering about unsteadily, it may seem like their efforts are signs of pure inability, but a group of researchers recently wondered if babies’ early walking patterns might have something to teach robots. In a unique mixing of AI and infancy studies, these researchers trained soccer-playing robots to walk like babies in a series of simulated games to better understand the process of learning to walk while improving robot learning.</p>

<p>The researchers chose to use soccer-playing robots for their study because playing soccer tests functional locomotor performance; instead of simply repeating movements, soccer players, like infants, must learn to move in ways that are flexible and goal-driven in a continually changing environment. For this study, soccer-playing robots were trained on walking paths generated by 90 infants during free play and then set up to play a series of simulated games of "RoboCup," to better understand whether infants’ varied locomotive patterns are beneficial to learning to walk, or merely indicative of failed walking performance.</p> 

<p>Two simulated tournaments of RoboCup took place, with each eleven-player team competing in 1,000 head-to-head soccer matches. All players on a team were trained the same way, and each team competed in one ten-minute game to get a ball into the other team’s goal. In the first tournament, infant-trained teams squared off with teams trained on less varied geometric paths. In the second tournament, teams trained on different infant walking paths were compared, so that different combinations of path shape, step direction, number of steps, and number of starts and stops could be compared for effectiveness. Teams were ranked based on the number of goals scored relative to the number of goals conceded.</p>

<p>In the first tournament, the infant-trained team consistently won, losing less than 2% of the total number of games played. The team also achieved larger average goal differences across the tournament, clearly demonstrating this team’s superiority. In the second tournament, the team trained with the most varied locomotive path outperformed teams trained with less varied paths. The team with the greatest amount of variety in their movements won the most games and also demonstrated the highest average goal difference across the tournament. These results demonstrate that not only are seemingly sporadic, mistake-riddled walking patterns not fruitless but that they are beneficial to the success of infants in their quest to learn how to walk.</p>
 
<p>As the researchers point out, infancy and artificial intelligence researchers rarely think to benefit from each others’ findings, despite the fact that both are interested in developing systems that produce adaptive, functional behavior. This study shows that the fields of robotics and infant behavior have great potential to learn from each other. Robot learning and mobility just might be increased through taking a few tips from babies. </p>
