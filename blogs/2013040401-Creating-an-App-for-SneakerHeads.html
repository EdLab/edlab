          <p>
            For those who didn't know, I have been trying to collect sneakers for the past year. My collection has been mainly Jordans and Nike. Making the long lines and camping overnight in front of the store for a sneaker has made me think of how can I get the sneaker to someone who couldn't camp? 

My idea is to make an app for those who collect sneakers and aren't able to camp overnight or simply don't want to go through that kind of trouble. I would also like to be able to inform people what would be the next sneaker release, the day of release and if any store near them will have it along with the estimated price. I've seen a few apps for sneaker collectors but they do not have what I would want the app to focus on the most: not having to pay a hundred dollars or more for the sneakers before or after the release date. I would like to make it possible for people who are already camping to take an extra chair to hold a spot and charge for that spot. In the app, you can either be the person willing to hold a spot for someone so they can just come to the store at opening time or you can be the person looking for someone to do you that favor. 

I would like feedback on this idea or any questions you might have. What can I add? What can I take out? How could this be better? Also who can help me make this app since I have no experience with creating apps. Thank you.
