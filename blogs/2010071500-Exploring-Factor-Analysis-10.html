          <p>
            I had this idea that I might keep recording my research-related learning experiences here at the EdLab (as part of my "narrative inquiry" for research) during my doctoral study. I'm lucky that I've had great opportunities to be involved in a number of research projects here at the lab. The most recent project I have been working on is a pilot survey study.

The "quantitative" feature of a survey study might first sound overwhelming for a qualitative researcher like me. The self-observed change is that having taken intro and inter-medium level stats courses at Teachers College, my research belief has grown increasingly towards mixed-methods studies (although my dissertation will still focus on qualitative observational studies because of my data access). If there were large-sample sets available, I could see the great value of both 1) finding out the patterns of and relationship among identified variables, and 2) gaining an in-depth understanding from case studies of individual participants. I believe that quantitative and qualitative methods should complement each other and an overemphasis of either might lead to an "inequity" in research. It is easier for researchers to think about "diversity", "multiculturalism", and "educational equity", however, it might be hard to remember all the terms when we are in a "debate" that educational research should or should not be against studies that are generalizable and measurable.  Quantitative studies, to my understanding, can only be generalizable regarding major variables(identified factors).  It is like seeing a "map" with marked major destinations. Qualitative studies, on the other hand, help map viewers "zoom in" and see selected details within one specific destination. Either method is indispensable!

Factor analysis is crucial for making decisions about what are the survey items that should be removed/kept in a survey study. This analysis also tells whether or not questions should be added or reduced under different theme categories of a survey. For an exploratory purpose in a pilot study, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal component analysis (PCA) </a>can be conducted under each survey category to detect factor loadings of each survey item. All the analysis can be done in SPSS. Hair et al's (1992) work might be a classic book to read as it is also cited in a number of studies I have read.

After doing a correlation analysis along with the factor analysis by using survey results from a pilot study, we might know what questions in the original survey need to be expanded or reduced.

I'm truly seeing another research world and a lot of studies can be done. If I can find relationships among certain variables, I may further want to know why such relationships exist. In-depth qualitative studies might help.

Literature review of quantitative studies also gives me a different experience. Studies can be gathered together like "data", which can be displayed in a chart, comparing quantitative theoretical models, variables, and degrees of relationships/predictability. A more advanced version might be a meta-analysis.

Maybe, literature review of qualitative studies can also be treated as "data analysis", detecting different themes, theories, and findings, then trying to make connections and new categorizations.
