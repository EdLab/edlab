            <b>Has the LMS gone too far?</b>

The latest blackboard app posts (see <a hre="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2609">here</a> and <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2603">here</a>) got me thinking. While my LMS experience is limited to Moodle, BlackBoard, and Classweb, I think I have seen enough to make some suggestions. Actually, <a href="http://elearningweekly.wordpress.com/2009/03/20/have-lmss-jumped-the-shark/">one blogger</a> took the words right out of my mouth when he said, <blockquote>“I constantly hear people (across many organizations) complain about their learning management system (LMS). They complain that their LMS has a terrible interface that is nearly unusable. Upgrades are difficult and cumbersome. Their employees' data is locked in to a proprietary system. Users hate the system. It's ugly. (Did I miss anything?) </blockquote> 
They <i>are</i> pretty unattractive to look at.  What's more is that I have been trying to comprehend the hubbub surrounding the social interactivity of them.  I've created courses on Moodle and added wikis and blogs and thought... what's the advantage of putting a blog here?  Will people actually use this wiki?  Maybe I'm being too critical... but I have never actually seen anyone use the chat or forum functions in an LMS.  Others may be questioning the addition of such socially based activities, as well; the next move for LMSs seems to be an integration with other systems that offer educational management, such as  Microsoft's <a href="http://www.bersin.com/Blog/post/SharePoint-and-the-LMS---Time-to-Converge.aspx">SharePoint.</a>

I think BlackBoard's recent move to the iTunes app store was a step in the right direction.  It's a useful way for students and teachers to engage with the LMS and doesn't [seem] to give either party sensory overload.  I guess if I could give Blackboard any advice, it would be <i>[cue Full House meaningful moment music]</i> you can't be all things to all people.  Sometimes it's better to just be the best at what you are expected to do…
