World-renowned educator, Dr. Arthur Levine, has spent most of his career pushing for change.  So it is not surprising that his most recent work at the<a href=" http://www.woodrow.org"> Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation</a> is focused on transforming the education sector. With an ambitious agenda to revamp teacher education and school leadership, we had the opportunity to connect with Dr. Levine for an exclusive NLT interview to find out more about his twofold approach of repair <i>and</i> replacement. <p>
<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b>
<p>
<b>Question: </b>What are you currently working on at the Woodrow Wilson Foundation? <br>

<b> Answer: </b>Our repair efforts focus on existing universities, and the areas we are most concerned about now are teacher education and school leadership. So what we are doing is going state by state, - Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and New Jersey—working with governors, state legislators, chief state school officers, unions, schools, philanthropists, businesses, and with that coalition we are trying to recruit wonderful people to become teachers and have universities in the state transform what they are doing in teacher education. On the school leadership front, we are trying to remake the degree structure and move from the traditional M.Ed. and Ed.D, which have been widely documented as poor in quality, and create a new degree, an MBA in school leadership, which we hope will be a rigorous, terminal degree that will replace the existing models.
<p>
<b>Question: </b> How do you think the current work you are doing will change the learning landscape? <br>

<b> Answer: </b>This is a time in which opportunities for change are extraordinary. It’s basically an era that if you can dream it, you can try it. For me the focus is education schools. We are working on changing already existing institutions and newly created ones, and we are working on changing the policy environment that surrounds them. 
<p>

<b>Question: </b> What are some trends that will have the most impact on learning in years to come? <br>

<b> Answer: </b> I think the largest change we are going to experience is a change in our philosophy, or vision of what education is about. We are moving from a focus on teaching to a focus on learning, shifting from an emphasis on process to outcomes, from one size fits all to individualization, demanding more technology. <p>


<b>Question: </b> Can you talk about how your professional experience has informed the work that you are doing now? <br>

<b> Answer: </b>Two experiences at Teachers College stand out for me. One was an effort to create Teachers College Innovations, an on-line professional development program for teachers, which wasn’t a successful initiative, but boy did I learn a lot in terms of prospects for a digital future. We got to work with publishers, educators, and venture capitalists, and it really opened up a whole new world for me. And the second thing is, I did a series of reports (<a href="http://www.edschools.org/">The Education Schools Project</a>) on the condition of education schools, which was critical of the work they are doing now. Together these initiatives allowed me to see where we are and to glimpse the potential future. 
<p>
<b>Question: </b> How did your educational trajectory affect your current work? <br>

<b> Answer: </b>Probably my greatest strength is the ability to knit together different literatures and trends to see emerging issues. It isn’t simply reading in the field I know. I’ve always tried to read at the cutting edge of what I can understand.
<p>
I remember visiting the University of Phoenix in 1995. And thinking "Oh my God this is the future," which led me to read everything I could about emerging technology… Maybe it is historical reading that’s mattered most. For a long time, for example, I read everything I could about the industrial revolution... I have been fascinated by periods of change.
<p>
<b>Question: </b> If you had to give words of advice to those thinking about the future of education and learning, what would it be? <br>

<b> Answer: </b> There are a couple of different things. One is, the education paradigm is going to change. Think about paradigm change. Think about the switch from teaching to learning. Don’t be limited by existing structures. Use your imagination. Anything you dream could be a reality today.
