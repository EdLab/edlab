          <p>
            <a href="http://www.phorm.com/about/">Phorm</a> is a digital technology company which builds users' profile by scanning for keywords on all websites visited by the user and using that information to suggest ads. The source of the constant debate surrounding Phorm centers on how a user gives content and is yet another saga in the ongoing debate about user privacy online. Users can opt not to use Phorm, all the sites they visited will still be collected by Phorm though it will not use it to suggest ads.

The debate around Phorm grew louder when Open Rights Group (ORG) wrote a letter to some of the top firms, e.g. Google, Yahoo, and Amazon, asking them to block Phorm from building user profiles on their sites. In the letter, ORG cites “very significant concerns” from users about how Phorm collect and track their online habits. ORG's letter also noted that Phorm will not just track users' behaviors on commercial websites but personal information someone put on their Facebook page, blogs or personal websites will be used to create a profile for a visitor to that site. 

<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7999635.stm">Amazon</a> recently became the first major company to publicly announce it will not allow Phorm to scan its pages to recommend ads for its users. Amazon did not cite any specific reasons for its decision but ORG is hoping Amazon's action will lead to more companies opting out of Phorm. Phorm's legal problems are also about to get deeper. The European Commission is in the process of starting legal proceedings against the UK (which has legally cleared Phorm of any wrongdoing in its data collection) over its data protection laws as it pertains to Phorm.
