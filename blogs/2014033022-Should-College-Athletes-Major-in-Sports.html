            One of the hardest things for some college students is choosing a major. Students are usually confused as to what their heart desire and what major would provide them with career and financial security. This <a href="http://keepingscore.blogs.time.com/2012/11/27/should-jocks-just-major-in-sports/">article</a> sheds more light on this current discourse. As expected, a large majority of student athletes aspire to turn professional in their respective sport. As a result, parents and friends of student athletes heavily support them and always want to see them make it to the professional level. 

One of the main issues is that these students are not provided the same opportunities as students who major in fields of their interests such voice, theater and music. According to the aforementioned piece, college athletes should also be able to major in courses that have to do with their respective sports. Colleges have to make an effort to design academic programs that will enable college athletes to major in courses related to their respective sport. This way after college or after playing at the professional level in their respective sport, they can still work in the field in another capacity.

This article has a point in the sense that student athletes should be provided opportunities to learn more about their sport. Most athletes end up unemployed after retiring from sports at the professional level because they might have taken a major they were not interested in while they were in college. In this case, they are not motivated to pursue a career in their major. As a college athlete, I would rather major in "soccer" and either become a soccer analyst, reporter or manager of a soccer club than major in something that might not be too beneficial to me because of the lack of interest I have for that particular major.
