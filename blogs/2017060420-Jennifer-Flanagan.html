<p>Jennifer Flanagan is the co-founder, President, and CEO of <a href="http://actua.ca/en">Actua</a>, a national charitable organization that engages Canadian youth in inspiring and innovative science and technology experiences. Flanagan has served on the boards of several local, national, and international groups that are committed to furthering educational opportunities for youth and women. In 2007, she was named one of Canada's Top 100 Most Powerful Women and in 2011 she was the recipient of a Y Women of Distinction Award (Education and Training) and was named one of Ottawa's Top Forty Under 40. She holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of New Brunswick and a Master of Management from McGill University in Montreal.</p>
<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Actua?</b><br>
<p>I was extremely lucky to have had an excellent K–12 education where I was encouraged to pursue high-level science and math courses in high school. I also grew up with a father who was an engineer so I was aware of the opportunities in that field. It was during my first summer in university that I had the chance to travel around the province of New Brunswick to deliver science workshops and camps that I realized how many youth, especially those from rural and Indigenous communities, were not being exposed to hands-on STEM. We also saw far fewer girls registering in the summer camps, which was also shocking to me. These early experiences, combined with research that confirmed the lack of representation of many of these groups in STEM fields, greatly influenced Actua’s two-decade long focus on inclusivity and diversity.</p>
 
<p><b>What has been the response from students who have participated in some of Actua's workshops and other experiences?</b><br>
<p><p>The response from participants is always the same: they love it! Kids are naturally curious and adventurous and so eager to learn. Of course, there are youth that come into the programs thinking they don’t like science, but their minds always change when they learn about how science is connected to things that are important in their lives.</p>
 
<p>Above all else, we work to create a safe space where youth can take risks, problem solve, fail, and try again; all knowing that they won’t be graded at the end of the day. We reinforce the message that failure is what leads to innovation and it is one of the best ways to learn and advance in STEM.</p>
 
<p>For many of the participants, attending an Actua program is often the first hands-on STEM experience they have had and for many, the first time they have met a <i>real life</i> scientist. This is an absolutely critical part of the experience. Youth need to be able to interact with and relate to these mentors so that they can start to imagine themselves in these fields in the future.</p> 
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Technology is having a positive disruptive effect on all aspects of our lives and this certainly holds true for education and learning. We are seeing a lot of focus on coding in Canada right now, including unprecedented investments by the federal government in a new $50 million <i>Teaching Kids to Code</i> fund. Actua has increased its focus and development of digital content by partnering with Google on a national digital skills building program called <a href="http://www.codemakers.us/">Codemakers</a>, which in its first two years has engaged over 80,000 youth.</p>
 
<p>While the word <i>coding</i> itself has become very trendy, it is critical to not look at it in isolation. Our work focuses on computational thinking and problem solving and integrates coding as one tool to help build solutions and innovate. Digital skills have become a basic literacy.</p> 
 
<p><b>What were some initial challenges in starting Actua and how did you overcome them?</b><br>
<p>Initially our challenge was in getting people to buy-in to the importance of engaging youth in STEM at a very early age. The corporate sector understood this right away and invested in our programs early. The critical importance of early engagement is now widely accepted and this has provided a significant boost to our work.
 
<p>We have been very lucky to have had excellent network members, partners, and sponsors that have helped us grow. One of our major challenges now is how to grow fast enough to meet the huge demand for our programs across Canada.</p> 

<p><b>What is next on the horizon for Actua?</b><br>
<p>Actua is continuing to grow across Canada. We are currently in over 500 communities covering every province and territory and annually engaging over 250,000 youth. We have big plans for growth: growing both our geographic footprint and also deepening the impact of our programs through longer-term engagement programs with youth. Our focus on engaging the hardest to reach youth in Canada will only continue to get stronger. Other areas of growth include teacher training, parent engagement, and high school internships.</p>
