          <p>
            I was reading an <a href ="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/education/columbia-actively-recruits-veterans.html?_r=1&ref=education"> article</a> on the New York Times about how Columbia University's dean of admissions began recruiting veterans at military bases in an effort to increase the amount of veterans in their student body. The article goes on to compare an average 18 year old Ivy League applicant with these veterans. Surprisingly it was reported that veterans are less aggressive than the normal 18 year old applicant, but don't forget that our men and women in uniform are very disciplined for the most part. I also ran into another <a href ="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/11/11/student-veterans-do-better-peers-when-given-support-services"> article</a> on the subject of veterans in higher education, it looks there's a growing trend in colleges seeking out veterans. 

From the report <a href ="http://www.pattillmanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Completing-the-Mission.pdf"> “Completing the Mission: A Pilot Study of Veteran Students' Progress Toward Degree Attainment in the Post 9/11 Era,”</a> we see that student veterans earn an average GPA of 3.04, and they have a 94% retention rate from Fall 2010 to Spring 2011. This data can hopefully convince more colleges to recruit veterans, since some colleges might not seek them out because of mental health risks as some veterans may have post traumatic stress disorder, among others. Although it's not enough to get these veterans into schools, they will also need support throughout their school years because if a veteran drops out then they would lose some of their <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill"> G.I. Bill benefits</a>, which includes a housing allowance.  As more veterans are coming back home, I hope more Ivy League schools will follow Columbia's lead and help our veterans, who want to go back to school, and receive the good education they deserve.
