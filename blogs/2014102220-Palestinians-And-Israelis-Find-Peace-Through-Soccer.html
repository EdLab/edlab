As recent events have reminded us, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one that affects both sides, especially young people. With the region experiencing a youth population boom, finding a long lasting solution to the conflict has gained greater importance. There are several programs in the region to foster understanding and empathy for the now 60-year-old conflict. One of these programs is the Peres Center for Peace, named and founded by former Israeli Prime Minister and Nobel laureate Simon Peres. The Center is using the world’s most popular sport to ensure that the next generation of Israelis and Palestinians has a genuine shot at peace. <p>

As the most popular sport in the world, soccer appeals to almost every demographic. As such, the Center uses soccer’s broad appeal as a platform for Israeli and Palestinian children to build cross-cultural understanding. Despite geographical and political barriers, children and their families from both sides are able to engage in play and conversation on and off the field. Soccer is one of several educational programs the Center has or plans to have for Israeli and Palestinian children and their families. The hope is that the program will offer the children a solid platform on which to build a sustainable peace as they enter adulthood. <p>

Can the success of this program be replicated in other conflict zones (e.g., Kashmir, Sudan)? What other activities can lead to cross cultural understanding? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16938">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>03:19 Nantwi:</b> The "political atmosphere" is the seemingly endless bouts of attacks by perpetrators on both sides of the conflict. The conflict has made the area a power keg as it is subject to full-scale war at any given moment. <p>

<b>03:52 JordaJean:</b>  Oh this brings up an interesting question. I wonder to what extent that the families of the soccer players feel a peace/resolution towards the other side. Seems like it could breed great understanding.
