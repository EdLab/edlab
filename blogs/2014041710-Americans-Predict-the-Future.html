<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/04/17/us-views-of-technology-and-the-future/">Pew Research (Internet Project) recently released a fascinating study</a> focused on American's views of future tech advances. Although technology and scientific innovation are overwhelmingly viewed as potentially positively impacting future life, Americans still have doubts about certain advances (designer babies, drones etc.). Interestingly, education and learning are not mentioned. Will "learning" be so ubiquitous as to make traditional learning obsolete? Will the brain implants predicted become an augmented learning device? Only time will tell. Most surprising to me is the negative view of wearable devices (& implants) that provide constant "information about the world around them." Not surprising, if you are keeping abreast of the disturbing <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/05/us/massachusetts-upskirt-photography/">"upskirt" debacle,</a> but women are the most skeptical of these devices. 

<b>Highlights of the study listed above:</b> 

-Some 59% are optimistic that coming technological and scientific changes will make life in the future better, while 30% think these changes will lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are today.

-81% expect that within the next 50 years people needing new organs will have them custom grown in a lab

-51% expect that computers will be able to create art that is indistinguishable from that produced by humans

-39% believe scientists will have developed the technology to teleport objects

-33% expect that humans will have colonized planets other than Earth

-19% of Americans expect that humans will be able to control the weather 

-6% think it would be a change for the worse if prospective parents could alter the DNA of their children to produce smarter, healthier, or more athletic

-65% think it would be a change for the worse if lifelike robots become the primary caregivers for the elderly and people in poor health

-63% think it would be a change for the worse if personal and commercial drones are given permission to fly through most U.S. airspace

-53% of Americans think it would be a change for the worse if most people wear implants or other devices that constantly show them information about the world around them (Women are especially wary of a future in which these devices are widespread)

Are you surprised by any of these findings? If so, which ones?
