<p>Infographics defy disciplinary boundaries and media categorizations with every conceivable type  found practically everywhere online. Teaching students to interpret scientific multimodal infographics is difficult, and creating them even more so. There is little research available to assist interested teachers who want to help their students learn to understand the ongoing deluge of visualizations in the scientific realm, let alone make their own. A recent study addresses this issue by identifying constituent components of science infographics to assist in instructional settings. </p>
 
<p>The research question investigated how different groups of visualization experts approach the critical appraisal of science infographics. A group of ten cross-disciplinary specialists provided graphic design insights on six infographics. An inductive analysis of transcripts resulted in five categories regarding the use and creation of science infographics: (1) purpose or message of the infographic, (2) how the visualization addresses an audience, (3) quality of organization and design, (4) use of semiotic and visual representation, and (5) quality of data and information sources. These categories were further subdivided along broader dimensions, including:  (1) overall purpose of the infographic, (2) appraising the content that is incorporated into the design, and (3) how <i>representation</i> is conveyed through the form and tools used.</p>
 
<p>The study draws explicit connections to science education and science communication and  makes suggestions for future research. The authors suggest that similar studies should be conducted to combine the multimodal discourse and inscription of infographics with science. They further advocate that teachers should engage in read-alouds and think-alouds regarding purpose, content, and representation to deepen student understanding. </p>
 
<p>The authors also suggest that classrooms engage in more sophisticated types of infographic design and construction. This would include re-visualizing an existing infographic in alternative ways for organizing and representing content. By having educators suggest that class members play the role of data journalists, students can explore issues of personal interest, family concerns, and community problems to foster direct impact on their lives that would presumably deepen learning and student engagement. By learning the skills to critically interpret scientific infographics, students can learn to better navigate the visual world that surrounds them. </p>
