<p><b>Title:</b> Preschoolers’ Selective Learning is Guided by the Principle of Relevance (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Annette M.E. Henderson, Mark A. Sabbagh, & Amanda L. Woodward<p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The first years of childhood are a time of intensive language learning. Studies have shown that young children use their judgment of the speaker and circumstance to evaluate the validity of new vocabulary and selectively learn words that are likely to be correct. Because children tailor their learning to the perceived accuracy of a new word, it may be possible that they also evaluate the potential relevance of a new word before learning. <a href="http://woodwardlab.uchicago.edu/Publications_files/Henderson,Sabbagh,Woodward%20Cognition%202012.pdf">Preschoolers’ Selective Learning is Guided by the Principle of Relevance</a> investigated vocabulary learning in preschool-age children to discover whether young children select vocabulary based on potential relevance to their daily life.</p>
 
<p>The researchers conducted two studies. In both, 4-year-olds were taught the name of an unfamiliar toy that they were told was purchased either nearby or far away. The testing group was made up of 24 monolingual English-speaking children, primarily of Caucasian descent. The first study showed that children who were told the toy was purchased nearby learned the vocabulary, but those who were told it was purchased far away did not. In the first study, the participants’ memory for the link was assessed by a speaker who was not present when it was taught. To eliminate a potential retrieval-cue problem, the researchers conducted a second study in which the participants were tested by the same speaker who had taught them the word.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Even controlling for the speaker, the researchers found that children who were told that the toys were purchased nearby tended to learn the word–referent link and children who were told the toys were from far away did not. The findings suggest that relevance is a selection factor in 4-year-olds’ word learning. The participants preferred to acquire new word meanings that would have communicative utility in their linguistic community. These findings provide the first evidence that children’s selective word learning is driven by the principle of prospective relevance.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Curiously, the existing literature also shows that children readily learn words from foreign languages. The authors believe that children’s selective learning in the study was based on proximity and potential use and did not indicate a bias against the unfamiliar. The clear lesson for the educational technology community is that word-reference links are useful for vocabulary learning in preschool children, but only if they appear relevant. Promoting relevance in word learning could improve the content of word selections in content targeting young children, and vocabulary lessons in general might have a greater impact if they connect to the student’s everyday life.</p>
