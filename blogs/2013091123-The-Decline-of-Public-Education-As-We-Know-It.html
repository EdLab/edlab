          <p>
            In today's EdLab seminar, the founders of the <a href="http://www.odysseyinitiative.org/">Odyssey Initiative</a> focused a lot on what they perceived as best practices from classrooms across different states and countries, all of which they plan to incorporate into their soon to be charter school. I am taking an Ed and Public Policy class here at TC this semester with Professor Amy Wells and a large chunk of the discussion on the first day of class revolved around the expanding the role of charter schools as an option for many parents and its implications for broader public education in the country. In our small groups, we were asked to discuss whether we think there is even a long-term future for public education in light of this growing trend. For the record, our group agreed there is still hope for public education (more on that in a later blog).

<a href="http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/13256-the-ghettoization-of-public-education">This article</a> sheds some light and harsh criticism on how charter schools (through legislation) are essentially becoming a for profit business taking money out of public schools and should the trend continue, signal the eventual decline and doom of public education, leaving it to rot like our other “public” institutions (i.e. housing and hospitals) that affect predominantly poor, crime-ridden, and minority neighborhoods.
