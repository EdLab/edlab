            For centuries, scholars have vigorously debated over a central question-- How do we spark creativity, curiosity, and wonder in children?
Today most students graduate from college and yet cannot find a job because students are just being taught about what is relevant enough for landing a job. In the olden days, they assembled an education system to mass-Produce workers with identical skills. Plucked from the classroom and put instantly into the system, citizens were churned through an educational factory engineered for maximum productivity. Schools today are the product of an expired age; standardized curricula, outdated teaching methods, and old textbook assessments. Schools still operate as if all knowledge is contained in books and as if the salient points in books must be stored in each human brain to be used when needed. 
Students are rewarded for memorization, not imagination or resourcefulness; we need to seriously think of a best way to teach our children. We need a curriculum of big questions, examinations where children can talk, share and use the Internet, and new peer assessment systems. We need a teaching method free from fear and focused on the magic of children's in-built quest for information and understanding so they can think for themselves.
We are far too behind and itâ€™s about time that need think of better way to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sugata-mitra/2013-ted-prize_b_2767598.html?utm_hp_ref=education-technology "> educate students </a>for challenge the future holds.
