<p>In the digital age, all things historic can feel prehistoric to youth. When kids turn on and tune into their digital future, they tend to drop out of the analog past, including history and other important subjects. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/history-line/id393452083?mt=8">History Line</a> helps connect students to historical topics using a collaborative app-based learning game. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>History Line asks players to place a series of monumental events along a timeline to create an accurate historical sequence. History is covered over three distinct time periods: Early Explorers and Settlers, Colonial Growth and American Revolution, and A Nation is Born and Expands Westward. This app is strictly a simple drag-and-drop affair where short text descriptions of historical events are bounded within rounded icons that are moved around the interface to their correct chronological location. </p>

<p>Gameplay is as straightforward as it goes in both single and multiplayer forms. If you choose the latter, multiple history buffs can connect to their iPads using Bluetooth, and each young historian becomes responsible for one portion of this timeline of the past. In multiuser mode, players move simple event icons unfit for their period away from their portion of the timeline, which allows others to help correctly construct their own historical period. Once you are done, this back-and-forth between players eventually creates one continuous timeline across two to six iPads. History Line’s greatest strength is that it involves two main modes of gameplay, single player and group, which allows it to appeal to different learning styles. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>If you find that your students perceive history as a little boring, History Line may have only relieve this boredom in a small way. In a world of fantastically immersive multimedia experiences, tricked out augmented reality, and 360 degree virtual reality, History Line feels like a step into the proverbial Dark Ages when it comes to apps. Beyond a pleasant sound when players arrange an event in its proper order, there appears to be nothing else besides dragging, dropping, and eventually from frustration, possibly some snoozing, especially if it takes you a while to make your timeline right. </p>
 
<p>Maybe more problematic than the spartan interactivity, student success could be a function of simple repetition rather than historical know how. If you play the game long enough, you will eventually succeed. There is no fixed time element to make players finish quickly, and more disappointingly, there is no encouragement to prompt learning, such as a magnetic pull to bring a student selection into the proper part of the timeline. As such, if you aren’t deeply familiar with these historical time periods, this app won’t likely help. To unnecessarily complicate matters, the timeline is both too long and events often overlap within the same year. For example, in Colonial Growth and the American Revolution, no events of note occur between either 1701 and 1750 or 1777 and 1784, while a whopping four events occur during 1777 alone, making game play unintuitive. </p> 
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>History Line is an overly stripped down app that takes away some of the shine from the infinitely fascinating world of history. This app absolutely begs for a History Line 2.0 update, but until then, I’d suggest young historians find another app or make a retreat back to ye olde history books. </p>
