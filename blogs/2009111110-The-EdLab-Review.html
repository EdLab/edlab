            Wondering what happened to [the EdLab review/ the CSG review] after the D&R meeting last week? Here is a brief reminder of what it is and links to examples and a template we'll use to kick start <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3425>our own CNET review for educational technology</a>. 

<b>Why review?</b>
This project began from the need to create a repeatable format for evaluating new video-based discussion tools. Then it quickly became apparent that all D&R team members also, at some point, investigate various EdTech products and services or research emerging trends for their projects. [The EdLab Review] therefore aims to do two things simultaneously: 1) build our 'group knowledge' database more effectively and 2) engage outside audience by broadcasting EdLabber's insight. The latter goal of building a readership is a mid-term goal. For now, we'll have to use this blog space and keep on designing the best review format and delivery/sharing method. Branding, in this case, is a process.  

<b>Whose our audience?</b>
Teachers, school administrators, and parents who are contemplating about which web/hardware/software tool to use in their classrooms and at home. 

<b>Who will be doing the review and how?</b>
Anyone at the Lab who is interested in reviewing and peer-reviewing. At this point, we'll have 1 reviewer and 1 peer-reviewer for each review entry made. Zhou, Ting, and I revised the format ver.1 and made <a href=http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AodyR3euBN7BdGRYT01FUGc5SUJkYzFxbXhRdXBDdWc&hl=en>a full review template</a> to begin with. We'll roll out as many reviews as we can in the coming weeks using the format as attached. But our hope is that we'll write do this regularly so that we can build trust with our readers AND also do other exciting things like redesigning the CSG website to support this particular format. 

<b>We are still searching for more ideas regarding...</b>

1) Name of our review: it's been called the CSG review then the EdLab review, any suggestions?

2) Name of the three most important points in our review summary: "The Good," "The Bad," and "The Bottom Line" is what the CNET does. 

3) Small logo.
