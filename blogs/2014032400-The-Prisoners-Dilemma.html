          <p>
            The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/">prisoners dilemma</a> is a hypothetical game that can explain why people sometimes don't work together even when it's beneficial to do so. It's basically a long way of explaining that people don't like to been used. Why should I? What would be the point? A favorite example is in game theory, which shows why co-operation is difficult to achieve even when it is mutually beneficial. For instance, two prisoners have been arrested for the same offense and are held in different cells. Each has two options: confess, or say nothing. There are three possible outcomes. One could confess and agree to testify against the other as a state witness and receive a light sentence while his fellow prisoner receives a heavy sentence. They can both say nothing and if lucky, receive light sentences or even acquitted due to lack of firm evidence. They can both confess and receive lighter individual sentences. The second outcome would be the best for both prisoners. However, the RISK that the other might confess and become a state witness is likely to encourage both to confess, landing both with sentences that they might have avoided had they remained silent.

There are a lot of examples of people working together seemingly with no real personal benefit like giving to charity or contributing to Wikipedia. Some people give, others just free ride. But when we start talking about people's livelihoods, rather than their spare change or time, people tend to be more personally oriented. The key to solving it is changing the structures to account for individual incentives. In an oligopoly, citizens often behave like the prisoners: not setting prices as high as they could do if they trusted the other firms not to undercut them. As a result, they are worse off.
