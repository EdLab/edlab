<p>Even though new technologies to enhance student learning are constantly cropping up, they aren’t always successful at helping students develop a coherent and holistic understanding of new material. Technological tools often feature more abstract representations of concepts simply because they are intangibly behind the screen. Due to this rift between the physical and the virtual, four researchers set out to find ways to bridge that gap.</p>
 
<p>At the forefront of this study is something called Frame technology—a computer simulation paired with sensors to allow users to interact with <i>physical</i> objects in a way that directly impacts the <i>virtual</i> world. Students in this study employed a variation called the Gas Frame, which uses temperature, pressure, and force sensors hooked up to a jar of hot water, a syringe, and a spring. As students fiddle with each object, they directly affect the molecules shown on the screen. For example, pressing the syringe will cause the simulation to add gas molecules to the virtual space.</p>
 
<p>In this study, many methods of testing and data collection were used. In some tests—such as the one on the relationship between temperature and pressure—students who used the traditional sensor-based lab performed as well as those who used the Gas Frame. However, in other questions—such as one on pressure in enclosed containers and another on the relationship between temperature and volume—the students who used the Gas Frame performed better.</p>
 
<p>Could mixed virtual reality labs provide students with an integrated approach to learning more abstract scientific concepts like gas laws? The researchers behind this study think so, and they highlight the power in providing students with the opportunity to physically interact with a phenomenon or mechanism. Without that personal method of exploration, students may not be able to piece together the complex fragments that are supposed to make up gas laws or any other concept in a challenging science class.</p>
