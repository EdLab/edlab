Margolis, J., Estrella, R., Goode, J., Holme, J. J., & Nao, K. (2008).<i><a href=" http://www.amazon.com/Stuck-Shallow-End-Education-Computing/dp/0262514044/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330117425&sr=8-1"> Stuck in the shallow end: Education, race, and computing.</a></i> Cambridge: The MIT Press.

The digital divide, the gap between the technology haves and have nots, has drawn people's attention since late 1990s when the National Telecommunications and Information Administration used this term in the title of its national survey. Scholars have been warning that it is not only the availability of technology and devices, but also human and social resources that determine the digital inequality (Warschauer, 2003). In this book, Margolis et. al (2008) add a new dimension–racially biased beliefs–to the understanding of digital inequity.

In this study of computer science courses in three urban high schools in Los Angeles, Margolis and her colleagues (2008) found that schools systematically offered unequal learning opportunities of computer science education to students based on their racial and/or demographic backgrounds. In two urban schools where the majority of the student population is African American or Latino/a, only "cut-and-paste" types of basic computer science courses were available. These two schools were "technologically rich yet curriculum poor" (p.14). In another integrated school that is located in a wealthy community where two-thirds of students are black or Latino/a, advanced computer science courses, including Advanced Placement (AP), were available yet low expectations and racially biased beliefs in this school resulted in a disproportionately low enrollment of African American and Latino/a students in these advanced courses. Thus, instead of serving as an equalizer, schools exacerbate the gap of computing knowledge between those from historically disadvantaged backgrounds and their wealthier counterparts.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
EdLab's efforts to build more powerful, accessible, and less costly learning models and environments echo the ideal of digital equity. The cultural aspect of technology practices could be another dimension that enriches our future design of education innovation and helps us develop differentiated strategies to engage various social groups in our new learning environments.
