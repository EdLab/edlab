<p>It may surprise you to know that IMAX has been around since the late 1960s. This motion picture company has spent years venturing into the roughest terrain on Earth, bringing stunning images back to the masses in three dimensions. Yet despite our adoption of 3D technology in movie theaters, museums, science centers, planetariums, and even the comfort of our own homes courtesy of Oculus Rift, we have little research regarding its pedagogical impact. This is stunning given that science centers have used 3D films to appeal to visitors for decades. </p>
 
<p>An experimental study designed an IMAX-style science film about the Milky Way Galaxy that was screened for 498 adults. Researchers deliberately created this film to decrease cognitive load and improve learning by adding depth, motion, and shadow only where necessary; they slowly transitioned viewers into the cinematic world they were watching. The final film was available in either 2D or 3D. </p>

<p>To measure retention, viewers were asked spatial concept questions about the galaxy both pre- and post-screening using iPads. Researchers found that short-term learning results were identical across both 2D and 3D groups. However, from a delayed posttest, they found that only the 3D version provided long-term learning gains six months after viewing. </p>

<p>This study is significant because many adults learn scientific information from informal settings like science centers, museums, and planetariums. Given the popularity of the hyper-realistic and relentlessly paced Marvel comics cinematic universe, this study suggests that our scientific films need to be more stately in pace and incorporate a straightforward visual style if we want to foster long-term learning. 

<p>Next time you visit a science museum, opt for the 3D version of scientific films when given the choice. The extra dimension will not only keep you more immersed in the short-term, it also could help you remember scientific concepts over the long-term. </p>
