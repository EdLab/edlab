<p>A recent study investigated animated pedagogical agents (APAs) in terms of how they fit in a learning environment. APAs often appear in educational software programs or as an educational element in regular software programs to guide users through complex tasks. These characters often integrate help text or audio and can be based on real people, animals, fictional characters, or even <a href="https://www.smore.com/clippy-js">inanimate objects</a>. This study compared APAs in various configurations. The first configuration was a control (no APA), the second tested a voice with no image, and the and third tested a full agent with both image and voice.</p>

<p>The researchers worked with 61 high school students to find out how the use of APAs could improve science courses and student motivation. Students were trained in the use of learning software created by SimQuest and used it to work though a physics lesson on motion. Findings in past studies show that motivation in the sciences is lower for girls, so the researchers were particularly interested in how the motivation levels of female participants were affected by the use of APAs.</p>

<p>Students filled out questionnaires at the beginning, middle and end of the study to determine whether time spent in the system, the absence or presence of an APA, or gender had an effect on their motivation. The researchers were also interested in investigating how the students felt about the APA's qualities based on their gender. They also conducted pre- and post-study knowledge tests to determine whether the APA helped students learn.</p>

<p>The results showed that all the participants felt more confident about the content and that the APA was associated with motivation benefits, especially for girls. The motivation benefits of the APA depended on how well the users identified with them. This study showed that girls identified with the APAs more readily than the boys.</p>

<p>The study demonstrates that, in order to create successful APAs, design and user testing should be a central focus. More research needs to be done on this topic to gain insight into how APA use affects motivation and how it benefits education in general. This data suggests that APA use could be beneficial for high school students, but delivering the right APA to the right student is an important consideration.</p>
