            Every aspect of education is very important fin order for students to succeed. However, two elements that is very crucial for student success is reading and writing. These are widely considered the foundation of learning, including numerical skills. However, reading and writing requires more attention as a result of its regulations.<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vanessa-thevathasan/international-literacy-da_b_5781990.html" target = "blank">Illiteracy</a> has become a major concern for many schools across the globe. In fact, according to the World Literacy Foundation, 67 million children still do not have access to primary school education. 

In terms of gender, girls are more likely to be illiterate than boys. Many girls simply do not have access to education. Every human should have the right to be educated, regardless of gender, race, color, or nationality if we are to eliminate the rate of illiteracy across the globe. At the annual International Literacy Day, UNESCO, national governments and international organizations discussed the importance of literacy and the challenges facing across the globe. 

One of these concerns is the eradication of poverty. It is estimated that at least a billion people across the world live in poverty. Of this billion, 70% are women. One of the reasons is women lack of access to education. Women reinvest 90 percent of their income back into their families. In essence, if we invest in women, the world will profit greatly. Similarly, illiteracy and child marriage must be eliminated.  Families are likely to marry their daughters to offset financial burdens. Perhaps, if families who marry off their daughters were educated, they would know the importance of education and long term planning. They will fight for their girls to obtain an education. I strongly believe that if girls are educated, the rate of illiteracy across the globe will decrease.
