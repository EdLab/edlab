<p><i>"AmIaDesigner (AIaD) helps individuals, companies and organizations to see the problems they face as opportunities to make a positive impact. Our playground is the globe, because we believe that everyone in the world should have access to tools, the right support and network that can help them solve their own problems, big or small."</i> (via <a href="http://amiadesigner.com/what/">AmIaDesigner</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="http://amiadesigner.com/what/">AmIaDesigner</a> (AIaD) is both a company and a community focusing on using design thinking and human centered innovation to help individuals, companies, NGOs, schools, and universities see problems as opportunities for design.</p>

<p><b>Designing the Journey</b><br>
The company founders, Jeroen Spoelstra and Boukje Vastbinder, began their careers taking traditional paths: design school, teaching at universities, and working at design companies. They both came to feel that the current culture of design was too fixed and rigid. "Who is the designer of the future?" Boukje asks in an exclusive interview with <i>New Learning Times</i>; she continues, "what is design education?" With many questions and few answers, the two set off to travel around the world and seek out diverse expressions of design. Boukje explained that they sought to "see people who are doing design differently to find out if it could be different in the future." As they travelled they both taught design courses and also met with local designers to understand how they viewed design. Jeroen and Boukje came to see design as a highly personalized and unique process that requires both tools and differentiated approaches.</p>

<p><b>The Art of Teaching</b><br>
What began as a travel blog snowballed into a full-fledged company focused on teaching design to teachers. The question, "what does design mean for education?" became more pressing when the two looked at both how design is taught and how educators are told to use design to solve educational problems. In response to this question, the two, now a team of seven, created a safe, experimental place where teachers look again at their own educational experiences and are given the tools to aid them as they imagine doing education differently.  AIaD offers a range of programs for educators, including a three-day master class that is a deep dive into educators' personal narratives and their experiences as designers while teaching the frameworks, methods, and tools of design thinking. An underlying aim for the company is to empower teachers. As of yet, AIaD has mainly worked with university teachers, but in 2015 there are plans to expand the program to high school teachers. While AIaD has started to explore other fields, such as policy and agriculture, education and the art of teaching continue to be touchstones for the company.</p>
