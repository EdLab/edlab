          <p>
            As I approach my last few weeks of high school, I have to do two presentation to in order to graduate. My high school is one of the few public high schools in New York City where students don't have to take the statewide Regents exam; students do presentations instead. The presentations are all based on what you've learned in your classes. You present in front of two teachers and your students, usually freshmen. The goal of these presentations is to be able to teach the teachers and students what you've learned. The teachers and students are able to ask questions throughout your presentation and ultimately they decided whether or not the presentation was good. They also look at presentation skills and the accuracy of the information. The presentations are all on powerpoints and the teachers usually know the subject and the information on the presentation but they still hope to learn something new. In my school we do five presentations: a biography, Math, ELA, Science and History.

Tomorrow, I will be doing my Literature presentation, so it counts for ELA. My literature presentation will be based on the three novels we read throughout the semester which involved Chinese Immigration, Puerto Ricans and Native American history. I created a thesis for my presentation and to support it, I used the themes of the novels and literary elements from quotes in the novels. I also have notecards prepared and the history of these groups memorized. 

I feel ready and by tomorrow I will be a lot closer to graduating from high school once I pass my presentation for my Literature class. Wish me luck.
