What was your favorite subject in school? Whatever it was, it was probably your best subject as well. It is no secret that we learn better if we are enjoying ourselves. Classroom gaming has become a hot topic over the past few years, but many educators aren’t quite sure if it is successful, necessary, or even worth the difficulty of them having to adapt to new teaching tools. Watch these students learning through gameplay, via both physical and virtual games, and judge for yourself. Did kids always seem this excited about their education?</p>

<p>Take a look at how <a href="http://gamedesk.org/">GameDesk,</a> a company dedicated to immersive learning through gaming, engages students in these classrooms. Instead of solving unrealistic and boring math problems (a man wants to purchase 80 apples and store them in his spherical basket…), remedial math students get to create their own video games. To learn engineering, students are given materials and tasked with building arches and other ancient structures. To visualize how planets form, students are guided by their teacher to move around outside to mimic asteroids and meteorites. The bottom line is that kids are learning through play, and it seems to be working.</p>

<p>Kids are so engrossed in their learning, that missing recess does not even phase them! Surely an education practice that is more compelling to kids than break time is worth further attention, especially since teachers claim that early results show an overall improvement in student comprehension. Games allow students to connect theory to practice in ways that the traditional method of schooling does not, and the fact that kids are also enjoying their studies is a major plus. </p>

<p>Do you think that learning through games is the next big trend in education? Tell us your opinions <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23249">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:09 pchasinga:</b> I totally dig this video especially the role-playing classroom!</p>

<p><b>@02:49 jacob.albert4:</b> Seems obvious, but it's interesting how this teacher points out that the environment often created by games forces us not only to learn and understand what certain game vocabulary mean, but also to assimilate that vocabulary into our own play.</p>

<p><b>@04:14 P.Williamson:</b> This approach to learning is so much more interactive than traditional forms of education. I know that if we were doing this when I was a kid, I would have had much more of a connection to course material. These kids have all the luck!</p>
