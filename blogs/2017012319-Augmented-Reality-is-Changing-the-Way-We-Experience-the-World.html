<p>Augmented reality is changing how we experience technology, and John Hanke, CEO of augmented reality (AR) company <a href="https://nianticlabs.com">Niantic</a>, thinks that it will change the way we experience the world. Hanke mentions that until recently, using technology such as computers or TVs was a stationary activity. He says that technology used to require us to be tethered to a screen, but AR lets us reimagine that.</p>

<p>AR can come in many different forms, including audio cues, popup videos, and smart watches. It allows users to experience an overlay of information over the real world, creating a digital enhancement of reality. Niantic has created two successful AR apps so far, including  <a href="http://www.pokemongo.com">Pokémon Go</a> and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3674/everyday-can-be-a-field-trip-with-this-app">Field Trip</a>. Pokémon Go, in particular, highlighted AR’s potential to foster collaboration and communication among people as they experienced a digital world together.</p>

<p>How can AR change how we experience the world? Do you think it has greater potential to foster or weaken relationships? What learning potential does AR carry with it? Answer these big questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/33340/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:19 DJRojas11:</b> Didn't Google already try and fail to build a wearable everyday AR device with Google Glass? Even though the device was meant to integrate unobtrusively, it never caught on. What were the takeaways from that experiment? What are the major obstacles to practically layering AR over everyday life?</p>

<p><b>@00:46 AimeeLee:</b> I once tried a mobile AR app for a natural history museum. While I liked the concept, it took so much effort to position the phone just right over objects that it would've been faster and easier to just look at a traditional museum display. The idea was there, but needed to be developed further and executed better.</p>
