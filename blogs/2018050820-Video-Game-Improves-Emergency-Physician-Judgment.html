<p>In emergency rooms and in the field, trauma triage judgments are made quickly and with incomplete information. Physicians rely on heuristics such as educated guesses, intuition, stereotyping, profiling, etc., to rapidly identify morbidities and make treatment decisions about severely injured patients. When calibrated well, heuristics allow doctors to function under conditions of time pressure and uncertainty. When calibrated poorly, they result in errors in judgment. In this study, researchers embedded narrative engagement (compelling stories to communicate principles of best practice decision-making) in a video game designed to recalibrate physician heuristics.</p>
 
<p>In the trial, 368 U.S. emergency physicians, with an average age of 40, were randomly assigned to either play the game Night Shift or use a traditional educational program. Participants took on the persona of Andy Jordan, a young emergency medicine physician who moves home after the disappearance of his estranged grandfather and takes a job in the local emergency department. They were given the dual objective of solving the mystery of the grandfather’s absence and interacting with patients to experience the consequences of under-triage (failure to transfer severely injured patients to trauma centers).</p>
 
<p>In one scenario, a patient returns to the emergency room with complications from an injury and Andy Jordan must find a solution for the patient’s deteriorating clinical condition as well as explain the outcome to other characters (family members, consultants). The characters’ responses to Andy provided didactic information about relevant contextual cues for the evaluation of trauma patients. At the same time, they highlight the repercussions of under-triage, such as preventable disability from a delay in treatment, to evoke an emotional response that would make the feedback memorable.</p>

<p>In the results, physicians who played Night Shift made 11% fewer diagnostic errors, despite the fact they were unlikely to describe the game as usable or enjoyable. Researchers concluded that age could play a role in the negative reaction to Night Shift and that younger physicians with greater tolerance for games might represent a more suitable target population for this type of intervention.</p>
