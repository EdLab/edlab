Sometimes we have to push ourselves to be better learners. Self-described self-directed learner Aarul Malaviya explains his journey to enlightenment in this autobiographical video. <p>

Aarul was struggling to get through his classes; he knew he wanted to do better but every attempt to raise his grades resulted in even more frustration. He tried to crack down on studying his class notes and textbooks but found himself too easily distracted. Worse yet, his commendable attempts at reaching academic prowess were ridiculed by his classmates. <p>

Through the use of online resources like Khan Academy and Academic Earth, Aarul was finally able to find the path that could lead him to his ultimate goal. He pulled up his grades and was even accepted to a university that was previously beyond his reach. His is an inspirational story for the millions of other would-be autodidacts out there. <p>
