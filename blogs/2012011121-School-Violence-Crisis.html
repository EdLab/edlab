            If anyone told you that <b>their</b> country's schools didn't have problems related to bullying, they'd probably be lying to you or be from North Korea. However, South Korea is having serious problems related to school violence and bullying, which have led to physical and mental damage, or worse, deaths.

A middle school student in Daegu recently committed suicide, leaving a note saying that multiple students beat him so that he would play an online game with their characters in order to "level them up" and make them better. In addition, a relatively large amount of money was taken from him as well. Their violent methods included water torture and "leashing." Their schools, run by bureaucratic staff who are only eyeing their promotions, claimed that they thought the students were only horseplaying. This caused an national outcry, leading to arrest warrants being issued for the two main culprits.

The problems didn't end there. Recently, a student accidentally stepped on the feet of an "Iljin" (the de facto leader of student hierarchy) and paid for it by being stomped to death. Other students have been diagnosed with mental problems due to school violence. The school leadership (the adults, that is) willed it away by ignoring it, afraid that holding a school violence panel, as required by law, would hurt their chances of being promoted later on.

Finally, the media has taken a harsh stance against school violence, and as a result, even the politicians have come together across party lines (a rare event, even more so in Korea) to set up support systems to punish the aggressor, not the victim. I can only hope that this blight in Korea's educational system will soon be wiped out.
