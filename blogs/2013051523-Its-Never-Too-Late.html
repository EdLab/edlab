            Mr. Kaufmann, 71 years old and a partner at the law firm Dewey Ballantine, has decided to retire. With enough money to do so, Mr. Kaufmann goes back to taking classes. It started with taking a class on Chaucer. After that, he took another class on the “Divine Comedy” by Dante and then took another one called Heresy in the Medieval World. He enjoyed these classes so much he decided to get  a master's degree in Classics (Latin and Ancient Greek) at the City University of New York (CUNY). Once he received his masters, he received several job opportunities for teaching. Mr. Kaufmann has now been teaching for three years and seems to be staying for a few more years. I was very surprised when I read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/business/retirementspecial/retired-and-back-in-school-for-the-degree-not-just-the-fun.html?ref=education">article</a> knowing that it is never too late to do what you want to achieve in life. 

He has set an example for many students that are now looking up to him. For him, completing school was not just about money because he had money to retire and live comfortably but yet he still continued going to school and pursue a new dream after leaving the law firm. Would you have retired, or would you have continued trying to help others as Mr. Kaufmann did?
