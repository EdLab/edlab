            <strong>Title:</strong> Bedtime stories and book reports : connecting parent involvement and family literacy

<strong>Author:</strong> Catherine Compton-Lilly &amp; Stuart Greene (eds.)

<strong>Publisher:</strong> New York: Teachers College Press, c2011

<strong>Call no.:</strong> LB1048.5 .B436 2011

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>This book brings together the newest research on parent involvement and family literacy--two strands of research that rarely exist in conversation with one another. The discussion highlights how race, class, gender, and history serve as potent factors that shape children's school experiences. Each chapter offers portraits of real families and schools that illustrate parents' awareness of their children's school progress, their perceptions of teachers, and their involvement in teaching their children life lessons that extend beyond school achievement. Translating theory into action, this resource extends conversations about parent involvement and family literacy across time and multiple spaces--home, school, church, and community; challenges accepted notions by listening to parents' counter-stories of how they are involved with their children both in and out of school; and highlights the significance of race, class, gender, religion, sexual preference, and history in literacy learning and schooling.

<strong>About the authors: </strong>

<strong>Catherine Compton-Lilly</strong> is an assistant professor in curriculum and instruction at the University of Wisconsin Madison and the author of <em>Re-Reading Families: The Literate Lives of Urban Children, Four Years Later. </em>

<strong>Stuart Greene</strong> is associate professor of English at Notre Dame University and co-editor of <em>Making Race Visible: Literacy Research for Racial Understanding.</em>

<strong>Reviews:</strong>

“<em>Bedtime Stories and Book Reports</em> is the right book at the right time… The editors have gathered an impressive group of researchers and practitioners to provide insights into working with families in productive and empowering ways. . . . Happy reading!”
—<strong>Patricia A. Edwards</strong>, president, International Reading Association, 2010-2011

“The fundamental ideological orientation of the volume’s authors is to set right the prevailing parents-as-problem orientation sometimes put forward by school administrators, teachers, and policymakers.”
—From the Afterword by <strong>Shirley Brice Heath</strong>, professor emerita, Stanford University

“Children can't reach their full potential for literacy development without the participation of parents. The editors have brought together an excellent group of authors who provide new information and a hopeful look at family literacy. This is a must-read.”
—<strong>Lesley Morrow</strong>, Graduate School of Education, Rutgers University

“The content of the book is a call for schools and teachers to recognize and value the diverse knowledge that culturally and linguistically different children bring from home as a stepping-stone to new learning. This will support all students’ transition into schooling, and will enhance the learning opportunities and success for all children.”
—<strong>Flora V. Rodríguez-Brown</strong>, University of Illinois at Chicago
