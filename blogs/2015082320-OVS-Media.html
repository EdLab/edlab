<p><i>"Since the days of radio, broadcast technology let those with something to say do so en masse, but that was over 100 years ago. OVS Media uses the latest in broadcast technology — Internet broadcasting — along with industry-best production practices to turn your conference, presentation or other event into an interactive broadcast that targeted audiences with an internet connection can join in on, and we do it all live."</i> via <a href="http://www.ovsmedia.com/">OVS Media</a></p>

<p><b>Broadcasting Democracy</b><br>
<a href="http://www.ovsmedia.com/">OVS Media</a>, the first company to specialize in the live broadcasting of government and nonprofit content over the Internet, has been around since 1999. The company launched in Seattle, WA with roots in technology and government communities and expanded to Washington D.C. in 2009. Since then, they have streamed hundreds of informational events and meetings for government and non-profit agencies including the Nuclear Regulatory Board, FEMA, CDC and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

<p><b>The New Face of News</b><br>
OVS Media webcasting can be live or pre-recorded and delivered in any format. Live captioning is an additional feature along with branding, which allows the webcast to seamlessly represent the company’s brand. The system also features seamless integration of presentation slides and real time tracking and reporting. No specific operating system is needed to view the webcasts, there are no licensing fees, and any browser can be used to tune in. OVS Media provides analytics showing how many viewers are watching, when they are watching, and their locations for both live and archived webcasts. Real-time streaming of Twitter feeds, audience questions, and moderated chatrooms can also be implemented during a webcast.  Due to OVS Media’s history and current clients, services provided adhere to stringent security requirements.</p>

<p>The webcasting services provided by OVS Media can be a great tool for educators and students. The freedom to use any operating system or browser increases the ease of use. Archived content can allow educators to share with students in or outside of the classroom. Live Twitter feeds and moderated chatrooms are efficient ways to communicate between educators and students across the country.</p>
