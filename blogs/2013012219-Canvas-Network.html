<p>Instructure has been producing <a href="http://www.instructure.com/">Canvas</a>, their standalone learning management system, since 2011 and currently <a href="http://www.instructure.com/about-us/">boast</a> over 4 million users at all learning levels. This spring, the system is expanding to host a promising-looking cadre of massive online courses. The Canvas Network will maintain the flexible feel of Canvas and will support content from a mélange of community colleges, publishers, elite universities, and edtech companies. 
</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Diversity is the key mission of both Canvas and the Canvas Network. The learning platform promises extreme flexibility and teacher-centric features like reduced clicks in grading and easy, automatic analytics. Course creators can customize their domains with video chat, saved feedback, calendars, private and public messaging, and even a customized layout built around their unique needs. The network dashboard, currently listing 22 upcoming courses for spring, demonstrates diversity of perspective. Far from the elite-branded MOOC of <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> or <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a>, Canvas seems to host a more democratic stable of content creators which include a variety of institutions and private companies. The dashboard makes it easy to get a sense of the content, a large banner on the homepage proclaims the provenance of the course and small icons beneath explain course requirements and components. The site seems primed to attract a crowd; the network sign-in is a lot less work than the original canvas and doesn’t require any personal information beyond email address. 
</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this anonymity contributes to course dynamics. Canvas is huge on social features and seeks to encourage student collaboration through online groups and conferences. The current crop of elite-branded MOOCs offered at other sites are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2012/08/16/are-they-learning-or-cheating-online-teachings-dilemma/">highly concerned</a> with authentication and reliability, so it will be a grand experiment to see if the Canvas Network’s quick and dirty sign-in breeds the kind of web shenanigans <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> seem so keen to prevent. The design of the site tips towards LMS classic with a few really exemplary features like the calendar. Overall the platform manages to incorporate a clean, modern aesthetic while upholding our sober, monastic expectations for a learning system.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Canvas Network is an example of the MOOC growing into its birthright. The major beneficiaries of massive online education are not likely to be on-campus Harvard undergrads, but rather time and location-strapped community college attendees. The Network even contains a few examples of courses created by textbook publishers and edtech companies looking to expand their user base. This might have been worrying, but as well-produced MOOCs with pure motives are already <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/coursera/2012/11/16/taking-the-next-step-in-online-education-with-credit-equivalency/">on course for credentialing</a>, perhaps we’re ready for a bit of experimentation.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>The Canvas Network is diversifying the MOOC.</p>
