<p><b>Title:</b> Creating a Mindset for Innovation (2012)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Skaggs, Richard Fry, & Geoff Wright</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/1021381506">Journal of Strategic Innovation and Sustainability</a></p>

<p><b>Research Questions:</b> What impact does an intensive learning workshop have on studentsâ€™ innovative abilities and attitudes and what role does this kind of workshop play in fostering a "culture of innovation?"</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> This project is organized into three phases: (1) develop and run an innovation boot camp, which the researchers described as "an intensive, hands-on, collaborative, experiential learning workshop focused on educating students on the principles of innovation by providing them real-world situations," (2) evaluate the boot camp, and (3) restructure the boot camp based on evaluations.</p>

<p>The two-day boot camp involved 18-24 students and faculty from different departments within the School of Technology in the College of Engineering at Brigham Young University. All participants were split into 4-6 multidisciplinary groups, each with 4-6 students and a faculty member. The boot camp was structured so that the groups were competing with each other.  At the end of the boot camp, "a panel of judges from local design and engineering companies" judged the students projects and gave awards to the top three.</p> 

<p>For the curriculum and pedagogical design of the boot camp, an innovation design team observed and researched the definition and manifestations of innovation, collaborating with institutions like the IDSA National Conference, the Stanford d. School, and the Rotman School of Management. They developed a very broad framework.</p>

<p>The researchers collected data during all phases of the boot camp. In addition they conducted an online survey, a focus group, interview sessions, and one-on-one follow-up interviews. They also made a video documentary of the boot camp to allow for further analysis and critique.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The researches found that it was essential for participating students, faculty, and administrators to be committed to explicitly teaching and learning innovation. Related to general buy-in, funding was also an important part of success. The researchers found that 85% of the students said their time at the boot camp "was spent effectively or very effectively."</p>

<p>The researchers came away with two targets for improvement: the first is to develop a common vocabulary, a series of definitions and concepts with which to talk about innovation. The second is to continue to develop evaluation processes and strategies for restructuring the boot camp.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The authors say, "Surprisingly, most technology and engineering programs in the United States do not explicitly teach innovation," but have schools of engineering typically engaged in invention? The article uses the terms "inventions" and "innovations" interchangeably, which highlights the need for the terms to be explicitly defined before more conclusions are made about the goals and findings of this program.</p>

<p>Using the word "boot camp" suggests that innovative learning could happen in a single event. An alternative strategy might be to have a maker event or workshop featuring innovative projects and where changes in the innovative cultural landscape of the school are showcased. If we assume the goal is to interweave innovation throughout the curriculum, workshops could be intentionally used to jumpstart the practice of innovation for faculty members so they feel empowered to integrate innovative practices into the curriculum. A measures of success would be the increase in student innovative projects and interdisciplinary innovation work.</p>
