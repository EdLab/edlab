Michael B. Horn is unique in the field of educational technology, in that, he is not an educational technologist.  Instead Horn, who is one of the founders of <a href="http://www.innosightinstitute.org/">Innosight Institute</a>, is dedicated to contributing both valuable research and knowledge that will potentially disrupt the education field and create lasting innovation. We connected with Michael Horn to learn more about his past and future work.  Check out the interview below.  <p>
<b> EXCLUSIVE NLT INTERVIEW</B>
<p>
<b>Q: How did your educational trajectory/background affect your current work?  </b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The educational experiences I have had, both from a learning perspective as well as from the networking opportunities they presented, have led me to where I am today. In particular, while a student at the Harvard Business School, I had the opportunity to take <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6437">Clayton Christensen's</a>, class which changed the way I saw the world. The theories that I learned in that class--the theories of disruptive innovation--explained so many mysteries that I had not understood before. Armed with this knowledge, I had the opportunity to apply the theories to the challenges in public education when Professor Christensen offered me the chance to work with him on coauthoring a book on the U.S. K-12 public education system. These theories have continued to guide my work in my position as Education Executive Director at <a href="http://www.innosightinstitute.org/">Innosight Institute</a>, a non-profit think tank that I co-founded with a classmate and Professor Christensen, as our mission is to use the theories of disruptive innovation to help solve problems in the social sector.
<p>
<p> 
<b>Q: What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?</b>  
<p>
<b>A:</b> Writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disrupting-Class-Expanded-Edition-Disruptive/dp/0071749101/ref=dp_ob_title_bk/188-5065445-0405031"><i>Disrupting Class</i></a> with Clayton Christensen and observing him speak and teach was of course quite formative to how I conduct my current work. That said, I think a critical part of our team's success so far stem from the lessons I learned from my time working with David Gergen as his research assistant. I learned so much from him--from his ability to work with an array of people on a variety of projects to how he worked with the media and handled public speaking and from how he managed a team that supported the work we did together to his understanding of the political and media landscapes.
<p>
<p> 
<b>Q: How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b>  
<p>
<b>A:</b> I hope our work will transform our current monolithic education system that was built to standardize the way we teach and test into a student-centric system that can customize for students' different learning needs and allow each child to realize his or her fullest human potential.
<p>
<p>
<b>Q: What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The rise of online learning--the first real disruptive innovation in education we've seen in ages--over the last several years and its inevitable improvement in the years ahead will have a significant impact on learning in the years ahead. In addition, declining public budgets will force public schools to search for new solutions for educating students, which together create a unique window to re-imagine schooling in some exciting ways.
<p>
<p>
<b>Q: What are you currently working on & What is your next big project?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> We are working on several exciting projects. We have a few papers in the works on blended learning that I think will help to clarify some of what we are seeing develop in public schools across America right now. We're also working on a case study to help push key stakeholders' thinking on what a next-generation system of assessments might look like in K-12 education. We're building a blended-learning database that will capture the profiles of K-12 schools moving to blended learning in a variety of ways across the world, and we continue to do work to think about how the job of a teacher will evolve in the years ahead. It's clear to us that teachers will remain vital in the education system, but what they do will likely look pretty different in some ways that should be much more gratifying to educators. Lastly, we're looking at writing another book that would be a field guide of sorts to Disrupting Class to give educators on the ground more guidance of what they can do to create a student-centric education system, and we're increasingly working on a variety of higher education projects as well.
