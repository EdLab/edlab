            <b> Speaking of Educause...</b>

<a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ers0906/rs/ERS0906w.pdf"> The new ECAR study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology is out</a> and it has some <S>interesting</S> expected results. 

Here is a summary of their summary ( â˜º )
<li>Since 2006, the number of laptop owners (from 65% in 2006 to 83% in 2009) has increased while desktop owners have decreased (from 71% in 2006 to 44% in 2009). </li>
<li>On the topic of content creation and sharing….</li>
     o	48% contributed content to video websites 
     o	41.9% contributed to wikis 
     o	37.3% contribute to blogs and use podcasts (35.0%) 
<li>Weekly use of instant messaging has gone down from 72.5% in 2006 to 55.7 in 2009.  On the other hand, weekly use of social networking sites has increased from 65.3% in 2006 to 86.6% in 2009.  Likewise, text messaging has increased to a point where 84.9% of respondents txt'd more than once a week (though, I would have thought this to be higher!)</li>
<li>“In this year's study, most [students] who had used a CMS said their overall experience with them was either positive (52.0%) or very positive (11.2%).” For those who were not happy with their LMS experience, design and performance issues (speed and ease of use) were to blame.  </li>

I think this study gives us (as researchers and developers) a lot to build off of.  I don't mind that my world wasn't rocked by any groundbreaking discoveries because there <i>is</i> a message in here. The tech problems that plagued teachers and students 3 years ago (and probably even earlier than that), especially those involving LMSs, are the same that do so today.  Undergrads are increasingly viewing themselves as expert internet users and the LMS just isn't keeping up with them.  Still, instructors need to have some confidence in their computing abilities as well.  I think when students, instructors, and the lMS are all on the same page it will be a beautiful day indeed â˜º  In this regard, the Educause workshop on recrafting an institution's online learning presence is more relevant than ever.
