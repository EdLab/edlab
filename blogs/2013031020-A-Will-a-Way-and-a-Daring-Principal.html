No more pencils, no more books! The resounding credo behind Principal Karen Collins's challenge for her elementary school teachers rang out like a victory cry from the battlefields. Principal Collins dared her teachers to go one day without using pencils or paper in their classrooms in favor of using new media and technology. The ultimate goal was to inspire students to become active learners and to get teachers excited about integrating technology into their lessons. 
<p>
Among those interviewed about their experience, there was an overwhelmingly positive response. Teachers loved the exercise because it allowed them to differentiate instruction for kids who excel when using digital technologies; students--and these are elementary school kids, remember-- liked that they were using up-to-date learning materials and appreciated being able to find resources online from a number of authors, as opposed to adhering to the one author who penned their textbook. 
<p>
By all accounts, "No Paper/Pencil Day" was a success and helped to buoy national awareness for <a href="http://www.digitallearningday.org/">Digital Learning Day</a>, an aptly named, yearly celebration of digital learning in K-12 public schools across the country. Initiatives such as this serve to stress the importance of learning the innovative, tech-based skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital future. 
<p>

<b>@01:02 Lola:</b> Was participation voluntary? If so, I wonder how many of the teachers in the school took up the challenge.
<p>
<b>@03:57 MariaSanchez:</b> Digital native DOES NOT EQUAL digitally literate.
