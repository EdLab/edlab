<p><i>"No two students come from the same background or learn the same way. With Knewton adaptive learning, every student is supported and challenged."</i> (<a href="https://www.knewton.com/about/">About Knewton</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Adept at Adapting</b></p>

<p>Teachers want to provide individualized learning to their students. But in today’s jam-packed schools, there are just too many learners and too few instructors. <a href="https://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a> 
aims to help solve this problem by adapting learning on an individual basis. </p>

<p><b>Students, Start Your Learning Engines</b></p>

<p>Knewton uses its learning engine to find out what individual students know; it determines how they learn best and directs content to improve learning. It performs sophisticated, real-time analysis of student performance data. By having this data, Knewton recommends what students should focus on depending on their strengths and struggles. Parents and teachers can use Knewton to ensure they provide lessons that incorporate the proper types of media at appropriate levels that fit student needs. By focusing on learning materials, Knewton gets students what they need when they need it. </p>

<p><b>Record of Success Keeps Spinning On</b></p>
 
<p>Knewton has a relatively lengthy corporate history given the short lifespan of adaptive learning. Founded in 2008, the company has provided over 16 billion recommendations to help students learn; in sum, over 10 million have used Knewton. It has been named one of the top 10 most innovative companies in education by Fast Company. As the Common Core dominates classrooms and high-stakes testing grows, providing individualized education will prove more important for success. If Knewton develops more granular real-time feedback tailored to student need, it should continue outpacing its competitors in adaptive learning. </p>

<p>In a post-Snowden era, surveillance is a troubling problem across edtech and Knewton must continue treading the fine line between collecting student data and ensuring privacy. For example, Knewton’s <a href="https://www.knewton.com/resources/press/houghton-mifflin-harcourt-and-knewton-announce-pioneering-partnership/">collaboration with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a> could put student info in the grasp of an educational giant. If they aren’t careful, big edtech players like Knewton may become Big Brother. </p>
