          <p>
            Obesity has a substantial economic impact on the U.S. healthcare system, costing an estimated $110 billion. Medical literature has found that obesity is a risk factor for a number of medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension and elevated cholesterol levels. The current epidemic of obesity is caused by numerous factors such as environmental and behavioral interaction as well as genetics. Research was done to assess the presence of supermarkets, convenience stores as well as grocery stores and to determine whether the availability of these establishments were responsible for the causes of cardiovascular disease. It was hypothesized that the availability of supermarkets would decrease the prevalence of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.

In addition the research emphasizes that race, gender, income, age, education, medical conditions can be related to cardiovascular disease and the availability of various food stores. 10,763 individuals were randomly selected from Jackson City, (MS), Forsyth County (NC), Washington County (MD), and selected suburbs of Minneapolis (MN). Based on the Baecke questionnaire, these individuals were asked a series of questions which ranged from physical activity to place of work.  To calculate the prevalence of CVD risk factors related to the availability of food stores, a binomial regression model was incorporated.  In turn, all analysis were conducted using SAS version.
