          <p>
            It's said that all good things must come to an end. Well, so did my internship at Edlab last week. The whole summer went by in such a rush, that I didn't realize how quickly the time to finish up came, until it was staring me right in the face. 

It was quite an incredible experience, and I am thankful to have been given this opportunity. I personally grew a lot as a programmer, worked on my weaknesses, had my set of highs and lows, both frustrating periods of inefficiency and super productive bursts of time. More than anything else, I felt connected. Connected to everyone around me at Edlab. I met some amazingly wonderful people, and I struggle to think of another place I could meet so many amazing people in one place. I'm thankful for everyone being patient with me, taking time out from their schedule to help me out whenever I had trouble. I hope I was able to repay those times with some meaningful contribution through my work. I have definitely grown in both technical skill and professional behavior with extremely valuable feedback I got. 

I also had the pleasure of having some of the most awesome people as my fellow interns. I honestly don't know what to write for them, I've been thinking for a while, but I can't come up with words suitable enough. I guess I don't need to say anything, they'll understand. And that would tell you a lot about how wonderful we all were as a group.

One of my regrets is that I left in a rush, and didn't get to say goodbye to some people. Maybe it's a good thing I didn't get time to think much about goodbyes, it would have been much harder had I had time to ponder over it. On the plus side, as I said to some of you, I'll keep visiting whenever I'm in New York.

Thank you everyone. It's been wonderful knowing you, I promise to keep in touch, and it's been a bright, sunny summer in new york!

Best Regards,
Sakar
