What happens when you combine the world’s most popular sport with arguably the most important gift you can give underprivileged young people? You get Right to Dream Academy in Ghana. The academy provides educational opportunities for youth in the country by using soccer (or football as it is internationally known in the video), as the platform. <p>

Tom Vernon founded the program to afford talented soccer players a chance to use the sport as a platform to a quality education. Due to the immense popularity of soccer in Ghana, rogue sports agents often use young people’s aspirations to become professional soccer players as a means to extort money from their families. Right to Dream serves as a more viable option. <p>

At Right to Dream, students spend large parts of their day in the classroom and the rest of the time on the soccer field. The goal (literally and figuratively) is to provide students with educational (and sporting) opportunities often lacking for so many children in Ghana and other developing countries. Can the success of Right to Dream be replicated in other developing nations using other sports or extracurricular activities? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/15335">Chime in on the discussion on Vialogues</a>.

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:33 AbdulMalik:</b> This is absolutely true. Even though Africa has young talents, people use those talents to make money for themselves and not the players themselves.<p>

<b>@01:18 Nantwi:</b> How can we use academics to motivate students, wherever they are in the world, to pursue their passions (e.g. sports, entertainment)?<p>

<b>@02:39 abagigah92:</b> football have always been a way to get out of poverty for most boys in Africa. A lot of boys usually drop out of school to chase their dreams. Right to dreams help create a bridge for football and education.<p>
