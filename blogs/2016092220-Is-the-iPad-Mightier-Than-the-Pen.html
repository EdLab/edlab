<p>Few things are as universally valuable in adult life as the ability to write well. Yet with a diminishing emphasis being placed on writing instruction, many schools are struggling to produce the wordsmiths of the future. Mobile apps have the potential to be fun, relevant, low-cost resources for language arts teachers, but does plopping iPads into a classroom actually make kids better writers? </p>

<p>Researchers in this study set out to investigate the effects of integrating iPad apps into a 5th grade writing class. They compared two groups of fifteen 5th graders during a nine-week period. Both groups were given identical lessons, but the first group received instruction using traditional paper and pencil methods while the second groupâ€™s lessons incorporated six interactive apps. The course was designed to target three specific Common Core writing skills: sequencing, visualization, and use of sensory details; these skills were used as benchmarks for coding and analyzing student work. Researchers also collected interviews and journal entries in order to compare student experiences. </p>

<p>While both tracks showed improvements, researchers found that the iPad-integrated classroom had greater gains in certain areas, particularly in the coherent sequencing and pacing of events. For example, one app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toontastic/id404693282?mt=8">Toontastic</a>, allowed students to storyboard their work visually and temporally on screen. These animated visualizations helped students make precise decisions about the timing and the pace of narrative action. In contrast, stories written without the aid of apps, while full of rich sensory description, lacked structure and often slipped into a "stream-of-consciousness" style. Additionally, teachers reported higher levels of engagement and more collaborative social dynamics amongst students in the app-integrated classroom. As the study itself states, "students LIKE using apps!" </p>

<p>The take away? There is little to lose and much to gain by diversifying writing instruction and integrating iPad apps into language arts classrooms. Doing so can strengthen Common Core skillsets, boost student engagement, and make kids more technology literate along the way. </p>
