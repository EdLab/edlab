Are you <i>really</i> smarter than a 5th Grader? <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-iq-test-free-edition/id293165776?mt=8">The IQ Test</a> will let you know. This iPad app helps you find your intellectual ranking—whether it’s good, bad, or ugly. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The IQ Test is a neat little app that helps you explore various dimensions of your intellect. The app demonstrates its academic intentions right out of the gate, providing diagnostic assessment when it's launched. You begin by finding your baseline with a general IQ test involving 13 different areas. It includes subjects like Analogy, Classification, Coding-Decoding, etc. This breadth of areas gives the test more credibility than if it was confined to a few, narrower sets of subjects. </p>
 
<p>The IQ Test is great at helping you understand your progress as you explore. The app provides simple bar and pie charts that visualize your learning trajectory as your scores presumably improve as you continue to use the app. And don't worry about becoming bored with repetitive questions—an in-house algorithm randomizes questions every time you use the app. In terms of interactivity, the experience is responsive and straightforward with navigational keys logically located on the user interface. With a question-answer format, the interface is incredibly simple to comprehend after just a few clicks. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The underlying raison d’être of The IQ Test is a tad dubious. Admittedly, intelligence quotients are not immutable. However, the idea that you can quickly raise your IQ simply through playing an app does not hold up to closer examination. In the short term, the app seems to imply that the only way to quickly improve your IQ is through a recursive process. Namely, list a set of questions, provide feedback, and then retest on similar questions. Voilà, your IQ score test improved—you’ve become smarter! The app can become a neat parlor trick that demonstrates your "intelligence." </p>
 
<p>The user experience with The IQ Test is average for an educational app. Given how beautiful some apps are, this one is a little spartan. It looks like an SAT study book was scanned and souped up with simple navigational capabilities. Also, the drill-and-kill routine of repeatedly answering questions can become tedious. The sections have lots of questions—as many as 50 in one case—which can become deathly boring. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The IQ Test is a functional app. It does its best to provide a diagnostic setting and straightforward interaction to improve your scores as well as your confidence. However, if you are desperately searching for a truly long-lasting, educational experience to enrich your intelligence, confining yourself to an app probably isn’t the answer. You can certainly lower your boredom, and speed up your response times, by using The IQ Test. However, if you want wholesale improvement of your intellect, cozy up with a complicated book, or sign up for a course at your local college, to become your best self. </p>
