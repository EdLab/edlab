<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> My early work in psychology, especially influenced by a psychoanalytic understanding, was very influential in my learning about child development. When I moved into the field of education, I was most influenced by the open classroom philosophy.  I studied with people in that movement including such people as Lillian Weber, Vito Perrone, and Debbie Meiers.  I met two women who were classroom teachers and had lived the philosophy in powerful ways.  The three of us, Joanna Nicholson, June Gould, and I started The Committee for an Open Classroom in our community.  From that beginning, we were able to start a movement, establish a graduate program for teachers in Fairfield University, establish one of the first Teachers’ Centers in the US, and, in anticipation for the bicentennial celebration, created a Children’s Museum in 1975. We developed the Learning Co-op, a high school alternative in 1976 to accompany the museum.  All of these experiences shaped my work around teaching and learning, and most significantly, the importance of collaboration, creative and critical thinking, and dispositional thinking as we try to break the boundaries and limitations of schooling so that it focuses on learning what matters.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> I am hopeful that the work that I have been doing will serve as a model for creating a climate of possibilities. I try to model dispositional thinking in all that I do, such as: listening with understanding and empathy, thinking flexibly, thinking interdependently.  I believe that if educators were to embrace the <a href="http://bit.ly/1zwrzVI">16 Habits</a> that Art Costa and I have worked on over the past 30 years, people would have an effective way to deal with the problems in today’s educational environment.  I am hopeful that creating a new mindset for learning will help to ultimately change the ways we live and learn in this very uncertain time. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Technology has already had an impact.  I think that technology, when used properly, offers a great opportunity to rethink the way we approach teaching and learning.  We need to stop thinking "school" and start thinking learning.  The diverse learners that we are engaging bring a whole new dimension to our lives as teachers.  I see us seizing the opportunity to learn more languages, become more sensitive to other cultures, and to move toward assessing what we truly value. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am presently working with <a href="http://bit.ly/1E1Yq6k">Eduplanet21</a> an innovative online learning platform.  We are redefining PD so that it is more self-directed, connecting educators globally, and focusing on not only hearing from experts but also applying what is learned and bringing the expertise of the learners back to the theorists.  
<p>
I am also working on 16 instructional animations for the Habits of Mind with <a href="http://bit.ly/1yrgxiH">Wondergrove Kids.</a> This is very exciting work.  It is the first time that Art Costa, Mort Sherman, and I are co-creating scripts and extension lessons to make the Habits of Mind come alive for early childhood. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I follow <a href="http://bit.ly/1yL23w3"> Diane Ravitch</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1sYnpn1">Silvia Tolisano</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1Gv6DSM">Grant Wiggins</a>, <a href=" http://bit.ly/1JerXrK">Heidi Hayes Jacobs</a>.
