            Don't worry, your trusty Twitter-feed is safe... it's just <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/01/hack-week-twitter.html">Hack Week</a> @ Twitter headquarters!  Twitter has opened-up the company to employees, who have formed about 100 teams to spend the week "hacking" existent products, services and to create new ones.  The Twitter blog describes the following goals for the initiative:

<i>We don't know what exactly will result, but we can't wait to find out. One thing we do know: we'll have a bunch of awesome new products, features, and ideas. Some may launch quickly, and others will earn more time and attention to further develop. And of course, some of what happens in Hack Week will stay in Hack Week.</i> 

Google has offered employees a 20% time-off for innovation program for many years (as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html">this NYTs piece form 2007</a> will attest) and according to <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/02/24/google-facts-and-figures-massive-infographic/">this infographic</a> over 50% of Google's products resulted from this 20% of employees time spent working on "outside" innovation.  I wonder what newness will hatch from the Tweet nest?  

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
After a recent development & research meeting spent re-imagining the potential role of interns within the group, a hack-a-thon was proposed as a possible way to both foster innovation and generate new ideas around existent products.  Do you think that the EdLab should follow Twitter's lead and create a lab-wide hack-fest?  If so, what would be the main benefits?  If not, what would be the main reasons to avoid this route?  I already feel that many of our products and applications were developed here at the lab were created in a culture that embraces open, agile innovation 100% of the time.
