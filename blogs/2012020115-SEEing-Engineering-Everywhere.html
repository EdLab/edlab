<a href="http://soe.stanford.edu/">Stanford School of Engineering</a> is now providing its course material online for some of its classes for free, through a program called <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/default.aspx">Stanford Engineering Everywhere (SEE)</a>. Not only can educators use these course materials in their classroom, now anybody can download them and learn about the basics of computer science, artificial intelligence, linear systems and optimization, and more. There are <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx">10 courses</a> to choose from that are free to use because the content is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. Course materials include lecture videos, a syllabus, handouts, assignments, and exams.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> This program is making it possible for anybody to get an introduction to a few topics in engineering. It's format is much like other online learning platforms and what's interesting about the SEE program is the actual engineering topics themselves, some of the courses are more advanced, requiring the viewer to have some prerequisites before viewing them. What's also interesting about this program is that the material is open for other educators to use in their own classrooms to teach engineering. 

So the question today is, can this affect the future of STEM education? This could very well promote engineering education and get more people interested in learning about it beyond what is available for free. If more people looked through these free courses, would it have much of an effect on STEM education? If these courses can be available online then why pay so much to attend college? It's hard to have a solid answer to these questions now since the concept of letting more people view higher education course material is still fairly new. If the lectures can be viewed at anytime then why not devote more class time for the application of the knowledge, much like flipped classrooms? Let's start thinking about the future, everyone.
