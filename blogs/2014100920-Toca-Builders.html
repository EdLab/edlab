<p> Developed by <a href="http://tocaboca.com">Toca Boca</a>, a play studio located in San Francisco, and offered in 20 foreign languages, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toca-builders/id652077009?mt=8">Toca Builders</a> is a construction app for iPad and iPhone that targets kindergarteners. Within the app, players can use colorful virtual blocks to construct their own 3D world. There are six different robot builders designed for different types of construction: (1) Blox the Hammer who can drop and smash a block; (2) Cooper the Ball who can paint the virtual ground; (3) Vex the Jumper who can jump and create stacks of blocks; (4) Stretch the Tall who can stretch and reach high places without jumping; (5) Connie the Crane who can lift and move blocks; and (6) Jum-Jum the Painter who cannot move but is able to access and paint any square on the board. All of them help players design, organize and fulfill a series of construction tasks.  </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The 3D interface of the app is succinct and intuitive. The play process involves constant spatial design and decision-making: In order to construct something, players need to figure out which builder is best suited to the current task. Players can pan the camera and change the view angle in the game by zooming in and out or dragging in different directions. Toca Builder has no rules, no penalties, and no limits on either time or the number of virtual worlds one can create. This freedom fits perfectly with the construction theme of the app, resonating with real-world block building experience.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> The app costs $2.99. The game currently provides blocks of the same size; more options for block size and shape should be considered for future development. While the game provides an open space to make the creation process flexible, it does have a six-block height limit. The app also lacks a social element, so players cannot share their worlds or invite others to join the gameplay. There is no in-game tutorial or instruction, which might frustrate some players.</p>
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Toca Builders is an imaginative app that helps support children’s spatial design and decision making.  Parents and teachers might find it a meaningful addition to children’s real-world block building experience and could use it as a potential teaching and learning tool to introduce 3D world and spatial navigation </p> 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p> Toca builders is a masterpiece virtual construction toy.</p>
