<p>When it comes to new technologies, teachers don’t always have the time to learn and implement the next new bright, shiny platform. While many teachers are willing to try out a new LMS, actually replacing their current system with a different one is uncommon. What actually promotes longevity instead of a short-lived shelf life for an LMS has less to do with teachers than it does with their students. </p>

<p>In a recent study exploring how secondary teachers experience and adopt Learning Management Systems, researchers found that success had to occur in the first stages of teacher experience before they would consider adopting a new system. Teachers experienced initial concerns in the understanding, ease of use, and awareness of a platform’s operation. If a teacher was unable to quickly understand how the LMS could facilitate their coursework and help with student learning, they were less likely to move to a new system. </p>

<p>The most important factor that went into the adoption of an LMS was how it might benefit student learning. An LMS allowing students to collaborate and interact with their peers was most appealing for teachers. The implications from this study suggest that developers of Learning Management Systems must successfully do what teachers do; soften the learning curve for students and act as an instrumental tool in their learning experiences.</p>
