<p>You and a large man are the only people on a bridge. On the train tracks below are five workers, completely oblivious to the train rapidly approaching around the corner. You know the only way to save the lives of these workers is to push the large man onto the tracks, derailing the train. Do you push him? This dilemma, known as the Trolley Problem, is one of the most famous contemporary philosophical thought experiments.</p>
 
<p>As people increasingly use technology to think through moral dilemmas, it’s important to understand how different devices affect our moral decision-making inclinations. Researchers of a recent study analyzed how people responded differently to the Trolley Problem via smartphones and PCs. They were interested in which device inspired more emotional, intuitive responses driven by gut feelings, and which inspired more rational, unemotional responses driven by conscious reflection of the different consequences. They considered people who chose not to push the fat man as making an <i>emotion-driven</i> decision, and those who chose to push the fat man as making a <i>reason-driven</i> decision.</p>
 
<p>In one part of this experiment, researchers corresponded with over 1000 participants online who completed the thought experiment on their own personal smartphones or PCs. In another, participants completed the same thought experiment, but were told they either had unlimited time to do so or that they had to make a decision within a time constraint of 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Both parts of this experiment garnered the same results: participants who answered the question on their smartphones were more likely to push the large man off the bridge. In other words, they were more likely to adopt reason-driven decision-making than the participants who answered on their PCs, even when given a time constraint. This is contrary to the popular assumption that people tend to make more intuitive or unreflective moral decisions on their smartphones.</p>
 
<p>The researchers believe the results are due to the <i>narrowing effect</i>, which means that instead of distracting users when they make decisions, smartphones help them focus exclusively on the task at hand. Some people have been concerned in recent years that the increased use of technology in moral decision making has overall adverse effects. But this study demonstrates that that is not always the case. In fact, people tend to make more reason-driven decisions on their smartphones, even with a time limit. This suggests that smartphones might actually play a positive role in helping people make more reasonable decisions in moral dilemmas. As more people rely on smartphones for decision making, this is good news for us all… except large men on bridges.</p>
