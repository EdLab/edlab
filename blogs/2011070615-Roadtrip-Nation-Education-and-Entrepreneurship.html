<a href="http://roadtripnation.com/about/rvs.php">Roadtrip Nation </a>hopes to change student perception of personal success by providing the framework, inspiration and tools for charting an unconventional career path.  

After deciding that college wasn't connected enough to the real-world, the three founders set-out on a road trip to discover "why" and "how" a diverse swath of Americans, from Lobster fisherman to CEO's, found livelihoods they loved that diverged from traditional career paths.   

What started out as a journey of self-discovery has grown into a national movement when in 2010 over 100,000 students became "Roadtrip Scholars (nice play on Rhodes)" and embarked on Roadtrip Nation-funded adventures of their own.   "Roads" scholars are given a grant and access to both online and print materials to help create and guide their trip.    Participants are also tracked by instructors from their respective schools, who are provided with <a href="http://roadtripnation.org/rtnexperience/curriculum.php">Roadtripnation.org's online curriculum</a>, video archives and resources developed for use in the classroom.  

The goal of each trip is to create video-based interviews with a wide variety of people who are successful and happy in their unconventional life's work.  Sample interviews include cartoon programmers, entrepreneurs, scientists who work on the "fringe" etc.  Students then track their experiences through an <a href="http://roadtripnation.org/rtnexperience/roadtrip.php?roadtrip_id=4530">interactive map and blog</a>.  

<b>What is the connection between a roadtrip, education & entrepreneurship?</b>
Road trips are traditionally considered a journey that deviates from a prescribed path and as such, are a great metaphor for both entrepreneurship & 21st century education.  As Michael Dell states simply in a Roadtripnation.org interview, "I wouldn't have done as well as I have, had I conformed."   Recent interest in the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5889">DIY-U </a>and <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5853"> "UnCollege"</a> movements are examples of education taking a virtual roadtrip away from a traditional classroom setting.  Additionally, start-up's have a feeling similar to a roadtrip in that you gather a small, agile team, have a goal in mind and GO, or in this case, iterate!     

<b>How does Roadtrip Nation relate to EdLab's core projects?</b>
As we initiate our "entrepreneur in residence" program under the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5068">LaunchPad39B umbrella</a>, we should explore this model of documenting "experience-based" learning opportunities guided by an entrepreneur.  Perhaps creating an archive of online materials, lesson plans and mSchool courses that would enable adoption of a unique "edupreneur"-focused residency program in schools.   We could also explore the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive ">SXSWi</a> model of a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2300-11386_3-10006964.html?tag=contentBody;imgThumbContainer">"start-up bus"</a> that took developers & entrepreneurs to the Austen-based conference this year and created an environment for launching new ideas through a self-contained, team-based competition.  

<b>Final thoughts...</b>
Whether hitting the road of life or simply navigating the bumpy education trail, EdLab  will be able to leverage our unique position as both an archive and incubator for new ideas in the education space while forging a new tech-based path to innovation.
