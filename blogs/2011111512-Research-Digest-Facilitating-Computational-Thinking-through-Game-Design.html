<a href ="http://www.springerlink.com/content/u10464w125031115/fulltext.pdf">Wu, M. & Richards, K. (2011). Facilitating computational thinking through game design.  <i>Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6872,</i> 220-227. </a>

<b>Description:</b> This paper explores the effectiveness of digital game based learning when it comes to <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking skills</a> in STEM classes.  The method involves K-12 students designing a STEM related digital game in the U.S. and Taiwan; students used an online game making program. Data collection and analysis includes reflective short answer questionnaires, field notes, student design journals, and semi-structured interviews. The paper reports on the preliminary findings and describes its future work, meaning that the study is still on going and has yet to have a solid conclusion. From the preliminary findings in the U.S., the researchers found that the students had a better understanding of games as systems and how theses components work together to make a game functional. They also developed communication skills with their fellow students, and improved their understanding and application of computational thinking.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> There seems to be a growing trend in game usage in classes, for example the educator in <a href ="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/can-an-online-game-crack-the-code-to-language-learning/">this article</a> lets his students play a game that teaches students about Latin through role playing citizens in ancient Rome. In the game, students learn Latin through simulation, and according to the article, the students seem to learn more Latin through the game than the traditional method. Although not many teachers completely replace their classes with gaming, some do add it as a supplement to their curriculum. 

I am loving this new trend as it combines my two favorite interests, although I never thought I would see this day, where gaming and education are getting closer and closer together, it makes sense now that I think about it. Many games are, more or less, simulations of real-life events, like how in <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Noire">L.A. Noire</a> players take the role of a detective. Students seem to be better engaged in class when they are taught materials that can be applied directly to real life situations, instead of applying it to textbook problems. What gaming can provide for students are simulations of real-life situations where the material taught in class can be applied to solve problems. So this growing gaming based learning trend is an interesting thing to keep an eye on, and also figure out how EdLab can be involved in this trend.
