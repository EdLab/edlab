          <p>
            Not so long ago we spoke about technology in my english class. Is has advanced so much in the last ten years. The topic of online classes came up and I was very intresed in what many of the students had to say. Most of us believe that in the near future classes wont be using text books and maybe some might not even be taught by teachers physically being in the classroom. It can get to the point that maybe some sort of laptops or tablets be connected to the students desk. Also it can be a recorded class by the teacher where the student takes notes and goes to a tutoring program or finding a way to contact the teacher for any questions. In conclusion of the topic a student mentioned that having a teacher in the class will be for the rich, who can afford to have one. A school can buy laptops and tablets and not have to worry about paying the teachers in the future. Simply because you only spend once buying the items and not have to pay a yearly salary for a teacher. In my opinion no matter how many classes are made to be taught online, I will always believe that you will learn and understand the class a lot more being taught by a teacher face to face. Do you think this can possibly happen, where technology takes over classrooms? Would having a teacher cost more money?
