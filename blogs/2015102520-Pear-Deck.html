<p><a href="https://www.peardeck.com/">Pear Deck</a> allows teachers to create interactive presentations to share with their students. With this tool, teachers are able to work with their students and assess their progress on learning tasks. This application was created and is maintained by individuals who are passionate about education and the ever-evolving roles that technology plays in the field.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>One of Pear Deck’s most useful features is the fact that users can import presentations they have created in the past (whether through PowerPoint, Google Presentation, or even just PDF) into Pear Deck. Then the presenter can choose different ways to interact with participants during and following the presentation. One of the interactive drawing options—which allows a group to overlay all of their drawings together—is very useful for easily illustrating various perspectives. Other interactive options include the ability to add multiple choice questions, enter text, or move icons during the presentation, and the presenter is able to share participants’ responses anonymously. It also supports embeddable content to create a more media rich experience. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While you can perform many of the basic Pear Deck functions with a free account, some of the more advanced functions are only available with a paid subscription, which can be quite pricey: the professional subscription is $249.99 per year, and even the educator plan is still a hefty $99.99 per year. Also, you must have a Google account in order to use Pear Deck, which could be an issue for teachers depending on their school’s rules regarding personal versus professional email use.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Pear Deck is easy to use, and it includes many exciting interactive features to keep participants engaged in the learning process. It is most useful for individuals who are familiar with Google Apps and are able to integrate these tools into their presentations. For those users who need extra support, there are extensive resources for assistance on the Pear Deck website. Overall, Pear Deck allows you to take basic slide presentations and turn them into a more creative experience for everyone involved. </p>
