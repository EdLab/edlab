<b>Three Primary Programs</b><br>
<a href="http://4pt0.org/">4.0 Schools</a> is "a community of curious people— educators, entrepreneurs, and others— committed to driving change in education" (Watch this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10933">video</a> to learn more about 4.0 Schools).   Located in New Orleans and New York, this organization offers three different programs for people interested in making educational impact: Essentials, Cohort, and Launch.  <a href="http://4pt0.org/essentials">Essentials</a> is a day long program held once a month, where the 15-20 participants explore three skills: "Empathy, Unbundling, and Prototyping" (See this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10935 ">video</a> for a quick overview of what Essentials).  For those seeking to collaboratively solve problems in the current education system, the <a href="http://4pt0.org/cohort">Lab Cohort</a> is a two to ten week program filled with a series of dinners and workshops, where people come together to test solutions for specific problems.  The most intensive program is called <a href="http://4pt0.org/launch">Launch</a>, where participants turn ideas for new schools and organizations into outcomes.
<p>
<b>From Ideas to Solutions</b><br>
Not only are these programs a useful way to bring problem-solvers and those who want to make a change in education together, they also offer participants help with the process of going from an idea to an actual solution.  For example, 4.0 Schools offers coaching, marketing, financial planning, goal planning, and community support; they basically walk the participants through the process of setting up a business with a possible solution.  Furthermore, participants are able to connect with real users such as administrators, educators and learners, by having them test-drive their new solutions.  For now, 4.0 seems to be gaining attention as they gain recognition for their work and as people from across the country apply for their programs.  <a href="http://gettingsmart.com/2012/02/schools-4-0-sweeps-startup-weekend-nyc-edu-awards/">4.0 Schools impressed the judges</a> at the <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend New York City EDU</a> awards in 2012.  In a web 2.0 world it is refreshing to discover a group that is focused on the 4.0 evolution of learning.
