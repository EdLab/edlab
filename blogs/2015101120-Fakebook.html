<p>Did you know that there’s a great free tool online that allows you to create a social media page for fictional and historical figures? <a href="http://www.classtools.net/FB/home-page">Fakebook</a> is a resource that anyone with an internet connection can use to create a living document about a person’s life. Just like Facebook, <i>Fakebook</i> allows you to add pictures, post statuses, write comments, and share videos. You can even make up a list of friends and enemies as well as list family members and important events. Part of the larger collection of educational games and resources that are available on <a href="http://www.classtools.net/">Class Tools,</a> Fakebook takes a platform that is already widely used by students in their leisure time and turns it into a pedagogical tool. </p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Not only is it completely free, but it’s also very simple to use. For students who are already familiar with Facebook, using Fakebook will be like second nature. Since you can add pictures and videos as well as posts and comments, you become more fully immersed in the life and experiences of an historical figure. If you choose a character that is recognized by Fakebook, it will automatically add profile pictures, although you can easily change any of the photos at any time. Another cool feature is that you can search for Fakebook profiles by name, and look through others’ creations to see how they envision a particular person’s online personality. There is also a browsable gallery, which you can peruse by subject category for inspiration. Finally, you can actually add likes to posts and comments and you can control how many likes appear, giving you complete power over how popular—or infamous—a historical figure and their actions appear to be. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are a few minor limitations. Sometimes the point-and-clicking that is required to edit the page can be imprecisely calibrated and lead to some frustration over being unable to quickly and seamlessly edit the profile. Also, you have to create at least two posts before the site permits you to save your work, which can be a hassle if you have already selected photos, listed family members, and posted event dates before realizing you cannot yet save your work. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway: </b></p>
<p>Fakebook is an incredibly immersive and engaging way to explore an historical or even fictional person’s life. Instead of shunning social media, it embraces the very thing that students already enjoy using in their everyday lives. This adds an element of fun to biographical research, which might otherwise be a tiresome task. More traditional projects—creating a timeline or writing a report—may also be effective for learning, but letting students make a social media profile for a person requires just as much research and thought, and is ultimately a more interactive learning experience. By using Fakebook, students may also be better able to empathize with and understand a person who lived and died centuries in the past by imagining a person connecting with their contemporaries in the same way that students connect with their peers today. </p>
