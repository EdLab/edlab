<p><i>"We believe there’s creativity in everyone, and our job is to help find it, grow it and let it out to play."
</i> (<a href="https://www.craftsy.com/about-us">About Craftsy</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>By Makers, for Makers</b></p>
 
<p><a href="https://www.craftsy.com">Craftsy</a> is an online platform for serious crafters. This website, also an app, is similar to Pinterest in craft ideas, but it provides much more educational content. Instead of posting still images with step-by-step instructions listed, Craftsy is full of different video series to educate aspiring crafters on techniques, anywhere from the most basic information to the tricks of pros. This includes classes such as <i>Patternmaking & Design: Creative Necklines</i> and <i>The Baker’s Guide to French Breads</i> (sign me up for this one, please!).</p>
 
<p>Craftsy has over 1,000 online classes in basically any type of crafting you can think of, from quilting to cake decorating to jewelry making. The courses are run by professional crafters, artists, and chefs, some of whom, such as the winners of MasterChef, are big names in their fields. While there are some free courses, most of them have a fee anywhere from $5 to $99. Each course includes a series of high quality videos produced by Craftsy in their studio in Denver, Colorado. Users can buy crafting supplies directly from the website, as well.</p>
 
<p><b>More Educational than Community-building</b></p>
 
<p>While many instructional online sites tend to incorporate elements of social media, Craftsy keeps it simple, sticking primarily to educational content. That said, the site does contains a <i>Member Gallery</i> where crafters can share pictures of their finished products with others. Users can engage in a question and answer with these crafters to get the details of the product as well. This is the closest thing that Craftsy has to an online forum where members can communicate, which by itself isn’t enough to generate a strong sense of community on the site. Despite this, Craftsy certainly achieves what it sets out to do: to create classes for all crafters to improve their skills and foster their crafting passions.</p>
