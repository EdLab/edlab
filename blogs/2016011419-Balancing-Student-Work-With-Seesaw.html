<p>Teachers who have spent years filing stacks of student work into folders and binders may just have a new option—one that not only takes away the need to store mountains of paper but also gives students the autonomy to document their own work. <a href="http://web.seesaw.me/">Seesaw</a> gives students the opportunity to upload audio, PDFs, links, videos, and images—including photos of their work—into a virtual portfolio, which the teacher can then access at any time from his or her device.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages that Seesaw offers is the easy-to-access online record of every single student’s classwork. When students upload their documents, they will know where to find them in the future and their teachers will be able to review them whenever necessary as well. Teachers can even provide access to students for one another’s work, or to parents so that they can keep up with what the class is working on—to answer the age-old question of <i>"What did you do in school today?"</i></p>

<p>Another helpful feature that Seesaw provides is the extra level of organization beyond simply categorizing work by student. Users can also organize items by subject or project, or flag certain documents for later review—especially if it’s something that needs to be brought up at a one-on-one meeting or parent-teacher conference.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Seesaw provides teachers with a substantial amount of support and organization through these ePortfolios, it relies heavily on students’ abilities to upload work independently without too much assistance. Otherwise, teachers will likely feel split fifty different ways in trying to help all students as they try to get their work added to their portfolios. As such, Seesaw may not be best suited for younger age classrooms.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Classrooms these days are moving further and further away from countless handouts and paper copies. But a teacher will undoubtedly assign work that is not entirely digital. Seesaw is providing a great way to integrate those aspects of student work in one easy-to-access portfolio that can help and support teachers, students, and parents alike.</p>
