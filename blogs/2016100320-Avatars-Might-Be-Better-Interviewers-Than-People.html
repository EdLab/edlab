<p>You’re about to be interviewed. Luckily, you can choose the interviewer, and two candidates stand before you: one is a human, the other is a computer avatar. Which do you choose? Findings from a new study reveal that when it comes to relaying personal information, most people would rather be partnered with the latter.</p>
 
<p>Researchers surveyed over 200 university students on their interview preferences and found that when it came to talking about sensitive topics, people felt more comfortable interacting with embodied conversational agents (ECAs) than with humans. ECAs are computer characters, such as avatars, that have human faces, voices, and mannerisms but are non-intelligent. They’re basically an online survey embodied in a computer character.</p>
 
<p>That’s right, although people preferred talking to humans about non-sensitive issues, such as their favorite computer brand, they preferred talking to avatars about sensitive topics, such as ethnicity and income. This was because they felt less judged when discussing these matters with computer characters and could more easily open up. Let’s face it; discussing sensitive information with a stranger isn’t the easiest thing to do, but there’s a lot less pressure when the stranger is digital, non-intelligent, and on a screen.</p>
 
<p>Avatars and other ECAs will likely never replace human interviewers, but this study demonstrates that they could play an important role in collecting sensitive personal information. In particular, avatars may enhance screening processes, research surveys, and even journalistic endeavors. Now, you’re choosing whether to interview 200 people on their lying habits using a human or computer interviewer. Which do you choose?</p>
