<p><a href="http://www.unboundconcepts.com">Artifact</a> considers itself the <a href=" http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> of books. Much like the beloved playlist-generating site, Artifact helps users find children’s books based on specific themes or plot points. Because it also catalogues accelerated reader points and reading levels, this tool is most useful for teachers and parents and can be used as a website or app.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The idea behind Artifact is original and worthwhile. Users tag each book with "artifacts," or themes and subject matter, that arise in the book. For instance, <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> is tagged with artifacts such as "bravery," "animal friends," and "good vs. evil." This information is mostly crowd sourced, meaning site users can add artifacts to any book in the database. Each artifact also comes with a description and quote from the book that demonstrates its relevance in the text. In addition, users can search for books by reading level, accelerated reader points, authors, or publishers.</p>
 
<p>One of the most useful parts of Artifact is that it provides public book lists on specific themes, which are also added by community members. Users can create their own lists or browse ones such as "children’s books with diverse characters" and "children’s books about activism and social justice."</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Artifact seems like the type of site that lost steam shortly after jumping off the starting blocks. It probably has almost every children’s book you can think of listed in its database, but many don’t have attached artifacts yet, most likely because the Artifact community still seems small. In addition, although you can theoretically search for books by both theme and reading level simultaneously, the site never produced results this way when tried. Instead, it only worked when searching one parameter at a time. This greatly limits the usefulness of Artifact.</p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, the user interface is not incredibly intuitive. Users will likely have to pluck around the site for a chunk of time before having a successful search. This is particularly true of the iPad app, which is much more unwieldy and less directed than the website.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Although Artifact is a great idea, its poor execution makes it frustrating and cumbersome to use. If more people joined the online community and contributed to the book tagging process, the site would be much more useful than it currently is. That said, it could still be a valuable tool to identify themes in a specific book or search for a booklist on a particular topic.</p>
