<p>While the coal mining industry has long supported many Appalachian communities, jobs in mines are rapidly disappearing, causing residents to lose work and leave their hometowns. For those hoping to preserve the community they’ve long been a part of, options may seem few and far between. However, thanks to the plethora of information at the fingertips of anyone with access to internet, a town in Kentucky was bolstered when they undertook an innovative experiment to reinvigorate their community’s economic landscape.</p>

<p>Thanks to a connection to the software development world and a lot of YouTube how-to videos, a group of former coal miners have taught themselves to code. After engaging in both online and in-person training, the company formed by these individuals, <a href="https://www.bitsourceky.com/">Bitsource</a>, now creates websites and apps for clients across the country. The company hopes that through supporting the learning of new job skills they can sustain the community they love.</p>

<p>Bitsource was launched largely because one of the founders’ cousins was a software developer and was willing to help the company find its footing. What is the role of networking and connection in learning? What other skills beyond programming do you think these individuals are learning by working in this new environment and industry? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50767">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:45 Anna Curry:</b> I think relationships are incredibly important to learning. We achieve nothing alone and our ability to succeed depends upon the help of many people seen and unseen. So I think having a connection with someone who understood both the community and technology was critical to the success of this endeavor.</p>

<p><b>@01.59 Christine Odenath:</b> Coal mining was a highly localized job. Contrastingly, coding will likely require daily interactions with a network of colleagues that extends beyond the town in which they live and work.</p>
