<p>For those of us who experience test-taking anxiety, it’s clear that emotions can have a big impact on learning and educational performance. Yet, current e-learning systems do not take into account the emotional state of learners. What if an online class could tell how you felt about different lessons and adapt its pedagogy accordingly? </p>
 
<p>Researchers in this study were interested in developing a method for capturing the emotions of students using biophysical feedback and facial expression. A group of 129 college students and staff were observed during 30 20-minute sessions. Researchers used sensors to measure heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity; they also empoyed a spot detection technique using a webcam to capture the facial expressions of participants. Researchers developed a computer algorithm that fused biophysical and facial feedback to identify one of six emotions. The program then automatically selected the most appropriate lesson based on the particular emotional state of the learner. Participants were also given questionnaires to check the accuracy of the emotion detection techniques.</p>

<p>Researchers found that they were able to identify participant emotions with a high degree of accuracy when compared with questionnaire responses. They hope that this technology will lead to a new model of <i>affective e-learning</i>, in which learning management systems will be able to instantly identify emotions and deliver each student an individualized pedagogy.</p>
 
<p>What does this study mean for the future of learning? Imagine an online course that knows when you are struggling with a concept or when you are enjoying a particular exercise and can then adapt future lessons accordingly. This opens the door to truly personalized learning experiences. Still, an educational model that relies on monitoring users emotions raises ethical questions, and many of us wouldn’t be comfortable sharing such sensitive information. I wonder if simply asking e-learners to self-report their emotions could be equally (if not more) informative and far less intrusive.</p>
