          <p>
            It's hard sometimes to pin down the reason I was drawn to education as a part of life about which to try to become expert. What part of education was it, anyway, to which I was most drawn? Surely there are a million parts: the power, the neurons, the changes in behavior, the institutions, the time it takes, the obvious achievements and the more invisible ones, and so on. All of which, alas, are more interesting to me everyday.

So how does one choose to ply his or her trade in this expansive field we call 'educational research?' In my past work, I have begun to explore the role of 'genius' as a model – I just haven't figured out how, in my own life, to deviate less from the norm that I imagined: that people who follow in the paths of others (whether consciously or not) are 'selected for' (in Darwin's terms) in the activities that are the backbone of social life...<!--break-->

(Well, what can I say, that's as far as I got.)

Then there are moments where I doubt that education is really all it's cracked up to be. Like now, as I'm thinking of two incongruent matters: a war on the other side of the world, and PocketKnowledge.

As most of you know, my wife, Suzanne, is Lebanese. This past week has been an awful week for Lebanon, and a trying time for my extended family. While there are great resources for understanding the roots of the current conflict (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">bbc news</a>, <a href="http://lebanon-2006.blogspot.com/">various blogs</a>, etc.), yesterday there was a particularly well-written article by a British journalist (here found in an Australian news source) entitled <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/21/1153166583302.html">A Farewell to Beirut</a>.

While this is a journalist's article, I noticed he includes a few references to his personal "archives" on Lebanon's history. His thoughtful and poetic use of these old newspaper clippings and photographs offers us a clue, I think, about the potential importance of institutional archives for educational researchers in the coming era of PocketKnowledge.

To wit: archival content is commonly thought to be most important when used to illustrate a historical argument. For example, the researcher finds materials from an earlier era that support his argument that there are trends in the history of violence on Beirut. Unfortunately, his argument is largely disconnected from the larger socio-political world in which this violence takes place. It appeals more strongly to our emotions than to our intellect (though certainly to both).

Enter the social, online archive. Wouldn't it be nice if said reporter was able discover what kind of archives the whole world kept in the wake of those events? Not just the polished articles and well-indexed materials, but everything else? Were the digital tools made powerfully enough, he could not only report back what was in the archive and what it meant, but how it was related (statistically speaking) to everything else.

Well, yes. Sort of. But,

Maybe his shoebox is good enough. What I'm trying to think around is what good will come of "embedding" research into our tools. (This is the humanities side of me trying to make sense of the 'reporting' features of websites.)

In particular, what will be able to be shown once there are a million items in PocketKnowledge. Sure, we'll still need good research questions and methodologies, but will the magnitude of the data set (the archive and its community) really make the results more convincing?

Maybe my dilemma (trying to think this through) is that I still want to relate these results back to education proper. And even though PK is a tool for a community of educational researchers – and this makes me excited about the kind of content that will be collected – what it will really tell us about is the use of a tool.

Oh how I wish it were more clear what we need to know to turn the world around...
