<p>One major distinction between face-to-face and online courses, says Mary Stewart, an Associate Instructor at the University Writing Program, is that everything needs to be written out for the latter, whereas in the former, much of the content can be communicated verbally in passing. But thatâ€™s not the only difference between the two, and Stewart notes that without thinking critically about those differences, instructors can get complacent about the structure of their face-to-face courses, especially because they have been academically successful for so long.</p>

<p>Some might argue that in the current movement of rapid development of online courses, much of the innovative curricular attention at higher education institutions may be focused on MOOCs and open courseware options. Yet hybrid and face-to-face courses will likely need the same type of attention and care to ensure that they are streamlined and effective in their instruction. </p>

<p>What are some of the main differences between online and face-to-face teaching? In what ways does face-to-face instruction need to be improved at higher education institutions? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/28318/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:41 beckieb:</b> I expect that more teachers are going to use online teaching methods. Although the face to face element really can't be replaced, a teacher's response times can be just as quick as in person. There are many creative ways that students can engage in a course remotely. For example, live group chats where instructors can instantaneously respond to student inquiries. The huge benefit to this structure, is that students can always have a record of these conversations to go back to.</p>

<p><b>@02:52 beckieb:</b> Some courses don't necessitate facilitators like others do. I say allocate the time and resources to dense courses that require that sort of attention, and rely on online elements to cover the more foundational ones.</p>
