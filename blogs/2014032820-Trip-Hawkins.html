<a href="https://twitter.com/realtriphawkins">Trip Hawkins</a> designed his major at Harvard University (Strategy & Applied Game Theory) and has fittingly brought a similar level of innovation and outside-the-box thinking to his career. With founding and executive leadership roles at companies ranging from <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130129/we_see_farther__a_history_of_.php?print=1">Apple</a> to <a href="http://www.ea.com/history">Electronic Arts (EA),</a> Hawkins has been at the forefront of one digital wave after another. When Hawkins joined Apple in the late 70’s the fledgling tech company only had 25 employees. During his tenure as head of marketing, Hawkins helped grow the team to over 4,000. Hawkins left Apple in ‘82 to found EA and was responsible for creating at least one genre of video game, <a href="http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2014/01/09/detail/madden-nfl-25-years-and-running/">Madden NFL</a>, while spurring the development of many other PC industry breakthroughs. As the founder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_3DO_Company">3DO</a>, Hawkins helped usher in the era of powerful, immersive gaming platforms that we currently enjoy. Hawkins has stepped away from our existing concept of "gaming" once more, with his new venture, <a href="http://www.ifyoucan.org/">If You Can Company</a>, and their newly released iPad-based game, <a href="http://www.ifyoucan.org/what-is-if/">"IF…"</a>. Meant to teach children <a href="http://www.ifyoucan.org/what-is-sel/">Social and Emotional Learning skills</a>, the game is a unique addition to the gaming landscape and a much needed potential antidote to the <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/news/media/facts/">bullying crisis</a> in US schools (for more on "If…" read <a href=
https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1492
">this EdLab Review piece</a>).  Hawkins also currently advises digital game and technology companies including <a href="https://www.kixeye.com/">Kixeye</a>, <a href="http://nativex.com/">NativeX</a> and <a href="http://www.xtr3d.com/">Extreme Reality 3D</a>. He was the eighth person to be inducted into the prestigious <a href="http://www.interactive.org/special_awards/">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame</a> and is the only person to receive an <a href="http://www.ieee.org/about/index.html">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</a> lifetime achievement award.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Totally!  I knew as a child that I wanted to make games because of their learning power and I created the first college degree in the topic.  My mentor and thesis leader later won a Nobel Prize for work in Game Theory.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Leading collaborative teams of experts to make EA Sports games.  I'm now using the same model but have changed the subject from sports like football to the now-critical educational curriculum of SEL (Social and Emotional Learning).

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> 
Along with other leading learning games such as <a href="http://www.simcityedu.org/">SimCityEDU</a> and <a href="http://www.dragonboxapp.com/">Dragonbox</a>, we hope to help create a new industry that joins a fun gameplay foundation to real curriculum and legitimate methods of assessment.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> We learn by doing, hence it is essential to leverage technology and game mechanics in 21st century learning.  Learning must also begin with attention and be sustained by student motivation; today's digital natives are on device, playing a game, and we need to meet them where they are.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> <a href="http://www.ifyoucan.org/">IF…</a> is a new game for iPad that introduces and teaches the principles and skills of SEL (Social and Emotional Learning).  Over the course of the year we will expand device support to all tablets, smartphones and PCs.
