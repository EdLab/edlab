            I'm reading Alvin Toffler's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4375.Revolutionary_Wealth">Revolutionary Wealth</a> and there's an interesting chapter on America's school system that I'd like to sum up and share.

<h2>Background</h2>
It should be noted, for those who are not familiar with Alvin Toffler's elements, that he divided revolutions and wealth into three waves:

<b>The First Wave: The Shift from Hunting and Gathering to Sowing and Reaping</b>
The first revolution happened when humans stopped being nomadic and started planting. This caused our ancestors to root down and start innovating under more stability.

<b>The Second Wave: The Industrial Revolution</b>
The second revolution, as we know, started with the mass production of goods through hard factories, hard labors and arcane machines. Peasants (the adopters of the First Wave) moved into the city factories and created what he referred to as the "Second Wealth."

<b>The Third (and ongoing) Wave: The Now</b>
The ongoing Third Wave is described as a fast-paced, ever changing "mashups" of olds and news and chaotic flow of data, information and knowledge. Computers play a great part in this revolution resulting in a world culture that's moving toward serving, experiencing and customization, instead of mass production.

<h2>The Leaders and Laggards</h2>
Toffler used a metaphor of cars on the street running at different speeds to represent the institutions in the Third Wave.

<b>100 mph</b>
Zooming along at great speed on our figurative freeway is a care representing the fastest-changing major institution in America today--<b>the company or business</b>. In the business world, technology blazes ahead at a pace very often faster than managers and employees can handle. Competition drives businesses to undergo changes at amazing speeds and being slightly less nimble can mean death. Most innovations happen in this car.

<b>90 mph</b>
The car speeding right behind business is <b>Civil Society</b>, considered collectively. It is comprised of NGOs, coalitions, professional groups, associations, human right activists and vice versa. These people are in the business of "demanding changes", often from government and business. They are what drives change. They are small, fast and flexible. This car both honks at the business car in front and taunt those behind it often in the form of protest, media rant, online crowdsourcing, etc.

<b>60 mph</b>
This car is the <b>American family</b>. Since the 1960s, the family institute has undergone enormous changes from nuclear family settings (in the First Wave, it was extended) with a working father, stay-at-home mom and two children under 18 to single-parented, unmarried couple, once-, twice- (or more) remarried couple with children from previous marriage, geriatric marriages and recently, legalized gay civil unions, if not marriages. Family adapts to the revolutionary changes pretty well, since it's a survival matter.

<b>30 mph</b>
This car is the <b>Labor Union</b>. American unions remain frozen in amber, saddled with legacy organizations, methods and models left over from the 1930s and the mass-production era. In 1955, U.S. labor unions represented 33 percent of the total workforce. Today that number is 12.5 percent. The nature of work and job has transformed, and they just couldn't keep up.

<b>25 mph</b>
No, not the school yet. This car is the <b>government bureaucracies and regulatory agencies</b>. Skilled at deflecting criticism and delaying change for decades at a time, pyramidal bureaucracies run the day-to-day affairs of governments all over the world.
Not only do they themselves change slowly; they slow the pace at which business can respond to fast-moving market conditions.

<b>10 mph</b>
But even bureaucrats, as they look out their rearview mirror, can glimpse a car far behind them. This car shudders along with a flat tire and steam coming out of its trunk, slowing down all the traffic behind it. This car costs <b>$400 billion to maintain each year</b>.This car is the <b>American school system</b> (and I'd say most systems in many other countries). Designed for mass production, operated like factories, managed bureaucratically, protected by powerful trade unions and politicians dependent on teachers' votes, they're perfect reflections of the early twentieth-century economy. 

Despite a growing number of educational experiments, the core of U.S. public education remains the factory-style school designed for industrial age.
