            Calvin Coolidge once said “the business of America is business,” and back in the 1920's the phrase applied because business was booming and America was experiencing its golden age but if we were to apply the quote to America now, it would have a totally different connotation. Now, the business of America is business because it has permeated every aspect of the culture, and every angle of life is treated as a business.

Today I read an article in <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1648022,00.html?iid=feed-biz_rotate_ad6 ">Time</a> Magazine that talked about placing A.T.M. machines in churches to make donations simpler.  That doesn't seem right to me at all.  Last time I checked you donated money to church in a little white envelope that you pressed between the pages in your Bible to keep nice and crisp but now churches want you to break out your plastic, swipe, and donate?  This is a strategy that department stores use to get you to spend more money.  

Nowadays people don't tend to carry much cash around, so once they hit the shopping mall the handy-dandy A.T.M. is there to make spending vast amounts of money “more convenient” for the customer of course.  I'm not badmouthing churches in any sense, but I just don't understand why there is a need for A.T.M. machines when people usually have the exact amount of cash they want to donate to church ready on Sunday morning.       

Also, another place that has turned into a business is the home.  Parents resemble C.E.O.'s more and more everyday.  In today's world money is ever present, and with new charges, taxes, rising gas prices, a mom or a dad can't help but run the home like a business by allocating the family's income to all the necessary places.  Of course parents had to do this job in the past, but in today's capitalistic world, its key for a family to have a set budget and to really focus on finances; and the main place where all the money goes is usually the children.

Kids have become an extension of the “business” at home.  Kids are like an investment for parents everywhere.  For example, parents send their kids to ballet, tap, jazz, horseback riding, swimming, and SAT prep on Mondays to Fridays and yoga, gymnastics, belly dancing and basketball on weekends, and they cross their fingers and hope for the best.  Parents put time and money into a kid and hope that they go out into the world, get into an Ivy League school and bring home a new Hummer for dad and a Gazebo for mom.  Money is poured into a kid because parents want their children to become moguls and make Gazillion dollars a year and ultimately pay them back for all the pasta dinners and the hours spent chauffeuring little Tina back and forth from class to class.  

So I would say Coolidge was onto something, because America definitely means business.
