          <p>
            Child obesity has become a prominent problem across many communities in the United States. First lady Michelle Obama, among other prominent politicians, has sought to find a solution through initiatives such as <a href=http://www.letsmove.gov/>Lets Move</a>, which aims to create healthier lunch food options in schools, and promote daily physical activity.  This <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/education/even-as-schools-battle-obesity-physical-education-is-sidelined.html?_r=2&ref=education">New York Times article</a> sheds light on how many school programs aimed at decreasing childhood obesity are facing cuts due to budget concerns. Another major problem facing the fight against childhood obesity is space, as many schools do not have the necessary space on their campus for students to do any physical activity. Even for those schools that do have the space, finding appropriate instructors for physical activities is proving difficult.

I think schools should do whatever they have to do to make sure physical activity and regular physical education class remains part of their schools. For most students who do not play sports in or outside of school, gym class might be their only form of physical activity and even if it is for 45 minutes a day, students will leave knowing they've done something that will contribute to their overall health. Couple this with a health class, which usually informs students on proper nutrition and healthcare and students should at least be getting a good amount of information on how to remain active and ultimately not become obese.

 

Why do you think schools have decided to cut physical education classes when there is a push by politicians alike to make it a big part of school life?
