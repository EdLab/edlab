James Huggins is the Co-Founder of <a href="http://www.madeinme.com/">Made in Me,</a> a creative studio exploring new ways for technology to inspire millennials. The team produces apps, games, websites and video content for major clients including Penguin Random House, LEGO, and McDonalds. Their in-house projects include the BAFTA-nominated apps <i>Sneak</i> and <i>The Land of Me</i> as well as <i>Me Books</i>, an award-winning ebook app and online shop that has seen more than a million digital books downloaded since launch. Previously James was the Managing Director of Escape Studios, a company he helped grow from a startup to become one of the foremost computer graphics academies in the world, before it was acquired by Pearson in 2013. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I think it's inevitable that these things are all directly connected. Ironically much of what I do now in interactive design and software development is informed by activities I pursued outside of my academic career. I dropped out of Edinburgh University after two years studying philosophy and psychology, as I wanted to pursue graphic and web design, something I'd been doing in my spare time. Often the words <i>education</i> and <i>academic</i> are seen as interchangeable, but that's far from true. My educational trajectory has been the product of a supportive family and parents that were happy for me to deviate, as long as I did so with genuine effort. As a result I've had an incredibly rewarding and satisfying career so far, albeit littered with countless fascinating failures! </p> 

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
We founded Made in Me as a creative studio to try new things with technology. But we learned the hard way that it's not enough to make great work in a vacuum under the impression that everyone thinks and behaves in the same way. Our early projects were bold and award winning, but failed to take into account the challenges of the educational technology landscape. Because we're fond of simplicity as a design principle we've become increasingly obsessed with simple, powerful ideas that perform one function and perform it well. I'm not sure if our work will do anything as dramatic as change the learning landscape, but we're excited to be part of the shift which is unquestionably taking place and at a profound level. There's a lot of rhetoric in education about teaching kids to think outside the box and be more creative and courageous. It's ironic then that there's so little of that happening at the decision maker level. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
Technology will continue to make it easier to be flexible—not just in education, but in every aspect of our lives: more people will be working from home or on flexible terms and more forms of work will emerge connected with technology or enabled by it. For example, you can now set up and run an online shop with the bulk of its operation, payments, and order fulfillment taken care of by third parties. Barriers to entry in all kinds of new and existing industries will continue to fall away, creating the most dynamic and rapidly changing society in history. Set against this backdrop, maintaining a single format for education is going to be impossible—but I'm not worried about it, I think it's incredibly exciting. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> 
We're currently working on a series of new mobile games aimed at children with special needs, as well as a large piece of work for McDonald's connected with literacy and reading. There are a few projects we'd like to do next—one in particular that involves using technology to encourage kids to engage in all kinds of diverse playful activities on and away from the computer. It's a long way from confirmed yet but it's got us excited regardless! </p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
This is hard because I follow a lot of interesting people on Twitter. Here are three that are different, but fantastic in their own way: <a href="https://twitter.com/DIY">@DIY</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTonyWagner">@DrTonyWagner</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/brainpicker">@brainpicker</a>.</p>
