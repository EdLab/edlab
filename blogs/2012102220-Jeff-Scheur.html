<i>I love that more teachers are getting involved in entrepreneurial ventures, and I think it's one of the best ways for educators to shape the discourse.  The ed-tech space sorely needs more teacher contributions, and anyone who thinks otherwise just isn't paying attention.</i><b> Jeff Scheur</b>
<p>
<br>
<b>Experience is the Mother of Invention</b>
<p>
After grading over 15,000 student papers and working for 8 years as a Chicago-area high school English teacher, Jeff Scheur left his teaching post to head to a leading startup "incubator" in Palo Alto, CA called <a href="http://www.imaginek12.com/">ImagineK12</a>.    Focused on educational technology, ImagineK12 provides working space, mentorship and funds to help startups in the educational technology field to get off the ground.  Scheur, who has an undergraduate degree from Oberlin College and graduate degree from the University of Michigan, started his company, <a href="http://noredink.com/">NoRedInk</a>, to meet a need he saw first-hand as a teacher, to engage students more fully around the process of learning grammar.  With the goal of creating, "tools that allowed kids to get more rapid feedback while leveraging their specific interests" and more closely resembling Star Magazine, instead of <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">Strunk & White</a>, NoRedInk empowers students to learn the difference between a parenthesis and a paragraph break through the subjects they often care most about: sports, celebrities and pop figures.  The site utilizes interactive text and popular elements of social media to allow students to personalize the topics and content they will engage with to sharpen their grammar skills.  World’s away from the dry, traditional textbooks of the past 100 years and powered by adaptive technologies and formative assessment, NoRedInk presents a learning experience for both educators and learners that more closely resembles Facebook than traditional "skill & drill" exercises.  Perhaps of most interest to Scheur, who started his company after tiring of seeing nothing but "red ink" and very little meaningful progress, the site helps educators to move beyond standardized tests that often provide limited information to both learners and educators.  "The fact that schools feel compelled to drill kids to death on standardized assessments is a tremendous shame… the way to cultivate great thinkers is to breed curiosity, confidence, and passion, and that doesn't happen if all kids are doing is bubbling in Scantrons." 
<p>

<b>Rise of the "Teacherpreneurs," Fall of the Teacher?</b>
<p>

If teachers like Scheur begin to leave the field to become "teacherpreneurs," will we be in danger of losing even more innovative, motivated educators who are willing to work on the "front lines" of America’s schools?  Through new incubator programs like ImagineK12, devoted to supporting and growing educational technology startups like NoRedInk, we just might be faced with this "Catch22."  By providing funding, exposure and mentorship, other educators like Scheur may increasingly decide to leave teaching in the trenches behind for the potential promise of the comparably more luxe life of a "founder."  On the flip-side, while contributing to the diminishing ranks of qualified teachers, "teacherpreneurs" will undoubtedly provide unique value to the field of edtech.  As Alex Sarlin, Senior Producer at Scholastic points out, "Teachers (like Scheur) bring amazing domain knowledge to a team; they understand how teachers plan, their technological and time limitations, and the strength of teacher communities."  Perhaps during his experience at ImagineK12 Scheur will help to grow the community of practice and body of knowledge that will help to push-forward the field of "teacherpreneurship" and inspire other educators to follow-suit. Despite potentially draining the pool of available teachers, when all is said and done, who better to help develop educational technology, than practitioners themselves?  Teacherpreneurship would then be a true model of bottom-up development by the people on the ground who understand the space the most... teachers and not only technologists.
