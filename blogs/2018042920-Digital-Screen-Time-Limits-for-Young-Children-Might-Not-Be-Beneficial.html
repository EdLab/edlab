<p>Device and screen usage has been a growing concern for parents and educators. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends limiting screen time for young children to around one or two hours per day. However, researchers are still trying to understand the relationship between childhood development and this technology. In a study of almost 20,000 participants, a team actually found that AAPâ€™s limits have no association with child psychological well-being.</p>  

<p>The team utilized a national representative sample of parents with children between the ages of two and five from the UK. Through phone interviews, caregivers were asked to make assessments related to their child's attachment, resilience, curiosity, and positivity, along with digital screens usage. The researchers were looking to test the claims popularized through AAP. </p>  
  
<p>There were clear demographic divides in the results. Screen usage was lower for females, white children, and children from affluent and educated households. Screen usage also increased with age.</p>

<p>In a basic statistical test, children within the AAP screen limits showed slightly higher levels of resilience, but also lower levels of positivity compared to other children. When the demographic controls were included, these tiny disparities disappeared between the groups. While results did differ along demographic lines, the researchers found that the benefits of AAP screen time limits are not empirically supported. In fact, they contend there may actually be some small psychological benefits to extreme screen usage of up to seven hours per day.</p>

<p>While the researchers do not recommend simply plopping down every kid in front of a TV all day, they do want to illustrate that long-held guidelines should be given second thought. The team believes that some of these notions have been formulated through studies of older children and that more research needs to be done on younger kids. Specifically, they would like to expand this research over a longer period and in other areas of wellness, such as sleep quality and peer relationships.
