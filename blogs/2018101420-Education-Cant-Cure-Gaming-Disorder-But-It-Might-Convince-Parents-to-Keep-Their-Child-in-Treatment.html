<p>Earlier this year when the World Health Organization (WHO) officially recognized gaming disorder as a diagnosable condition, the announcement was met with controversy both across medical communities and among the general public. <a href="http://www.who.int/features/qa/gaming-disorder/en/"> Gaming disorder is defined by WHO</a> as a pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over the activity that results in increasingly prioritizing games over other interests and daily activities. While many surveys have been completed by teens with internet gaming disorder, the condition lacks clinical study. To fill this gap in knowledge, a group of researchers recently set out to pin down this condition’s defining characteristics, and to study the effectiveness of treatment and parent education on gaming disorder.</p>
 
<p>The study consisted of 30 male patients, between the ages of 12 and 21, who were admitted to a specialized mental health unit in Spain for gaming disorder treatment, as well as 30 healthy control participants. All participants were interviewed, evaluated by a symptom checklist, and given a self-administered personality test and diagnostic questionnaires.</p> 

<p>The experimental group all received cognitive behavioral therapy in weekly and later biweekly sessions, with education on gaming disorder, strategies to avoid and change risky behavior, and relapse-prevention techniques. In addition, this group was subdivided so that the parents of 15 patients received psychoeducation while the parents of the other 15 did not. The former received instruction to help them better understand behavioral addictive disorders, improve their communication skills, and set limits for their children.</p>

<p>Though the study found no significant differences between the mental health of those with gaming disorder and healthy individuals beyond the diagnostic characteristics of the condition, patients being treated scored higher for introversion, were more concerned about their identity, valued themselves less, and were more insecure in peer relationships than healthy subjects. After completing cognitive behavioral therapy, patients reported fewer symptoms and demonstrated fewer diagnostic criteria for gaming disorder. While parent psychoeducation didn’t seem to reduce symptoms in patients, it did result in fewer dropouts from the rehabilitation program.</p>

<p>Though increased education didn’t directly cure gaming disorder, it clearly had an impact on parents by seemingly convincing them of the importance of treatment, both for themselves and for their children. The groundwork laid by this study shows the importance of educating not only patients but also their loved ones, to increase the chances of successful recovery.</p>
