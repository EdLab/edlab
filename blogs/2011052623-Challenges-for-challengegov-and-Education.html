          <p>
            In my wanderings on the microblogging platform Tumblr, I was surprised to discover three things: challenge.gov, its minimal impression on the world of social media, and its lack of challenge. <a href="http://challenge.gov/">Challenge.gov</a> was formally launched on September 7, 2010 as "an online challenge platform...that empowers the U.S. Government and the public to bring the best ideas and top talent to bear on our nation's most pressing challenges." The premise is simple: government agencies post challenges, citizens promote them through social media outlets, experts rise to the challenge, and creative solutions are born. Recently, Pop! Tech promoted challenge.gov on their featured Tumblr to little note. This raises some concern because social media outlets like Tumblr are supposed to be the driving force behind the website.

The challenge.gov Twitter account actually has fewer followers than Teachers College's. Another concern is that most of the challenges are actually essay, video, or apps competitions and not actually calls for innovation of the type that was described upon its launch. The category with the most challenges and largest number of actual challenges? Science and Technology. The most active agencies posing real challenges? NASA and the Department of Defense. Currently the education category only has 14 challenges, of which only one is related to solving issues in education and not an aforementioned competition. The challenge was entitled Challenge to Innovate (C2i) and had two phases. It closed in January of this year and the winners of the challenge are posted on the Department of Education's website, but there has been little continued discussion or dissemination of the ideas.  It seems like education is having difficulty catching up in not only innovation, but in trying to bring about innovation.
