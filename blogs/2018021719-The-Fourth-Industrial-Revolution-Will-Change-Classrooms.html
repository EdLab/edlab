<p><i>"Learning is changing, classrooms are not." </i> (<a href="https://room2learn.org/about">About Room2Learn</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The New Industrial Revolution</b></p>

<p>During the Industrial Revolution, classrooms adopted the traditional design: desks in rows facing a chalkboard. This setup mirrored the mentality of the time, that productive information transfer happens assembly line style, from one person to the next. More than 150 years later, most classrooms still adopt this set up. Yet many scholars believe we are in the midst of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/">a new Industrial Revolution</a> characterized by AI, robotics, and the Internet of Things, to name a few elements. The question is, how will classrooms adapt to this new age?</p>

<p><b>Adapting Spaces to New Learning Styles</b></p>

<p><a href="https://room2learn.org">Room2Learn</a> is bringing education into the 21st century by working with teachers and designers to create spaces that fit the needs of contemporary learners. Room2Learn’s co-founders, Jane Zhang and Grace O’Shea, believe students today need more than just information; they need to cultivate skills such as digital literacy, socio-emotional learning, and empathy. To do this, not only do students need a new curriculum, they also need new spaces.</p>
 
<p>As a design consultancy agency, Room2Learn helps schools and other educational institutions identify the learning needs and goals of their students, and then design innovative and exciting spaces around those needs. For example, they might build into a space private nooks for students who need quiet reflection, or mobile desks to encourage dynamic collaboration. Unlike traditional classrooms, Room2Learn’s mobile spaces constantly adapt to the day’s lesson. By adapting the classrooms to learning needs, students’ become co-creators of the space and take more responsibility for their education.</p>
 
<p>To determine the design features most supportive for learning in their unique classrooms, teachers can take <a href="https://room2learn.org/survey">a quiz</a> on the Room2Learn website. They can also browse Room2Learn’s curated collection of furniture to see pieces that fit their needs. Unlike classrooms in traditonal schools, not all classrooms today are the same, and by helping teachers innovate learning spaces, Room2Learn supports the individuality of each classroom.</p>
