<b>Bringing Arts Education to California Students</b><br>
With the heavy reduction and in many cases, elimination of art programs due to budget cuts since the 1970s and 1980s, it has become increasingly important to create supplementary arts education opportunities for children to learn about creativity and to express themselves.  This is why <a href="http://psarts.org/">P.S. ARTS</a> was formed: to help create opportunities for thousands of students from underserved public elementary and middle schools.  The program allows these learners to take art classes at least once a week throughout the school year (learn how P.S. ARTS describes themselves in this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10885">video</a>).  Currently, P.S. ARTS is the only organization in Southern and Central California that provides yearlong arts education for students in dance, music, visual arts, and theater arts. 
<p>
<b>Different Program Options</b><br>
P.S. ARTS offers a variety of programs and <a href="http://psartsfan.eventbrite.com/">events</a>, dedicated to children with different interests and needs.  For example, they collaborate with many California school districts to create <a href="http://psarts.org/programs/partner-programs/">partner programs</a>, where they provide quality arts instruction at schools.  Young people who are not enrolled in the program can also participate and create art projects via resources included in the <a href="http://psarts.org/programs/to-go-projects/">To Go! Projects</a> portion of the P.S. ARTS website (see an <a href="http://psarts.org/pdfs/P.S.ARTS_to_go_Bearden_E.pdf">example of a To Go! Project</a>).  
<p>
Not only does P.S. ARTS fill an at-home need, but there are a variety of program options for in-class learning as well provided by a team of qualified and passionate art instructors who administer lessons (learn more about their <a href="http://psarts.org/team/teaching-artists/"> teaching artists</a>).  In addition, P.S. ARTS provides valuable <a href="http://psarts.org/programs/professional-development/">professional development programs</a> for teaching artists, classroom teachers, and school district administrators.  This programing includes workshops, coaching, and mentoring sessions that help ensure that teachers have excellent lesson plans and resources for their students.
<p>
<b>Achieving The Best Learning Outcomes Possible</b><br>
In addition to their in-class, at-home, and professional development programs, P.S. ARTS also created a way to measure learning outcomes.  This <a href="http://psarts.org/programs/evaluations/">evaluation protocol</a> covers four categories: curriculum quality, instructional quality, student academic and social performance, and partner school or district satisfaction.  So far, the results have been positive with the majority of schools reporting that their students demonstrated improved confidence, critical thinking, vocabulary, cooperation, and social skills after participating in P.S. ARTS programs.  With so many program options, in combination with systematic evaluation, P.S. ARTS brings more than just arts education to students.
