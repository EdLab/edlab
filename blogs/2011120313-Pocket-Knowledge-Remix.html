          <p>
            I was wondering what people think about widening the focus of Pocket Knowledge from archiving and self-publishing within the TC community to a broader set of  education institutions. PK could open up to perhaps 3-5 top education research schools and, in addition to it's current purposes, be used as a person-to-person academic connection tool within the research community. Researchers across institutions can not only see what others are interested in, but what they're working on too (should they choose to share it). This would hopefully foster a new set of academic collaborations and rivalries. 

Reporting shows PK has seen a fairly steady decline in usage from '07-'09. Developing a cross-institutional base could help create the critical mass necessary to drive continuous commentary/discussion and the desire for users to post new work more frequently. In Spring '09, 37% of the files posted had public permissions and 38% were viewable university-wide, so it seems users are willing to share their work, we might just need to push them to do so.

I know this sounds similar to what EdNode can provide from a profile perspective and we don't want to have overlapping products, but maybe there's merit in tying parts of PK to EdNode? 

This will also raise issues of content quality control on PK, but by limiting the size of the network to a few institutions, this should not become too unwieldy.
