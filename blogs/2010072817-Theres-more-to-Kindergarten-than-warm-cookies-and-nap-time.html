            In high school drama club we took the book “All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten” and adapted it for the stage.  It was pretty awful. In fact, forget I mentioned it. What was my point again?

Oh, right.  Kindergarten.  It turns out what you learn in Kindergarten might really <i>be</i> what sets you up for success in life.  

By looking at the results of an education experiment done with children in the ‘80s, Raj Chetty of Harvard University found that some kindergarten teachers helped their students learn more than other teachers did [<a href="http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/STAR_slides.pdf">study can be found here</a>].  Chetty then looked at how the study participants, now in their 30s, are doing today.  

His conclusions are pretty remarkable: 

<li> Students who had learned much more in kindergarten were more likely to go to college than students who learned less.</li>
<li> Students who learned more were also less likely to become single parents.</li>
<li> Students who learned more <I>earned more money</i> as adults</li>


And, perhaps most astounding of all...  Chetty estimates that, based on the earned income of an entire class,  an outstanding kindergarten teacher is worth $320,000.  

For more details, check out the story in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/business/economy/28leonhardt.html?_r=1&hp">the New York Times.  </a>

Is it too late to go back to Kindergarten?
