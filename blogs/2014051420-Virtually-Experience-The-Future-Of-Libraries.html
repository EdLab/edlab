<p>Costing $261 million to build, at 31,000 square meters and with 3.5 million visitors annually, the <a href="http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/">Library of Birmingham</a> is a massive government-funded project in library innovation. This video offers a fly-through of the library. The visual experience of cutting edge work in library design leaves viewers rethinking basic ideas about what a library can and should be. According to the library’s website, project architect Francine Houben of <a href="http://www.mecanoo.com/">Mecanoo</a> describes it as "the ‘people’s palace’ – a highly accessible and family-friendly place that is welcoming to all."</p>

<p>One of the key features of the library is the <a href="http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/article/visiting/bfimediatheque">BFI Mediatheque</a>, a place where visitors can sit in design-friendly private compartments and view selections from the British Film Institute National Archive. Among other features, it has a Shakespeare memorial room, a state-of-the-art gallery space, studio theater and outdoor amphitheater. The library is expansive in its mission and also serves as a community and cultural center, offering health-related resources as well as information for children. It also holds cultural events in its many spaces. </p>

<p>The library’s unusual tri-part design and motif of circles captures the eye of pedestrians walking by the building. "The idea is to put three palazzos next to each other, so you have Baskerville House which is from the 20s-30s, then there is The REP, the theatre which is from the 60s, and in between will be the library. Every building has its own identity of a certain period, I think it's our task to bring all these periods together, from the last century for the next century," shares Houben.</p>

<p>What is the future of libraries? How will they be built and integrated into society as their function changes or remains the same? What do you think of this library design? How futuristic is it? Share your thoughts <a href= "https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/14031" >in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@1:23 Carla:</b> Is this all conceptual? And is it for a public or academic library?<p>

<b>@05:57 welmer:</b>  I love the idea of escalators. It looks like there is no room for growth in that library. Every shelf is full. Who said printed books are going out of style?<p>
