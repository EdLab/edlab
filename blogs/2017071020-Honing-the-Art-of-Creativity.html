<p>Do you consider yourself artsy? If so, then <a href="https://www.creativelive.com">CreativeLive</a> might pique your artistic enthusiasm. Full of in-depth instructional lessons taught by dedicated professionals, this platform is devoted to helping people learn artistic skills, whether they want to pursue them as a hobby or a profession. It seems like the kind of app you would visit if you want to hone your craft like an art. While most classes on the platform can be bought as a package, there are also some free lessons available.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>CreativeLive has over 1,500 classes taught by over 650 instructors in many different artistic areas. The five main areas that CreativeLive provides lessons on are <i>photo & video</i>, <i>art & design</i>, <i>music & audio</i>, <i>craft & maker</i>, and <i>money & life</i>. Each class comes with a series of mini-lessons; some classes have as many as 200. They’re taught by professionals and recorded in CreativeLive studios, meaning that the production values are higher than just a webcam. Most of the lessons are recorded lectures in front of a live, albeit small, audience.</p>
 
<p>One of the founding principles behind CreativeLive is that all people should have open access to educational content. While the platform charges for most lessons in order to compensate instructors, it also provides many free opportunities for learners. For example, across all five streams, there are <i>on-air</i> classes 24/7 that you can watch for free. In addition, various lessons across the board are free to watch, and you get to choose one paid lesson to watch free each day. This system seems to strike a good balance between providing educational access to users and compensating the professional instructors.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The only real downside to CreativeLive is that the cost might limit learners’ access opportunities. Some of the classes require a fee as high $99, which might discourage casual learners from diving into the CreativeLive community. These classes might be more attractive to learners hoping to direct their artistic pursuit into a moneymaking endeavor to recover some return on the cost.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The high production value and in-depth topics make CreativeLive a fantastic educational platform for aspiring and professional artists and entrepreneurs. While the cost may at times deter some casual learners, the platform’s free lessons are accessible to all and definitely worthwhile to peruse. Whether you need to figure out how to use that new camera lens or want to start your own Etsy store, CreativeLive likely has the goods to teach you what you need to know.</p>
