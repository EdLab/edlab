          <p>
            Earlier today, I came across this blog post from Penelope Trunk via LinkedIn. Penelope Trunk is an American businesswoman, author, and blogger. Her work focuses on the intersection of work and life. In her post "The Strongest Careers are Non-Linear" she makes the argument that colleges charge tons of money for school and then graduates are unemployable and in debt. Colleges are responding by becoming job preparation centers. She, along with Frank Bruni, Opinion Editor for the New York Times, claim this maneuver is a waste of time and resources. She suggests the following instead:
<blockquote><strong>1. Skipping college.</strong>
The real issue we have with admitting that college is not a path to the work world is then we have to ask ourselves <a href="http://homeschooling.penelopetrunk.com/2012/01/19/high-school-damages-kids/" target="_blank">why we send our kids to high school</a>. There is plenty of data to show that teens are able to manage their lives without the constraints of school. The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345507894/?tag=brazecaree-20+adolescence&amp;link_code=ur2&amp;creative=9325&amp;camp=211189" target="_blank">Escaping the Endless Adolescence</a> is chock full of data, and <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/high-school-2013-1/" target="_blank">a recent article</a> by my favorite journalist, Jennifer Senior, shows that high school is  not just unnecessary, but actually damaging to teens who need much more  freedom to grow than high school affords.

<strong>2. Focus on internships instead of school.</strong>
Kids should be working in <a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2013/03/05/how-to-make-it-in-new-york-city" target="_blank">internships in high school</a>. Because the <a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2012/05/31/how-to-decide-when-to-work-for-free/" target="_blank">best path to a good job is a bunch of great internships</a>.  But great internships don’t go to people who need money. They are  mostly for young people. Yes, this is probably illegal and classist and  bad for a fluid society. But we will not debate that here. Instead we  will debate why kids need to go to college if the <a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2006/11/06/start-looking-for-summer-internships-now/" target="_blank">internships are what make them employable</a>?  Kids should do internships in high school and by their college years,  they are capable of real jobs where they are doing work that people  value, with cash.

You cannot take this route if you’re saddled  with huge student loans. You can’t take this route if you’re inundated  by homework in required subjects you don’t care about. You can’t take  this route if you have no <a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2011/09/05/what-to-do-in-college-right-now/" target="_blank">work experience when you graduate</a> college. It’s too late. (Don’t tell me you need to go to school to learn, okay? <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/04/18/testing_is_killing_learning/" target="_blank">People just do not believe this anymore</a>.)

I was reading the Fortune list of 40 under 40 and I was struck by the career history of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/gallery/magazines/fortune/2012/10/11/40-under-40.fortune/11.html" target="_blank">Kevin Feige </a>(number  11 on the list). He’s president of Marvel Studios at age 39. He wrote  that he interned with the Superman movie director as a film student and  that was the last job application he filled out. That’s because if you  get an internship with someone great, and your performance is great,  your network will cover your employment needs for a very long time.

<strong>3. Start a company instead of writing a resume.
</strong>I’m struck by <a href="http://money.cnn.com/gallery/magazines/fortune/2012/10/11/40-under-40.fortune/3.html" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer</a> (number 3 on Fortune’s list) whose <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/11878472/1/marissa-mayers-strategy-taking-shape-at-yahoo.html" target="_blank">announced acquisition strategy</a> is buying small, cheap companies. Which is, in effect, buying the team.  Silicon Valley calls these acqui-hires. She is looking at young people  who start companies that are not necessarily successful in terms of  product or sales but successfully market the founders as visionaries,  self-starters, and hard workers. You can’t show those traits in school,  so if you have those traits, you slow yourself down by going to school  where you cannot exhibit your best, marketable traits.

<strong>4. Refuse to present yourself in a linear way.</strong>
Do  any workaround that lets you forgo the linear obsession the standard  resume format. Because linear presentations favor people who have long,  rule-following careers – <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/07/why_i_like_people_with_unconve.html" target="_blank">which don’t necessarily make you look good anyway</a>.  I could write a post ten thousand paragraphs long of all the new things  people with nonlinear work histories are doing to get jobs.

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323820304578412741852687994.html" target="_blank">People use twitter as a resume</a>, according to the Wall Street Journal, which requires only that you publish ideas, not any sort of academic experience.

Young people are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/15/sarah-hanson-auctions-senior-living-map_n_3084591.html" target="_blank">selling stock in themselves</a> - paying out dividends for decades at a time.

Agents  represent workers who pick and choose projects that match them rather  than signing on for indefinite amounts of time. The Harvard Business  Review calls this <a href="http://hbr.org/2012/05/the-rise-of-the-supertemp/" target="_blank">supertemping</a>. Business Week calls it <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-10/silicon-valley-goes-hollywood-top-coders-can-now-get-agents" target="_blank">going Hollywood</a>.

But  here’s the big takeaway. A fundamental shift is taking place, where the  path to getting a job is massively circumventing college credentials.  And, at the same time, the <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2013/apr/17/college-debt-stifles-american-dream-for-younger/" target="_blank">American public is fed up</a> with the <a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/03/11/colleges-admit-problem-student-loan-crisis" target="_blank">insane debt that college are expecting new grads to take on</a> in order to graduate. (Good essay: <a href="http://www.bradleygauthier.com/blog/how-college-ruined-my-life/" target="_blank">How College Ruined My Life</a>.)

If  you are not going to school in order to “fit” into the adult world,  then why are you going to school? The love of learning, presumably. But  school reform pundits are 100% sure that kids will choose to learn if  you put no constraints on them. They will just learn what they want.  Best example: <a href="http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news/technology/2012/11/06/mit-leaves-laptops-in-ethiopia-kids-hack.html" target="_blank">The MIT program that gave iPads to illiterate kids in Ethiopia</a>, and they taught themselves <a href="http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/10/ethiopian-kids.php" target="_blank">to use it, program it, and read it</a> in English. <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506466/given-tablets-but-no-teachers-ethiopian-children-teach-themselves/" target="_blank">No teacher. No curriculum</a>.

The biggest barrier to accepting the radical new nature of the job hunt is the reverberations throughout the rest of life. If <a href="http://homeschooling.penelopetrunk.com/2013/01/17/curriculum-by-subject-makes-kids-unemployable/" target="_blank">you don’t need school for work</a>, and <a href="http://homeschooling.penelopetrunk.com/2012/12/06/well-roundedness-is-for-the-poorly-educated/" target="_blank">you don’t need school for learning</a>, then <a href="http://homeschooling.penelopetrunk.com/2012/09/17/public-school-is-a-babysitting-service/" target="_blank">all you need school for is so parents can go to work</a> and not worry about taking care of their kids.</blockquote>
Although this is an interesting perspective, it would seem that there are certain careers for which one would need formal schooling, like becoming a doctor. There are also inconsistencies with her argument. First she claims that student should skip high school and college and, instead, focus on internships. Next, she says that students should focus on internships in high school and get paid positions in college. So, which is it?

What are your thoughts? As educators or for those who work in education, does this argument have validity or not? Please explain your position.
