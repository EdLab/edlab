            <b>Arne Duncan doesn't mess around</b>

Arne Duncan, the new secretary of education, has an idea for increasing academic success that has not made him popular among students: lengthen the academic year.  He supports his argument by pointing out that countries that have longer school years show greater academic achievements, regardless of the students' family background and socioeconomic status.  This, Duncan says, puts American students at a competitive disadvantage.  As part of his education reform plans, Duncan also urges schools to think carefully about teacher performance. "If teachers aren't making it, we want to support them and help them develop, but ultimately if it's not working, our children deserve the best," Duncan said. "They probably need to find something else to do." Read the entire article at <a href=”http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/27/education.school.year/index.html#cnnSTCText”>cnn.com</a> 

<b>Click your cares away, worries for another day…</b>
Hi, Edlab. Do you remember the presentation by <a href=”http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2346”>Jeannie Crowley of the Digital Science Lab in the Bronx?</a>  If you don't, one word: tsunamis. At any rate, Jeannie exposed a lot of us to those fun remotes she used to elicit immediate student feedback and answers.  <a href=”http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101343866&ft=1&f=1013 “>NPR reports</a> that these remotes, referred to as “clickers” are becoming increasingly popular in classrooms.  One professor at Cleveland State University uses clickers during review sessions in class to gage what topics students are absorbing and what he should spend more time on.  He feared that the clickers would make students less likely to speak up in class, because they have the ability to remain anonymous, but was delighted to find that students became more boisterous and interacted with each other more.  One make of these clickers, <a href=”http://www.turningtechnologies.com/ “>Turning Technologies,</a> has created iPhone and BlackBerry apps to make use of the technology.

<b>iPhone App-a-Day</b>
How could I not follow up that last item with the actual iPhone app? Meet <a href=http://www.turningtechnologies.com/highereducationinteractivelearning/higheredresponsewareweb.cfm “>ResponseWare</a>.  It's a free app that works just like Turning Technology's clicker.  Students can use their iPhone to respond to multiple choice, alphanumeric, multiple response, and essay questions.  The app also works on Blackberries, Windows Mobile devices, and laptops/desktops.
