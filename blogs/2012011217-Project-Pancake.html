Project Pancake : Part 1
(Codename by Alex Park)

In my short time at the Edlab, the diffusion of ideas afforded to me by the blog has really influenced what I think Edlab can bring to the greater community. In this project proposal, I'll be building on ideas mentioned in recent blog posts. 

To name a few:

Credentialization and Its Discontents - Skanda
It's Really Cool When Really Smart People Are Thinking Like You - Skanda
Proctor U
Trends in Ed: Rise of the Wikiriculum - Laura
I did it! I "completed" a Real* Course at Stanford! - Kate
Assessing Student Mastery with Machine Learning - Stephen Pratt
Digital vs. Analogue: Will Virtual Learning ever Fully Replace Brick & Mortar? - Kate
EdLab Review: OpenEnglish - Joann
The Flipped Classroom Model - Julia
Story of Piazza - a social homework help platform - Megha

A small case study of online education:
Recently Steve and I found ourselves in a common situation for a student, knowing we had ample time to study for an exam, but trying to figure out the methodology that would give us the greatest understanding of the topics at hand, and the highest possible grade on the exam. We had the textbook, and notes, yet we still yearned for other methods of instruction. Enter MIT OCW and Khan Academy. In this particular instance, the instruction provided by Khan Academy was too cursory for us, and we were left with MIT OCW, which proved to be a fantastic resource. During my use of OCW, I realized that despite a couple of weeks of work at EdLab, I still don't have a good idea of what exactly the M-School is. 


The underlying purpose of this project proposal is to better define exactly what the M-School is (via Edlab feedback), and to propose what I believe M-School courses should look like. Project Pancake is an idea for the layout, and organization of M-School courses. 

Some (Hopefully) Common Ideological Pillars:
M-School courses will be crowd sourced. (ex. If she so desires, Kate could create an M-School course on Kinesiology)
M-School courses should provide elements of machine learning. Use the latest technology to create an adaptive learning experience.
M-School courses provide tools that allow teachers to easily provide some level of interactivity within their courses, 
People learn via a plethora of different methodologies, and therefore an M-School course page should be able to encapsulate different content types, video, text, interactive media, and other representations.
Students of courses should have an extensively easy way of commenting, asking questions about what they see.
Students need a way to prove their proficiency, via a badge, award or some credential.


Many of the ideas presented above are present in Edlab products or products that we have actively blogged about. The first point is crucial in Wikipedia's model, while Vialogue's is based on number 5 for example. 

In order to encapsulate these goals, I envision the following control flow:
