Naviance is a guidance counseling supplementary tool that offers statistics, individualized guidance, and other consulting services to allow students to better prepare for college and careers following high school. A few high school teachers gave me a sneak peek at both sides of the application (teacher/counselor and student).

Naviance is structured around a few key features: course-selection and college plans, test-score-based notifications for teachers and school administration, data and statistics, and direct notification and communication with families. 

The plans are fairly standard; I'm not sure I would heap much praise here but they provide some basic framework for planning out one's four years of high school. Moreover, there is some fairly useful resources for college applications, scholarships, and the College Board. They've done a nice job of aggregating and centralizing resources, for whatever it's worth. 

The test-score based notifications are sort of nice I guess. There's nothing particularly impressive about how the notifications are executed but if a school has particularly poor administration, Naviance could definitely help in terms of preventing students from falling through the cracks. Nevertheless, a decent teacher can do a better job of keeping track of a student than Naviance.

The raw data and statistics they have gathered are quite impressive. Unfortunately, it is parsed through very poorly. For instance, they show the average GPA and SAT scores for a given university's acceptees, rather than attendees. Thus, schools tend to have inflated average scores; it raises the risk of discouraging students from applying to more selective schools. 

I do like that Naviance facilitates more communication with parents. I have long had a suspicion that too many parents are in the dark with regard to their children's futures even at places as upper-middle-class as central New Jersey. The direct notification and communication system has the potential to better inform parents about the college admissions process and help better prepare students. Naviance also makes it easier for parents to contact a college admissions rep.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> Features are basic and its main value is in improving communication and administration. Nevertheless, there is still potential provided each of the features goes through a few more iterations of development to flesh out more detailed statistics and course/college/career plans.
