          <p>
            Ramadan began this past Wednesday and we've already passed the third day of the fasting. So far it has not been as intense and difficult as I thought it would have been. I actually thought today would be a challenging day since it will be the first day I will be playing soccer while fasting but it actually turned out to be a very easy day. Training kept me busy and it also helped run down the time. By the time I was done playing,  it was around 8:30pm, half an hour past sunset (the time we break the fast).

The time we usually break fast changes from day to day since it depends on the time of sunset. This particular year, the time will reduce gradually to about an hour, from 8pm to 7pm, from the first day of Ramadan to the last. The time of breaking the fast doesn't always start from 8pm. I remember a few years ago when I first arrived in the United States, we fasted around October and broke our fast at 5pm but as the years went by, Ramadan shifted into September and now August. This is because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar">Islamic calender</a> is either 10 or 11 days shorter than the Gregorian calender and during the fall, the sun sets very early, which made the fast easier then than it is today.
