            <a href="http://her.hepg.org/content/n306607254h11281/fulltext.pdf">Filindra, A., Blanding, D., Coll, C.G. (2011). The Power of Context: State-Level Policies and Politics and the Educational Performance of the Children of Immigrants in the United States. Harvard Educational Review, 81(3), 407-438.</a>

A large question looming over the educational world is our (in)ability to educate immigrants and the children of immigrants.  In the Fall 2011 issue of the Harvard Educational Review, three authors take a look at how different state policies impact immigrant high school completion rates, with the goal of discovering methods by which to better serve and integrate immigrant populations.
<!--break-->
<b>Description</b>:
They start by laying out the context: the number of immigrant students has been increasing in every state.  Policy responses to these changing demographics vary enormously, particularly when it comes to social welfare access and policies of multicultural accommodation (providing bilingual education programs, for instance). 

They argue that both the direct effects of these policies and their indirect effects on the political climate can meaningfully impact immigrant accomplishment.  After analyzing a variety of data, they “found a positive association between access to the welfare system and graduation rates of children of immigrants.” They also found a weak but negative association between multicultural policies (ESL programs) and graduation rates.  Lastly, it seems that the size of the immigrant population has an independent impact, with states with more immigrant students having a harder time graduating them.

As the authors are careful to point out, this is really a first glance at the issue, and a more fine-grained analysis (that does more to take into account possible variation in student characteristics and background) is required before drawing any definite conclusions.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>: 
“In 2008,” the authors write, “children of immigrant parents made up almost one-fourth of all children in the United States; U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents make up about three-fourths.”  This number is expected to rise.  In many ways, our thinking about education policy may be a good example of “fighting the last war,” in that policies for closing the achievement gap between black and white students, for instance, may have very little relevance for a student body of growing immigrant origin.  But it's not too late to start planning!
