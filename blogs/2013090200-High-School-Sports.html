          <p>
            Sports has always been a big part of my life. Growing up a lot of my peers wanted to take the next step and play professionally. Some of them were good enough to have that chance, but because they played on a small team or didn't play in a big name school, they were not able. They didn't get the opportunity to receive the necessary exposure for recruiting. This was one of the things that fueled me to create a business that will give high school athletes the exposure they need to take their game to the next level. I created a proposal for this during my junior year called High School Sports. The service allows coaches to view players all around New York City while also seeing up to date articles about the players as well. The business was intended to focus on basketball, but as it expands, it would include different sports and a wide range of locations. 

The service is intended for college coaches that may want players to play Division II or III sports. Coaches log on to the site and pay for a monthly membership.
