<p>A recent study reviewed empirical studies that analyze the effectiveness of serious games for teaching 21st Century skills. While 20th Century skills were defined as measureable tasks like reading, writing, and arithmetic, 21st Century skills covered 15 categories including collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social and cultural skills, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, productivity, learning to learn, self-direction and self-regulation, planning, flexibility and adaptability, risk taking, conflict management and resolution, as well as a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>The authors sorted the serious games identified from the literature and classified the included concepts according to 21st Century skills. For example, a direct connection could be drawn between games that included competitive teamwork and the development of collaborative and social skills; fantasy characteristics were related to creativity; games with flexibility and a range of plausible paths to success could help learners develop flexibility; and in-game challenges might be essential for developing concepts of entrepreneurship. The study concludes that the key characteristics of serious games can support and help develop 21st Century skills. </p>	

<p>Gaming as a method of learning can enhance classroom teaching and give students the opportunity to engage in new ways. These results highlight the power of gaming, while also illuminating the importance of core teaching and learning principles, such as social learning, problem solving, and creativity from a different pedagogical perspective. <p>
