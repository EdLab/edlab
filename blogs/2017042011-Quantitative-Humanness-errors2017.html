          <p>
            <p>Yesterday we had a great opportunity to catch up with the Research Team about their latest pursuits. It was interesting to see the range of quantitative tools the team is using to analyze collaboration. The team is looking past concerns of data collection and exploration and into the higher order problems of processing. It turns out it's pretty tough to transform analytic knowledge about learners into intuitively accessible evaluations. Nonetheless I think the team's work could help tighten the research loop.<br /></p><p>    We also heard from Gary about his vision for a future of education research where glacially slow institutional cycles are replaced with a rapid iterative research construct. The idea as I understand it is to craft a lightweight widget to provide embedded analysis and feedback for educators as they work. This premise resonates with the imminent realities of ubiquitous computing data collection. It also looks to the horizon of human augmentation, where we may no longer notice IOT or &quot;wearable tech&quot; except in their absence, as one notices when they've lost their MetroCard or gone to work with mismatched shoes.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The tools of educational research are converging on the tools of basic research in learning and informatics. As the team gets ready for AERA, I am thinking about what really makes research &quot;educational research&quot;. Learning is no longer just for people, after all. So how does education express its humanness? Perhaps the goal of education is more akin to intellectual fitness than to intellectual horsepower. Less about how we can use our brains on information, more about how we relate to other people. The social goal might be obvious, but for me it raises questions about how we should treat technological supports for getting there.</p><p><br /></p><p>Computers have us hopelessly outclassed as data processors. Are we really using that speed to improve our relationships with each other? Or, if social media sorts us sufficiently to maintain order, is structured education even relevant? It will be interesting to see how the field of learning changes, and if the informatic component of educational research survives.<br /></p>
