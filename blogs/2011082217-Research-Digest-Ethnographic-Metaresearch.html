Green, D. (2011). Ethnographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.erialproject.org/">http://www.erialproject.org/</a>

The ERIAL project, Ethnographic Research in Illinois Academic Libraries, used intensive interviews and other data from <a href="http://www.erialproject.org/participants/universities/">5 universities</a> in Michigan to draw conclusions about the current state of academic research and its relationship with the academic library. 

<b>Description:</b>
The project used two anthropologists and two years of intensive interviews with students, librarians, and faculty to get a clear picture of student research structure at universities diverse in size and population. <a href="http://www.erialproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ACRL_Methods.pdf">Collections</a> for the study also included photo journals created by librarians of hardware and spaces used in instruction, design workshops with students on library resources, cognitive maps drawn by students of library facilities, and diagrams of student movements on campus. 

The <a href="http://www.academiccommons.org/commons/essay/erial-project">preliminary publications</a> from this research show that many students are still unsure about the purpose of librarians and the services offered by their library. They also found that significant portions of the student population struggled not only with navigating and using library resources but also with crafting research methods and search strategies. Some student search failure was associated with lack of understanding about google-foreign concepts like authority control and Boolean, but researchers also found a widespread inability to understand and effectively control the results of searches beyond trial and error. 

Students who approached librarians were mostly satisfied with the service and had a better grasp of available materials and how to use them, but many students were not aware that librarians could help them with research. The study advocated greater outreach and collaboration between librarians and teaching faculty and more library instruction in the early undergraduate years. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
In this library, we have a significant population of users that approach the desk for research assistance and seem to know that librarians are available and can help them to meet specific and nonspecific research goals. Perhaps it is a difference in population, the Michigan study dealt primarily with traditional undergraduate student populations and many of our students have prior library experience. This study reinforces the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/08/22/erial_study_of_student_research_habits_at_illinois_university_libraries_reveals_alarmingly_poor_information_literacy_and_skills">ideas</a> of collaboration and outreach that have become so essential to the continuing importance and place of libraries. There's nothing so crucial to the future of libraries as making these connections, providing service, and creating a university culture that values good and thorough research.
