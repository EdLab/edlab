<strong>From the Publisher: </strong> (A note from the editor, Robert  Lake)

Dear readers of Maxine Greene’s work,
A new book comprised of 75 letters from a wide range of teachers, scholars and artists, followed by a short interview with Maxine, is now in publication by <a href="http://teacherscollegepress.com/" target="_blank">Teacher’s College Press</a>. The title is <em>Dear Maxine: Letters from the Unfinished Conversation </em>and is edited by Robert  Lake.  The date of release is September, 2010. Every letter in this book contains first person accounts of the impact that Maxine’s life and scholarship has made on the current generation, and I can think of no better way to present the immense value of her work to the next generation than through these personal narratives.

<strong>Reviews: </strong>

This collection brings together a prestigious group of individuals who have wondered, looked at, revised, acted, questioned, and changed their world because of their connection to American philosopher Maxine Greene. Teachers, students, colleagues, artists, and others, such as <strong>Gloria Ladson-Billings, Herb Kohl, Mike Rose, Deborah Meier, and William Ayers,</strong> have written edgy, thoughtful letters addressed to Greene about her work, their own, and the spaces in between. Rather than just thanking this master philosopher/teacher, each sets out to discover what they have learned from Maxine Greene and to discuss the continued relevance of her work in aesthetics, education, and social imagination.

Maxine Greene has been referred to as “the most important American philosopher [on education] since John Dewey.” This wonderful collection continues the unfinished conversation that is her work.
—Teachers College Press

“Within the context of letters to a dear and esteemed colleague, the contributors to this book expand their readers' and their own perspectives on the complexity and the promise of teaching, learning, and living a generous life.”
—Karen Gallas, teacher and researcher
