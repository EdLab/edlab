            So we have our Flic IoT buttons here (you can read the previous post about them <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/12482">here</a>), and here are four potential use cases and demonstration projects:

1. In Edlab Seminars and future LT events, there are/will be times when event facilitators would like to adjust background music volume to give explanations to group activities. We can have a volume control button for that task: one click to set volume to 20% or so for facilitators to talk, and two clicks to get the volume back to 80% to facilitate group works (Hui Soo, you get Brian covers you with the colorful lighting, so this is the only thing I can add to your presentation at the LT games before we send you to the Oscar next year)

2. The new meeting area at the front door comes with a coffee and drink station that is essential for a welcoming atmosphere. So we can have a button here to send reminder to our staff when there are only few coffee pods left in the station. One click: coffee pods request. Two clicks: drinks request. Currently the message will be sent to my email account, so we can save Chris’ energy to keep searching great seminar food for us.

3. We have been creative in finding ways to communicate with EdLab and library members about claiming or cleaning food forgotten in the refrigerator. Here is the latest solution: a refrigerator cleanup button that sends out reminder message. When some of us notice the refrigerator is overcrowded with food that seems to be forgotten, he/she can push to button to send cleanup reminder message to those who sign up to receive the email. Send me your email or leave it on a note on the fridge if you want to sign up and play.

4. Lastly, I know it is very tempting to just play, push the button and send a message to whoever on the other end. So here is another button for you to play if you cannot steal the volume control from Hui Soo, Gary or Brian, and don’t want to fool other Edlab fridge users (ok, sure, it's ok to play and I will report back how many email reminders I receive from the play tests :)

We have many group activities at seminars and design events, and finding a way to communicate group work progress is important for smooth transition. Here is the latest variation of the "duck signal” we had used in the past design event: the yellow duck with a lighting up button. Push the button and the duck will light up, and the event facilitator and all participants can now know which group is ready and which group needs more time. Thanks Gary for this use case. We can have each button pairs with one duck that represents one group’s progress in some way. 

This demonstration uses IFTTT and Littlebits Cloud module in addition to the Flic button (I will need to fix the issue of letting the light staying on once it is clicked and off when double clicked). The duck is not “wireless" as Cloudbit needs to be connected to wall power not battery, so maybe not a neat solution but as an example of possibility. For now, you can use the button as a remote to light up the duck. Happy clicking!
