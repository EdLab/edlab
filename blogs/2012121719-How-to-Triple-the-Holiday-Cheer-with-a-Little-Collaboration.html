          <p>
            Holiday Greetings are serious business that can support and extend our brand. 

As some of you may already know, today, EdLab sent out its first 'Happy Holidays' e-card to those we have had contact with in the past. The holiday message e-card (animated GIF) is a great way to spread the warmth and joy of the season, and remind the recipient of EdLab. 

Keeping it a genuine message of the season, rather than being too product-focussed, is the best tone for this type of message, in my opinion. There's another side to think about too: <b>subscriber management</b>. As this message is going out, unsubscribes naturally are beginning to come in, as is always expected to some degree. It pulls on our heartstrings to loose a subscriber, but that should motivate us to focus on always delivering something of value, something helpful, or constructive in the messaging.

There are many different ways to collaborate for a project such as this one. 

This was a fun project and I'd like to share the design team's small collaboration effort. The final version of this e-card that went out today actually came together from 3 different versions (3 different designers). 

We combined the best from each one into the final version. Here are those 3 versions:

A)<br>
<img src="http://www.umcreate.com/edlab/holiday/images/a.gif" alt="Version A">

B)<br>
<img src="http://www.umcreate.com/edlab/holiday/images/b.gif" alt="Version B">

C)<br>
<img src="http://www.umcreate.com/edlab/holiday/images/c.gif" alt="Version B">
<br>

Each has something interesting in a different way from the other. So, we did a mashup!

We took the typography from version A, combined it with the iconology from version B, and added in the transition effect from version C. It's alive.

Finally, this is the one we sent out today: <br>
<img src="http://www.umcreate.com/edlab/final_edlab_holiday.gif" alt="Final">
<br>

Here's the <a href="http://www.umcreate.com/edlab/holiday/happy_holiday_2012.html">link</a> to see the .gif animation (in e-card context).

Hope that everyone's season is filled with cheer.
