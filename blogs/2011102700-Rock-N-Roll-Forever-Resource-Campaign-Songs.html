            With Election Day less than two weeks away and the race for the White House fully underway, every candidate has or is finalizing all aspects of their campaign. On the campaign trail, every move is dissected and analyzed by pundits and opponents for any sorts of strengths or weaknesses. One of these key aspects is a campaign theme (e.g. President Obama “Hope” and Newt Gingrich's “Contract With America”), which is usually represented with an image or a song. 

The overall theme of the Rock N Roll Forever project is how music has shaped America's political and social landscape. As with any key campaign decision, the chosen song has to speak to the aspirations of not just the candidate but for the specific constituency they are targeting. Nowhere is this more apparent than presidential elections. Since the founding of our nation, presidential candidates have used songs to rally support for their campaigns. Time Magazine gives a brief but insightful history of campaign songs in this <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1840981_1840998_1840892,00.html">piece</a>.

As Republican candidates seek to unseat President Obama, it is worth noting that the last time an incumbent President (George H. W. Bush) lost his re-election bid, it was to an aspiring young Arkansas Governor who used Fleetwood Mac's “Don't Stop” to sum up his goals for America. Such was the influence of the song on the campaign that President Clinton was able to convince Fleetwood Mac to reunite (they hadn't performed together for over 10 years prior), just for one night, to play the song as his inaugural party. 

I wonder how campaign songs can be used or included in PD videos or as part of additional resources for the Rock N Roll Forever project.
