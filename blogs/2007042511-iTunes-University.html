          <p>
            Since TC has been considering creating a presence in <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/products/ipod/itunes_u.html">iTunes University</a>, I thought I would visit some sites that are using it.  I visited <a href="http://itunes.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkely's</a> site and was pleased to find that <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/~duguid/">Paul Duguid</a>, who wrote <a href="http://www.sociallifeofinformation.com/"><em>The Social Life of Information</em></a> (good book), includes his History of Information lectures in iTunes U.  However, I was disappointed to find that the broadcasts have serious sound quality issues.  For example, his lecture titled "Introduction: On Information", as well as his lecture on “Writing Mentalities”, are almost completely inaudible.  Yet the files are nearly 20 MB each, which are a big download for little payoff.  The sound quality on some of the other lectures is somewhat better, however, there is a persistent buzzing and the voices seem quite far away.  Everyone sounds better with a British accent, which should work in Duiguid's favor; however, the sound quality is a deterrent.  Another limitation is that there are no introductions in the beginning of the files, so most files begin with several second of blank noise, followed by Duguid clearing his throat.  The lack of polish on these podcasts are not the fault of the lecturer, but rather the University for not properly polishing their "products".  

I think if TC had a presence in iTunes U, it would need to do something much more in line with what <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/73">Joachim</a> has been doing with the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=192002900">EdLab channel in iTunes</a>, which have very good sound quality, titles, and good introductions.   Otherwise, it is a bit embarrassing.
