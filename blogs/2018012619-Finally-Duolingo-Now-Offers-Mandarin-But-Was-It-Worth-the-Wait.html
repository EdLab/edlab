<p>We’ve written a lot about <a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>, including a <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/42/duolingo">full review</a> over five years ago. Since then, the platform has become one of the most popular language learning apps on the internet, including a free version and a $9.99 per month premium service. Yet, fans waited years for Mandarin Chinese courses. Well, the wait is over: <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/welcome">Duolingo</a> recently added Chinese (simplified characters). How does this new edition stack up since our last review of the app? </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Duolingo’s Mandarin platform is not friendly for people who have previously studied Chinese. Since I am not a pure beginner, I tried to move past the basic levels. However, the placement and passing exams are a mess. They are unforgiving to alternative inputs, inaccurately assuming every translation has only one answer. For instance, <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/comment/20837876"><i>wŏ chīfàn</i></a> is directly translated to "I eat rice," but it’s more colloquially understood as "I eat" or "I eat (a) meal." I confirmed this with a native Chinese speaker here at the EdLab. These problems are prevalent throughout the levels and quickly become very annoying.</p>  

<p>The platform’s strength is its community support that is intended to crowdsource fixes when users collectively report issues and developers incorporate them into future updates. However, this doesn’t help early adopters who want to use the service now. Other language learning apps offer overrides to users in order to brace for glitches. Duolingo seems more focused on having learners earn experience points and gain other awards by grinding through their levels like it’s some kind of RPG. Personalized learning experiences should be emphasized over glorified educational gamification.</p>  

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Duolingo is ideal for total beginners of Chinese language studies. The closely guided pedagogical process of the app is geared toward incrementally building knowledge. Studying for just the prescribed five to 20 minutes per day will ease the bewilderment for starting such an alien language. Because new students are learning everything within the platform, they won’t be tripped up by variations learned from outside classes.</p>

<p>The app has a massive community of users, which makes their resources and conversations about language learning encouraging and helpful to new learners. There are already threads deep in discussion over the new Chinese feature. Community groups are also offered to give users motivation through peer interactions.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Duolingo waited a long time to release Chinese; perhaps, they should have waited longer. For beginning learners of Mandarin, the app is a fine option. However, for those with any background knowledge in the language, this platform probably offers much more frustration than it’s worth. </p>
