          <p>
            Washington's D.C's public schools will soon become the first school district in the nation to <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/local/education/2012/03/dc-council-approves-huge-education-overhaul/390566">require all college eligible students</a> to apply to college or some kind of postsecondary school. Additionally, they are one of several states requiring all 11th graders to take the ACT,  SAT or some sort of mandatory college entrance exam. The requirements are part of a broader set of laws and regulations, Raising the Expectations for Education Outcomes Omnibus Act of 2012, passed by lawmakers. 

Although the bill contains provisions such as ensuring all students entering kindergarten can read and write, giving $10K to teachers to relocate to poor and struggling schools as well as closely monitoring the progress of at risk students as early as elementary school throughout high school, the mandatory college application and test taking has ignited the most debate.  Chief among the criticisms of the regulation is how students, especially those from poor families, will afford the exams and ultimately college. The issue of financing is not relative to students as D.C's schools don't even have enough funds to see out all aspects of the measure. 

Is requiring high school students to take entrance exams and apply to a postsecondary school necessary, and/or sustainable?
