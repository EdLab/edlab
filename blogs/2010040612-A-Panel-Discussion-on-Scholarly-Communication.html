          <p>
            Hi EdLabbers,

I'm at an event hosted by the Columbia University Library/Information Science's Scholarly Communication Program and the Earth Institute titled, Communicating Climate Change Science. (Detour to the post on <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4068>why I am here</a>)

Sharing with you live today is in regards to this purpose: 
<blockquote>
Researchers often come up against the challenge of effectively communicating complex data to an audience beyond academia. In the case of climate-change science, this challenge is a special one. Now a highly politicized issue, climate change has camps of interested parties among specialists, policy makers, and the general public. In such an environment, what should researchers do–and what do they need to do–to make the scientific data widely accessible and interpretable?

Lerner Hall 555. There are about 100 chairs set up, and I'm seeing less than 5 empty seats.

“We don't communicate science very well to the public.” 
- Scientists are far more trusted than journalists, lawyers or politicians. 
- Popular media doesn't see the big picture.
- Public eye is on what to do about climate policy.
- Media's attention is driven by the public debate not by the scientific debate.
- Problems in the media environment: one or two papers that gets press attention — this can distort the real problem 
- What's missing is the context
- There's more information on sports column than science section because the article has to explain the content
- Focus in the media is almost always wrong
- Windows for what is permissible in discussing climate science is closing in.
- Credibility of science communication medium needs to be revamped. 

<b>Ned Gardiner</b>
<i>Climate Visualization Project Manager at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Program Office</i>

- We are being barraged in the media's reports due to culture wars.
- Cultural cognition project at Yale Law School conducted a study in which they took samples of general population and asked to note their preference after providing a summary of scientific explanation at a very basic level. 
- Group A: Scientific panel recommends anti-pollution solution on global warming (restrictions ->> received low vote)
- Group B: Scientific panel recommends nuclear solution to global warming (solutions —>> received higher vote)
- Communicate scientific data and concept to people in the way that is comprehensible. 
- He's showing an animated graph (more like a sophisticated video) that explains el Nino and how it relates to the super cold weather we had during this past winter season. 
- Visualize it to establish a frame of reference.

<b>Sabine Marx</b>
<i>Managing Director at the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED) at Columbia University.  She is especially interested in the integration of climate science and social science, communication of climate information, and outreach to decision makers.</i>

- Great barriers on the decision making processes for the policy makers and those who implement. 
- Solutions on how to improve the process?
- Barriers to behavioral change: uncertainty, public risk perceptions and attitudes, myopia, cultural values and political orientation, self-interest vs. collective interest
- How we frame the issue is very important.
- Typical abstract scientific theories do not inspire people, let alone simply reach people. 
- <b>*Studies found that closer levels of affiliation between individuals can improve action; emotional science appeals to people more strongly than quantitative science.</b>
- What she suggests: a combination of emotional appeal and scientific explanation. 
- <b>*If we want general public (laypeople) to get engaged and change their behavior, for example, match visual cues/photos with graphs or streamline oral history with climate science data.</b>
- “The Psychology of Climate Change Communication,” a book published by CRED.
