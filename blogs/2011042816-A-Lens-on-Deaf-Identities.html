<strong>Title:</strong> A Lens on Deaf Identities

<strong>Author:</strong> Leigh, Irene W.

<strong>Publisher: </strong>Oxford University Press

<strong>Call No.: </strong>HV2395 .L35 2009

<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals develop their  identities within environments that convey and reinforce preconceived  assumptions of disability and of deafness, thereby encouraging  particular ways of accommodating individuals' hearing status. These  assumptions ultimately influence the evolution of their identities and  in turn their psychological well-being. This notion is particularly  important within societies that frame deaf or hard-of-hearing persons as  living in a "prison of silence" (a metaphor the media uses frequently  when extolling the virtues of cochlear implants) or which view them in  one-dimensional perspectives-- rather than recognizing that there are  many ways to be deaf or hard-of-hearing.

Many factors, some  ever-present and some that have emerged in recent years, impact the  unique identities of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals today. These  factors, which are explored in A Lens on Deaf Identities,  include explanatory paradigms that frame how deaf and hard-of-hearing  people are understood within the context of disability and  sociolinguistics; the relatively recent formal recognition of a Deaf  culture and the emergence of bicultural frames of reference; the  appearance of deaf identity theories in the psychological literature;  the influence of families and schools, historical and social contexts;  the acknowledgement of diversity in this population; and the technology  that affects the identity of deaf people in potentially unexpected ways  (e.g., cochlear implants as bionic ears, telecommunications that bring  deaf people together with each other as well as with hearing people, and  advances in genetics with implications for parental decision-making  about hearing status and the acceptability of hearing differences). This  book uses personal experiences, theoretical formulations, and research  data to examine interfaces within and between each of these areas and  how the tensions emerging at these junctures influence deaf and  hard-of-hearing identity formation in complex, multifaceted ways that  defy pervasive stereotypes of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons. A Lens on Deaf Identities  will appeal to students and professional researchers in deaf studies  and deaf education, as well as those interested in identity formation in  the presence of "disability".

<strong>Reviews:</strong></div>
<div><a id="Reviews" name="Reviews"></a>"In this most comprehensive and up-to-date discussion of identity  and identity development among deaf and hard-of-hearing people, Leigh  richly compiles, compares, contrasts, and critiques the existing  research and literature. She capably debates the appropriateness of  traditional and racial/ethnic identity development theories, their  strengths and weaknesses and their utility for applications to the  identities and identity development of deaf people...The author is open,  honest, and provocative in her presentation, taking bold steps to  address and mediate controversial issues in identity and identity  politics...The book respects and balances the multiple realities and  experiences of individuals and the complex forces that contribute to  these realities...This is a sincere, validating, and courageous stance  against a backdrop of multiple competing social tensions, which renders  the book an important source of critical community dialogue."--PsycCRITIQUES

"Like peeling a multi-layered onion, Dr. Irene Leigh gets to the  'core' of the complex concept of identity formation of d/Deaf and hard  of hearing individuals. Her recognition that identities can't be 'boxed  in by categories of prescriptive deaf identity categories' will make  this a pivotal book for all who write about deaf people."--CHOICE
