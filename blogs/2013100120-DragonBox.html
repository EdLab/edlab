<p><a href="http://www.dragonboxapp.com/index.html">DragonBox</a> is a mobile math game that makes learning algebra easy, fun, and addictive. The interesting learning aspect of this app is that it starts with visual concept instruction; users must move blocks with the goal of getting the dragon box alone on one side. Later in the game it becomes clear that the dragon box represents the variable in an algebraic equation and users are able to practice what they have learned with actual equations. The app includes over 200 levels to teach users the properties of mathematics using symbols to represent numbers or variables. The claim is that students will be able to learn how to solve algebraic equations more quickly by playing the game than they would through traditional methods. Resources are available on the site for teachers to help students make the transition from game play to in-class math lessons.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game is easy to learn and users can begin play without much instruction up front. It is also easy for experienced math teachers to identify the math concept goals. The game layout is similar to popular mobile games like Angry Birds. The game starts off with simple directives and becomes more complicated as users progress through the levels. As users become familiar with concepts, the game starts to include mathematical operations which help students transition the concepts they have learned into actual equations.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are two versions of the DragonBox app available for purchase. The light version has many of the game play levels, but lacks a lot of additional help content and practice tasks.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>DragonBox has a unique algebra teaching concept that makes learning fun and addictive. Integrating the app into classroom teaching means that educators would need to transition students from the symbolic algebraic concepts they learn in the game to equations with actual numbers. The game teaches the basics of solving algebraic equations such as balancing equations and solving equations with variables on both sides. The gamification elements encourage students to replay the game to increase their score. To get high scores players need to completely balance the equation and do it in the fewest moves. This repetitive element makes DragonBox as addictive as popular mobile games like Angry Birds.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>DragonBox is a fun and addictive math game to play on your way to school.</p>
