<p>Although it's been predicted time and again that our education system is ready for a revolution, practices have remained static for. . . a long time. A typical classroom still has a single teacher lecturing in front of the class. Every supposed revolution seeks to alter this paradigm—whether by replacing teachers with technological medians or hoping that the internet will provide an unknown breakthrough in instructional delivery.</p>

<p>The good news for teachers is that they are not so easily replaced—not even by the coolest app. Despite the web being the most gigantic repository of information, translating that information into student knowledge is still best facilitated by teachers. Their roles as motivators and guides are essential to students' excellence. </p>

<p> In this video, the most successful learning occurs as a social activity. The internet is a poor replacement for teachers, because it is devoid of the benefits of real life social interaction. Perhaps the edtech revolution won't happen when teachers are replaced, but when they are empowered to use new technologies that are seamlessly integrated in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>What technologies do you think have the greatest potential to positively impact education? And how should they be used in instruction? Add your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/19801/">on Vialogues</a>.<p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i><p>

<p><b>@00:00 DJRojas11:</b> Technology can alter the way we educate students but manipulating them into having the right thought process will be a challenge. While teachers on the other hand can only motivate students to a certain extent.</p>

<p><b>@06:06 AimeeLee:</b> Although technology has had a great impact on education, the most important part of it all is the relationship between a teacher and a student. A teacher's job is to motivate and guide students through the learning process.</p>
