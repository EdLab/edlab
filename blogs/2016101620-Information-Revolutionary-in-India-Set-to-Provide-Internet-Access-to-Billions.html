<p>India, the second most populated country is the world, is undergoing a digital revolution in the telecommunications and information sector. The richest man in India, Mukesh Ambani, is leading this transformation through the launch of Reliance Jio, a Mumbai-based provider of mobile telephony, broadband, and digital services. The company seeks to provide free mobile calls and online data until December and will then charge as low as 75 cents per gigabyte in the coming year. </p>
 
<p>With as little as 22% of the Indian population currently connected to the internet, this expansion of access is expected to connect upwards of 80% of the country's 1.3 billion inhabitants. Such a large influx of users is destined to reshape the digital landscape, creating new markets and destroying old ones. As India is one of the largest education technology markets, this also promises to spur innovation in that sector as a larger consumer base becomes available.</p>
 
<p>This massive shift in internet access is bound to change the country, giving millions access to information and learning technologies that were previously inaccessible. What do you think we should expect from this information revolution? What are the benefits to inhibiting or promoting digital access on a global scale? Tell us your thoughts in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/31401/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:16 RuthS:</b> In this age, it's increasingly difficult to interact in society without technology such as smartphones. Providing internet and phone access to a whole country means that people who were once left behind in the digital divide can now partake in a society that's increasingly connected.</p>
 
<p><b>@00:16 DJRojas11:</b> "While mobile learning is gaining pace, only 27% organizations in the country have adopted the approach, according to a study" <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Consumer/Jx5FFXAsYA6nB4hob1f0gJ/80-Indian-employees-find-mobile-learning-useful-says-study.html">80% Indian employees find mobile learning useful, says study.</a></p>
