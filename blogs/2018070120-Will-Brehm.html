<p><p><a href="http://www.willbrehm.com/">Will Brehm</a> is the founder and host of the <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/">FreshEd</a> podcast, a weekly podcast on education, globalization, and society. He is also an Assistant Professor at the Waseda Institute for Advanced Study at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. </p>  <p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br> <p>When I look back on my history in educational technology, I realize, to my surprise, I’ve experimented with different online platforms for a decade. </p>

<p>In early 2008, I developed an online learning network called Culture of Conversation. Inspired at the time by the relatively new website called Facebook, I dreamed of creating an online space where the students I had been teaching in Taiwan could continue conversations about books and poetry outside of the classroom and throughout the year. The website was a complete flop. Only a handful of my students used the site regularly. It certainly didn’t catch on as I had naively imagined it would. </p>

<p>In 2009, I teamed up with <a href="http://globalteachingconsultants.com/about_us.html">Daphne Hobson</a> and <a href="https://education.asu.edu/iveta-silova">Iveta Silova</a>, two graduates of Teachers College, on the International Teaching Resource Center (iTRC) at Lehigh University. The iTRC was a searchable online space for the free exchange of multimedia resources, primarily aimed at comparative and international education students and professors. This too was a flop, not because it was a bad idea but because, in my opinion, it came a bit too early. Not many professors were using digital resources in their teaching (other than PowerPoints and the random DVD) and even fewer were willing or able to share them online. </p>

<p>Fast forward to September 2015. It was at this time that I moved to Tokyo and was looking for ways to build and maintain my professional network. My wife suggested I start a podcast to keep in touch with my network that, by this time, spanned the globe. Initially, the podcast, which I called FreshEd as a not-so-subtle play on the name of the National Public Radio show <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/">Fresh Air</a>, was a small side project I produced single-handedly, inviting people I knew on as guests. My first guest was <a href="https://edpolicy.stanford.edu/adamson">Frank Adamson</a>. Frank and I have known each other for years. </p>  <p>Listening back to the first few episodes is really embarrassing. I had no idea what I was doing, asked terrible, leading questions, and said "like" and "um" far too much! Eventually, I asked a friend to produce some music for me and designed a website. A few of my students started to help out and soon enough I had listeners emailing me. All of a sudden, the show had a following. As the show organically grew from a few dozen listeners per month to nearly 6,000 in December 2017, my hobby turned into much more than I ever imagined.</p>  <p><b>What is so powerful about the medium of podcasting?</b><br>  <p>Podcasts are certainly powerful, but I’m not sure they are always beneficial. Yes, they provide a new medium through which ideas can circulate. And, yes, more digital content has been created because of the medium. One of the values of FreshEd has been to provide listeners with a wide range of voices, from <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/ruidasilva/">PhD students</a> to public intellectuals such as <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/davidharvey/">David Harvey</a>. FreshEd has helped, in some small way I believe, introduce people interested in education to new ideas. Personally, before FreshEd, I never heard of the <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/orenpizmonylevy/">Opt-Out Movement</a>, thought about German <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/cynthiamilleridriss/">right-wing extremism</a>, or watched <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/friedrichcolmenares/">El Chavo del Ocho</a>.</p>   <p>But, there are many dangers. Are podcasts yet another online distraction contributing to serious cognitive impairments? Are we, in some anti-Freirean way, oppressing ourselves by believing we can fill our brains with knowledge through podcasts instead of deep critical engagement with ideas? And are we learning to be capitalist consumers who accept sponsored content and advertising without question? The trouble with podcasts, in short, is that they do not allow the listeners to speak back, challenge ideas, or engage in critical discourse. It is a passive medium that may reproduce the status quo.</p>  <p>I’m deeply aware of these dangers and struggle everyday with navigating FreshEd through this political and ethical minefield. Some episodes of FreshEd, for instance, have used advertising and sponsored content as a way to pay the costs of running the show. However, my team and I have decided to stop these practices precisely because we don’t want FreshEd to be co-opted by powerful interests.</p>   <p>Moreover, we have spent the last few months discussing ways to <a href="http://survey.podtrac.com/start-survey.aspx?pubid=yje6arLd11rK&ver=standard">engage listeners</a> and focus on topics they feel are important. We have been self-critical of our Western-centric (primarily United States) focus thus far (70% of our listeners live in the USA, Canada, the UK, or Australia) and have developed a strategy for including what <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/raewynconnell/">Raewyn Connell</a> calls "Southern Theory." Will this work? I don’t know. Maybe FreshEd will flop like my other ventures in 2008 and 2009. But I’m optimistic because members of the <a href="http://www.freshedpodcast.com/aboutfreshed/">FreshEd team</a> who, despite never being in the same room, have an energy and passion for the future.</p>  <p><b> What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>  <p>We are currently transcribing past episodes to increase access. These text files will be freely available on FreshEd’s website later this year. Moreover, we are planning on translating select shows into Chinese and Arabic as a way of reaching a non-Western audience. We are also experimenting with dubbing and creating YouTube channels for subtitles. On top of this, we are developing new types of shows and looking for guests from across the world. The interview-format won’t go away, but listeners can expect to hear some avant-garde shows sometime in 2018.</p>  <p><i>Image:</i> Courtesy of Will Brehm </p>
