<p><a href= "http://www.socrative.com/">Socrative </a> is a simple and smart student response system that creates immediate student engagement.  Able to work on almost all devices, Socrative lets teachers provide student access to a virtual room, where they can engage students with real-time quizzes, short answer questions, and gaming-style interactive activities. Teachers can also get instant feedback from students, and the system automatically uses response data to generate an assessment report. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b>
Perhaps spontaneity is one of the reasons Socrative has won so many fans. In essence, Socrative is a learning management system. Like most learning management systems, it provides targeted portals for teachers and students. What distinguishes Socrative is its well-functioning connection system that beautifully synchronizes communication between teachers and students. That connection is the key to the high level of student engagement in the Socrative learning process. The quizzes in the system are succinct, well-paced, and very successfully gamified. Socrative quickly captures the gist of interactive classroom communication dynamics and involves students as active participants in the educational conversation. </p> 

<p>Socrative saves a lot of grading time for teachers as the system automatically keeps records of student performance and responses. These records are automatically sent to the teacherâ€™s email address as a full-scale report. This helps teachers to coordinate more effectively and focus on developing individualized learning plans for students with unique needs. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b>
Socrative relies on web and computer access for each student, which can be a challenge for many K-12 schools. The synchronous feature of Socrative is dependent on the quality of the internet connection as well. Successful implementation of the system requires a high-quality connection in schools. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Socrative seeks to enhance teacher understanding of student performance. Face-to-face in-class interaction can keep teachers updated on the real-time student responses to what has been taught, yet it is hard for teachers to keep track of individual progress or give feedback to all students. However, Socrative takes full advantage of technology to collect, mine, and analyze all response data and automatically generate an assessment report for each individual student and the class as a whole. This provides teachers a systematic view of how students are performing in class. </p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b>
Socrative is a convenient, smart, quick and synchronized mini-LMS that effectively engages students in the learning process. </p>
