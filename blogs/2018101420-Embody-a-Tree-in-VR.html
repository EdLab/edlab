<p><a href="https://www.treeofficial.com/">Tree</a> is a virtual reality experience in which one follows a kapok tree's lifespan, from seed to full form in the rainforest, from the perspective of the tree itself. As a 4D experience, Tree is accompanied by a synchronized set of 4D enhancements, including floor and body haptics, wind, heat, and smell. It is currently screening at IMAX VR centers in LA, New York, and Toronto.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Tree is an undeniably beautiful production. From the moment you emerge from the soil as a seedling to your final demise at the hands of humans, you’re immersed in an impressively realistic rainforest world. It’s magical and surprising, first seeing ants trot past you with leaves on their backs, and then turning around to realize there’s a parrot perched on your limb. Seeing the world from the forest floor, from above the treetops, and from every other vantage point in between as you grow helps you recognize all of the species that interact with and depend upon this tree you represent.</p>

<p>The 4D experience definitely adds to the magic. Being able to smell dirt, feel the wind blowing on your branches, and shake with the earth as it is demolished by forces beyond your control makes the experience feel more real, and ultimately more moving.</p>

<p>Empathy is often induced in humans for other living things through anthropomorphism. Shel Silverstein’s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Giving-Tree-Shel-Silverstein/dp/006028451X">The Giving Tree</a></i> is moving, but only because we come to think of the tree as human-like. Tree is so powerful because it presents the subject exactly as it is, yet puts you inside of it, so that you have the perspective of a tree with the insight of a human. After you have marveled at the world from this new position, the kapok’s death is much more poignant because you can see what has been lost.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because this experience is highly dependent on haptics and other sensory components, Tree is not accessible to those outside of centers where it is screening. I think finding a way to make this experience available to more people should be a priority.</p>
 
<p>The experience is only eight minutes long, which is far too short to explore everything the animators have clearly worked so hard on. I would have liked Tree to last twice as long as it did.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Tree is stunning and profound. It sheds light on nature conservation in an innovative way, and allows the viewer to learn about the plight of kapoks, and of those that depend on these trees for survival. This is an opportunity that everyone should have, and I hope Tree’s creators can make that happen.</p>
