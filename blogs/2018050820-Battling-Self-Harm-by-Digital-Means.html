<p>Developed for stem4 (a support system for teens struggling with mental illness) by Dr. Nihara Krause, <a href="http://www.stem4.org.uk/calmharm/">Calm Harm</a> is a free app with activities to help users resist or manage the desire to self-harm. Using ideas from evidence-based therapy, this app teaches teens techniques for safe self-expression, aiming to help those struggling with self-harm to control depression and urges to hurt themselves.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I appreciate how clearly this app is set up as a resource and trustworthy aid in clinical treatment. Each group of activities is broken down into a mini therapy session. After completing them, users fill out a quick evaluation to determine how strong the urge to self-harm was, how helpful the activity was, and what caused the urge in the first place. Then they're given tips and questions to ponder, and are able to view logs that rank how serious the self-harm tendencies were during a given week and what times of day they typically manifest. They're also able to look at graphs documenting what causes urges to self-harm and which activities they gravitate toward most frequently.</p> 

<p>The activities themselves are divided into six sections: comfort, distract, express yourself, release, breathe, and random, representing some of the main reasons why people engage in self-harm. Within each category are lists of different activities to help users "ride the wave" until the urge to self-harm passes. These activities represent a creative, wide range of healthy alternatives, distractions, and tools to combat self-harm..</p> 

<p>Calm Harm is also extremely secure and private, with no link to an email address; there's just a password for the mobile app that's required with every visit.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>I should disclose that I am not struggling with self-harm, so while I can make judgement calls on certain aspects of this app, those who are actively seeking help might have different criticisms of it.</p>

<p>That being said, there are a few changes I would suggest. First, the ability to adjust the timer so that it isn’t limited to 60 seconds could be helpful, as some users might wish to extend activities. Some of the activities certainly take longer than a single minute, such as talking with a friend or spending less time on social media.</p>

<p>Additionally, some activities rely on materials that might not be at someone's immediate disposal, such as a pen and paper. This is fine, but it would perhaps be helpful to organize activities in a way that shows which require materials, so that users who need help immediately aren't turned off. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I was very impressed with Calm Harm. It’s rare to see such serious science and love go into the creation of a free resource like this. While I cannot endorse it from the perspective of a target user, I can see real merit in this app, and would recommend it based on its creative, relevant approach to providing help for many that seriously need it.</p>
