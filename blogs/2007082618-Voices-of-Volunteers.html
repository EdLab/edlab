            One of the most encouraging things to happen in the aftermath of Katrina is the continuing flow of volunteers from all over the world to assist with the rebuilding.  Two years later, that urge to lend a hand does not seem to have abated, as groups from churches, schools, and other organizations continue to make the journey to contribute what they can.

One of those groups came from the Kingswood-Oxford School in West Hartford, Connecticut, which sent 21 students, four teachers and one graduate under the heading Team Up New Orleans in early August to work with Habitat for Humanity rebuilding homes. The group planned the trip after hearing an address from <a href= http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/14213/Douglas_Brinkley/index.aspx>Douglas Brinkley</a>, author of  <a href= http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061124235/The_Great_Deluge/index.aspx>The Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast</a>, featured prominently in <i>When the Levees Broke</i>.  

One of the teachers, Yom Odamtten, helped write the curriculum for <i>Teaching the Levees</i>.  She will be posting her own commentary on the experience on this blog soon, along with pictures of the trip.  In the meantime, she has sent along journal entries by three of her students.  You can also read more about the group's trip to New Orleans in an article from the <a href= http://www.courant.com/news/local/hr/hc-whdvolunteer0815.artaug15,0,6441253.story>Hartford Courant</a> and on the <a href= http://www.kingswood-oxford.org/podium/default.aspx?t=12596&newsid=405644>Kingswood-Oxford</a> website.  You can also watch a <a href= http://www.tc.columbia.edu/news/article.htm?id=6305>video</a> of Yom discussing the <i>Teaching the Levees</a> project.

In the beginning of this trip, I was wary and unsure about New Orleans. I didn't know if building houses would be worth it due to future hurricanes and the damage they can obviously cause. But as soon as I arrived at the Habitat site I knew this was the right thing to do. The morale of the city is so high that it makes me proud to be helping these people. When Sam and other kids came to the Habitat house, all they wanted to do was help, even in the hundred-degree heat. In Connecticut, I would never pass by a construction site and help. The fact that these kids are volunteering with no benefit for themselves shows the real New Orleans character and makes me want to help bring the city back to life.

<i>Today was our first real day in New Orleans. The Katrina tour was completely different than I expected. I thought the levees would be fixed and the rubble would still be there. The levees were nothing like I expected. I saw two types of levees: one was a hill, literally 3 feet of grass and soil, and the other was a wall at what looked like six feet. I thought the levee would be a twelve-foot pile of concrete or stone at least, not a hill.

At the beginning of the tour we saw the Convention Center, and all I could think about were the scenes from Spike Lee's documentary, When the Levees Broke, of the tons of people standing outside asking for basic help. Then as we headed to the houses with the water lines all I thought about were the boats that [Douglas] Brinkley talked about which were run by volunteers to save people. I thought about that story because the lines were almost nine feet at some point and I could not believe how high up the boats must have been and the height of the water. We also saw a house that had been picked up by the flood and then stopped by a big tree. That stuck with me because those people were considered lucky that there was a tree to stop their house. 

However, the end of the tour was happier when we ended in the French Quarter with all the restaurants and gift shops. I had no idea how much New Orleans depended on tourism. The Mardi Gras Museum was fun with all the intricate details and shiny, colorful sequins of the costumes and floats. Then the Presbytere was very historical and I learned a lot how Louisiana started and the crops. The Katrina exhibit was the best, though. The pictures were heart-wrenching, but even more so the quotes said by the teenagers. It helped Katrina become closer to me seeing as I could relate or try to relate better through the eyes of a teenager. Then, right before dinner there was a fight. It was scary because the “n word” was just thrown around and there is so much hatred involved with that, that it just makes me cringe. 

After that, we left to go to dinner and then walked down Bourbon Street. When we walked down Bourbon sipping our milkshakes and listening to jazz it really made you appreciate the liveliness of New Orleans.

Today was good. Mr. Baldwin and I went run/walking to begin the day. We
went to the Mississippi and back. The river is beautiful. I was surprised
by how dramatically the ground sloped up to the river.  It really made the
statement "New Orleans is in a bowl" clear. On the way back, we passed the
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., as in the movie <i>Forrest Gump</i>. I didn't even know it was real! I wonder which came first?

After running, we went to the Habitat site. Once again I spent the morning on the roof. Now the roof vents are up, and Megan and I just need to cover the vents with ridge caps in order to finish the roof. This afternoon I painted window trim and siding. It was hot outside, but better than yesterday and I had fun. The people who were painting inside however were suffering form the paint fumes. 

This evening we went to Zea's restaurant. Joining us was Edna Novak, who was a teacher in New Orleans pre-Katrina and is still involved in the school system. She told us about pre- and post- Katrina public schools. I was amazed by how bad pre-Katrina schools were. Many students were unable to pass basic tests to move onto the next grade; kids my age were in 6th grade! I can't even imagine something like that. It really made me appreciate something that oftentimes I take for granted, almost at times as a burden: school. However, when Katrina came through most of the schools were wiped out, leaving a blank slate to start anew. Now there are lots of independent charter schools with strict requirements. Parents can choose the best school for their kids. Amid all the damage of post-Katrina New Orleans, this seems like a step in the right direction.
