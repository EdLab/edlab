<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>

The idea for <a href="http://bit.ly/1S6n5eb">Minerva</a> actually started years ago when I was an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. I was Chair of the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education and had the opportunity to propose a wide variety of new ideas to enhance the student experience. I’m proud that some of those ideas, like preceptorials, are still a part of the current Penn experience. But many of the other ideas were deemed "too big." It was frustrating to realize that the modern university had abandoned its role of ensuring the intellectual development of its students in favor of simply passing along fixed quantities of information. This was something I never forgot and that stayed on my mind as I started my career. </p>
 
<p>After college I headed West. I spent more than 10 years working at Snapfish, working my way up to CFO and then CEO. Snapfish taught me firsthand that you can start something and grow it on a global scale. </p>
 
<p>After Snapfish, I knew I wanted to focus my efforts on something that would make systemic impact. I naturally gravitated to education and thought about how to design the ideal university experience. I knew from my days at Snapfish that it was possible to build something extraordinary from scratch. And we are doing that at Minerva. </p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
I believe Minerva’s greatest impact will come from two things: first, our students, and second, the change we drive within other higher education institutions. We are educating the world’s brightest students and preparing them to be innovators and leaders who can solve the world’s most complex issues. And it is our firm belief that other universities will adopt our approaches or develop something even better over time. We want to bring the concept of a competitive marketplace for curricula back into the university landscape. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
Two of the trends driving significant change in education are advancements in technology and research, and more specifically, what research is teaching us about how people learn. </p>
 
<p>At Minerva, we are using technology in a completely new way to apply the proven impact of active learning, and doing all of this within a context of a diverse student body. Technology enables new methods of engagement in the classroom and incredible new ways of assessing and helping students based on data collected about their engagement during class sessions. Activities that would otherwise be arduous in an offline setting (breakout groups, joint simulations, polling, etc.) are built into our Active Learning Forum (ALF) and allow us to put together active learning in a much more comprehensive way than would be possible without it. </p>
 
<p>Additionally, assessment data is not only collected from every interaction with every student but it is fed back to professors through a decision support tool that increasingly changes the way in which class is conducted.  Simple data kicks in within the very first class to help the professor decide on which student to call for which activity (e.g., amount of time already talked) but with time this data grows in sophistication to a great extent.  By the second semester Sophomore year, the data will be rich enough for every interaction in class, group project assignments, even personalized office hours to be informed by what will be most effective for each student.  The professors will adjust the way class is conducted given the intellectual development arc of each student to ensure they have the best possible shot at achieving ultimate mastery by the end of their Minerva tenure. This is simply not possible without the ALF. </p>
 
<p>At the same time, research in cognitive and behavioral science has helped us develop not just the curriculum at Minerva but techniques in the classroom that stimulate deep mental processing and active engagement with the course material. For example, research shows that lectures are not a very effective way to learn, which is why you won’t find them at Minerva. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
One of our biggest undertakings right now is preparing for the Class of 2019 to spend their sophomore year in Berlin and Buenos Aires. Minerva students live and study together. By using cities around the world as their campuses, Minerva students learn in a manner that is both practical and applicable to real-world settings. In order to maximize immersion in different cultures, broaden their perspectives, and extend their learning environment into a wide range of diverse urban contexts, students change locations every semester after living in San Francisco during their first year. Cities of study include: Berlin, Buenos Aires, Seoul, Bangalore, Istanbul, and London. </p>
 
<p>Taking what we have done in San Francisco, and replicating it in Berlin and Buenos Aires, is a significant undertaking. Not only do we need to figure out the basics, (e.g., a building where students can live together), but also more complicated factors like community partnerships that extend learning into the city. In San Francisco, we already had many of the connections necessary to quickly build Minerva’s unique experience. For Berlin and Buenos Aires, the puzzle pieces may be more challenging to connect, but we are confident that the picture we create will provide our students with access to two amazing cities where they will learn and thrive. </p>
