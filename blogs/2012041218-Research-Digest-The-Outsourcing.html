<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/07317131.2012.650126">Ballestro, J. (2012). Losing your control: Acquisitions and outsourcing. <i>Technical Services Quarterly, 29</i>(1), 113â€”121.</a>

As part of a cost-saving experiment, Southern University's Morris Library did a use study of monographic preprocessing suss out the areas of outsourcing efficiency. Staff reduction and stagnant budgets have caused many library technical departments to cut services and seek alternative workflows, primarily through outsourcing and Morris' aim was to compare this new workflow with the cost of in-house processing. 

Morris chose a shelf-ready processing plan from YBP. With this service, ordered books theoretically come barcoded, labeled, and security-enabled to the library's particular specifications. Their first invoice pre-processed through YBP showed significant losses, $7,469.25 to an (optimistic) in-house estimate of $2,843.36, the outsourcing number includes nearly $400 in staff time pay for negotiating technical difficulties. For their preliminary test, Morris did not adapt their expectations to the outsourcing process and the conclusion suggests that resistance to change might be an issue in managing the switch effectively. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Our library has been all over this for years. Similar to Morris, lowered costs were secondary in our decision to pursue outsourcing:

<blockquote><i>The main impetus for Morris to begin pre-processing their monographs was the ability to take a staff member who was performing some of the basic processing and move him or her to higher level tasks within the department or even to other units within the library, such as, moving our core work from repetitive work to higher level functions.</i></blockquote> 

It's interesting that their study found significantly higher costs in outsourcing, especially considering we use the same service with the same company, but it appears that there are adaptivity factors at play. The pre-processing we outsource avoids many of the picky cataloging and processing factors that complicated Morris' study. Segmentation and control may be the key to outsourcing wisely and wise outsourcing may be the new collection development.
