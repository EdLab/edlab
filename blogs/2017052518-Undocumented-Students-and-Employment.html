<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For many undocumented students, these are uncertain times. The current political climate means they can be deported without hesitation by ICE. For those undocumented students who are fortunate enough to enroll in college, graduation comes as a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinchan/2017/05/15/what-job-prospects-do-undocumented-students-have/2/#3404a1541453"><span class="s2">mixed blessing</span></a>. They have to contend with the uncertainty of legal status, job placement, and further education. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), enacted during the Obama administration, served offered a glimmer of hope for undocumented students. DACA provided a brief reprieve from deportation and eligible recipients received a two-year work authorization. Though DACA offered a temporary relief, a lot of students didn’t meet the eligibility requirements. The Act requires students to be in the country before their 16th birthday. Additionally, the application fee of $495 was too expensive for most students and their families. DACA also doesn’t guarantee certain protections. For instance, when students under DACA apply for jobs, they show their work permits. However, many employers tend to ask for more documents that students cannot provide. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By the time most students graduate from college, the two years guaranteed by DACA has ended. They have to worry about finding a job under the table or stay unemployed, which is not really an option when you are a college graduate. For some, there is no other option but to leave America and find opportunities in other countries where they can gain legal status. The global search for opportunity is truly on. </span></p>
