Museums and other traditional learning spaces such as schools and libraries are currently in the midst of reimagining their physical spaces and content offerings. The Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., is hoping to lead the way in this revolution. With 19 museums and nine research centers, the Smithsonian is a hub of activity that draws around 30 million visitors every year. This highlights a popular and varied interest in the museum’s offerings. To this end, the Smithsonian is working on a project to deliver its resources to an even larger and broader audience. </p>

<p>The Smithsonian Learning Lab is an ambitious endeavor that brings the museum’s digital collection of well over a million items to users across the globe. The Lab is specifically focused on engaging educators and students. A major component of the Lab is a digital learning resource that offers thousands of lesson plans and online content, combining the Smithsonian’s collections with learning initiatives. Educators have been particularly impressed with the ability to merge lesson plans from the Lab with learning goals for their students. </p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of the Smithsonian opening its digital collection to everyone? What are some other educational opportunities for the Learning Lab?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>01:14 AbdulMalik:</b> By going to classrooms and after school programs, the organizers of this program will receive efficient feedback from educators and students. Testing the collections in learning spaces is a key factor in the improvement of the learning lab and its initiatives. </p>

<p><b>02:18 abagigah92:</b> I like that the Smithsonian program is presenting a platform for teachers to customize activities for their students. This way, teachers can help students understand the digital world in a confident and comfortable manner. Smithsonian Learning Lab gives teachers a voice in how to shape their class. </p>

<p><b>02:45 bizapp:</b> The Learning Lab is a unique idea in that it brings the Smithsonian experience to everyone. More importantly, it creates a platform for educators to build lessons and classroom activities for students without having to physically visit the Smithsonian. </p>
