<strong><a title="About the Authors" href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073028630/information_center_view0/about_the_authors.html">About the Authors</a></strong>:  Scott K. Powers is the UAA Endowed professor in the Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology and is Director of the Center for Exercise Science at the University of Florida. Powers enjoys teaching and has earned three University of Florida teaching awards.

Dr. Powers’ research has focused on exercise-mediated changes in cardiac and skeletal muscle antioxidant systems and the role that these changes play in providing protection against oxidant injury. Further, he is actively investigating the mechanisms responsible for respiratory muscle weakness in patients subjected to prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation. Dr. Powers’ laboratory work is currently funded by grants totaling more than 2.8 million dollars from the National Institutes of Health and the Florida Biomedical Research Program.

This research has resulted in over 150 peer-reviewed scientific papers. Powers has also co-authored four college textbooks for use in exercise physiology and fitness courses. Powers serves on the Gatorade Sports Science Institute (GSSI) Sports Medicine Review Board and is a member of the editorial board for the Journal of Applied Physiology, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, the International Journal of Sports Medicine, and the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism.

Scott Powers received his bachelor's degree in physical education from Carson Newman College, his master's degree in exercise physiology from the University of Georgia, and a doctorate (EdD) in exercise physiology from the University of Tennessee. Powers earned a second doctoral degree (PhD) in physiology from Louisiana State University.

Edward Howley received his BS degree from Manhattan College and his MS and PhD degrees from The University of Wisconsin, Madison. He completed a one-year post-doctoral appointment at Penn State University and has been at the University of Tennessee since 1970.

Currently a Professor in the Center for Physical Activity and Health in the Department of Exercise, Sport, and Leisure Studies, Dr. Howley teaches both undergraduate and graduate classes in exercise physiology, and an undergraduate class in fitness testing and prescription. He has received several awards for his teaching. Most of Dr. Howley's volunteer efforts have been with the American College of Sports Medicine, where he served as president from 2002-2003.

He is the Editor-in-Chief of ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal, and he continues to serve on the program planning committee for the annual Health &amp; Fitness Summit meeting.
