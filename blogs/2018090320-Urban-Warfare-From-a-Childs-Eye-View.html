<p><a href="http://info.icrc.org/enter-the-room">Enter the Room</a> is an augmented reality experience that gives the user an intimate look into a child’s experience of war. Created by the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en">International Committee of the Red Cross</a>, the app’s content is based on a 2017 in-depth report looking at the devastating impacts of modern urban warfare. The user learns what it is like to be a child in such a situation, not through images of violence, but by seeing the changes that take place in a child's bedroom over the course of four years.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I was impressed and moved by the fact that Enter the Room was so effective just through its attention to detail. There was no blood, no explicit violence, and yet through the sounds outside and the changes in the child’s bedroom (the electricity going out, the appearance of a wheelchair and emergency supplies) you could piece together the death and destruction taking place.</p> 

<p>I also appreciated the fact that no people, including the child whose room the user is in, are ever physically present. This anonymity allows the user to realize that this could be any child’s room, in any country.</p>

<p>The AR itself is also beautiful. You can walk around the room as if you were actually in it, lowering your camera to the ground to look under tables and inside drawers. Enter the Room’s immersive nature makes the experience feel more real, and the result is very powerful.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>I really wish Enter the Room were a longer experience. You have no control over how quickly each yearly snapshot lasts, so the entire scenario is complete within five minutes. With all of the detailed work that went into the design of this app, it’s a shame to not have the time to appreciate it.</p>

<p>Though the ICRC does a good job of showing the realities of war in a new light, I do wonder about the ethical implications of creating an AR experience depicting urban warfare with the intention of influencing donors. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story">The danger of creating a single story</a> is also a real concern when presenting an experience that might become used to define all such experiences. Perhaps this could be remedied by adding more statistics, facts, and stories after the experience to shed light on the wide variety of warzone stories out there.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Enter the Room is a powerful AR experience with the potential to be even more powerful with a few additions and changes. As a free app, it is certainly worth your time to check out.</p>
