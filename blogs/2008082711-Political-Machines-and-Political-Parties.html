          <p>
            Now that the <a href=“https://www.democrats.org/page/contribute/JoinUs”>Democratic Party</a> has officially started the buildup to the general election on November 4th, the time is right to look at the development of political parties and their immense role in American politics today. Political parties of the early 20th century, known as political machines, rose as a result of the large immigration boom that occurred during the early part of the century. Political machines such as <a href= “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Plunkitt”>George Plunkitt's</a> <a href=“http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/tammany-hall.htm”>Tammany Hall</a> (famous for the “honest graft”), gained prominence in the early part of the 20th century due to the large influx of immigrants from Europe.

In America, these immigrants faced a host of problems: poverty, they did not speak English, and they had difficulty assimilating to their new environment. The political leaders in many of the large industrial cities where the immigrants settled saw their plight as an opportunity to gain influence in local government. The political leaders wanted to take over local government so they provided services to immigrants such as employment and healthcare in return for votes. As customary with most political offices, once the party gained power, they wanted to stay in power. To do this, the parties provided patronage jobs to ensure that the majority of government workers in the city would be their party members, and who in return, would bring not just their votes, but those of their friends and families come election time. The machines also had a relationship with the private sector as well. If a private company wanted to gain the city as a client, it had to contribute money and votes to the party. If they don't, there would be another company willing to do so and thus gain the city's services. The government also regulates building, health, among others so it is in a company's best interest to contribute votes and money to the party in government so they can regulate in their favor. <p>

Of the many parts to today's political parties, party organizations-when party leaders and activists work for and promote the party's causes, the party's perspectives on issues and party's candidates, are the most important. The party organizations are composed of state party chairs, county and city leaders, among countless others. All of the members of the political organizations hold job titles. The primary objective of the party organization is to keep the party in power and thus it uses most of its resources and assets to promote the party's candidates and the party's stances on issues. Since most of the members of the party organization hold job titles, most aspire to move up the political ladder so they are in the job of always keeping the party in government in power so they can receive a chance to run for office. Party organizations are responsible for providing services for the two parts to a political party: the party in government and the party in the electorate. The party in government is candidates who run for public office on the party's label and those public officials, whether elected or appointed, who share the party label. The party in the electorate is compromised of citizens who identify themselves as supporters of the party and who generally vote for the party's candidates. 

The party organization's relationship with the party in government is a love-hate relationship. Since they are of the same party, they work collectively to promote shared party goals, but they take a different route to reach that goal. For instance, a Senator, who may have future presidential aspirations, may try to raise a lot of money so a victory could enhance their presidential chances. The party organization's leader, at the same time, may try to convince the same campaign contributors to support other party candidates instead of the representative so the party could gain a majority in Congress. The party organization and party in government both fight for party leadership in the national spotlight. When the media wants a certain party view on an issue, they ask party leaders in Congress or the White House (if the President is of that party). The party organization's leader may tend to state the party's view on that issue in a different way. 

The party organization has a very different relationship with the electorate. The electorate is not tied to the party in any capacity. They can change their ideology and join the opposition party at will. The electorate is responsible for choosing the party's candidate during primaries. The party organization knows they have to mobilize the electorate during election season because they need their votes to either maintain power or gain power. For this reason, the party in electorate has tremendous power in persuading the party organizations to act in a way favorable to them.
