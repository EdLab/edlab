<p>The Indian Institutes of Technology (ITTs) are some of the most difficult universities to get into in the world. Entry into one of these 23 elite institutions is seen as a meritocratic path to affluence. Because of the fierce competition, a "shadow education" industry has sprung up around the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for these universities. Jakob Williams Ørberg explores the growing role for this kind of private education in India by focusing on tutoring centers are their impact on students.</p>

<p>The researcher employed an in-depth ethnographic study of the Indian educational sector, visiting Jawaharlal Nehru University, in New Delhi, and numerous private coaching centers in Kota, a small, but dense city in Rajasthan, a state in Northern India. The researcher interviewed 20 private coaches and surveyed 180 students who worked as tutors. He also reported detailed notes of numerous informal interviews and discussions with various other stakeholders in the field.</p>

<p> Students from across the country flock to study centers located in Kota, which is now known as the "Education City." These centers often operate as boarding schools where students abandon their traditional curriculum. Instead, a pedagogy of memorizing massive amounts of information is implemented, which doesn’t built long-term knowledge that students can utilize later. The cram schools isolate students from family and friends, forcing a singular focus on the high-stakes testing. </p>

<p>Coaches do not shy away from claims of "teaching to the test." In advertisements noted by the researcher, centers clearly state that they will teach students how to "crack" the entrance exams. While the questions on the JEE are always deeply guarded, the testing centers have treated guessing the contents of the test as an art form. Some students told the researcher that the best coaches can usually accurately predict exam questions. </p>  

<p>The centers often make the claim that they are serving a public good by providing access to a new education style that is not available in public schools. Many of them have even offered scholarships or fee waivers for merit-based performance. However, what may appear to be an altruistic measure is also a way of using the achievements of past students in advertisements to recruit more pupils.</p>  

<p>Participating in this kind of shadow education is quickly becoming the standard for students with any desire to enter the elite ITTs. This cramming pedagogy doesn’t offer critical thinking or skill-building that students need to succeed later in life. The researcher believes that future studies must pay closer attention to curriculum surrounding shadow education in Indian society.  </p>
