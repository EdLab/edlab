          <p>
            A suburban school <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chibrknews-creationism-in-classroom-wont-get-teacher-fired-20110322,0,6553595.story?track=rss">district</a> recently voted against firing a teacher who taught and expressed his creationist beliefs to students in his science class. This anecdote best illustrates the ongoing controversy surrounding the age-old question of whether creationism should be taught in our nation's classrooms. 

Backlash against creationism in classrooms has been, for the most part, led by atheist groups although conservative religious groups have also been known to par take in the movement. Creationism as expressed by the aforementioned groups, shouldn't be a subject taught to pupils since it offers little to no scientific base. Their underling belief is that students shouldn't be influenced by a topic that is largely belief based. Furthermore, they cite that the separation of church and state should also apply to the educational setting. Evolution instead should continue to be taught in schools since although it's a theory, offers scientific reasoning. Conservative Christians and other pro creationist groups though take offense to the notion that their children are subject to learn about a theory that juxtaposes what their religion teaches. 

A proposition has been made to mediate both sides and it involves teaching a curriculum based on Intelligent Design. This theory states that certain features of the universe are best explained by an intelligent cause and not an undirected process such as natural selection. The problem with this proposal though is that it often further ignites the controversy rather that abating it. Pro creationists argue that it's a belief that still incorporates evolutionary beliefs while anti-creationists argue that Intelligent Design is just another form of neo-creationism in which a theory is altered to appeal to the public. 

The truth in regards to this matter is that it is one of those topics that offer little to no “gray” area.

This issue has reached the courtrooms and other state legislatures. So far Tennessee is the only state that has passed legislation that does not ban the use of creationism or Intelligent Design in school curriculums.

Here is an interesting documentary done by PBS that goes further into this complex and intricate controversy.
