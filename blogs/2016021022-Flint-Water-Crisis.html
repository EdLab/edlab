          <p>
            The ongoing water crisis in Flint has sparked a nationwide debate about many topics such as race, class and governance. Lead is a very harmful substance that can cause many defects when it enters the bloodstream. According to reports, the issue in Flint was brought to the notice of officials long before it exacerbated. Officials in Flint did not admit there was a huge lead problem with the water supply. They rather informed the public that the city had not found a similar issue with the water supply. 
<p>
Many illnesses and deaths were recorded overtime and that left the city with no other option but to publicly admit there was an issue of contaminated water. Among several findings about the effects of the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-explain-the-long-term-health-effects-of-flint-water-crisis/" target = "blank">water crisis,</a> doctors have predicted that children who were exposed to this sort of water could potentially have brain damage. The long term effects of this crisis will affect the education of Flint's children because they will need special attention and a lot of time to be able to comprehend basic learning ideas and concepts. The water crisis in Flint will have a long lasting effect on almost every aspect of the city.
