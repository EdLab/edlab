<p><a href="https://www.littlepassports.com">Little Passports</a> is an educational subscription box geared at global citizenship and STEM education. Each month, a box of experiments, learning activities, and a comic adventure are mailed to subscribers. The packages range from $16 to $20 per month. The company was founded by two mothers hoping to inspire their children to learn more about the world. </p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Little Passports comes in several different kit options that range in age and subjects.</p> 
<ul>
  <li>World Edition (Ages 6 - 10); centers on exploring a new country each month.</li>
  <li>USA Edition (Ages 7 - 12); introduces two American states each month.</li>
  <li>Early Explorers (Ages 3 - 5); focuses on easier, general themes about the world.</li>
  <li>Science Expeditions (Ages 9 +); contains a different set of scientific themes each month.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>For this review, I received kits from the <a href="https://www.littlepassports.com/little-passports-science-expeditions">Science Expeditions</a> series. While the science series focuses on experimenting and STEM, instead of world knowledge like the majority of the company’s boxes, my kits still incorporated aspects of global awareness. For instance, in the Solar Energy set, the protagonists traveled to India to look at how solar power is used in the Himalayas. I like this cross-disciplinary approach.</p> 

<p>The monthly kits come with basically everything that a kid will need to complete the various experiments or projects. The first kit even comes with some items that can be reused throughout the lifetime of the subscription, such as a bag for materials and a lab notebook to keep track of earned badges or field notes. Other items can simply be thrown out after use.</p>

<p>Kids don’t simply jump into the experiments; instead, they start with a fun little comic adventure starring Sofia and Sam that introduces ideas like hypotheses or correlations, along with themes for each kit. These narratives nicely depict women and people of color as scientists, too.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The kits are reasonably priced at $15 to $20 a month, but some parents may not be willing to buy new toys all year long. For parents on a tight budget, the subscription model could be too much of a commitment.</p> 

<p>For the Science Expeditions series, the activities and tasks are fairly in-depth. The kits are aimed at kids ages 9 and older, but kids in the younger range might find the tasks too difficult. Depending on their child’s age, parents may need to be involved with the exercises in each kit.</p> 
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>A common complaint from parents is that kids get a new, expensive toy and get bored with it after a few weeks. With kits coming every month with new activities, Little Passports alleviates this issue, while encouraging learning.</p> 

<p>I was very impressed with the aims and scope of the Little Passports series and how it smartly introduces kids to STEM topics. Parents should seriously take a look at a subscription.</p>
