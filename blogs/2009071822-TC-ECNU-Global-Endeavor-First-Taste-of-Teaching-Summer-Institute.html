          <p>
            On Tuesday (July 14th), I attended the opening ceremony of TC-ECNU summer institute organized by the Office of International Affairs. This four-week program has become the first formal collaboration between Teachers College and East China Normal University (Shanghai, China). 

As introduced by President Fuhrman in her opening remarks, over one third of the major educators in Chinese history were related to Teachers College. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Shi">Hu Shih</a> (1891-1962), was a student of John Dewey. He later became the president of Peking University, the "Harvard" in China. Hu Shih invited John Dewey to China who stayed there for about two years from 1919 to 1921 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/John-Dewey-China-Chinese-Philosophy/dp/0791472035"><i>John Dewey in China: To Teach and to Learn</i></a>).

The summer institute will introduce ECNU undergraduate students to the teaching profession through a series of training workshops (at TC), school visits, and cultural events in New York. As part of TC's <b>global endeavors</b>, “the Institute will be the first in a series of professional development activities conducted through the new TC-ECNU partnership implemented in March 2009”. 
 
Prof. Lin Goodwin, the associate dean of teacher education also gave a short speech to the group. She is the one who manages the design of the academic and cultural activities for the summer institute. 

At the reception, I met two ECNU professors who will be mentoring the student group at TC until the end of the program. They are Prof. Weicheng Zou in English Education and Prof. Jian Zhao in Curriculum and Teaching. <a href="http://www.fl.ecnu.edu.cn/tchblog/index.asp?txh=284">Professor Weicheng Zou</a>, currently teaching in the English Department of ECNU, was President Fuhrman's student at University of Pennsylvania.
