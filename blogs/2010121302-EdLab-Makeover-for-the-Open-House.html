          <p>
            As we all know, this wednesday the lab is hosting its <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5019">holiday open house</a>. Over the past few weeks, but especially this weekend, we have been working to give the lab a well deserved makeover. The more noticeable changes are the new entrance space, the funky window frames and the decorated window shades. However, beyond these changes in appearance,  we made a few functional changes. Please note:

- We moved both printers to the other side of the entrance door (now they are next to Andrew's desk).  I checked the BW printer and it works fine with the usual dedicated IP address.

- You will notice that we rerouted power and ethernet cables, particularly in the D&R space, to get rid of that crazy web of cables we had over our heads. We made sure to connect every device to the exact same power and ethernet outlet as before. Can you guys please double check that everything is fine? Thank you!

 Now I have two huge favors to ask everyone. 

 1) Right next to the bookshelves near the beginning of the curvy wall, we set up two carts, one with office supplies and another one with tools. We put them right there in the middle of the office for everyone to access easily. I wanted to ask you if you have any supplies or tools around your desk that you don't use anymore, can you please put them in the carts? The office supplies cart has a pretty self-explanatory organization; the tool card is still kind of chaotic, but we'll get to it soon. 

 Thank you!
