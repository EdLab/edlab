<a href ="http://pro.sagepub.com/content/55/1/1511.abstract"> Oleson, Kristin, Surprenant, Carbon, Tom, Blair, Lucas (2011). Teaching Algebraic Concepts via Serious Games on a Tablet PC. <i>Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting</i>,1511-1515.  </a>

<b>Description:</b> This paper aims to prove that the use of “serious games” on Tablet PCs are a valid teaching tool. Algebra was the subject chosen for the study because the authors saw that when students start learning about algebra many of them initially struggle understanding the concepts. The two main tools, the Tablet PC and serious games, are used in this research because a Tablet PC can provide students with interactive learning, and gaming will keep the students motivated. While not meant to replace traditional teaching, it is a great student practice tool. When we think of gaming, most of us will think of bright colors and weird characters, especially when it comes to educational games, but the design of this game look just like exercises found in a math textbooks, which is probably why these games are deemed "serious."  

There are three serious games that were made for the Tablet PC, and they all involve understanding a linear equation whether it is in slope intercept form, or standard form, and graphing a linear equation. All three games use a two dimensional graph (x,y) as a layout. There are three serious games: in the first game, students are given an equation and asked to find the slope of the line or the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. The second focuses on graphing a linear equation, and the third has a more traditional game structure, where there is a battleship on the graph and students are ask to move the ship around and fire at targets using linear equations.

This game had to go through three phases that include feedback and implementation. The first phase was feedback from university leveled educators in the Math department on the design and layout. During this phase, some of the concerns were the lack of direction, and basic video game features (automatically moving on to the next level, high scores list). After changes were made based on the feedback, phase 2 involved feedback from faculty members about how the games should be used in the classroom. Most of the faculty agreed that these games would be best used as a practice tool. Using the feedback from the first two phases, phase three implemented changes according to the feedback.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This is an interesting paper that focuses primarily on the process of improving an educational game through feedback from educators. Even with all the feedback in the end, only a couple aspects of the games were changed. These changes showed a great overall improvement in usability and polish. The authors  support more technology usage in the classroom, and I'm sure most of us here in EdLab do too. Hopefully they will have more studies like this.
