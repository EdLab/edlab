<p>The scenario in ScoreCloud’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB73xKZfszw">promotional video</a> is a perfect example of why the world needs a musical annotation app: a moment of musical genius in the shower that produces a surprisingly catchy and original tune "that should totally be a song!" When a user sings into the mobile app, ScoreCloud records the audio, translates notes into written musical notation, and plays it back in one of several instruments including piano, horn, overdrive guitar, or even <i>cats</i>. Aspiring maestros can then edit, sync, and share their melodies via social media, kick back, and wait to be discovered.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>During a trial run on ScoreCloud Express, the $0.99 mobile version for iOS, an eight bar vocal sample of Amazing Grace was quickly translated into a score with appropriate time and key signatures, although the duration of some notes was sometimes shortened. The score was easy to play back, edit, and share, and the app’s social media team was very responsive in addressing concerns (<a href="https://twitter.com/ScoreCloud">@ScoreCloud</a>: Thanks for testing the app! The sounds are currently not saved to the cloud, but we're working on it!).</p>

<p>The desktop version, ScoreCloud Studio, is available in both freemium and premium editions for MAC OSX and offers more in-depth features; it is compatible with both on-screen and attachable midi keyboards, offers a click track, and allows composers to selectively re-record specific measures or dub multiple voices on top. In addition to offering contextual help to highlight the changes possible within a certain musical context, musical savants can access tutorials on writing scores via manual input, editing rhythm, adding parts and objects, and separating voices.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Amazing Grace worked well as a trial song because the singer paid careful attention to pitch and because the song has a moderate tempo with organic, musical timing. Slightly faster songs (à la <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwx8Voq373A">Build Me Up Buttercup</a>) were not easily translated, and when a song’s first notes were out of tune, the app had difficulty determining the appropriate key signature. It was also sensitive to vibrato and could not differentiate harmonies when two voices sang in duet. For those with enough bravado to try a key change, it’s not clear how accurate modulations are, but rumor has it Adele did not score well in a trial run.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Musical annotation platforms have come a long way since the turtle and error days of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic01Vhiyrb4">Mario Paint</a>. ScoreCloud captures the moment by skillfully combining the accessibility of mobile sound-recognition apps like <a href="http://www.shazam.com/">Shazam</a> with some of the creative composition features found in programs like Garage Band. Aside from being used as a composition tool for experienced musicians, this app has enormous potential to help new music students understand and experiment with music notation and theory. By allowing aspiring musicians to edit note values, change key signatures, and adjust their intonation after being ‘kinda pitchy,’ ScoreCloud could help students develop more finely tuned ears.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Despite some minor issues, ScoreCloud is a major development in digital music learning. </p>
