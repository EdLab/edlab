<p>Hypercontextualized games are locally specific creations meant to guide players in gathering and accumulating knowledge about a specific place or context. LIEKSAMYST is an example of a hypercontextualized game that was developed to connect players to local history. A recent study used questionnaires and student grades to assess the impact of engagement on student motivation. The study found that academic success increased as students became engaged in the game’s fantasy and narrative.</p>

<p>LIEKSAMSYST was originally designed to "breathe life" into the cultural heritage and historical objects on display in the open-air section of the <a href="http://www.museot.fi/searchmuseums/index.php?museo_id=21472">Pielinen Museum</a>, the second largest museum in Finland. The game was designed for use on students' personal mobile devices.  To study the game researchers collaborated with the museum and a group of 7th grade students from a local school. </p>

<p>The researchers note that while educators often cite increased engagement as a reason for bringing gaming to the classroom, the kind of engagement educators hope to inspire is not often specified. Different game genres could motivate students in different ways and result in diverse learning outcomes. The researchers believe that games that emphasize informal learning and are based in the learners context, like hypercontextualized games, support rich engagement and academic success.</p>

<p>Of particular note is the fact that the students’ did not play the game voluntary; it was assigned to them.  As a result this study addresses the impact of tasking students with an informal game where the results are still positive and marked by high-levels of cognitive engagement and meaning making. The researchers conclude that contextualized gaming is a good strategy for inspiring this type of learning environment, but further research may reveal ways to extend these benefits to games of all kinds. </p>
