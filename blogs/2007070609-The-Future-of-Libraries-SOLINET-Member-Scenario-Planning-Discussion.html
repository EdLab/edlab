            SOLINET, the SouthEastern Library Network, reports on its members' needs for the future.

Once again, Gottesman is WAY ahead of the curve:

<a "http://www.solinet.net/emplibfile/Scenario%20Planning%20Summary%20Report.pdf">SOLINET Member Scenario Planning Discussions</a>:

Summary Report from the Planning Committee of the SOLINET Board of Directors, April 23, 2007

Executive Summary:

SOLINET held 12 discussion groups with members around the region to explore their vision of the future of libraries and SOLINET. Discussions focused on three scenarios of possible library futures, developed by the Board of Directors. Participants debated what was likely, unlikely, and missing in each of the scenarios, then identified possible roles for or services from SOLINET that could help members achieve their desired future. This report summarizes the outcomes of all discussions.

The library environment for the next 3-5 years is focused on:

1. New service models for libraries

Â§ Outward focus on users (less on behind-the-scenes operations)

Â§ Broad engagement in planning for the future (it is no longer “business as usual”
for libraries)

Â§ Importance of collaboration and partnerships in enhancing, expanding, and redefining
library services

2. Changing role of collections

Â§ More collections/information on-demand

Â§ Focus on special, local, and/or unique collections, to raise the library's profile

Â§ Shared repositories for print and electronic resources

3. Staff transformation

Â§ Work re-design focused on user impact and increased efficiencies

Â§ Need for knowledge and skill development

Â§ Outsourcing and flexible staffing options

4. Re-purposing buildings

Â§ More multi-purpose community and collaborative space

Â§ Less collection/information storage

5. More assessment

Â§ Value and impact of library; return on community investment

Â§ User needs and expectations compared to performance and service effectiveness

Â§ Accreditation standards

6. Keeping up with and in control of technology

Â§ Use of new technologies/tools for providing or improving services

Â§ Library role in providing technology training for community

Â§ Library investment in expensive, proprietary systems (e.g., ILS) and the potential
for open source systems/applications

Recommendations for SOLINET based on this library environment are to:

1. Increase library capacity

Â§ Provide alternatives to support dynamic staffing situations at member libraries

Â§ Expand collection resources available to members through collaborative resourcesharing

Â§ Provide technical infrastructure support for members

Â§ Offer collaborative access to contracted (outsourced) services

Â§ Provide programs or services to directly meet needs of library users

2. Strengthen library capability

Â§ Support the development of knowledgeable and skilled library staff

Â§ Assist libraries in defining their vision and steps for achieving it through
consulting activities

Â§ Assess libraries and communicate their value

Â§ Serve as an information resource and clearinghouse on best practices

Â§ Strengthen the library community through activities that support professiona l
engagement and leadership development

3. Provide cooperative access to products and services

Â§ Expand offerings of collection resources and collection management tools

Â§ Work with vendor partners to improve their products and services to meet library
needs

4. Support effective digital library collection and service initiatives through activities in
addition to those provided through 1-3 above

Â§ Provide digitization services and/or technology to support conversion of local and
special collections

Â§ Serve as a regional resource for long-term preservation of digital content created
by members

Â§ Provide information on new technology uses and models of adoption

Â§ Represent members in the development of standards and promote their use

Â§ Support technology research and developme nt
