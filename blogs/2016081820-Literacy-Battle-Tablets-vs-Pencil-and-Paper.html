<p>It’s well known that young children who practice writing have greater beginning literacy skills than those who don’t. With the ubiquity of tablets and apps, however, a new study questioned whether preschool children who engage in digital writing practices and use literacy apps have similar levels of emergent literacy as those who use non-digital instruments. Can apps increase a child’s early reading and writing abilities as much as old-fashioned paper and pencils?</p>
 
<p>The researcher tested preschool children’s tablet use at home. She measured children’s emergent literacy levels (including print awareness, print knowledge, and sound knowledge) and compared these to how frequently they used tablets at home as well as the types of apps used.</p>
 
<p>The study found that the children who used a greater number of apps had overall greater print knowledge, meaning they were better able to recognize letters and words. In addition, the preschoolers who used literacy apps had overall greater levels of emergent literacy compared to those who just played games. The literacy apps cited in the study include writing apps, such as iWrite words and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3293/abc-letter-tracing">ABC Tracing</a>, and drawing apps, such as Edupaint and Kids Play Paint. Interestingly, the study also found that children’s emergent literacy skills did not improve based on listening to storybooks or e-books being read aloud to them.</p>
 
<p>As more children use apps at home, it’s important to understand their educational potential. This study demonstrates that young kids who engage with literacy apps on tablets have levels of emergent literacy similar to kids who practice writing with pencils and paper. This shows that whether kids use paper or tablets, reading and writing skills improve the more they practice drawing letters and engaging in other literacy activities.</p>
 
<p>More research needs to be done to examine the exact differences that tablet and pencil and paper writing might have on a child. In the meantime, however, we can rest assured knowing that the word-based apps your child plays at night are only improving her literacy skills.</p>
