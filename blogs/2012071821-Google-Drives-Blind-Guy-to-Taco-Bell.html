          <p>
            	Google recently announced that they have hit the two hundred thousand mile mark for their computer driven car experiment. The video released included <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2402380,00.asp">Steve Mahan, who is 95 percent blind, </a>using the car to go to where else taco bell! Mahan sits in the driver seat and the car steers its self-using lasers and radars to properly accelerate and break. Normally a blind man getting behind the wheel can be considered crazy and illegal. However, a Google representative states, "Yes, this test was legal, it was performed on a carefully designed course, and we filmed in partnership with the local police department. We also placed one of our project experts in the passenger seat who could stop the vehicle if it became necessary." Detective sergeant Troy Hoefling compared that to a 15 year old taking drivers ed. This comparison was made because the vehicle can be controlled by the passenger's side if a dangerous situation occurs. In the Google car, the person in the passenger seat can take over the vehicle by pressing a button in the middle of the car using the break or the laptop synced to the car. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with Google and the police department over in California highway patrol stated, "In order to legally drive a vehicle in California; it must be done so by an appropriately licensed driver. Whether the input from a driver into the driving of a vehicle is done manually or electronically through entered commands, the driver is still responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle and is also required to abide by all existing rules of the road. Additionally, the vehicle must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards as well as all requirements of the California Vehicle Code." I think that the California highway patrol needs to calm down and lighten up. I mean a blind guy was just able to drive to taco bell to get a meal that is just amazing. With future cars on their way, what else from the future do you want to see? Check out the video I posted on Vialogues of the self-driving car in action.
