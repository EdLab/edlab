          <p>
            There has been some debate regarding how we can effectively use technology to improve learning. We must keep pace and make it relevant to students in order to keep them engaged. Technology is a very important tool that we can use to improve outcomes for all learners. Most of the current technologies did not exist eight years ago. As a result, we have to teach students how to learn and adapt to changes.
<p>
Education today is more about adapting to changes in a constantly changing world. Therefore, we need to rethink what and how to teach our students. There are so many resources available that can be used to better student's education such as Instagram, and Google Hangout, among others. There are unlimited sources of online information that can improve students learning without an instructor such as Khan Academic. Also, educators can post notes or videos of the class online for students so they have access to it at all times.
<p>
The aforementioned technologies can be sources of distractions for some students but learning has to be fun and not boring. Students are more likely to share their opinions and ideas using text messages, and Google Hangout than in person because they are afraid of being embarrassed in front of the class. We need to introduce more technology in our classroom in order to better our education and keep students engaged in learning. We need to stop focusing our teaching methods on standardized testing because it is not a true measure of students' knowledge.
