<p><a href="https://ideasonfire.net/team/cathy-hannabach/">Cathy Hannabach</a> is the founder and president at <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/">Ideas on Fire</a>, an academic publishing and consulting agency. The organization has a mission to foster interdisciplinary, progressive academics’ careers through career consulting, publishing advice, and publicizing their research and work.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br> <p>All of my work and projects bring together art, activism, and academia in some way as this nexus is where I find the most exciting and creative horizons. I am the founder and president of <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/">Ideas on Fire</a>, an academic editing and consulting agency helping progressive, interdisciplinary scholars write and publish awesome texts, enliven public conversations, and create more just worlds.</p>
 
<p>I went straight to graduate school after getting my BA in gender and women’s studies at the University of California, Berkeley. I did my PhD in cultural studies at the University of California, Davis, focusing on queer studies and visual culture, and wrote a dissertation about queer corporeal ethics in art and performance. During graduate school, I also continued my long-time involvement in activist and community arts work, interweaving it into my scholarship and teaching. </p>

<p>In 2009, while in grad school, I founded Ideas on Fire by turning my haphazard freelancing into a dedicated editing and indexing business with the goal of signal boosting the amazing work that progressive, interdisciplinary folks were producing. I spent several years in contingent faculty positions after getting my PhD, and left academia in 2013 to run Ideas on Fire full-time.</p>
 
<p><b>What has changed in academia in recent years and what are some trends to expect in the future?</b><br> <p>Higher education has been slammed pretty hard in the past four decades by the rise of neoliberalism, attacks on already underfunded departments and programs, huge tuition hikes, adjunctification, and the overall corporatization of the university. Those of us who entered the academy with the goal of contributing to progressive movements and building more just futures have wrestled with how to continue doing so in the context of such violence. But I come from the tradition of the interdisciplines, where public engagement, art, community building, activism, and interdisciplinarity have always been how we did the academy. </p>

<p>It’s the interdisciplines and the social movements that birthed them that remind us that education and learning have never been and can never be confined to the university, even as that institution continues to be incredibly important. The interdisciplines and social justice movements provide strategies and tactics, both huge and tiny, that can help us build new learning and teaching spaces beyond the academy even as we also fight within it for unionization, student debt forgiveness, comprehensive and free health care, and academic freedom. I take inspiration from these radical histories and their vibrant present.</p>

<p><b>How is technology impacting your current work?</b><br>
<p>Like so many other companies and organizations in today’s world, tech names the medium through which Ideas on Fire works. Our editors and indexers use digital tools to work on scholarly books and articles (CINDEX, Word, Pages, Preview, Adobe Acrobat, Dropbox), our <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/grad-school-rockstars/">Grad School Rockstars</a> coaches mentor students via Slack and the webinar platform Crowdcast, and we produce the <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/imagine-otherwise-podcast/ ">Imagine Otherwise podcast</a> with tools like Skype, GarageBand, Libsyn, CoSchedule, Canva, and Auphonic. And, of course, we build community through our social media platforms, webinars, website, and in-person workshops.</p>
<p>Ideas on Fire is a completely remote team, which means we all work from various cities across North America, so we also use digital tools on a daily basis to keep in touch with each other (Slack, Skype), organize all our client projects and deadlines (Asana, Dropbox), process client inquiries (WPForms, Wordpress), schedule meetings and podcast interviews (You Can Book Me), and handle accounting and invoicing (Harvest, Quickbooks). </p> 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br> <p>Ideas on Fire just launched a new course called <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/academic-editing-course/ ">Introduction to Professional Academic Editing</a> that I am super excited about! We teamed up with <a href="http://www.greyediting.com/">Grey Editing</a> to do so, and it is a self-paced course for those who want to learn concrete skills, navigate professional networks, and put their scholarly training to work building an academic editing career.</p>  <p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter, other social media, or in academia?</b><br> <p>I am continually inspired by folks who combine art, activism, and academia in the service of social justice; they provide the best role models for how to shape a more just world, while also making really cool stuff in the process. For example, <a href="https://ajchristian.org/ ">Yaba Blayr</a> and <a href="https://ajchristian.org/">Aymar Jean Christian</a> use web television to provide spaces for queer, trans, and women of color media and pedagogy; <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/podcast/21-ronak-kapadia/">Ronak Kapadia</a>, <a href="http://gss.princeton.edu/tala-khanmalek">Tala Khanmalek</a>, and <a href="https://www.brownstargirl.org/">Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha</a> teach us how healing justice and disability justice mean centering the needs and leadership of queer and trans people of color; <a href="https://www.eliciagonzales.com/">Elicia Gonzalez</a> reminds us that truly comprehensive, feminist, and femme sex education means defending pleasure as a fundamental human right; <a href="http://scholarcomics.com/about/">Vicko Alvarez</a> draws Latinx feminist comics that expand the horizon of what K-12 education might look like if it centered the lives and desires of Latinx youth; <a href="http://www.lovewithaccountability.com/about-aishah/">Aishah Shahidah Simmons</a>, <a href="http://shanteparadigm.com/">Shanté Paradigm Smalls</a>, and <a href="http://shanteparadhttp://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/people/faculty-profile/juana-maria-rodriguezigm.com/">Juana María Rodríguez</a> illustrate what powerful tools film, meditation, and dance are for learning; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAAIYFfvR9k/">Nikiko Masumoto</a> and <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/podcast/51-aileen-suzara/">Aileen Suzara</a> grow, cook, and teach about food that links communities to their ancestors and this precious planet; and <a href="https://ideasonfire.net/podcast/55-shaka-mcglotten/">Shaka McGlotten</a> and <a href="http://pma.cornell.edu/karen-jaime">Karen Jaime</a> use the stage to build Black and Latinx community pedagogies. They and so, so many others inspire me daily.</p>
