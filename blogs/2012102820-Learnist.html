<p>
<a href="http://learni.st/">Learnist</a> is a social learning platform on which diverse topics are shared via images, videos, music, podcasts, webpages, and various other multimedia tools. Launched as an invite-only venture by the social test prep site <a href="https://grockit.com/">Grockit</a> in May 2012, Learnist has subscribed almost 10 thousand people with full access and thousands of other learners within just one month. Upon receiving a member request, Learnist carefully reviews the online "footprints" of the requester in order to make sure they are capable of delivering qualified educational content to ensure a high-quality educational experience for every Learnist user. 
</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
Learnist is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cQDEwbgxSOs">pretty ideal tool</a> for visual learners who are looking for free, interactive, social learning resources. With a nickname of <a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58179">"Pinterest for learning"</a>, Learnist allows users to deliver content through various multimedia approaches rather than simply plain text. By clicking through each educational board with different topics, users are able to keep track of the up-to-date trends, discussions, issues and knowledge that can help to get them familiar with or develop deeper insights on a certain topic. Additionally, the social function of Learnist dynamically groups users into different learning communities in which they can comment, raise questions, answer questions and share their learning experience with one another. The groups cover a wide range of topics like technology, education, sports, travel, cooking, crafts, and many more created by Learnist curators and educators. 
</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
Anyone who is interested in joining Learnist needs to be approved before being granted full access and board creation capabilities. New users usually need to wait for a couple of days or even weeks to be approved. Learnist explains their membership threshold as an initiative to ensure that the curators and educators have adequate experience in producing streams with high quality. While this is a good intention, we need efficiency to keep learners updated in this rapidly changing digital age. Currently Learnist moderators are assessing the quality of community members by tracing their online "footprints" on various social networks. Inspired by the <a href=" http://livehoods.org/about">Livelihoods Project</a> developed by Carnegie Mellon University, a possible way to enhance the efficiency of qualification screening is to use a well-designed data-mining algorithm that analyzes online activities of applicants so as to shorten the waiting time of avid learners who want to join the Learnist community. 
</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
Learnist combines two booming digital industries: online learning and social networks. One of the greatest functions of Learnist is curating the most useful, important learning pitches and putting them together for those who seek treasures out of the ocean of information. The idea of forming dynamic learning communities incorporated with multimedia and various visual learning tricks would not only be adequately enticing to involve curious and avid learners, but also benefit the learning population by encouraging knowledge transfer among individuals with different expertise.  Such openness, diversity and passion for learning that feature the communities are contributing increasing values to Learnist and each Learnist member.
</p>

<p><b>Bottom Line:</b><br>
Create, collaborate, and communicate in the new learning times.
