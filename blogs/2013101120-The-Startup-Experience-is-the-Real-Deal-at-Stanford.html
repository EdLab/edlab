You may have heard of project-based learning before, but how about product-based?  At Stanford University, entrepreneurial students are finding a haven in the <a href="http://startup.gsb.stanford.edu/">Startup Garage</a>, a course that lets them to go from concept to company in just two quarters. The Startup Garage has a "B. School" meets "D. School" feel to it, as students actively engage in the design process throughout their tenure in the class. <p>

Working in interdisciplinary teams across the university, students develop and prototype ideas, work with users to understand their needs, test and reiterate, and then pitch their products to investors. By the end of the entire experience, students will either have a viable product to launch or will at least have the know-how to get the ball rolling in their own time. <p>

While acting as an incubator, this class gives students the opportunity to practice and fail within a safe learning environment. As with other experiential learning approaches, it also allows them to try on the entrepreneur hat and get a taste of what it takes to run a startup. Some might find that they donâ€™t quite have the chops; others might find themselves on Shark Tank. Regardless, the experience seems apropos to the changing dynamics within the tech industry. <p>

Does the startup sampler class appeal to you? Have you gone through a similar immersive experience? Where did you cut your entrepreneurial teeth? Share your experience in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11117">on Vialogues</a>.<p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i> <p>

<b>@00:52 YogiP:</b>The collaboration between students in different schools is a great aspect of this course. But I wonder... could it possibly lead to conflict over what idea the group lands on? I imagine that with so many entrepreneurially spirited people, it would be hard to come to a decision re: product and vision! <p>

<b>@01:52 JordaJean:</b> Is there a difference between this course and an incubator program (besides the thousands of dollars in tuition you would need to spend)? <p>
