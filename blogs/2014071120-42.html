<p><b>The answer to the question of life</b></p>
<p>What if there was a school without a single teacher? A school completely made up of students working on their own? <a href="http://www.42.fr/">42</a> is a new school in France founded by French billionaire and founder of internet provider Free, <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/magazine/grand-angle/xavier-niel-met-l-ecole-au-futur-10-10-2013-3213257.php">Xavier Niel</a>. The school is named after the answer to the question of life according to the <i><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/oclc/33348186&referer=brief_results">Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</a></i>. This new school has a noble mission to give students who have been failed by their traditional school another chance at an engaging education. 42 was also created to tackle class issues in France. The organization of schooling in France means that socioeconomic status is usually fixed from generation to generation. Technology provides an opportunity to break out of this cycle and the school is capitalizing on this by giving disadvantaged students an education in computer programming.</p>

<p><b>The Coding Games</b></p>
<p>42 focuses on turning students in computer programming experts. Though the school is completely free and available for anyone at any level of education between the ages 18 and 30, students must go through a series of entrance examinations, and admission is very difficult. About 4,000 passed the first hurdle of an online cognitive skills test.  About 1,000 have passed the second hurdle of working on computer problems at the school for about 15 hours a day for a month and have been placed in the school. While the obstacles to enroll in the school are very difficult, the reward is a free and unique education in a high demand field. 42 does not provide students with an official degree, but students’ capstone projects could potentially serve as alternative credentials.</p>

<p>The school itself is a complete departure from traditional schools in France. Some might compare 42 to a boarding school because students sleep at the school in their sleeping bags and are provided with showers. The school’s pedagogy focuses on self motivated and directed learning. Instead of lectures, student work together to solve problems. Students are free to work on projects at any time of the day and week as there is no set schedule. In their final year at the school students work on one final project called a masterpiece. This allows them to reflect on what they’ve learned and demonstrate that learning. The school is still fairly new, and it will be interesting to see how much students learn and if they can use their newfound skills in computer programming careers.</p>
