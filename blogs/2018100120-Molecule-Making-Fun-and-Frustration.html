<p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> created <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-molecularium/id1272875040?ls=1&mt=8">My Molecularium</a> as a fun way to learn about the molecular structure of the world. Marketed as highly educational, the app aims to teach chemistry facts while users move through levels by binding atoms together to form more and more complex molecules.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>In each level, My Molecularium challenges users to build a 3D model of a molecule by aiming and shooting atoms at the molecule outline. The models rotate, offering dynamic visualizations of what might appear in a textbook as static chemical formulas. Different atoms are different sizes and move at varying speeds. In order to aim correctly, users must develop a tangible understanding that hydrogen, for example, is smaller and therefore moves faster than carbon. When a user successfully builds a molecule and completes a level, the robotic narrator offers a few fun facts about that molecule that explain its place in the world. For example, after building hydrogen peroxide, the user learns that it makes plants grow faster.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>My Molcularium requires users to aim atoms by rotating their phone or tablet like a <a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/wii2.htm">Nintendo Wii controller</a>, and to pull the trigger by dragging and releasing the atom on the screen with their finger. I found simultaneously using my phone as a motion controller and a touchscreen to be confusing. It was also challenging to aim the phone, since holding it in its natural upright position pointed the barrel at the sky. Shooting the atoms was laborious, frustrating, and repetitive. While the levels become more challenging, the basic activity of pointing and shooting remains the same. I also question the robustness of the game’s educational value. While the visualizations of the molecules are apt, the game offers no incentive to commit the structures to memory since the chemical formula detailing which atoms make up the molecule is always provided. A possible improvement could be to challenge users at higher levels to build molecules without access to information about their atomic properties. This would encourage students to learn which atoms form which molecules instead of simply copying the provided information.</p>
 
 <p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While this app offers interesting facts about molecules, its repetitive structure and technical challenges compromise users’ enjoyment, and its failure to foster conceptual learning undermines its value as an educational learning tool.</p>
