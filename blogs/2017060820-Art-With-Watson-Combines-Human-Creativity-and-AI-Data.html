<p>Artists recently teamed up with the artificially intelligent (AI) bot IBM Watson to create an artistic pop-up event called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/artwithwatson/">Art with Watson</a> in New York City last month. The exhibit featured seven notable figures in history, including Marie Curie and Nikola Tesla, but sought to reveal previously undiscovered aspects of their personality. This is where Watson came in. Although each of the seven pieces in the exhibit was created by the artists, Watson combed through massive amounts of data to find unknown details of these great thinkers that could inspire an artistic portrait.</p>

<p>This exhibit might cause us to question the role technology can play in artistic creation. Using Watson as a way to brainstorm ideas demonstrates that the cognitive powers of AI can be put to imaginative use. "To us it sort of proves that technology can also be a co-creator with you," says Adam Isidore, one of the artists in this exhibit, "not just a set of tools to execute a visual, but a collaborator to think up what it would be."</p>

<p>What do you think it means for technology to be a co-creator in artistic projects rather than a tool? How does art change what it is created by a human and an AI bot rather than just a human? Make your artistic and philosophical thoughts heard <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/37707/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:44 Evans.Asamoah:</b> Watson is a programming program, which fundamentally enhances the emotion [the] artist is attempting to illustrate. It works hand in hand with artist's creativity to create . . . artworks which are truly remarkable.</p>

<p><b>@02:14 Cinthia.Fabian:</b> Reminds me of a question posed to me by a friend once: If you were to look at a piece of art that moved you to tears, do your feelings change (or are they somehow undermined?) once you find out the piece was made by a robot? I think it highlights an important point regarding the extent to which emotion defines and/or determines the value of art, whether that emotion is coming from the audience or the artist (or the AI bot?).</p>
