<p>This past April, the <a href="https://lt.tc.columbia.edu">Smith Learning Theater</a> hosted a workshop on the challenges and opportunities faced by teachers in refugee contexts. The interactive design workshop, called Communities of Practice: Teachers in Conflict and Displacement, was open to graduate students at Teachers College. At the event, students engaged in design activities geared towards thinking through issues regarding child protection, pedagogy, curriculum, and teachers’ own well-being.</p>

<p>The workshop was led by <a href="http://www.marymendenhall.com">Mary Mendenhall</a>, an associate professor of practice and the director of the International and Comparative Education Program at Teachers College, where she received her doctorate degree in 2008. Mendenhall’s research interests surrounding refugee education within camps and resettlement contexts inspired the workshop, and have inspired other projects at Teachers College as well. Mendenhall also runs a program called <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/refugeeeducation/teachers-for-teachers-kakuma/">Teachers for Teachers</a> that creates professional development opportunities for refugee teachers working in camps.</p>
 
<p>While many people hold negative connotations of refugee camps and focus on what they lack, Mendenhall hopes students left the workshop with a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the challenges refugee teachers face in camps, but also the great work they are doing. The Communities of Practice Workshop sought to show students how they can support refugee teachers in this immensely difficult context while improving educational systems in camps. It’s a difficult task, yet with educational opportunities such as the Communities of Practice Workshop, students are prepared to make a difference.</p>
