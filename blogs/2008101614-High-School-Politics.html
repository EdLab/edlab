          <p>
            I watched a cute movie last night called <a href="http://www.frontrunnersthefilm.com/">FrontRunners</a>, which is about a student council president election at Stuyvesant HS in NYC.  My boyfriend is an alumni which is what led us to watch the movie.  What was interesting about it was how ethical the students behaved in their campaigns and how good they were at getting past the cool-kid issues and focusing on sheer merit and hard work.  This seems quite a bit different than national politics, where so many vote based on who they would want to have a beer with (although some have argued that this is a more stable trait than positions or initiatives, which are notoriously known to 'flip-flop').  I am just barely getting over Hilary.  It is also way different from my high school, where I can't even remember if we campaigned on any real issues or if it was just a popularity contest followed by lots of extra work.  The concept of "working with the HS administraiton" was also not on the table.  The movie is running at <a href="http://www.filmforum.org/">Film Forum</a> through Oct. 21.
