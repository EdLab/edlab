This past Friday, Arianna and I attended the final round for <a href="http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/berkley/bpc.cfm?doc_id=6306">NYU's Business Plan competition.</a>  While there, we sat through the pitches of 4 social venture plans and 4 new venture plans. After each group gave their 15 minute presentation, the panel of distinguished judges set about firing off challenging and provocative questions. At the end of the Q&A, the judges even provided feedback for each plan.

I think this last point is key and it's what makes the NYU competition so special; <b>it's the educational component.</b>  Throughout the 8 months of the competition, participants attended various workshops, classes, and events and received thorough mentoring throughout the process, ensuring that the 8 finalists that we saw presented solid and well put-together business plans.  I shouldn't limit it to just those 8, though; each team that participated in the process undoubtedly left the competition with stronger business plans due to the supportive nature of the competition.  

Anyway, back to Friday.  <b>Let's talk about the space, shall we? </b>

<img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/photo2.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket">

As you can see, the final round was held in a large lecture hall (located within the business school). I counted the attendance: ~100 during the social venture pitches and ~130 during the new venture pitches.  I guess I was expecting something that was more... stagelike?.. and less...classroomy. Still, it worked. One reason that I thought it worked well was for the constant latecomers and room-leavers (yeah, there might be a better word for them but it's escaping me at the moment). Because the chairs were the kind that were bolted to the ground, it automatically created ample space behind a row of chairs for people to walk through to snag an open seat. There are few things more annoying to me than people who make a ruckus as they enter a roomful of people during a presentation AND maneuver their junk all up in my personal space as they make their way through the squished space to a seat. But I digress.  Well, actually I was speaking to my point... but I could digress, so I'll cut myself off there.

ANYWAY let's now turn our attention to the <b>format of the day.</b> As I said, the competition was separated into the two tracks: social ventures and new ventures.  Social venturists (I'm getting the red squiggly line under that word. I'm going to ignore it because it totally SHOULD be a word) presented first and then the new venturists followed after a short break. To get more info on the teams (including summaries of their products/services), check out the agenda <a href="http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/emplibrary/finalist10[1].pdf">here</a>.  

I will say this: the moderator really kept things on track in terms of sticking to the schedule. Arianna and I wanted to grab a hold of some of the participants to ask them about their experiences but there was barely any time even for bathroom breaks!  It was extremely fast-paced but... I think that worked in the audience's favor as it kept everyone from becoming bored.  

A couple of other notes about the event: they seemed to be documenting it very well, as evidenced by a photographer and videographer.  Also, at any given point there were at least 4 organizers in the room, responding to questions and helping participants set up their presentations.  

Oh! I almost forgot my favorite part! 

If you guys can recall from our last EdLab Venture Competition seminar, we wanted to do a<b> "People's Choice" award</b> for the best online video pitch. Well, NYU had a similar award that begged for audience participation.  After the end of both the Social Venture and New Venture pitches, we were asked to vote for the best one using one of these:

<img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/photo4.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket">

The winner would be announced during the awards reception later in the evening.  


I regret that we don't actually know who won the competition because we did not crash the reception.  I do know that Arianna and I both had strong opinions of the best and most viable products and/or services, but I guess we'll have to wait to see which one of us has the best new business radar.  


Wow, look at me go on.  Is everyone still with me at this point? Yeah? Good for you.  

So, in sum... I have to give NYU's Business Plan Competition a lot of props: Not only did it work to constantly teach its participants how to succeed in business (by really trying!) but it also taught us, as potential BPC hosts, that a well-organized event is nothing without seriously savvy and talented competitors.  

I wish the best for the winners of the big cash money prizes (<b>100K for social venture, 75K for new venture</b>), but I also hope that the ones who didn't reach those checks (or even the final round) don't lose their motivation.  We saw a lot of creativity on Friday and even if those particular businesses never get off the ground, I have a feeling that the entrepreneurs involved in the competition learned valuable lessons that have set them years ahead of their cohort.
