            Most college coaches and school authorities work tirelessly to motivate student athletes to blend academics and athletic responsibilities. The academic help for student athletes include but are not limited to providing study rooms for the team and offering tutors.
<p>
However, this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/sports/university-of-north-carolina-investigation-reveals-shadow-curriculum-to-help-athletes.html?_r=1" target = "blank">article</a> sheds more light on a recent investigation that reveals athletes at University of North Carolina (UNC) taking fake classes. This investigation reveals that a large population of the football team was enrolled in classes that do not exist. Furthermore, these same students receive A's and B's for homework they never did, classes they never attended and exams they never took. Initially, the NCAA stated that the scandal had nothing to do with the sports program. The NCAA authorities found this scandal very serious and they have begun looking into the matter.
<p>
I think the NCAA should seriously deal with this matter. I believe in some sort of academic support for student athletes. It is not easy to combine schoolwork and sports. However the UNC approach is a very wrong way of helping students because you deprive them of the opportunity to learn on their own.
