<p>The internet is an invaluable tool that has inundated almost every aspect of our lives. But some of us have become addicted to this connectivity. Just like any addiction, internet addiction (IA) can have detrimental effects. Because of its prevalence, researchers have set out to understand the reach of IA in Chinese adolescents, as much of the research in this area has been centered in the West.</p> 

<p>The researchers sampled over 6,000 primary, middle, and high school students from Guangzhou, a sprawling metropolis of over 12 million inhabitants in southern China. The sample included students from 167 classes in a multitude of schools in both urban and rural areas. The participants were given a questionnaire regarding their home life, internet habits, and other background information.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, only 62 respondents were classified as severe internet addicts, less than 1% of the sample. However, over a quarter of the students were found to have some form of IA. Further, boys were more likely to be addicted to the internet than their girl counterparts. In addition, as students got older, they showed higher degrees of internet addiction. Rural students, though, were less likely to have IA than urban students.</p> 

<p>In more rigorous logistic regression analysis, the team found that when students had a negative relationship with their parents or teachers, they held higher risks of internet addiction. Similarly, students also had higher chances of addiction if they were in classrooms with other addicted students. But the factor that held the greatest association for internet addiction was low academic performance, and the researchers suspect that this relationship might be causal.</p>

<p>The results from this research on Chinese students are comparable to those in other societies. Similar tests on previous generations show that addictive internet behaviors have increased in China in recent decades. The researchers believe that more research with causal evidence is needed in order to identify a solution to internet addiction.</p>
