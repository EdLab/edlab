            Hey EdLab!  Surprised to see a post from me?  It's hard to imagine that I started my summer internship with EdLab about 1 year ago from today!  I missed you guys a lot!  I just finished the first week of my new summer internship at LinkedIn and of course I kept thinking back to my first week at EdLab!  I'm having a fantastic time at LinkedIn but I always keep EdLab in mind.

I loved talking about EdLab during the past school year to people who asked what I did over the summer.  I brought up everything from the projects to the people, from the activities to the culture.

I never did get to tell you guys how the experience I gained from EdLab, especially the technical experience from building NLT, helped me accelerate in a lot of my CS classes.  In many of my project groups, my peers made me the web-dev guy since I apparently “just knew more” about web frameworks, front-end business, and etc., but it was really due to the intensive training that EdLab gave me by throwing NLT onto my lap on the first week!

Anyway, from a cursory glance at the blog, it seems like everyone is doing just great which makes me glad.  I'll pop in every now and then when I get a chance.  And as always, thank you everyone at EdLab, especially my enduring mentor Yudan, for the awesome experience!  I hope the new summer interns have as amazing of time as I did :)
