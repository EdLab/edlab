<p><i>"We are explorers, adventurers and students of the world"</i> (<a href="https://www.roadscholar.org/about/">About Road Scholar</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The World as a University</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roadscholar.org">Road Scholar</a> is a not-for-profit travel agency service that specifically caters to lifelong learners. The organization views the world as its university and their expert excursion guides as the professors. The focus, though, is not on 22-year-old seniors, but rather 60-year-old seniors. The community is comprised of people who believe that studying and learning should never stop.</p>

<p>Prospective travelers can use the site to search for expert-guided adventures, tours, or other activities across the world. The options often range from $600 to over $3,000. For example, I found a <a href="https://www.roadscholar.org">6-day excursion through the Adirondacks</a> for around $650, which includes food, lodging, and a public historian guide who was formerly a faculty member at the Cooperstown Graduate Program of SUNY Oneonta.</p>

<p>Like an actual university, Road Scholar offers <a href="https://www.roadscholar.org/about/financial-assistance">financial assistance</a> to encourage social and economic diversity. The organization also publishes research on the <a href="https://www.roadscholar.org/about/our-story/research/">benefits of lifelong learning</a>. Potential enrollees can have their questions answered by experienced <a href="https://discussion.roadscholar.org/b/blog"> guides and community members</a> through an active online message board and blog. Finally, no university is complete without <a href="https://secure.qgiv.com/for/roadscholar">alumni giving and fundraising</a> operations.</p> 

<p><b>Forever Young</b></p>
Inspired by the youth hostels of Europe and the Scandinavian folk school movement, two employees of the University of New Hampshire, Marty Knowlton and David Bianco, founded the organization as "Elderhostel" in 1975. Through the program, five New England universities began to offer cheap accommodations and non-credit courses to older adults. In just five years, the operations expanded to all 50 states and, soon after, the program gained global popularity. </p>

<p>The organization changed its name to Road Scholar in 2010, as operations expanded and modernized. Today, the service offers over 5,500 learning adventures with 100,000 participants annually.  Despite the update, the organization still harkens back to its hostel roots by fostering camaraderie, relationships, and adventure through all of its experiential learning activities.</p>
