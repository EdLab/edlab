          <p>
            The United Nations (UN) <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47180&Cr=Inequality&Cr1=#.UxLAcWJdW68">recently called</a> on member states to do more to break down the “barriers of inequality” as part of their World Day of Social Justice, commemorated every year on February 20th. World Day of Social Justice was first initiated in 2007 and calls on UN member states to devote the day promoting activities aligned with the goals of the 1995 Summit for Social Development, which pledged to eradicate poverty and full employment, among others, for all people. The urgency of the moment was echoed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who stated, “the gap between the poorest and the wealthiest around the world is wide and growing. This situation is not only between countries but within them, including many of the most prosperous.”

As the gap in wealth between developed and developing nations continues to grow, there is a serious need from all member states to find platforms and avenues to promote equality and opportunities for all. Though organizations such as UNICEF, Red Cross and a host of non-profits work to promote equality and provide opportunities for the poor, the work must really be taken up by respective governments.  Governments, through sustainable development goals and other measures, must realize the urgency of the moment and enact sound policies on education, health, and employment, among others, to ensure all have a chance.
