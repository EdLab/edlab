          <p>
            The outbreak of the Ebola virus has led to worldwide concerns about its spreading and eventually becoming an epidemic. The quest to find a remedy to stop the spread is of urgency in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the two countries most affected by the virus.  For instance, the virus has killed 2,200 Liberian citizens. Apart from the death toll and those hospitalized, the virus has had a <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/10/13/liberia-school-ebola/" target ="blank">major impact on education</a>, especially in Liberia. Public and private schools have been closed as a result of the outbreak. As a result, an estimated 1.4 million school-aged children have no access to education. 
<p>
The most important thing for now is to find any means to educate school-aged children in Liberia. The education sector in Liberia is slowly recovering from the effects of the decades long civil war. The Ebola outbreak threatens to stop any progress or momentum that has been made over the past few years. Students cannot simply sit home until a cure is found. There is no timeline for when that will happen. 
<p>
UNICEF is working with Liberia's Ministry of Education to develop educational radio programs. This will help students learn from their homes. Furthermore, UNICEF is training 300 teachers, who in turn will train 11,000 teachers to raise Ebola awareness. Schools in Liberia are also a form of security for students. When students are not in school, they fall victim to sexual abuse, transactional sex, and sickness.
