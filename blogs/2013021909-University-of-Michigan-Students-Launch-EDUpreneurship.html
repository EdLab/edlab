We were definitely one of the first to use the term "edupreneurship" right here at the lab.  Perhaps two years ago (at least we were one of the first to use it!?)?  Now a group of University of Michigan students, many in the Business School and the Economics program have launched a "movement" called exactly that.  Funded in part by the University's Social Venture Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the group hopes to create change in the ed space (as stated on their Twitter page), "Our mission is to create positive, systemic, transformational change in the U.S. education system."  Visit edupreneurship.net for more details.  

The group will host an <a href="http://www.edupreneurship.net/#!e-day/cy1m"> "E-Day"</a> next month and has a series of initiatives ranging from ideation sessions, workshops, a field trip to a local school and a "lock-in" in which new solutions to education's problems will be developed.  Also, the group has invited "UnCollege" movement founder and author, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8647">Dale J. Stephens</a> to speak/host these multi-day bootcamp sessions. Despite a lack of solid plans for how these new ideas will be implemented in schools, excitement and <a href="http://www.edupreneurship.net/#!our-inspiration/c1ktb">inspiration</a> abounds (check-out NewLearningTimes.com alumnus Ghetto Film School and their Seen in New York <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/383">here</a>!.  

My biggest takeaway is that it is a good sign and refreshing change to see business/economics students focused on (at the very least) the need for real educational change.  It seems that <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/680">Sir Ken Robinson</a> and <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1522">Salman Khan</a> are inspiring much more than just educators...    

Do you think that "EDUpreneurship" has the potential to contribute something new and unique to the EdTech/education reform ecosystem?  Do you think we need more grassroots student-led groups and movements like this?  Despite the lack of education experts and educators...do you feel that there is still a role for students of business and economics in the ed reform movement?  If so, why?  If not, why not?
