<p><a href="http://www.quivervision.com">Quiver</a> combines coloring, learning, and augmented reality into one app. From the website, users can download and print coloring pages, capture them using a tablet or smartphone, and watch them come alive on the screen in an interactive, 3D visualization that keeps all your coloring choices intact.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Quiver is entering the scene at a time when augmented reality apps are rapidly gaining popularity. This app has two main functions. First, it brings coloring pages to life through augmented reality. Once you finish coloring, line your tablet over the page and watch as a 3D visualization appears on the screen. As the image gains a digital life, you can interact with it in different ways. For instance, if you color the soccer-playing dinosaur, you can make it practice kicking balls into the goal.</p>
 
<p>Quiver also has coloring pages that are specifically educational. These include images such as an animal cell, a volcano, and the earth. The coloring and augmented reality work the same way, but the visualization also comes with built-in identification quizzes, labels, and other activities. This element could make the app a useful addition in elementary or middle school science classes.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Perhaps because the technology is new, Quiver is not without its glitches. Although some of the coloring pages were quick to load, others, particularly in the educational section, took at least several minutes to recognize. In addition, users can capture the augmented reality images with camera or video functions, but there were several moments when this task seemed too great for the app and it refused to work. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Quiver is a fun app, and with the specifically educational coloring pages, it could also be a great learning tool. It fuses art with augmented reality to make learning interactive, interesting, and new. Children could work on their fine motor skills by coloring while not abandoning the screen completely. Itâ€™s the type of app that kids could come back to again and again without tiring of quickly. Because of this, I recommend Quiver for children ready to experience art in a new way, as well as for teachers interested in bringing a new dimension to their science class.</p>
