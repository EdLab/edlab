<h2>Library catalogs</h2>
<em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em> are the official subject terms prescribed by the Library of Congress for the cataloging of books and are in use in essentially all academic libraries.  To find works pertaining to art, art education, and related topics,  it may be useful to use some of the subject terms listed below when searching the online catalogs of libraries at Teachers College, Columbia University, and other institutions. A detailed description of how to find a subject heading and search for it in EDUCAT can be found <a title="Searching by subject in EDUCAT" href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/llange/searching-by-subject-on-educat">here</a>.

<h2>Periodical Indexes</h2>
<strong>Search Tips</strong>

These general tips can help you navigate any periodical index.
<ol>
	<li>First, if you are searching for a particular article, search by title or author.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, it is best to use Boolean search techniques, that is, use "AND," "OR," and "NOT" to refine the search terms. Most indexes have drop-down boxes with these Boolean terms as options.</li>
	<li>Most indexes have a thesaurus that is specific to that index alone. Utilize it to get exact subjects and keywords.</li>
	<li>Many indexes also have helpful tutorials on searching and other functionality.</li>
	<li>Once you have a list of results, most indexes allow you to further refine results by publication type, subject, year, etc. using limiters in a sidebar. Use these!</li>
	<li>Finally, <strong>the most important tip is </strong><em><strong>don't give up!</strong> </em>Keep trying different combinations of terms and refining them as you go.</li>
</ol>
For more tips, see this video on <a title="Online searching" href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/279">search techniques</a>, including Boolean searching.

<h2>Journals</h2>
<p style="text-align: left">There are several ways to access a specific journal through library resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Option 1: To access all of the electronic journals available through Columbia University Libraries (which sometimes offer greater access to full text or more years of coverage), go to the <a title="Columbia University Libraries" href="http://library.columbia.edu/">Columbia University Libraries' homepage</a>, select the E-Journals tab, and search for your desired journal by title. If the Columbia Libraries subscribe to the journal, you will get a list of databases from which you can access it along with the dates available to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Option 2: To access electronic journals available through Teachers College, go to the <a title="TC library homepage" href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/">TC library homepage</a>, click on "<a title="Journals" href="http://vq2st5lq8v.search.serialssolutions.com/">Journals</a>" (located under Library Resources), and search for the journal by title. If we have the journal, you will get a list of databases from which you can access it along with the dates available to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Option 3: If you are interested in an older volume of a journal that is not covered by options 1 and 2, then you should search for the journal title in <a title="EDUCAT" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/">EDUCAT</a>. Older volumes are stored in closed stacks, but are available by request. Once you have found your desired volume in EDUCAT, click on the link that appears below it to request that it be retrieved from closed stacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Note: These techniques are for searching for a particular journal, not for articles within that journal. If you are looking for articles, you should use one of the <a href="#databases">periodical indexes</a> above, which search thousands of journals at once.</em></p>

<h2>Archives</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Locating physical archives</span>

There are several ways to locate primary resources that may be of interest to you. These include searching online catalogs, national or institutional archival databases, or inquiring directly at individual institutions.

Any institution could potentially have an archive, from a small theater to governmental agencies or corporations. If you have an interest in a particular institution, you should contact that institution directly to inquire if they have an archive and whether you may access it.

Here is a very small selection of some of New York City's largest institutions with physical archives:

<a title="Archival Collections Portal" href="http://archivesportal.cul.columbia.edu/">Columbia University's Archival Collections Portal</a>

<a title="NYPL archival materials" href="http://www.nypl.org/find-archival-materials">New York Public Library Archival Materials</a>

<a title="NYU Finding Aids Portal" href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/">Finding Aids Portal</a> for New York University's<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/"> Fales Library &amp; Special Collections</a>,  <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/tam/">The Tamiment Library &amp; Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives</a>, <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/">New York University Archives</a>, <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/library/">New York Historical Society</a>, and the <a href="http://www.brooklynhistory.org/default/index.html">Brooklyn Historical Society</a>.

If you are curious to see where else in the world collections on an individual or group may be held, you can search <a title="Worldcat" href="http://www.worldcat.org/">Worldcat </a>(short for "world catalog"). To do this, use the advanced search, select "archival material" as the format, and search by keyword. Once you locate a collection of interest, you can inquire at the individual institution to get access.

<a title="Archive Finder" href="http://www.archives.gov/northeast/nyc/">Archive Finder</a> is another large directory of archival materials which indexes names and detailed subject heading for collections and repositories in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland. Beware that the search results are not listed by relevance but in alphabetical order.

For further tips, visit the <a title="Subject Guide to archives and manuscript collections" href="http://library.columbia.edu/eguides/archives_manuscripts.html">Columbia University subject guide for archives and manuscripts collections</a>, which offers a wealth of resources on searching for archival collections at Columbia and beyond.

<strong>Using a Finding Aid</strong>

Finding aids are the documents created by archivists to describe and give context to collections and help users identify what parts of the collection are of interest to them. They usually consist of the following sections, which may vary in title:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Title and years of coverage:</strong> The title is usually the name of the person who collected the documents. While the collection will be most closely related to this person, it may hold contents of interest on other individuals. Be sure the years match those you are interested in.</li>
	<li><strong>Overview:</strong> provides the size of the collection (usually in linear feet or number of boxes), its creator, and a brief abstract.</li>
	<li><strong>Administrative information:</strong> details guidelines for citation and any access restrictions.</li>
	<li><strong>Historical or biographical note: </strong>summarizes the life of an individual or the history of an institution and can serve as a starting point for further biographical research.</li>
	<li><strong>Scope and content note: </strong>describes the content of the collection including topics, types of materials, and years covered.</li>
	<li><strong>Arrangement:</strong> lists the hierarchical order of the collection as it has been arranged in the archive.</li>
	<li><strong>Box and folder list: </strong>details the box and/or folder numbers of the collection and their contents.</li>
</ul>
Knowing these essential parts of a finding aid can help you decide if a collection is relevant and which boxes or folders to request when onsite. It is important to note that access policies vary by institution and by collection, so you should make sure you are able to access a collection before visiting the institution.
