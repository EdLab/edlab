          <p>
            The recession in 2008 had a great impact on how students valued higher education. According to Stanford economics, the demand for higher education increased as job opportunity decreased. This is because it is harder to find a job, to keep a job or get promoted. This tight situation force individuals to enroll in college and to stay in school. Families with low income also have more kids enrolling in college during the <a href"http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/march/higher-ed-hoxby-030615.html">recession</a>. Low income students benefit from federal grants to fund for college. However, some states around the country have cut back on subsidizing public universities. These cut backs have affected not only lower income students but it also means that middle income student will get little or no type of assistance to fund for college. 

The bright side of this issue is that more people are educated now because of the recession. The increase in demand allows colleges to increase the cost of education to make up for loses in other areas. Increase in price of education did not reduce the amount of people enrolling into college. It shifted the demand to cheaper alternatives. One example is the increase of enrollment in CUNY schools. This is because more students are considering attending CUNY which is cheaper than SUNY or other private schools.
