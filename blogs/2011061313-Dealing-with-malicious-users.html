Jeff Atwood, one of the creators of <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> wrote <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html">an interesting post on his blog</a> the other day about policing users in a public forum. The one thing that really stood out was this quote:

"[I]n the absence of some system of law, the tiny minority of users out to do harm — intentionally or not — eventually drive out all the civil community members, leaving behind a lawless, chaotic badland."

Anyone who follows Jeff's blog will recognize his particular dramatic flourish here, but he does raise a pretty important point. Someone has to keep the folks inline or we're all in trouble.

The idea of crowd-sourcing and open content has come up a lot recently during conversations and D&R meetings (and this week isn't an exception) and although I'd like to think the academic community is a bit more mature than everyday internet traffic, it's fairly likely that these are issues we will have to deal with at some point on any EdLab project that involves participation from the general public. 

I'd like to hear if anyone has any thoughts on adding some moderator controls to vialogues. Possibly the ability to delete other users comments, and maybe even ban a user from a particular vialogue, or group of vialogues. Currently, users would have to contact us to deal with any 'undesired contributions' to their vialogues, rather than deal with it themselves. Obviously this is not a pressing issue right now, but addressing it before it becomes one could save a lot of stress and headache.
