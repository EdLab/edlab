            Google is, by far, the most influential entity on the Web right now. (EDIT: Actually, Facebook gives them a good run for their money.) The sheer amount of traffic that goes through Google everyday is downright phenomenal. Google's server farms use up a combined power equivalent to that of Belize (believe me, I checked on Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_platform#Current_hardware">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption">here</a>). If you still don't believe me though, check out <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/google-is-way-bigger-than-you-realize">this infographic</a>.

But what makes Google generate so much traffic? And later, more importantly, is Google a positive force for the Web?

Note: As you're about to find out, this is a ridiculously long post. I am ranting because I am confused about whether to see Google as a positive force for the web or a negative force for the web.<!--break-->

First, the traffic. Yes, their search algorithm and the sheer massiveness of the index is second to none. However, their other services, such as Gmail, Calendar, Maps, etc. were neither innovative when they came out (before Gmail was Hotmail, before Maps was Mapquest) nor were they significantly better. So logically, the only explanations of Google's ridiculous success comes down to two factors: <b>1) Google is a household name, thanks to its search engine, and 2) it's <i>free</i>.</b>

It is a frequently cited statistic that when people are given a choice of saving $5 on a $10 good and getting a $2 good for free, they will usually take the latter choice. (I know I'm not citing these, but this is a blog post, not a research paper :-P) This is because psychologically, spending any money at all is significantly worse than saving more money. (In economics, this would be considered an irrational consumer. Correct me if I'm wrong.) Since most, if not all, popular Google products are free, combined with the fact that it's "Google," it will generate massive amounts of traffic.

But you might ask, how does Google foot the $2 million-a-month electricity bill on their server farms as well as all other operating costs, when they're giving everything out for free? The answer is simple: <em>ad revenue</em>. By putting advertisements in almost every single one of their products, combined with their ridiculous amounts of traffic that they get, generates incredible amount of ad revenue. Their ad is so omnipresent that it exists even in, ironically, iPhones. In my opinion, this business strategy is one that, as of now, only works for Google. You simply cannot advertise on the web efficiently without going through Google, so Google gets all the ad revenue in a circular situation.

Now, I ask the question, what would have happened to the Web had Google not existed?

The first possibility, and the one that I hope is true, is that the Web would have had a higher cost to enter for everyday consumers, and it would not have grown so dramatically like it has in the recent years. I'd like to see Google as a positive force on the Web, just like their motto, <i>Don't be Evil.</i>

The other possibility, and the one that I fear is true, is that the Web has suffered from the existence of Google. I've come to consider this conclusion because when I compare the mobile app market and the web app market, the differnce is striking. In the mobile world, it's a dog-eat-dog, perfectly competitive world, when a start-up with a mind to target a niche in the market can succeed <em>and</em> make some money from the app. You don't have to invent something completely new to make moeny in the mobile app market, but since you as a start-up have the belief that you can do something better, and make some money while doing, there are small, but constant, innovations.

Now you look at Google. It's a huge company (and that's an understatement). In the web, they're doing the "small innovating," getting major ideas from start-ups and then buy them or just make them a little bit better and put a Google branding on it. The problem here is that, well, everything's free. The "small-innovating" start-ups cannot enter the market at all because people will always use the free, <em>Google</em> product over the cheap start-up product. I fear that this has stagnated the web app market. Think about it, when was the last time you paid for a web application? When was the last time you paid for an iPhone/Android app?

I hope that Google has been a positive force in the Web. However, the one thing that you can't deny is that they, whether intentionally or not, choke out competition by leveraging their incredible power to generate ad revenue and keeping their products free. I know that from a business side, this is a winning strategy. I just hope that Google decides to take a winning strategy for the Web, for which they have responsibilities for as a leader in the industry, as well.
