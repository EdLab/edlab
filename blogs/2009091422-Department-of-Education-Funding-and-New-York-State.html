            A <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1920299,00.html">recent article in Time</a> highlights the efforts of Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to overhaul the US public school system. As part of the economic-stimulus package (<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2375">check out this earlier blog by Faisal</a>), $100 billion was set for educational spending with $5 billion of that money specifically set aside for discretionary spending by Duncan. Duncan and President Obama recently announced the Race to the Top (RTT) fund, which lets states apply for a portion of $4.35 billion of the $5 billion in discretionary spending. The remaining $650 million will go towards innovative local school districts and nonprofit organizations. States must meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for some of the RTT money. 

First, Duncan is encouraging states to repeal laws limiting the expansion of public charter schools and develop a strategy to turn around their worst performing schools and work toward building better data systems. However, the most controversial of the criteria is the requirement that states drop any laws that prohibit linking student results to teacher performance. This requirement has been met with fierce resistance from teacher unions though some states have repealed or amended certain laws to make themselves eligible for funding. New York State is not one of them. 

New York State law prohibits the use of student performance data as part of the process for evaluating teachers, especially tenured teachers and as such New York is not eligible for some of the discretionary money to be doled out by the Dept. of Education. Since  New York State's highest court ruled that every student in the state is entitled to a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2526">basic sound education</a>, (the case arose as a result of inequalities in fiscal spending in New York State public schools)  the argument can therefore be made that by denying New York State the right to federal funding, the federal government is denying New York State students the right to that basic sound education. This could potentially set the stage for a potential Supreme Court case about requirements for federal educational spending. 

Do you think New York State should repeal its prohibition in order to qualify for some of the RTT fund?
