Written in an accessible style by highly respected scholars, the  papers in this volume document and analyze particular components of the  Children First reforms, including governance, community engagement,  finance, accountability, and instruction.

The education reforms in New York City’s public schools begun under  the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and School Chancellor  Joel Klein have been among the most ambitious of any large urban system  in the country. Aimed at instituting evidence-based practices to produce  higher and more equitable outcomes for all students, the policies that  comprise the Children First initiative represent an attempt at  organizational improvement and systemic learning that is unparalleled in  U.S. public education. The tremendous scope of the reforms, the  multiple and interrelated challenges involved in their implementation,  and their undeniable impact all underscore their importance in providing  lessons for the field and in framing the conversation about the next  level of work in district-based reform.

The editors explore the theory of action behind each phase of reform,  and examine the tensions and tradeoffs that played out as these reforms  were implemented. Together, these thoughtful and thoroughly researched  analyses promise to inform improvement in other urban systems and add to  our understanding of systemic learning and change in education.

<strong>Praise:</strong>
<blockquote id="praise_159"><em>Education Reform in New York City</em> provides clear and  comprehensive analyses of an extremely complex set of very high-profile  reforms. It also provides a template for analyzing multipart,  interrelated efforts that escape easy characterization and appraisal.  The authors have done a splendid job of bringing clarity to a  complicated story. 							      						 						<cite>— Susan H. Fuhrman, president, Teachers College, Columbia University</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>This is an important book. Its breadth does justice to the  ambition and complexity of New York City’s Children First reforms, as  seen through the perspectives of both critics and advocates. Let the  debates continue and enrich other communities wrestling with the  challenge of turning around urban schools. 								      							 							<cite>— Andrés A. Alonso, CEO, Baltimore City Public Schools</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote id="praise_157">An extraordinary analysis of the New York reform effort: the  volume is respectful of the scope and intensity of the Bloomberg-Klein  reforms, yet it penetrates the hype. These collected chapters present  big city education reform in their true light: as very hard work  requiring years of sustained effort. If you want feel-good fairy tales  about Gotham, read elsewhere. If you want compassionate truth, read this  book. 							      						 						<cite>— Charles Taylor Kerchner, professor, Claremont Graduate University</cite></blockquote>
