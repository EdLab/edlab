<p>Spelling app <a href="https://www.originatorkids.com/?p=913">Endless Wordplay</a> engages beginning readers with spelling activities, silly monster friends, and animated stories. Part of the <a href="https://www.originatorkids.com">Endless Monster series</a>, Endless Wordplay groups words together by rhyming scheme and offers hints to young children as they work across a map by completing spelling puzzles.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Endless Wordplay helps young children learn to spell basic words by grouping together rhyming words and depicting their spelling similarities. Each activity comes with three rhyming words (e.g., <i>can</i>, <i>tan</i>, <i>ran</i>) that kids spell one after the other. Alphabot, the animated robot taking you through each activity, provides hints along the way if children need it. In the spelling challenges, children pick up letters and place them in the correct order. As they pick up each letter, the shape emits the phonetic sound of that letter. For instance, when you pick up an <i>f</i>, the shape spouts out <i>ffff</i> again and again so that children can get help sounding out each letter.</p>
 
<p>Like all the Endless apps, Endless Wordplay is full of animated monsters. When children complete each rhyming activity, they watch a short animated story featuring the rhyming words, as well as monsters doing silly things. Children can read along with the text accompanying each story, or just seek the words they learned, which appear in a different color than the rest of the text. Endless Wordplay has no punishments, but these little animations can be seen as rewards for moving across the Endless land.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are some phonetic elements of the app that seem off and could make the reading activities confusing or even misleading for beginners. For instance, when you pick up the <i>r</i>, the shape emits the sound <i>are</i> instead of <i>rrr</i>; when you pick up the <i>n</i>, it emits <i>en</i> instead of <i>nnn</i>. When spelling a word, the monsters will sound it out with you as you go, but this combination doesn’t always seem most helpful in teaching young readers how to sound out words. For example, the first two letters of tan are sounded out as <i>tuh</i> rather than <i>tah</i>; when spelling cat, the first two letters are sounded out as <i>caw</i> instead of <i>cah</i>. The disparities in sound pronunciation could be confusing or even misleading for beginning readers.</p>
 
<p>Also, the pricing model is steeper than I expected. Users get three free activities for a total of nine words before having to pay an extra $6.99 for 30 additional activities or $14.99 for 90. For this cost, you can normally expect more varied activities within an app, which might be an option Endless Wordplay should consider in the future.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Endless Wordplay is full of fun animations and well-grouped spelling challenges. It is best suited for young children and beginning readers. Although there are some phonetic problems that could confuse young readers as they sound out words, and although the pricing model is a bit steep, Endless Wordplay could be a helpful and fun addition to children’s spelling education.</p>
