<a href="http://thefutureproject.org/">The Future Project</a> is an organization launching this fall, which will support high school students who create their own projects to make a positive impact on their communities. 

The organization finds energetic students, which they call "future fellows", in underprivileged partner schools who are "looking to dream big, think creatively, give back to their community, and build fun, purposeful projects." The future fellows are then matched with "future coaches", who can be college or graduate students or young professionals, based on mutual interests and placed into teams with three other pairs. Each team has weekly 90-minute seminars in which they set personal goals for inspired futures and focus on tackling challenges centered around a broad theme. The themes are based on the students' grade level and are: passion (9th grade), leadership (10th grade), self-expression (11th grade), and purpose (12th grade). Each pair works on creating a project to address the theme which they hope will impact their school or community. Projects can range from hip hop shows to public gardens, with the only guideline being that they encourage, inspire and make an impact. 

The Future Project takes an interesting approach to improving education. They embrace the hacking framework of using broad themes and teamwork to create new projects for any other field of interest. Then they let the benefits of that experience be what drive the changes in education. TFP hopes to combat apathy and the perceived irrelevance of school by giving grants to support projects, providing mentorship, and inspiring students to "imagine and pursue inspired futures, whether admission to college or leaps forward in leadership or grades" and create meaningful projects that reflect their interests.
