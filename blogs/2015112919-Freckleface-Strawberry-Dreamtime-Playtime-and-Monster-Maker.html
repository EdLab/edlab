<p>Julianne Moore is one of the most prolific actors of her generation. The Oscar winning actress has been featured in Still Alice, Short Cuts, Boogie Nights, Far from Heaven, The Hours, The Big Lebowski, Magnolia, and The Kids Are All Right, among many others. Oh, and in her spare time, she also makes apps! </p>

<p>Moore developed two educational apps for very young children based on her best-selling childrenâ€™s book series Freckleface Strawberry. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freckleface-strawberry-dreamtime/id758569886?mt=8">Dreamtime Playtime</a> teaches mathematical concepts such as counting and sorting. Users play during three dreams. In her freckles dream, players count and identify freckle colors. In her friend's dream, players recall the types and colors of their clothing. And in her monster's dream, players drag and drop coins to pay the monster. 

<p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freckleface-strawberry-monster/id613496481?mt=8">Monster Maker</a>, users continue playing with Freckleface Strawberry and create their own monster. As they mix and match monster parts, they learn about colors, shapes, and sizes. After the monster is created, users can create an original snapshot of the child with their monster creation.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The narrative elements from the Freckleface Strawberry books help drive the action in both apps. Dreamtime Playtime is highly effective in inviting reluctant mathematicians to practice their skills. This is mainly due to the Freckleface character, who is a cute and spunky protagonist. Her vibrant personality and supportive voice helps make the app engaging. She kindly encourages users to continue playing if they become discouraged by answering math questions incorrectly. The app is designed to appeal to young girls who struggle with math, are shy, or need encouragement if they do not immediately succeed at a task.</p>

<p>Monster Maker can help new app users learn the basics of interacting with a device, such as through dragging and dropping monster parts. For children who may frighten easily, the friendly monster character may allow them to explore the divide between fantasy and reality. Caregivers can also discuss basic colors, shapes, and sizes regarding the monster for those who are very young. Finally, for kids who are reading averse, Monster Maker may entice them into reading the Freckleface Strawberry series. </p>

<p>Given the focus on dreams, both games have colorful, playful, dreamlike visuals that invite users into the fantasy. The well-drawn characters and icons match the graphic quality of the books. The interactivity is highly functional, and young kids should enjoy spending time with Freckleface Strawberry in both of these adventures. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Dreamtime Playtime is limited in the breadth of mathematical concepts it covers. Children could become bored with the content relatively quickly. Monster Maker is fun to play but has little substantive learning impact. Mixing and matching body parts, although fun, makes more of a pure game than an educational application. For very young users, this app is developmentally appropriate. For older users ready for more substantive content, Monster Maker is not particularly useful other than for acquiring generic computer skills such as manipulating a tablet or mobile device. </p>
  
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Due to its mathematical subject matter, Dreamtime Playtime is clearly more educationally beneficial than Monster Maker. However, both are fun to play. Perhaps using Monster Maker as an incentive to migrate to Dreamtime Playtime may be the most useful strategy if you want your children to learn mathematics or read the book series. Also, if you have children who are shy or frightened easily by games, Freckleface Strawberry may be a perfect opportunity for them to learn the basics of computer interactivity in an encouraging way as well as explore issues around dreaming, monsters, and the differences between fantasy and reality. </p>
