<p>Almost all first-year university students have to take some sort of Writing 101 course during their first semester. This shared experience is formative because it is often the first learning community a Freshman is a part of in higher education. While these classes are traditionally held in person, the rise of online education has led to many such courses being taught with new methods, such as through blended learning. A group of researchers wanted to know how this new environment affected the development of a learning community.</p>

<p>The researchers were specifically interested in how different kinds of blended learning courses fostered a Community of Inquiry, a framework looking at how social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence intersect to create an educational experience.The study featured 229 participants in 17 blended sections of first-year writing courses at a public university. Eight of the class sections were medium blend courses (33% online), while nine were high blend courses (50% online). Students were given an end-of-the-semester survey to allow them to share perceptions of their experience in the blended learning environment. Researchers also made observations about the different types of activities that medium- and high-blend students engaged with when in class online.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that students in high-blend classes consistently perceived greater degrees of teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence in their course than students in medium-blend classes, making the former more likely to form a Community of Inquiry. Regarding activities, researchers discovered that in the high-blend classes there were more opportunities for student-instructor interaction as well as interaction among students, particularly in the form of required discussion forum participation.</p>

<p>The researchers wonder if these results might be due to the fact that high-blend courses differ more from traditional classes; teachers might feel more urgency in this context to prove theyâ€™re still present, while students might take the online learning more seriously since it constitutes a larger percentage of the course.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the results of this study demonstrate that our assumption that face-to-face learning is inherently more interactive might not be correct. By demonstrating how blended courses can foster Communities of Inquiry, these findings can help improve blended learning course design, professional development for instructors, and course orientation for students.</p>
