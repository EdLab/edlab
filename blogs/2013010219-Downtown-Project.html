<i>Education is the bedrock on which a truly great city is built. We believe a rock-solid education system builds community by helping intelligent people to do amazing things. It creates opportunities for people to explore new ideas and develop new passions </i> (<a href="http://downtownproject.com/">Downtown Project</a>).

<p>

<b>Building Happiness</b>
<br>
Perhaps Zappos.com founder Tony Hsieh played the popular virtual "town building" game <a href="http://thesims.com/en_US/home">The Sims</a> a few too many times as a teen.  When playing The Sims users are able to control every detail of their town from leadership to landscaping, and in the case of the <a href="http://downtownproject.com/">Downtown Project,</a> Hsieh is in the process of doing just that. Hsieh is currently rebuilding and ultimately reinvigorating an area of downtown Las Vegas, 2 miles north of "The Strip," that falls within the Clark County school district.  When Hsieh took over, this semi-urban zone of downtown Las Vegas was primarily comprised of the "working poor" and almost completely overlooked and underserved. Using funding from his vast personal wealth (In 2009
Hsieh sold Zappos to Amazon for $1.2 billion.), Hsieh is building cultural resources ranging from cafes to concert spaces, and supporting ground-level construction that encourages walking and biking.  These initiatives are paired with new collaborative working opportunities and unique infrastructure that encourage tech incubation and development, which are a part of Hsieh’s plans to attract a new influx of "creative" professionals with the goal of developing "the most community-focused large city in the world."  Connie Yeh, Hsieh's cousin and head of the initiative’s education fund, described this goal to New Learning Times via email: "We want downtown Las Vegas to be a hub where people encounter unexpected opportunities and ideas, find and foster their passions, meet amazing people and new friends, and love to live, work, and play."  Beyond creativity, Hsieh is known as a leader who strives to encourage <a href="http://www.deliveringhappiness.com/">"happiness"</a> in both his employees and customers, and it is through "inspiring and empowering people to follow their passions to create a vibrant, connected urban core" that Hsieh feels the Downtown Project will succeed. Hsieh is investing not only in "cultural" upgrades, but also working to support education through public and private schools. Initiatives range from the conversion of a church into a pre-school, funding to support thousands of Teach for America fellows at local schools and a partnership with <a href=" http://www.skillshare.com/">Skillshare</a>. Yeh elaborated on this partnership, "Essentially anyone can become a teacher or a student, and we envision downtown Las Vegas as the location for accelerated learning, collaboration, and cross-pollination of great ideas."  Hsieh goes so far as to describe education’s role in his plans for the Downtown Project as, "the bedrock on which a truly great city is built."  If the conversion of the town hall into Zappos headquarters is an indication of a "happy" and not hostile corporate takeover, then downtown Las Vegas might become one of the best possible case studies of big business interfering positively in a small town.
<p>
 
<b>Commerce & Classrooms</b>
<br>
When corporate headquarters replace a town hall there is a literal and cultural shift at work; you are taking what was once a public facility led by elected officials and instead, installing an empire of, in this case, e-commerce.  Only time will tell if the Downtown Project is a success and becomes a model of commerce and civics colliding to create something truly beneficial for both the company and the local population.  In the case of downtown Las Vegas, Hsieh is truly putting money where until relatively recently, only a flashy website has gone before. He is investing over $350 million, including $50 million for education and over $50 million for the <a href="http://vegastechfund.com/">VegasTech Fund</a> to revitalize the area.  Of the $50 million for education, a percentage will be used to support the work of Teach For America in local Clark County Schools.  Yeh explained that  "Downtown Project has a partnership with Teach For America where we have contributed $1.2 million a year.  In the last year, TFA has increased their incoming corps member size from 50 to 125, with plans to expand significantly in the coming years."  Viktor Wakefield, the executive director of TFA’s Las Vegas Valley office noted that "At this scale we will impact nearly half of the children growing up in poverty, accelerate the reforms designed to improve the system, and cultivate the proof point schools that will change the conversation about education in our community.  More specifically, this TFA grant will help to support teaching in high-needs subject areas like math, science, and special education, and help provide the means to support a record number of TFA corps members in the area. 
<br>
It is clear that Hsieh is not just selling shoes anymore; instead, he is supporting the development of a new model of urban living.  A new model supported in part by the same ubiquitous technologies as the ones that helped him build his business, online platforms to connect and share ideas.  Additionally, he is developing infrastructure meant to encourage open, peer-to-peer interaction, support creativity and foster innovation.  These goals are directly in-line with an ideal learning environment both in and out of the classroom.  Time will tell whether or not Hsieh’s goal to have education function as the marquis "product" in this new endeavor will come to fruition; regardless, it will be an experiment in urban development that is worth watching.  I wonder if he will offer free shipping?

<b>Exclusive NLT interview with
Viktor Wakefield, 
Executive Director of Teacher for America, Las Vegas Valley </b><br>  October 11th, 2012  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How has Downtown Project funding helped the Clark County Teach for America efforts?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The funding provided by the Downtown Project enabled Teach For America to significantly increase the number of corps members teaching in low income classrooms across the Las Vegas Valley. This support is critical in our effort to grow to a scale of 1,000 corps members and alumni living and leading in the Las Vegas Valley within the next five years. At this scale we will impact nearly half of the children growing up in poverty, accelerate the reforms designed to improve the system, and cultivate the proof point schools that will change the conversation about education in our community.
<b>Question:</b> What is one example of how the TFA corps members are making a difference for traditionally under-served students? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> Corps members are making a dramatic difference in lives of traditionally under-served students across the Las Vegas Valley. For instance, Chris Reger, who was recognized as a CCSD new teacher of the year this past year, leveraged his experiences in private business and MBA in order to take his math instruction to an exceptional level. Chris saw 88% of his 8th graders pass the Algebra Honors exam at Brinley Middle School vs. 28% of students who passed the exam the previous year. He also saw 1.12 years of growth in his prealgebra students. 
<br><b>Question:</b> Are there any additional ways that Tony Hsieh and Downtown Project are impacting the LV learning landscape that stand out for you? 
<br><b>Answer:</b> The Downtown Project and Tony Hsieh are adding an infusion of energy, innovation, and collaboration into the LV learning landscape. By supporting initiatives like skillshare, promoting community and co-learning, and building strong relationships with the schools around downtown, they are proving that they are exceptional at bringing people together and encouraging them to follow their passions. <br>
<b>Question:</b>  How might the Downtown Project be a model for helping to revitalize the educational system in an area? 
<br><b>Answer:</b> I think that the greatest potential of the Downtown Project is to attract, develop, and retain education entrepreneurs in the Las Vegas community. There is an education crisis on hand in Las Vegas – graduation rates have hovered near the 50% mark, limited early childhood and kindergarten options mean that students enter school underprepared, and many of our students who do graduate leave high school underprepared for college. There is great momentum in our system under the leadership of Superintendent Dwight Jones, but there also must be a community-wide movement devoted to putting an end to this systemic injustice. The Downtown Project is already acting as a source of innovation and creativity in the face of this challenge. As the partnerships with our school system strengthen, particularly in the downtown corridor, the Downtown Project will serve a critical role in attracting passionate people to create innovative solutions for our schools.
