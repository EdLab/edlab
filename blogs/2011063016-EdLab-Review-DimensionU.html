DimensionU Learning System, from Tabula Digita, is "a universe of educational video games where students practice core K-12 subjects including math, literacy, science and history." This learning universe serves as a network for educational games developed for students K-8. The learning system follows from their successful DimensionM series of math games. Tabula Digita's first and foremost aim is to engage and motivate students to succeed academically.

<b>Pros:</b> 
The gameplay to most of the games I demo-ed was very impressive. From the graphics to the animation to the strategies necessary for success, the games themselves feel very rich. The ability to play multi-player games adds a social layer to the DimensionU universe. Each game also has rankings for the top performers of each game, thus utilizing game dynamics rooted in competition. The games are easily customizable to fit the relevant subject and skill level. On a final note, the concepts embedded in their games are standards-based, thus making them a great supplement to what is taught in the classroom.

<b>Cons:</b>
The lesson content can be improved. I primarily played the science games and found that many of the questions were repeated in a single game and multiple choice questions were the common method of assessing knowledge. From personal experiences as well as my demo of DimensionU, this is a problem many educational games suffer from. The lack of a seamless interface makes it difficult to pose more challenging problems that require more open-ended thinking and less reliance on process-of-elimination and test-taking skills.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Given the recent efforts to develop a application for teaching mathematics to K-6 here at the EdLab, there is a lot to learn from the game mechanics found in the DimensionU games and learning system, though I ought to emphasize that while EdLab's math project is only interested in developing a game-layer, rather than independent games itself.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
DimensionU has the right focus in creating a social kid-friendly gaming platform that serves as the perfect supplement to teachers. One hopes the quality of the lesson content soon matches the quality of the gameplay features.
