<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that a total  of 2,500 million people were affected by disasters from 1995 to 2004,  with the loss of 89,000 lives and at a cost of around $570 billion. What  enables trauma victims to survive—and continue to flourish in the wake  of disasters, whether natural or man-made?

<strong>About the author: </strong>

<strong>Dr, Ani Kalayjian
</strong>

For more than a decade, Dr. Ani Kalayjian has been on a journey of  healing through forgiveness and meaning. She has devoted her life to  studying the impact of trauma, and helping others heal so that they can  reach a state of wholeness. "The terror from the sights and sounds of  bombs, the loss of homes, possessions, routines, and stability; the  experience of seeing their parents crying, fearful, and in anguish --  all these will likely last a lifetime for the Iraqi children," Kalayjian  said of the current war. "And the effects of this war will continue for  many generations."

Kalayjian's parents were survivors of the  1915 Ottoman Turkish Genocide of the Armenians which wiped out  two-thirds of the Armenian people. Dr. Kalayjian grew up experiencing  the effects of trauma through her parents' suffering, and that trauma  became hers.

Kalayjian's parents were always in pain, even after  moving to the United States. It was not until after she started her  research on the effects of trauma that she discovered what her  grandparents endured during the genocide. Although Dr. Kalayjian's  parents tried to 'spare' the family by maintaining silence, she still  felt their pain.

As a child she didn't know what was wrong or how  to process it. Ultimately, she processed it through her work. She  became a Psychiatric nurse and teacher, then psychologist, international  researcher and devoted her life to helping survivors of natural and man  made disasters.

Dr. Ani Kalayjian is a graduate of Long Island  University (LIU) with a Masters and Doctor of Education degree from  Teachers College, Columbia University. As a pioneering therapist,  educator, director and author, she has devoted her life to bringing  healing to those who have survived the devastation of disaster, whether  man-made or natural.
