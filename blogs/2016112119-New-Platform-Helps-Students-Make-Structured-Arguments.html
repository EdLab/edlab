<p>With assessments like the SAT restructuring to merge literacy with math and science, it comes as no surprise that the pressure to prepare students for success is not letting up. That is why platforms like <a href="https://thinkcerca.com">ThinkCERCA</a> are becoming more popular. This new technology has created a digital reading and writing world. Their platform reflects careful research in design, fostering audio, visual, and kinetic scaffolding for improved comprehension and development of critical thinking skills. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>The ThinkCERCA platform has a host of lessons and exercises available to teachers. The reading comprehension exercises have text supported by images and audio. However, it is the writing section that is truly unique as the platform is designed for optimum scaffolding while students write. Students are prompted to respond to assertions with claims, support these claims with evidence, clearly explain their reasoning, identify counter arguments, and use appropriate language for their audience. Each part of this writing process is broken down on the platform making it easy for students to structure their writing and have all the necessary ingredients to create a powerful essay. Students also receive instant evaluations on their performance. Teachers can even create their own lessons or use rubrics to give personalized feedback.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p> This platform is rich in learning, but seems to lack in visual appeal for students. Upon entering the platform, the text heavy interface can be a bit off-putting as it appears to take traditional textbooks and worksheets and simply make them digital. The activities can also become a bit redundant which can make fostering creative writing more difficult. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p> In spite of the discouraging aesthetics the platform, ThinkCERCA is full of substance. The potential for it to help students of various reading and writing levels cannot be denied. However, using the platform daily is sure to reduce the novelty and creativity needed to foster great writing. </p>
