<i>For thousands of years, people have known that the best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else. "While we teach, we learn," said the Roman philosopher Seneca </i> (<a href=" http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/#ixzz2Ct0ZBs5p ">Time Ideas</a>).

<p>

<b>Teaching your way to the Answer</b><p>
Operating under the premise that the best way to learn is to teach, <a href="http://upsidedownacademy.org/">UpsideDownAcademy (UDA)</a> has created a site dedicated to sharing user-generated lessons.  Organized by subject, visitor type (educator, homeschooler, students in traditional educational setting, etc.) and "confidence level" (novice to expert), UDA hopes to empower learners to become "educators." UDA builds on recent research on the <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/">"protege effect"</a> which purports that learners will learn more when they attempt to teach material to others.  For example, as Annie Murphy points out in <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/#ixzz2Ct2vBYjT">Time.com</a>, "Students enlisted to tutor others, these researchers have found, work harder to understand the material, recall it more accurately and apply it more effectively."  In addition to creating unique self-guided lesson content that will benefit individual users, individuals who contribute lessons to UDA are ultimately helping to "crowd-source" a library of user-generated content to support future peer-to-peer learning on a digital scale. 
<p>
<b>A Puzzling Beginning</b><p>
Started by <a href="http://puzzleschool.com/">The Puzzle School</a>, a group dedicated to using puzzles and games to foster learning, Upside Down Academy builds off of this emphasis on self-guided, inquiry-based learning.  The Puzzle School’s mission illustrates the approach, "This model can best be summed up as hypothesis and error driven learning, where students develop a hypothesis toward solving a problem and are able to test that hypothesis, learning from a success or failure as they move closer to a solution."  This element of trial and error is alive and well on the UDA platform, as learners must iterate and revamp their lessons until they have a concise video-worthy lesson that others can learn from.  For example, in an UDA video created by student user "a Wolf," she outlines the process for adding fractions and proudly adds her own aside at the end regarding a shortcut to the answer.  It is fascinating to watch her process and as a viewer, one gets a definite feeling that this "teacher" is now more confident in her knowledge of both the process and material.  While many of the featured lessons appear to be simple to explain, as any of us who have taught a lesson know, sometimes the simplest processes are the hardest to teach others and provide valuable lessons in the process of delivery.  Perhaps, as we search for more effective learning solutions, we aren’t focused on the right aspect of the problem.  Instead of emphasizing teacher-driven content creation on sites like <a href="http://teachertube.com/">TeacherTube</a>, we should explore more learner-driven resources like UDA.  The classroom of the future might not <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/science/11robots.html?pagewanted=all">replace teachers with robots</a>, as many fear, but instead, with learners.
