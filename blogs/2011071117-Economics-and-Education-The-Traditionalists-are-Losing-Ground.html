          <p>
            When you read Diane Ravitch and the folks at Schools Matter, you will be struck by the rough tone that both take in their commentary. Clearly there is a bitterness towards 'reformers', especially pop intellectuals who take up the cause of ed reform. I was pleased with Diane Ravitch's tone in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/opinion/l06dialogue.html">response</a> to David Brooks' attack on her views. However progressive educators like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-06cPuXf30&feature=player_embedded">Gary Stager</a> clearly demonstrate the bitterness by those in the education community at being trampled on by outsiders. 

Here are some of the trends that are going against the traditional education community:

1) The rise of 'economics of education' has led to more economists influencing education policymakers and more studies rooted in econometric models. The economics discipline typically wasn't deeply engaged in educational issues until the last couple of decades. Yet much of the push for education reform has been rooted in economics studies which have shown the lack of efficacy in paying based on post-secondary education or seniority. Moreover, it is largely the result of the emphasis on value-added assessment, first created by economists, that the real push to focus on teacher quality and hiring/firing has occurred. More space for economists has led to less space for educational psychologists and historians.

2) Lack of objectivity (or rigor, depending on perspective). Much of the reason policymakers are likely to gravitate to a discipline like economics is that econometrics is far more objective and concrete than research methods often used in educational psychology, such as naturalistic observation and psychometrics. Gary Stager's talk for example, relies on a couple of case studies that hardly amount to rigor that would be accepted as a study in rigorous social science disciplines. Of course more objective could imply more limited, but, from the policymaker's perspective, he or she is searching for cause-effect wherever possible.

3) Stagnating education performance. It has not been a great few decades for American education as far as educational achievement goes, especially in inner-cities. As a result, there is more push to "shake things up" and go against the trendy progressive ideas that have been popular in schools in the past few decades (e.g. multiple intelligences). 

4) The China factor...people are getting more and more conscious of international competition in the context of education. Amy Chua set fire to a debate over the role of discipline, ambition, and conservative pedagogy with regards to educating and raising children in America. More and more are panicking about what to do about education, and this has rocked the boat for traditionalists.
