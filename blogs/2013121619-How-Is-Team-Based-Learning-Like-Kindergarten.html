Team-based learning (TBL) is often touted as an effective method of teaching and learning, but what do students <i>actually</i> think of it? The video above showcases a group of students who answer that question with tongues fully in cheeks. <p>

Drawing comparisons to kindergarten, this "infomercial" for TBL calls into question many of its practices: creating group names, peer-reviews, and group quizzes. It also sheds doubt on the efficacy of learning through peers rather than trained professors.  <p>

The students featured here are in med school, but could their discontent breed in other fields as well? Whether you found the sentiments in the video inflammatory or full of truth, thereâ€™s an ongoing debate happening right now on Vialogues that likely supports your argument. <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12454">Head on over and get in on the action!</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>


<b>@00:00 slivingstone: </b>Nonsense! If Dick Cheney had been treated by doctors working independently rather than as a team, he would be dead; if problems leading to the discovery of the Higg's particle had been the result of individuals working in isolation, there would be no evidence of it; and when teachers teach students in isolation, learning suffers. We are social animals and learn better, teach better, and work better in teams, period. <p>

<b>@02:18 JordaJean: </b> I've actually never been much of a fan of TBL myself. I think it's a consequence of over-crowded classrooms; by breaking the students into small groups, the teacher doesn't have to deal with an entire class at once.
