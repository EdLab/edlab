Ebrary, the primary provider and host of e-books for our library, recently published the results of a 2011 survey of the current e-content practices and interactions in academic libraries. This was clearly a vendor-funded paper, though the author is a librarian. In response to a survey comment about the feasibility of electronic interlibrary loan, McKeil stated “interlibrary loan does not make sense in the context of the Internet. Demanding it inhibits the evolution of a model that utilizes the functionality of the Internet” (8). Despite its flaws, the survey presents an interesting picture of an industry firmly rooted in past models, but deeply considering the implications of change. 

The study found that users prefer an “untethered” reading experience from a tablet or mobile device, but the single-user access this requires is a big problem for libraries. The paper presents quotes from respondents bemoaning the exorbitant prices of multiple user access, but this is a legitimate concern that hinges on the idea of a book and its failure to scale in a way that makes sense to customers. The study contains an expansive discussion on check-out periods for single-user electronic materials, but the responses seem to indicate that users reasonably want as much access and freedom as Ebrary can potentially grant them without charging extra. It's likely that the issue of offline reading will wane as phone and tablet reading slowly eliminate the designated e-reader and academic librarians seem largely unfazed by “tethered” e-resources. One respondent commented, “Our library has offline options ---Books :)” 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
This survey is a great example of the digital/analogue divide in e-books. Ebrary continually refers to print-inspired models while also attempting to emphasize the differences between print and electronic, primarily in the case of extra fees for print-standard services like check out. It's good to hear respondents demanding better, faster, cheaper electronic access and the Ebrary survey really delivered. It doesn't seem like Ebrary is ready to transition into born digital pricing models, but it's clear from the survey responses that academic librarians are impatient for that transition.
