<p>Learning languages has come a long way since pocket translation dictionaries and Rosetta Stone. <a href="https://www.verbling.com/">Verbling</a> is a new addition to the foreign language education scene, with its key feature being its selection of native speakers who teach through group or one-on-one tutoring via live video. Teachers must apply in order to be a part of Verbling’s database, and the selection process favors those with teaching certificates or experience.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Verbling boasts hundreds of teachers, all of whom are required to be native speakers. For those who wish to learn languages from countries halfway across the globe, it can be difficult to find fluent speakers in their area, so being able to have face-to-face instruction time over live video is invaluable. Verbling also gives users the option to book slots based off a teacher’s available times, and many of them offer a trial session so that newbies who are unsure of the platform or their teacher can try it out before committing to paying.</p>

<p>The site also provides packages, which are one-on-one courses organized by proficiency level and theme—for example, <i>Business English</i> or <i>French Culture</i>. These packages vary in length and come with a corresponding fee. Finally, Verbling also provides forum-based language practice groups at various proficiency levels for users who want to practice on their own time.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because Verbling offers instructional time with real people, it is not a free service. Each teacher charges a certain rate, which users have to pay in order to receive instruction time. Some may find the rates a bit outside their price range, particularly when comparing the service to free language learning sites like Duolingo or traditional print resources that can be borrowed from the library. Adding an audio-only version may also help open up this valuable product to students who have slow internet connectivity.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Although the amount of language learning resources available these days—particularly online—is seemingly endless, Verbling takes advantage of video conferencing technology to provide the closest thing to face-to-face tutoring with a native speaker you can receive without applying for a travel visa and enduring a twelve-hour plane ride.</p>
