          <p>
            I am certain every aspect of Osama bin Laden's death and its impact on the war against terrorism has been analyzed over and over again these past few days. For most, bin Laden's death is simply symbolic and won't spell the end of al-Qaeda or terrorism. Others argue by ridding al-Qaeda of its inspirational leader, along with the peaceful protests for democracy in the Middle East and North Africa (aptly dubbed the Arab Spring), al-Qaeda's prominence as an organization has been permanently weakened.

Bin Ladens' death surely puts an end to the one person who was the most prominent modern proponent of terror against the West and its allies. Bin Laden's quest to form an Islamic empire ruled by Islamic law by ridding it of all outside evil was essentially a continuation of what Egyptian scholar <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1253796">Sayyid Qutb</a> started during the early years of post colonial rule in the Middle East. Qutb, often hailed as the father of modern day radical Islamic thinking, was the foremost and earliest critic of Western values and those majority Islamic states that adhered to what he perceived as non-Islamic values. His vision saw Islam as the centerpiece of everyday life and Sharia law as the only form of governmental law or rule to govern civil life. As a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in his native Egypt, he was executed in 1966 as a result of Egyptian leader Gamal Nasser's crackdown on political groups that expressed criticism of his policies. 

Qutb's ideology only gained strength in the years following his execution as he was hailed a martyr for his refusal to back track on the very values and ideals he often wrote about and ultimately died for. Nasser's successor, Anwar Sadat, was one of the first major casualties of individuals and groups that adhered to Qutb's doctrines after a radical group executed him in 1981. Qutb's arguments and doctrines will serve as the inspiration behind the <i>mujahedeen</i> and their battle with Soviet forces during the latter's decade long fight to gain control of Afghanistan. Bin Laden basically picked up where the <i>mujahedeen</i> left off and essentially continued Qutb's vision of a world in which Islam and Sharia law was the sole means by which people lived. His death, much like Qutb's, signal an end of the person, not the ideas and values he preached. Surely someone will pick up bin Laden's mantle and continue to preach the radical version of Islam he often touted. I know this because history tells me that is often the case.
