            Insight problem refers to puzzles that require a sudden spark of insight to solve. 

From the famous 9-dot problem, karl Duncker concluded that prior experience is sometimes part of what leads you to fixate on the incorrect path. When you overcome the fixation, you reformulate the problem and see the solution.

Janet Metcalfe, with her separated insight and non-insight problems, showed that for insight problems, people usually get the solution suddenly. This further suggested that insight was different from more ordinary, incremental problem solving. 

On the other hand, Robert Weisberg conducted an experiment that brought problem to Janet Metcalfe's findings. Robert believed that past experience is always the way you solve problems - even insight problems. These are difficult not because you're blocked by fixation caused by prior experience but because you don't have enough of the right kind of prior experience. With his puzzle about a clergyman, he concluded that we store information in a different way when we solve a problem than when we passively receive information. Creativity isn't about rejecting convention and forgetting what we know. Instead, it's based on past experience and existing concepts.  And the most important past experiences are in social groups filled with collaboration.

If insight isn't sudden, how can we explain the many famous stories of significant artworks and ideas that seem to come out of nowhere? The experiment conducted by Norman Maier showed that people have no trouble coming up with explanations for their behavior after the fact. They believe they had a solitary insight but the real story is that a social encounter was responsible for the idea. And this phenomenon is called confabulation. The myth that insight emerges suddenly and unpredictably persists because most people aren't consciously aware of the social and collaborative encounters that lead to their insights.


Then how do insights emerge? What goes on in the mind when people have an insight? One of the simplest ways to re-create insight in the laboratory is by using RAT - Remote Associate Test. Based on RAT, Kenneth Bowers' conducted an experiment. It demonstrated that your mind is always working closer to a solution, even when you feel blocked. Successful creators know how to keep their sparks coming by tapping into a collaborative process that unfolds over time.
