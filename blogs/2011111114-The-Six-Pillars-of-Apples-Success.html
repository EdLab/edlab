These tenets were adapted from <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/">Fast Co. Design</a> and  <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/users/cliffkuang">Cliff Kuang's</a> piece entitled, <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665375/the-6-pillars-of-steve-jobss-design-philosophy">"The 6 Pillars of Steve Job's Design Philosophy"</a>.  As you read through the originals on Fast Co. Design's site and my interpretations listed below, what are the take-aways for current & future EdLab projects, tools & initiatives?  What messages are most relevant?  Are there any we should ignore?  

<b>1) Craftsmanship & Quality Should Reign Supreme!</b> 

If you are going to design a website, product, app or tool the quality should be there from the beginning.  No cracks, major bugs or broken UI.  Every interaction a user has with your tool or product should reflect this.  How often has a negative user experience left a bad taste in your mouth for that product or company?  Even just a brief server outage can wreak havoc... <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2011-10-12/blackberry-outages-spread-to-north-america/50742476/1">BlackBerry</a> anyone?  Missteps & bugs are to be expected, but the overall craftsmanship of the product or service should be exceptional.  If it isn't as Apple has proven time & again, it is better to wait for (near) perfection to launch.  

The following excerpt from one of Steve Job's interviews quoted in the Fast Co. post listed above reiterates this,  "When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood in the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through." 


<b>2) Empathize with your Consumer</b>

Apple tried to understand consumer needs and anticipate user desire before anyone knew they wanted or needed them.  Truly understanding how users want to and do interact in their daily lives is a hallmark of Apple development.  I view this as pro-active vs reactive development.  Meet your consumer where they already live.  Whether it is listening to music on a commute, on their "desktop" or in their hands as they browse the day's news, be the best product in that moment.

For more on this and the next three tenets check-out this memo entitled, <a href="http://enterprisingfashion.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/applemarketingphilosophy.jpg">"Apple Marketing Philosophy"</a> drafted over 3 decades ago by one of the first execs at Apple, Mike Markkula.  


<b>3) Focus only on Select Opportunities</b> 

Basically, I interpret this as focus on your core consumer or business and don't try to be everything to everyone.  Don't dilute your message or spread your efforts too thin.  Ever wonder why Apple doesn't make printers?


<b>4) Design Matters!</b>

This tenet was originally entitled "impute" but I feel a simpler way to describe this is good design = happy user experience.  Perceived value & desirability of a product goes-up in direct relation to the quality & "beauty" of the product's design.  Wait in line for a phone that was not designed by Apple recently?  

<b>5) Happiness & Friendliness</b>

The comparison between the early "smiley" mac logo & IBM ThinkPad's "serious" tone are especially appropriate.  People wanted to engage with the early MAC's interface... it had them at "hello."  Who among us didn't see early iMacs like the clam shell laptop in Jelly-hued colors and not think "candy" or "fun?"  Apple really was one of the first companies to make technology previously only relegated to the realm of business & study, fun, approachable & ultimately more human-driven.  To further illustrate this, think of the early desktop-based iMac... how often did you really pick it up by the clever handle embedded in the top?  Very rarely, but the handle was there none-the-less, reminding you that this wasn't just stationary tool, but instead, a playful, movable feast of a machine. 
 
<b>6) The Value of Simplicity</b> 

What better way to express this than the success of the early iPod.  All your music & later media in one concise, beautifully designed package with no extraneous design elements.  Every button and line served a purpose.  Like calligraphy the artistry and message was conveyed beautifully & simply with the fewest strokes possible.
