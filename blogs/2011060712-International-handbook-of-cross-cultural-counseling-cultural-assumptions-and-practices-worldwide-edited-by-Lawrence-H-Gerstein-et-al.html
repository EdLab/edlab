<a href="http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book231934"><strong>From the Publisher</strong></a>: The only book to capture the rich diversity of the profession of counseling around the world, this volume provides a strong theoretical, research, and practical focus, with contributions from more than 80 world-renowned scholars. The first section of the <strong>Handbook </strong>includes chapters on multicultural and cross-cultural psychology in relation to the profession of counseling in a global context—its current status, methodological issues when studying culture, opportunities and challenges in collaboration across borders, and indigenous models of counseling.

The heart of the <strong>Handbook</strong> includes chapters that describe the present state of the field in the following countries:

• Europe: France, Great Britain, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, former USSR
• The Middle East: Israel, Turkey, United Arab Emirates
• The Americas and the Caribbean: Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Venezuela
• South and West Africa: Nigeria, South Africa
• Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan
• South Asia: India, Pakistan
• Southeast Asia: Malaysia, Singapore
• East Asia: China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan
• Oceania: Australia

Topics covered in the various country chapters include the history of counseling, cultural and religious values that have shaped attitudes toward counseling, types of clients and presenting problems, indigenous models of counseling, professional issues and challenges, research findings, the influence of U.S. models, and implications for the future.

This<strong> Handbook</strong> is a must-have resource for mental health professionals. It is also a critical resource for any academic library, as it will be an invaluable reference for faculty and students alike.

<strong>On the Web</strong>: “I highly recommend the <strong>Handbook</strong> for courses in international and cross-cultural psychology, courses on multicultural issues in counseling and psychology, and as a text for professional issues courses in counseling and psychology.
