<p><i>"There’s no such thing as playing without learning." </i> (<a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/about">Sawyer</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Parents Helping Parents</b></p>

<p>Having good neighbors pays off in a pinch. A borrowed egg can save a batch of brownies, and for a sample or two of the finished product, most neighbors are happy to help. In 2015, two neighbors in Brooklyn wondered why their sharing stopped at eggs and sugar. They were both searching for enriching and fun classes for their children, and decided to create <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com"> Sawyer</a>, an online platform that allows parents to browse, search, and sign up for local educational kids’ activities. The platform’s namesake is Mark Twain’s adventurous Tom Sawyer, but it saves the exploration for the kids. Sawyer aims to save parents from searching endlessly for high quality activities for kids of all ages.</p>

<p><b>Something for Everyone</b></p>

<p>Programs are vetted and organized by age and theme, making it easy for parents to find the right class, drop-in event, or summer camp. Sawyer’s founders believe that playing is learning, and that it’s never too young to start. <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/providers/baby-dj-school"> Baby DJ School</a> is open to newborns in the 0-3 month age range, while cooking classes with <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/providers/allergic-to-salad/about"> Allergic to Salad</a> are reserved for older children of at least 18 months. Other programs offer more serious play, such as <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/providers/actors-technique-new-york/about"> Actor’s Technique New York, </a> a place for kids and teenagers to hone their skills and network with agents. There are also  adult classes, in case parents want to join in on the fun.</p>

<p><b>A Boost for Small Businesses</b></p>

<p>Sawyer offers custom class management software to its partnering organizations to streamline registration and network with other activity providers. They want to make it easy for small business owners to manage the logistics of their organization so they can focus on providing high quality activities. Sawyer’s blog offers tips on how to create and manage membership programs, and shares spotlight interviews with local kids’ activities providers.</p>

<p>Sawyer now lists events in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. From chess clubs to African dance lessons, the platform shares learning possibilities that allow kids to explore their neighborhood in a new way.</p>
