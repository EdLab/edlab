            A couple days ago, PBS Frontline premiered an in depth documentary on the issue of whether collegiate athletes should be paid. At the center of this question issue is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), who are being blame for exploiting these athletes to generate revenue.

Founded in 1906, the NCAA is the nation's leading organizer of intercollegiate athletic programs with over a thousand participating institutions. Although it takes on the name as a nonprofit organization, the NCAA in fact wrecks in billions of dollars in revenue and profits each year. Revenue is generated from a variety of fields such as television and marketing rights, advertisement, among others. With all of this money at their disposal, it leaves many wondering why the performing athletes are not getting their fair share of the profits.

The NCAA does not advocate a monetary incentive for college athletes on the basis that they are “amateur student athletes” and not professional players. An athletic scholarship is seen as enough for these athletes since they are given an opportunity to receive an education from an accredited institution while simultaneously developing their athletic talent.
 
Former collegiate athletes (especially those of “big named” universities) and other advocates though object this notion. They cite that college athletes should receive some sort of financial compensation due to the amount of money and publicity that they generate for both the NCAA and their respective colleges. In fact the most profitable college football team, the University of Texas, generated about 94 million dollars in revenue and 69 million dollars in profits last year. In terms of publicity, last year's Final Four “Cinderella”, Butler University helped the university's applicant pool surge about 41% from the previous year. No matter how significant their contributions are though, college athletes are still required by contract not to accept any financial compensation from any university related personnel. Those that violate this law, along with their university, receive severe repercussions. This has some advocates likening the situation to modern day indentured servitude. If these collegiate athletes are not receiving their portion of the profits they helped generate, one has to wonder exactly what the NCAA does the profits generated.

According to the NCAA, profits generated are geared to the organization of the program such as paying for the remodeling of stadiums for tournament games, among others. Critics, on the other hand, note that the surplus is used to inflate the salaries of the organization's leader board, some of whom receive well over seven figure salaries. The CEO  of the Tostitos Bowl (one of the marque Bowl Championship Series (BCS) games) recently just got <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/campusrivalry/post/2011/03/fiesta-bowl-ceo-junker-fired-amid-multiple-investigations/1">fired</a>  for using revenue generated from the bowl game for his personal expenses. 

As to whether college athletes should be paid remains to be seen but there seems to be ground being gained each passing year. A lawsuit is currently been filed against the NCAA by former athletes who are suing the organization for unwillingly selling their names to video game developers  and for using their image to generate money off DVD sales.

Here is the embedded video of the documentary in its entirety.
