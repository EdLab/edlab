<p>We just don’t seem to be able to talk anymore. Concern about the negative impact of cross-partisan hatred in college and university settings has led more than 1,800 professors and graduate students to become members of Heterodox Academy, an organization that supports viewpoint diversity as a core element of productive academic life. One initiative that was born within Heterodox Academy is OpenMind, a free, psychology-based online platform that aims to promote intellectual humility, empathy, and mutual understanding on campuses and within corporations.</p>

<p>Anyone can take OpenMind’s online course, but a main target audience is professors who administer the course as a way to promote productive classroom dialogue. For this review, I created a free account and took the course as if I were a first-year university student. The course consists of five steps that explore viewpoint diversity, intellectual humility, the irrational mind, moral matrices, and constructive disagreement. Each lesson contains activities and quiz questions, and the instructor can follow students’ progress on the administrator dashboard. There are also surveys at the beginning and end of the course that ask questions about users’ political leanings and their perceptions of people who hold contrary opinions. The creators of OpenMind, which is now housed within NYU’s Stern School of Business, are collecting results and soliciting feedback in order to improve the course and better understand the present state of viewpoint diversity.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>OpenMind presents its content in an accessible format and shows special care in areas of transparency and privacy. Before beginning the course, users are required to read the privacy and disclosure statement, which specifies how OpenMind will use anonymized data and gives users the option to have their data deleted. I initially signed up for the course as a 17-year-old student entering college, and when I entered my age, I was informed that my experience would not include the surveys in the interest of protecting the data privacy of minors.</p>

<p>The course content and format are thought-provoking and nuanced. The modules move in a conversational format, weaving insights from psychology, philosophy, and history with interactive case studies. In almost every step, users are asked their opinion about a controversial issue, and are then presented with a case study featuring the opposite point of view. These interactive examples helped me realize my implicit biases in a constructive way. The different steps also interconnected in helpful ways, drawing on concepts previously taught and opinions I expressed earlier.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>While the content and format are nuanced, the design and graphics of OpenMind’s platform are pretty basic, consisting of text blocks interspersed with static images. While I value content over presentation, I can imagine some users losing respect for a platform with this somewhat antiquated design. Additionally, when creating my trial course, I followed OpenMind’s recommendation to lock users out of the platform for 12 hours after completing each step. OpenMind stressed instructor freedom in deciding how to administer the course, but stated that they found that the forced reflection time gained by temporarily blocking access leads to greater learning gains. While I value reflection time, I found it cumbersome and difficult to remember to take the course over five days. I can imagine students might similarly struggle with forgetfulness if asked to complete an assignment in this way. As an instructor, I would fear that some students would fail to complete the whole course.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>OpenMind expanded my theoretical understanding of viewpoint diversity and gave me tangible insight into how I can overcome my implicit biases without making me feel like a jerk.</p>
