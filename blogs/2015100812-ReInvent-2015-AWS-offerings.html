          <p>
            This year the AWS conference had 19k attendees and over 38k people seeing its keynote session  through livestream.

Zeph has been really excited by QuickSight which is a quick way to see analytics almost like what we have in Data dashboard with jupyter hub.

I am more excited to see the elastic search and feel that it could help us use it in vialogues, nlt, mschool. Also machine learning and lambda is very good

<ul>

<li>Amazon QuickSight</li>

Fast, easy-to-use, cloud-powered business intelligence
Amazon QuickSight is a fast, cloud-powered business intelligence (BI) service that makes it easy to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from data. Amazon QuickSight integrates with AWS data stores, flat files, and third-party sources, and it remains super-fast and responsive while seamlessly scaling to hundreds of thousands of users and petabytes of data.

<li>Amazon Kinesis Firehose</li>

Easily load streaming data into S3 & Redshift
Amazon Kinesis Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into AWS. It can capture and automatically load streaming data into Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools youâ€™re already using today. It is a fully managed service that requires no ongoing administration.


<li>AWS Import/Export Snowball</li>

Petabyte-scale data transport solution
AWS Import/Export Snowball uses secure appliances to help accelerate petabyte-scale data transfers into and out of AWS. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Internet.


<li>AWS Inspector</li>

Analyze application security
Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps minimize the likelihood of introducing security or compliance issues when deploying applications on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed report with prioritized steps for remediation.
 	

<li>Amazon RDS for MariaDB</li>

Fully-managed MariaDB deployment on AWS
MariaDB is now available as a fully-managed service on AWS with up to 6TB of storage, 30,000 IOPS, and support for high-availability deployments through the Amazon Relational Database Service. Amazon RDS for MariaDB is available in all commercial regions. You can start running production workloads from day one with high availability using multiple availability zones.


<li>AWS Database Migration Service</li>

Migrate databases to AWS with minimal downtime
AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS easily and securely with minimal downtime. It supports all widely used database platforms, and performs schema and code conversion for migrations between database engines. AWS Database Migration Service is low cost and simple to use. You only pay for the compute resources used during the migration process and can typically migrate a terabyte-size database for as little as three dollars.


<li>AWS Config Rules</li>

Cloud governance & compliance
AWS Config Rules is a new set of cloud governance capabilities that allow IT administrators to define guidelines for provisioning and configuring AWS resources and then continuously monitor compliance with those guidelines. AWS Config Rules ensures EBS volumes are encrypted, EC2 instances are properly tagged, and Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) are attached to instances.


<li>Amazon Elasticsearch Service</li>

Easily run Elasticsearch in AWS
Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch in the AWS Cloud. Elasticsearch is a popular open-source search and analytics engine for use cases such as log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analytics. You can get started with Amazon Elasticsearch Service as part of the AWS Free Tier.
 

<li>AWS WAF</li>

Filter malicious web traffic
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps to protect web applications from attack by blocking common web exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. AWS WAF integrates seamlessly with Amazon CloudFront, our global content delivery network, and includes an API that you can use to automate the creation, deployment, and maintenance of web security rules.


<li>Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts</li>

A physical server dedicated to your use
An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you address compliance requirements and reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
