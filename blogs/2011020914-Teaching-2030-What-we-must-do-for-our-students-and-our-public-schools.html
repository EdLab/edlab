<strong>Author:</strong> Barnett Berry
<strong>Publisher: </strong>New   York : <a href="http://store.tcpress.com/0807751545.shtml">Teachers College Press</a>

</a><strong>From the publisher:</strong> In the raging controversy over the purpose of public education and how to fix the nation’s underperforming schools, the voices of America’s best teachers are seldom heard. Now for the first time, in a provocative book about the future of teaching and learning, 12 of America’s most accomplished classroom educators join a leading advocate for a 21st-century teaching profession to bring expert pedagogical know-how and fresh and provocative policy ideas to the national school reform debate. Together they identify four emergent realities that will shape the learning experience of children born in the New Millennium—and propose six levers of change that can ignite a bright future for our nation’s students by ensuring they all have access to excellent teaching. To create the public schools all students deserve, today and tomorrow, the authors call on policymakers and the public to work with teachers in:
<ul>
	<li>Creating a dynamic and flexible learning environment      for students and teachers, and powerful new ways to define and measure      school success;</li>
	<li>Transforming public education through digital      technologies while reinventing brick and mortar school buildings into 24/7      hubs of community support for students and families;</li>
	<li>Re-imagining teaching as a well-compensated career with      many pathways, assuring that every child has qualified and effective      teachers and that teaching expertise is constantly spread, in and out      cyberspace;</li>
	<li>Establishing a new leadership force of 600,000      “teacherpreneurs”—classroom experts who continue to teach students      regularly while also serving as teacher educators, policy researchers,      community organizers, and trustees of their profession.</li>
</ul>
<em>Teaching</em> <em>2030</em> provides a refreshing, grounded, and lively examination of what we need to know and do in order to ensure that every public school student in America has access to qualified, caring, and effective teachers.

<strong>About the author:</strong> Barnett Berry is founder and president of the <a href="http://www.teachingquality.org/about-barnett-berry">Center for Teaching Quality</a>, based in North Carolina—a nonprofit that seeks to dramatically improve student achievement nationwide by conducting timely research, crafting smart policy, and cultivating teacher leadership.

<strong>On the web:</strong> “This is an exciting and provocative portrait of how teaching could look in 20 years, painting a picture of a profession centered on student learning. Barnett Berry and his colleagues make it clear that making this vision a reality is up to all of us.”
—Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers

<em>“Teaching 2030 </em>is a remarkable, revolutionary picture of the future of our schools. Blasting the intellectual meltdown shaping too much of today's education policy, Berry and his colleagues reveal extraordinary opportunities to improve our schools and serve every student. Deeply respectful of teachers, <em>Teaching 2030</em> proposes how teachers and support professionals can help craft and take more ownership of their professions. This is an exciting and hopeful vision of possibility.”
—Dennis Van Roekel, president, National Education Association
