          <p>
            As part of building the Collaborative Solutions Group and making EdLab's presence more widely known among businesses and educational institutions, I've been working on a website to showcase CSG. This website would be part of the Educational Network initiative - creating independent sites for CSG, the EdLab Review, Research Digest and Trends in Ed, but linking all the sites together in an online network.

Similar to the EdLab Review site prototype <a href="http://www.jasonmariasis.com/edlabreview">here</a>, I've created a CSG prototype <a href="http://www.jasonmariasis.com/drupal">here</a>.  The CSG site has a Drupal foundation, making it easy to integrate with EdLab's current drupal-based site if needed.

Once the educational network is created (a site for each publication plus the CSG site), businesses and universities will eventually want to consult with CSG.  With EdLab providing top-notch, free information organized in an easily-accessible, interactive way, more people will begin following and contributing to EdLab's publications.  Soon, EdLab will be recognized as an industry leader, and when businesses or universities need educational consultants, EdLab will immediately come to mind.

Before EdLab can begin significantly building its reputation, however, these sites need to be designed, built, networked and marketed.  This is a large initiative for just one person, but it's a necessary one since CSG is one of the only ways EdLab makes money.  Also, EdLab members will meet others through consulting, which can open many doors in the future.  

If any designers, developers, or researchers are interested in helping create this Educational Network, please let me know.  This is an EdLab-wide project that must include everyone to be successful.
