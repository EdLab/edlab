            Scientist have known that the human brain can stay calm and focus for only a limited amount of time. You can lose focus with noise, especially living in a city, and it can lead to what is called brain fatigue - when you become easily distracted and forgetful. A new study in Scotland suggests that you can ease brain fatigue by walking through a park. The idea of visting a park or a place full of trees is not new but researchers think green spaces are calming and they require less mental attention than being in a busy, urban street. Their theory, while agreeable, has been difficult to get results. 
<blockquote>Previous studies have found that people who live near trees and parks have lower levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in their saliva than those who live primarily amid concrete, and that children with attention deficits tend to concentrate and perform better on cognitive tests after walking through parks or arboretums. More directly, scientists have brought volunteers into a lab, attached electrodes to their heads and shown them photographs of natural or urban scenes, and found that the brain wave readouts show that the volunteers are more calm and meditative when they view the natural scenes.</blockquote>
 
In an another study, which was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh attached new portable EEGs to the scalp of 12 young adults. This helped the brain set wave readings wirelessly to a laptop in the backpack of each volunteer. The volunteer would go for a short walk about a mile in three different sections of Edinburgh. The first half mile was a shopping area with a lot of people in the sidewalk and light traffic. Then the volunteers walked through a park setting place of another half mile. They finally ended by walking through a busy area with heavy traffic and many buildings. The walkers were told to move at their own speed and not to rush, most of them finished their walk in about 25 minutes. The EEGs on their heads gave information about the wave patterns to the laptops they had in their bags. Right after, researchers compared the read-outs and looked for wave patterns related to frustrations, directed attention, mental arousal and calm. What they found was that green spaces lessen brain fatigue. 

<blockquote>When the volunteers made their way through the urbanized, busy areas, particularly the heavily trafficked commercial district at the end of their walk, their brain wave patterns consistently showed that they were more aroused, attentive and frustrated than when they walked through the parkland, where brain-wave readings became more meditative.</blockquote>

I found this very interesting and I agree that sometimes living in a big city, you can become very distracted. That's why I enjoy going to play soccer in the park every time I feel stressed out or to feel better. What are your thoughts of this <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/easing-brain-fatigue-with-a-walk-in-the-park/?ref=health ">article</a>? Will you be going for a walk in the park more often when you feeling stressed?
