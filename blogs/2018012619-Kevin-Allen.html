<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KevinAllenEI">Kevin Allen</a> is Founder and CEO of <a href="https://eigames.com/index.html">EI Games LLC</a>, creator of award-winning online Emotional Intelligence learning games for companies and higher education, and re:kap Inc., a business development company, counting Google, Cisco, Burberry, Expedia and Rovio’s Angry Birds among its global clients. He is recognized as one of the world’s most accomplished business growth professionals and as an expert on emotional intelligence and its practical application in the workplace.</p>

<p>After a highly successful 30-year advertising career atop global industry giants The Interpublic Group and McCann Ericson, with highlights like the "Priceless" campaign for MasterCard, Kevin now consults and develops learning programs for global companies and lectures at Columbia University, Harvard, Miami Ad School, Queen Mary University and Regents University London.</p>

<p>He is author of Wall Street Journal bestseller <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Agenda-Proven-Business-Following/dp/1937134040">The Hidden Agenda: A Proven Way to Win Business and Create a Following</a></i>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Missing-Cutlery-Leadership-Course/dp/1629560243/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487178707&sr=1-1&keywords=the+case+of+the+missing+cutlery">The Case of the Missing Cutlery: A Leadership Course for the Rising Star</a></i>, which has been featured on BBC Radio.</p>

<p><b>How has your education and previous professional experience shaped your current work as CEO and creator of EI Games?</b><br>
One of the biggest things I learned during my 30+ years in advertising is that business isn't about numbers and market share, it's about people, their hopes and desires, and if I was in any business at all it was the hope business. As a business leader, my job was hard but simple: it wasn't telling people what to do, it was creating a following and igniting people towards some amazing creation. The possibility of creating something amazing that didn't exist before is what makes people jump out of bed in the morning, whether it's the most senior people in the organization or the person who mops the floor. They all want to tell people they're part of something special.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you believe that games can impact positive social or educational change?</b><br>
The power of a game is the ability to immerse someone in a seemingly real-life scenario and allow them to live out consequences and opportunities and risks that are only theories in a classroom. A game lets them live it.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work with EI Games will change business education and the field of business at large? </b><br>
I'll answer that in two ways. The first is that all our games are underpinned by the power of emotional intelligence, which by definition helps companies become more human-centric, employee engaged, and customer-oriented. Secondly, the learning experience is transformed from "chalk-and-talk" to energetic engagement.</p>
 
<p><b>What other projects are you currently working on or have planned for the future?</b><br>
<p>A topic which has meant a great deal to me has surfaced recently in the creation of a business ethics game in conjunction with Arizona State University. The time is certainly right for a game that helps people to see that sound business practice and ethical considerations are synonymous and just plain good business.</p>
 
</p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/dorieclark">Dorie Clark</a>, not only because she's a fabulous person, brilliant business mind and author, but also because she really knows how to use Twitter!</p>
