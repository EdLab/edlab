            Hey Guys, 

Hope you guys are having a good wednesday. Just wanted to remind you that its the same day which we all look forward for every week where we can go out and show our mettle.

<b>Special:</b>
<ul>
<li>EdLab Running is going into it's 4th week which is a great achievement, congratulations to all of you who made this possible. </li>
<li>Todays run would be special in a way as <img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/pictures/picture-2719.png" height=50 width=50>Sharon</img> who is an avid runner would be leaving for Pittsburgh, nonetheless we would be expecting to see her soon. 
</li>
</ul>

<b>Updates:</b>
Please share your opinions:
<ol>
<li> We want to make it more regular and have an additional day for running probably on Monday too. We are planning to do it after labor day before winter starts in full swing. This run would be probably around ~5miles so that you can run practice more. Eventually the aim is to run from 125th St to TimesSquare and the higher goal will be to run from 125th to South Ferry (Zhou aspiration) 
</li>
<li>Also shifting the Wednesday run to Thursday as that would give sometime for us to relax our muscles from Mondays long run, this would be a 5k run. 
</li>
</ol>

As usual please do an RSVP so that we know that you are coming. Also share your ideas on improving it further. I have heard many people who are interested in biking too, I would suggest you to start with us one of these days and then carry on your pace. 
          </p>
