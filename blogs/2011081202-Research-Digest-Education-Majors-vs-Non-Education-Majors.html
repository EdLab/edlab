            <a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/millimet/classes/eco7321/papers/aaronson%20et%20al.pdf">Aaronson, Daniel. Barrow, Lisa. Sander, William. (2007). Teachers and Student Achievement in the Chicago Public High Schools. <i>Journal of Labor Economics</i> 25(1).</a>

Aaronson and Barrow, researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and William Sander, Professor of Economics at Depaul University, studied the performance of teachers in Chicago Public High Schools 

<b>Description:</b>
While there are plenty of studies out there to substantiate the importance of teachers to student achievement, few use data as detailed as what Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander present. Aaronson et al use matched student-teacher administrative data. As a result, they are able to track the performance of individual students and teachers, rather than simply making approximations of value-added based on the performance of the average teacher. Their findings seem to imply that there is significant teacher variation and value-added analysis has the potential for creating robust statistics that indicate a teacher's productivity so much so that past performance can serve as a reliable indicator of future performance. Of course, the measures of teacher productivity relied on standardized tests, a major point of contention for many. 

Yet the real point of interest that drew me to this study was its ability to distinguish between teachers of different educational backgrounds, specifically those that majored in an education-related discipline and those that majored in a specific subject. In this case, the paper was able to establish the role one's undergraduate major played in teacher effects. I was already aware that a teacher's highest level of educational background has not been found to be statistically significant. Yet I wanted to know whether the subject a teacher majored in during his or her undergraduate years made a difference. For those who follow economic studies of education, it comes as no surprise that no observable inputs were found to be significant in their ability to predict teacher productivity. Nevertheless, it was interesting to see that when teacher fixed effects were regressed against teacher demographics, certification level, undergraduate major, and selectivity of undergraduate college, those with BAs in science and math were positively correlated with teacher effects while BAs in education were negatively correlated. Of course, none of this was statistically significant, and I do not make any speculations.

EdLab Relevance: Given the lack of evidence for most observable inputs being significantly correlated with teacher effects, it seems like there is still a lack of concrete empirical evidence that points us to effective teacher education and training
