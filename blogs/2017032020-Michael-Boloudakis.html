<p>Michael Boloudakis is the founder and CEO of Kinems, a company that offers personalized learning experiences for children with learning disabilities such as autism, dyspraxia, and ADHD via Kinect-based learning games. Boloudakis won the MassChallenge Civic Tech Sidecar prize sponsored by Microsoft in 2014. With Kinems, he was one of the finalists of INTEL Business Challenge CEE competition 2011. Boloudakis earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and a master's in e-Learning technologies. He also has nine years of experience running projects with big industrial vendors such as Microsoft, Intel, Google, and Smart Technologies.</p>
<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Kinems?</b><br>
<p>Certainly yes. My bachelor degree is in computer science and my master's and PHD focused on digital learning technologies. Thus, I have been seeking viable ways to improve learning and teaching processes by making use of technology that adds value. At my first startup company, we developed interactive learning content and tailor-made solutions for mainstream schools. After several success stories with teachers and students, I decided to build Kinems, a company that focuses on kids with learning disorders since I truly believe that technology-enhanced learning tools can help them improve their skills and quality of life. The domain of technology-enhanced special education is still open for innovative effective solutions.</p>
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Kinems will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Kinems is a movement based educational gaming platform for children with learning disabilities such as autism, dyspraxia, developmental disorders, and ADHD. Children play with hand and body gestures, accelerate their academic performance in math and language, improve their attention and concentration, and enhance their eye-hand coordination and motor planning skills. Kinems games have been designed by specialists on learning difficulties and occupational protocols based on best learning methods and intervention protocols for offering engaging and effective learning experiences to children.</p>
 
<p>Kinems’ platform tracks all body interaction and produces kinesthetic and learning analytics, thus visualizing the improvement of children’s motor and cognitive skills. Until today, occupation therapists had to write notes and their reports were based on observations. Kinems now provides automated data driven reports that enrich their documentation and improve accountability. Parents are now informed on their children’s progress with their skills during the year without having to wait until an assessment.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Active movement-based learning is one of the modern learning trends and it’s going to become bigger in the years ahead. This is true especially in primary schools, where children need to get engaged in meaningful and stimulating tasks as well as to reduce screening time. Also, more sophisticated evidence based data-driven decision making approaches and tools are needed for educational leaders who constantly look for ways to improve student motivation and learning.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Kinems, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Kinems is my only work and I wish the day had more than 24 hours since there are so many amazing things that are coming up.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LarryAmplify">Larry Berger,</a> Amplify CEO, is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the EdTech industry.</p>
