            I saw Fred's post on Brainscape and its assumptions on how students retain flashcard knowledge. Thus, I figured it was appropriate to post my mathematics/behavioral economics addendum to Steve's proposal

Perhaps the most powerful aspect to Steve's idea, in my opinion at least, is its ability to serve as an anti-cramming tool. The ability to reinforce small bits of information undoubtedly reduces the need to cram in the days/hours leading up to the exam. Some of the ideas of behavioral economics are easily translatable to the problem of cramming. For starters, we have a tendency to overestimate our maximal productivity. In a more typical economic context, this often leads to under-saving during one's younger years, since the individual often assumes he or she will be earning more in his or her later years than he or she actually ended up earning. Thus, to compensate for this effect, in one's later years, he or she must work more hours and take additional jobs to pay off debts, or reduce his or her consumption in order to live within his or her means; neither are ideal circumstances. Roughly the same problem occurs with cramming. We often operate under the assumption that we can put off work in the present because we can increase productivity later to achieve our desired level of studying without additional stress. Rarely does this work however, as most find themselves stressfully cramming and either sacrificing sleep or knowledge because they overestimated the amount of studying they achieved and their maximal productivity. While there are some studies that promote cramming as an effective study strategy, few would consider it healthy or the optimal method for achieving academic excellence. The point in all of this is that certain aspects of human nature naturally yield to cramming as a result of pure inertia. By taking easy steps  ahead of time to add structure to one's studying habits (i.e. Steve's flashcard idea), he or she can conquer this inertia and be well-prepared and well-rested for his or her exam. 

Here is a model of how people might plan to study:
Let t be an element of T, the set of intervals during which the given student is studying his/her flashcards. Therefore, t represents an instantaneous moment in the sequence of intervals T.

Let f:T->|R (set of real numbers) be a function that maps a given instantaneous time element to an instantaneous rate of flashcard retention.
Let the integral of f(s) from t0 (initial time) to time t represent the total amount of flashcard retention achieved from t0 to t. At tf (final time), this integral should be a fixed constant for any measure (length) of T.

Behavioral economics tells us that on average we overestimate max[f(t)]. Let us denote the student's overestimate as M'. Then denote the student's true maximum instantaneous flashcard retention rate max[f(t)]=M, where M < M'
As a result of this overestimation, depending on what f(t) looks like across T, the student will likely underestimate the actual measure of T (at least that's my hunch, although it is possible that my hunch is wrong). 
An underlying assumption in all of this is that if a given task requires less time, it is more likely to be started closer to its deadline. (There is evidence to back up this assumption/preference axiom).
[I wish I could make the math would look a lot neater]

Rationale for making the math sorta complicated:
If we run experiments on students trying to learn flashcards in a finite period of time, we should be able to model f(t) and integral of f(s) from t0 to t. In doing so, we can also measure T. Because we do not know what f(t) looks like, we cannot assume that it is constant, linear, concave, convex, random, or anything at this point. If we know what f(t) looks like, then we are on our way to determining whether students actually underestimate the amount of time necessary for retaining the given flashcard knowledge. Then we can legitimately see whether an SMS flashcard app can solve the cramming problem.
