          <p>
            In response to a <a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/elsevier-my-part-in-its-downfall/ 
http://thecostofknowledge.com/ 
">post</a> written by noted British mathematician Tim Gowers, nearly twenty members of MIT's faculty have signed a <a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/news/faculty-boycott-elsevier/7564/#.Tyn1HkoGalV.facebook">pledge</a> to boycott Reed Elsevier (the world's largest scientific journal publisher) and are “refusing to publish, referee, or do editorial work unless they [Elsevier] radically change how they operate.” In addition, an online pledge against Elsevier currently has 2,892 signees from universities around the world, from both junior and senior scholars across a wide array of disciplines.

The frustrations from these scientists and academics boil down to three key points: 1) exorbitantly high pricing practices (running in the tens of thousands), 2) the practice of bundling subscriptions of less desirable journals to more valuable ones, forcing libraries to purchase journals that they don't want and won't use, and 3) Elsevier's support of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.03699:">Research Works Act</a> which would prevent the free flow of information.      

What makes this battle particularly fascinating to watch unfold is that it is the scientists themselves — the very people who provide these journals with content to publish — are now upset enough to withhold their work. In the past, dissent primarily came from the librarians and administrators responsible for negotiating ever-increasing contracts with publishers. Every so often there's been a rumble about boycotting (like in 2010, when the University of California system contemplated protesting Nature Publishing Group's 400% increase for journal licenses) — and there are already high quality open access scientific journals (such as the <a href="http://www.plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a>) available — but perhaps this time the reaction may finally lead to significant changes in the business models for Elsevier and other journal publishers.
