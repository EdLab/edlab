The next installment of music-based console games has arrived. At first glance, you might categorize <a href="http://rocksmith.ubi.com/rocksmith/en-US/home/index.aspx">Rocksmith</a> with its musical predecessors, but look deeper and you’ll see how different it really is. You won’t find some plastic toy resembling a guitar in this game’s box. Instead, you are expected to plug in your real-life electric guitar (or hookup to a pickup if you have an acoustic) to start rocking out. In fact, you can learn your instrument’s fundamentals in the time it would take you to bake a frozen pizza. <p>

Prior to beginning a session, players tune their guitars with the help of onscreen feedback. Game play may seem familiar to those who have played Guitar Hero or Rock Band; once the music starts, notes begin to fall towards you, indicating which ones you should strum or pick. As you do better, the note and chord progressions become more challenging; if the computer senses that you are struggling, it’ll ease up.  <p>

When it comes to learning the basics, would you go with the video game or the tried-and-true guitar teacher method? Does the element of "fun" weigh on that decision at all? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11752">Head over to Vialogues</a> to add your thoughts to the ongoing conversation. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i> <p>

<b>@00:10 Carla:</b> Does this have any relation to Songsmith? <p>

<b>@01:24 Clark:</b> Pairing the pedal choice with what the it actually looks like in this selection process is a great way to help learners to later identify these pedals in real life. I really like that they help contextualize it. <p>

<b>@03:06 YogiP:</b> "The game is a guitar-learning tool first and a game second." It sounds like if you want to add a little music playing fun into your next game night, you might be better served with the classic standbys over Rocksmith.
