If Dumbledore had Google Glass, could Harry Potter have Wingardium Leviosaâ€™d from the comforts of home? What would it mean for the young wizard to have such a master at his disposal? <p>

So goes the theory behind a most magical academy: <a href="http://thearcanum.com/">the Arcanum</a>. The Arcanum is based on the ancient master-apprentice relationship that nurtured many a novice artist. It takes advantage of the growing trend of augmented reality to transport learners and teachers from different locations to an alternate world where they are in the same place. While owning a pair of Google Glass is not required, many masters tend to use them as they offer unique vantage points for their apprentices (being able to take hands-free video is also a huge plus for art lessons). <p>


However, technology is only the medium, not the true draw of the Arcanum. What raises its educational profile is its adherence to personalized, one-on-one learning. There are even opportunities to learn from fellow apprentices. As learners progress, they advance to higher levels, eventually finding themselves on the path to becoming masters in their own right.  <p>

Is the Arcanum bringing education back to its roots or is it reintroducing the issue of access? Discuss that and more in the ongoing conversation <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12760">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i><p>

<b>@02:03 Carla:</b> There's a lot of emphasis on geographical location. Do you need to travel in order to level up? Between that and the AR glasses, this could be an incredibly expensive journey!<p>

<b>@02:18 MartinPaper:</b> I think this is a really innovative idea. I like that it is housed underneath the umbrella of an academy as opposed to one-off lessons. This gives the impression of being one of many students; a network of learners. It also implies that by the end of your learning journey, you'll have achieved a level of mastery. Or maybe that's just my bias towards academies.
