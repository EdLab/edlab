            Hi Everyone,

I had a chance to attend the <a href="http://mediaconvergence.economist.com/">Economist magazine's Media Convergence Forum.</a> It was primarily geared towards a marketing audience, but contained a lot of useful information relevant to education technologies (especially personalizing content for the learner). 

I'll post several entries from different sessions that I thought were useful for the lab's work.  


Part1: Understanding Consumer Behavior: The Moment of Truth

This session focuses on strategies that different firms are using to understand consumer behavior and customize sales strategies accordingly. There seem to be three schools of thought:

-	Minimial “high tech” approach that emphasizes using people's feedback or observations to drive the process of understanding the consumer. 
-	A “high tech” approach that uses statistics and artificial intelligence to mine consumer data
-	An approach that is hybrid. 

Where has this worked and what have been the results?
-	Sometimes it doesn't work — location and product is more important. Example of sales survey conducted with people who stopped at a Kiosk and found that the digital content wasn't as powerful as location, traffic management and the product. 
-	SmartNetworks: digital messaging usually works better for products that require people to stop and learn more about it (not for familiar products). 
-	Walmart / SmartNetworks: gaze tracking, simulating the shopping experience for individuals. 
-	Strategy & logic behind digital content helps to engage customers better — more than 60% increase in sales by tailoring digital content presented to a consumer when he enters the store (by recognizing their face and linking them to previous behaviors). 

Do consumers like this increased advertising? 
-	Presenting information to help make decisions vs. pushing information on to people when they don't want it. 
-	Consumers want to be in control, but it is also known that suggestive selling can be extremely effective — even more effective if sales associates offer to upgrade their purchase. 

How are consumers behaving??
-	Brand loyalty is declining. 

Neural marketing — first phase is to understand how consumers are responding to stimuli during the shopping experience. However, next phase marketers want to actually generate external stimuli that would prompt a particular neural response.
