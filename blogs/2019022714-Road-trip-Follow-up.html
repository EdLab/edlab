          <p>
            <p>Thank you all for joining us on our D&amp;R road trip!</p><p><br /></p><p>Through our conversation, we discovered that the primary purpose of D&amp;Rs is creative collaboration and giving team members the opportunity to share and present their work. However, it came out of our discussion that some D&amp;Rs have an additional purpose beyond team building. In past D&amp;Rs, we found that if the person presenting owned the project, for example in the 5G Verizon grant project or in the creation of Vialogues, that person could carry out the ideas proposed in the D&amp;R. However, if the person presenting did not have full ownership of the project, implementation of ideas was less straightforward. The suggestions raised in the share-out offered possible pathways for moving forward in those cases.</p><p><br /></p><p>The share-out discussion pointed to the importance of keeping purpose in mind during D&amp;R preparation. What are you hoping to get our of this D&amp;R, and why is D&amp;R an appropriate venue for advancing your theme? D&amp;R is supposed to be low stakes, but it's still good to have a clear purpose in mind.</p><p><br /></p><p>Another theme that emerged during the share-out and final green dot voting activity was the desire for follow-ups after a D&amp;R. Some of the formats this follow-up can take are:</p><p>-documentation in the form of a blog post</p><p>-creating a directory of ideas in action</p><p>-creating a prototype</p><p>-writing a proposal</p><p>-hosting another D&amp;R further exploring research and results</p><p>-sharing updates on how ideas that came out of the D&amp;R were enacted</p><p><br /></p><p>Our takeaway from this discussion was that the presenter bears the responsibility to decide and share next steps. We opted to do a follow-up to our D&amp;R in the form of a blog post. Do you think this is an effective form of follow-up for our presentation or do you want more?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Melanie and Rebecca</p>
