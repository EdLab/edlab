            If anybody ever wanted to be an entrepreneur, now is the time to become one because apparently everybody is now throwing money into ed tech startups.  The sum of equity invested into education technology companies in 2011 is six times (over $340 million) more than it was just four years ago. 

<img src="http://chronicle.com/img/photos/biz/29edtech-startups-fever-web.jpg">

Many are wondering whether this will be a repeat of the ed tech boom in the late 90's that grew as well as burst with the dot com bubble.

<b>"It's Different!"</b>
Since then, there have been big advances in computing such as near-universal wireless Internet access, high-speed connections, and growing comfort with cloud-based software that make it easier for today's ed tech startups to have a standing chance on today's campuses.

<b>"It's the Same!"</b>
The initial hype is still the same as the last time. The whole idea is riding on the wave that anything digital is going to work or make a difference. If ed tech really wants to make a difference, it has to think of something big instead of adding more bells and whistles.

As for traditional colleges and universities, they don't need to fear losing their footing in public education. Michael Staton, the founder of one of the earliest ed tech start-ups, thinks that students will still be attending traditional colleges 20-30 years in the future. However, he also thinks that if administrators don't start making changes soon, they most certainly will be left behind.

<i>"Universities are actually shooting themselves in the foot within this market transformation by being slow in their procurement decisions," he said. "There would be a lot more investment in companies that are figuring out how to serve schools if schools simply streamlined the process of making decisions about whether or not to adopt technology." Colleges have students' best interests in mind, but "in a world full of good intentions, our biggest competition is indecision."
