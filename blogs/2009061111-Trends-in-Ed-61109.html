            <b>The Obvious? Relationship Between Anxiety and Test Performance</b>

A recent <a href="http://http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1903476,00.html/">article</a> in Time Magazine details a study that found SAT scores actually improve with level of fatigue.  Participants were college freshmen who randomly took three versions of the SAT, each of which varied in length.  They also completed questionnaires before, during, and after the tests that measured their fatigue, mood, and confidence.  It was found that particularly for high-performing test-takers, <i>achievement motivation</i> took place, meaning feeling tired seemed to motivate concentration.  This need to compensate, if you will, for your own exhaustion by being especially diligent and focused is something that perhaps we all can relate to when in work-mode.

<b>Applications to Computer Adaptive Tests?</b> 

While the study in <i>Time</i> has its limitations, I would still be interested in its relevance to <a href="http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.1488512ecfd5b8849a77b13bc3921509/?vgnextoid=ebd42d3631df4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&vgnextchannel=54c846f1674f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD/">Computer Adaptive Tests (CAT), such as the GRE</a>.  In a CAT, the questions are tailored in difficulty to the test-takers' ability in answering previous questions.  For example, if a question is answered correctly, then the following question is intended to be more difficult and vice versa.  Essentially, one's final score aligns with the difficulty of question reached at the end of the test.  

However, as someone who has taken the GRE, the <i>Time<i> article only makes me question how test anxiety is managed with the new era of standardized tests being computer adaptive.  Fighting the urge to measuring or assume your own progress (and thus level of difficulty) with each successive question?  That's test anxiety if I've ever heard of it.  Maybe if we're tired we won't think about it and just concentrate on figuring out the answers...
