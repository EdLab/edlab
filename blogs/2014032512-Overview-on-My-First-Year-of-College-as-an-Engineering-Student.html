          <p>
            It is really astonishing how fast my freshman year in college is flying by. After I spent my first semester at the University of Maine-Farmington, I decided to transfer to SUNYIT since their curriculum was more rigorous in my field of study: computer and electrical engineering. The transfer has gone smoothly due in large part to the fact that some of my high school friends and former soccer teammates are already students at SUNYIT.  As expected, having fun is very limited because all my free time is spent doing homework, projects and test prep plus spring soccer practice.
 
Though my classes are very challenging, I am learning a lot about data structure and other aspects of computer and electrical engineering. My experiences in these classes has reinforced my belief that it is important for students interested in computers to take as many STEM classes as possible in high school. It will prepare them well for the rigors of college life. In my calculus class, I am working on a project to create a color-tracking robot. The knowledge I've gained from C++ programming, physics and calculus will be used to build the robot. I hope to have the robot done soon so I can share it with you.
