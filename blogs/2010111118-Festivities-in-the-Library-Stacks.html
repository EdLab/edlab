            It recently dawned on me that I have worked at the library through St. Patrick's day, Halloween and Diwali. It struck me that working for an information store house had done little for my own awareness about these major days of celebration. I did some research and talked to a few people and found out the following books that we have in the library stacks to help me cope with this:

<strong>Celebrate <span style="color: red"><strong>Diwali</strong></span> / Deborah Heiligman; <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/cBL1239.82.D58+H45+2006/cbl+1239.82+d58+h45+2006/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=cbl+1239.82+d58+h45+2006&amp;1%2C1%2C">BL1239.82.D58 H45 2006</a>: </strong>This is a neat picture book that talks about Diwali, a holiday that comes from India. It is celebrated by Hindus around the world. Sikhs and Jains celebrate it, too. The book primarily discusses how different people celebrate it in different ways and for different reasons. But there are common themes for everyone: the triumph of good over evil, of light over darkness. The author of the book is interestingly someone who was  born in Allentown, PA. and lived in the same house her whole childhood, she worked on building her curiosity and it resulted in this book . If you continue to stay curious about  Diwali and other festivities in the Indian culture check out the <a href="http://isa-columbia.org/index.php">Indian Student Association at Columbia</a> .

<strong><span style="color: red"><strong>Halloween</strong></span>: from pagan ritual to party night / Nicholas Rogers; <a href="http://eduproxy.tc-library.org/?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/teacherscollege/Doc?id=10103594">ebook</a>: </strong>In this heavily -illustrated book, York University professor of history Nicholas Rogers traces the history of this unofficial holiday from its alleged beginnings as a Celtic festival, Samhain, marking the end of summer, to its many and various manifestations today. Along the way, he tells how "trick or treat" began and developed, explains the origins of the pranks and even destructiveness associated with Halloween, and looks at the ways Hollywood has presented the holiday as a time of evil unleashed. According to this book, trick or treating, for example, only became popular in the 1920s. Rogers offers a wide and fascinating smorgasbord on all things related to this festival of transgression. He even speculates on a possible convergence in the future between Halloween and the not-so-dissimilar <a href="http://eduproxy.tc-library.org/?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/teacherscollege/Doc?id=10367263">Mexican Day of the Dead</a>.

<strong><span style="color: red"><strong>St.</strong></span> Patrick's <span style="color: red"><strong>Day</strong></span> / by Gail Gibbons; <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/cGT4995.P3+G53+1994/cgt+4995+p3+g53+1994/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=cgt+4995+p3+g53+1994&amp;1%2C1%2C">GT4995.P3 G53 1994</a></strong>: I love this book because it explains with beautiful colorful pictures  the story of Patrick's life, here is information about how St. Patrick's Day is celebrated. There are decorations from shamrocks to shillelaghs. People give cards, share meals, and wear green to honor Ireland, the Emerald Isle--and there are parades! Included are six legends about Patrick.

The library is a great place to meet new people and interact with different cultures and I look forward to learning about new festivities at the library :) <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2010/11/happy-diwali.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4651" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2010/11/happy-diwali-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

Any ideas for future celebrations in the Library?
