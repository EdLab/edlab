<p><i>"Games are no longer an activity for kids in a basement [...] we have a responsibility as a society to help youth switch their mindset, to change behaviors and minds, and to inspire them to be creators of change."</i> (Games for Change President Susanna Pollack)</p>
 
<p><b>Inspiring Youth to Create Games of Consequence</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/">Games for Change</a> is an organization that has caught the eye of social innovators in education, entertainment, and beyond through its <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4563/the-games-for-change-festival">annual festival</a> in NYC that showcases the best and brightest in the game industry. This also marks the third year of their Student Challenge, a digital game design program and competition that aims to inspire middle and high school students to explore civic issues and learn 21st-century skills.</p> 

<p>The Games for Change Student Challenge, which culminated in a New York awards ceremony last weekend, had five participating cities this year: NYC, Atlanta, Detroit, LA, and Pittsburgh. G4C works with schools and educators to offer game-making courses, workshops, game jams, and mentorship programs to teach and inspire students to see how online games can be both meaningful and fun. Designing games based on one of four challenge themes, kindness and empathy, wildlife conservation, connected cities, and news literacy, this year’s students had the opportunity to attend a public exhibition and compete for prizes and internships. </p>

<p><b>Fostering Game Development in the Classroom and Community</b></p>

<p>In a conversation I had with G4C President <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4755/susanna-pollack">Susanna Pollack</a>, she stated that her organization also does outreach with other game design programs, such as <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>, and provides professional development for teachers in addition to their student courses to build up wider participation. Pollack said that G4C does aim to bring game design into the classroom, but doesn’t want it to be limited to computer science classes; all teachers should be able to participate in their interdisciplinary curriculum. "Students learn design thinking as well as coding skills," she explained, "and we teach teachers how to think like designers too." G4C’s professional development gives educators a new skill set to add to their teaching toolbox while helping them think about game design as an activity to connect kids to important concepts.</p>

<p>The best games Pollack has seen from this competition, she explains, are those that "are so honestly personal but trying to tell a story for others to understand" at the same time. This year’s NYC grand prize winner <a href="https://gensuta.itch.io/solar-sprout">Solar Sprout</a>, created by high schooler Geneva H., is one such game, focusing on how energy enhances a city’s connectedness as it is built and repaired. Solar Sprout and all other games recognized on Saturday demonstrate the power of providing kids the tools to make their vision a reality, and set the stage for an exciting Games for Change festival later this week.</p>
