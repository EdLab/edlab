          <p>
            Few months ago, each of us on the Design Team did a quick thought exercise to brainstorm the next step for Mindful Lights. This time it was specifically catered to the Learning Theater, and we came up with ideas based on what we learned from the project: LEDs, sensors, physical objects, interactive installations and human behaviors. These are three of my ideas. 

For those who didn't get to see the Mindful Lights installation, here is a photo for reference. (Thanks Dee for the wonderful documentation!)

Thought 1: Subtle directional signage
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/sk-nextstep1_3699a1feff8c4f3e87cd3b86e5b08dac.jpg">
LEDs discretely embedded along the wall or floor of the LT. The light would mimic the fluidity of smoke/vapor and move in the directions that people need to go to. Would be used when ushering a crowd into a certain space. Ideally, the LEDs would be masked enough so it's subtle and doesn't scream "LED." Very subtle visual cue is the key here. 


Thought 2: LED vest that syncs with the wearer's breathing
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/sk-nextstep2_36fcfd56370f49a1834026e1608ca7ae.jpg">
Inspired by a <a href="http://b-reel.com/projects/prana" target="_blank">video Jackie showed me</a>. Have participants of an event wear some sort of a sensor that tracks their breathing and a vest with LEDs embedded in it. (The sensor could be a bracelet, a headpiece, or attached to the vest, etc.) The LEDs on the vest would sync to the wearer's breathing and pulsate softly. When two or more participants' breathings sync during an interaction, the LED pulsation among the participants would sync as well. Perhaps this could add an interest factor to the interaction between participants?


Thought 3: Wall/backdrop + LED synced with breathing
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/sk-nextstep3_994fe23ead8e4313bb56d6428dff40db.jpg">
This would be used in a more traditional slideshow presentation setting. LEDs hidden along the edges of a wall/divider/backdrop that stands behind the presenter (like the gray and red curvy walls we have right now in the seminar space). The presenter would wear a sensor that tracks his/her breathing, and the LEDs in the backdrop would gently pulsate along with the presenter's breathing. The pulsation would have to be really really subtle so it wouldn't be distracting. I'm thinking maybe this could help the audience engage with the presenter a little bit more, as their breathing syncs with the presenter's breathing rhythm. Not sure if this would work, but could be an interesting experiment.
