            Julia <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6732">broke</a> this story, but it's so relevant you'll have to read it twice. The <a href="http://wp.sparc.arl.org/lps/">SPARC</a> study began in 2010 in three university libraries with a stake in this new library role: Purdue University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of Utah. The survey portion of the study found that 55% of institutions offered or will offer publishing of some kind and three quarters of these programs included components of traditional publishing like journals and monographs. They also found, as Julia mentioned, that many of these programs were scrappy; few had long-term sustainability plans and fewer still the staff and funding required to re-create commercial publishing structures. 

This flexibility could be a strength. The second part of the study explains the focuses and  strategies of the three investigating institutions, which like TC's innovative publishing program, seem primed to expand the range of academic voices. The Purdue Library has created a series of open access e-journals with greater attention towards faculty research and demand, including two student-run journals. The Georgia Tech Library has a greater focus on gray literature including conferences and symposia held in the institution while Utah works in collaboration with their University Press to augment existing monographs with innovative online content. This increased library involvement in publishing may be part of a greater trend towards library output and creation. These nimble, niche publications seem also to align with current publishing trends towards increased e-content and turnaround speed.
