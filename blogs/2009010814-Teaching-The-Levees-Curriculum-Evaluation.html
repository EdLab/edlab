            Over the past few months, the D&R team has been working to evaluate the impact of the <i>Teaching The Levees Curriculum</i>. Received by just under 30,000 educators in every state within the US, the curriculum has been well received by students and educators alike. In an attempt to gain insight into the specific use and impact of the curriculum, the D&R team has been conducting online surveys and follow-up interviews with specific users. Here is a brief summary of the preliminary results:</br></br>

<li>The curriculum was received by 28,092 educators in every US state</li></br>
<li>These individuals were predominantly formal educators (36% classroom teachers, 26% college professors) but also included administrators (24%), Librarians (8%) and community leaders (6%).</li></br>
<li>16,000 copies were requested online, the remainder were distributed by TC Press. </li></br></br>
<!--break-->Survey results suggest that: </br>
<li>Over half of those who received the curriculum actively used it</li></br>
<li>Multiple aspects of the curriculum were used including specific learning modules, the TTL website and the accompanying Spike Lee documentary. </li></br>
<li>The curriculum was used to address a variety of topics ranging from social issues and history, to governments & civics and geography. </li></br>
<li>Over 90% of users indicated that the curriculum was effective in enhancing participants' understanding of Katrina and the complex social issues it raised, effective in facilitating participant's ability to consider and appreciate multiple points of view and effective in enhancing participants' ability to articulate their position using evidence and information. </li></br>
<li>Users have reported the project to be inspirational, eye-opening and a valuable tool to help teach academic topics through current events. </li></br></br>

These preliminary results paint an encouraging picture of the scope and impact of the TTL curriculum project thus far. The curriculum, and this project as a whole, has acted as an inspiration to many, supporting teachings of a diverse nature across the United States. Its unique approach of combining formal educational materials with documentary films through the lens of a current event has been highly praised, highlighting the call for future materials to use similar models and continue to build on these foundations. The full results will soon be made available in various reports being created by the team. Any suggestions and comments are welcome!
