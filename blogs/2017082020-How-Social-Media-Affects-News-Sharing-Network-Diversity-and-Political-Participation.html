<p> Social media and its relationship with news has become a dominant narrative in recent years. Researchers are now seriously considering the effects that this online environment has on the general population. In a recent study, researchers explored how sharing news affects the relationship between the diversity of someone’s network and their level of political participation. The results suggest that there is a relationship between a diverse network and political participation, but this effect is heavily minimized when accounting for news sharing characteristics.</p>

<p>An online survey was conducted by a professional polling organization to gather generalizable data; the sample included over 1000 respondents answering key questions on self identification along a political spectrum, behaviors related to news consumption, political actions, and interactions on social media. The researchers wanted to understand levels of heterogeneity or homogeneity for each individual network. For instance, a very conservative respondent who only read right wing sources was scored as homogenous because the news matched their ideology. This process was continued for gender, race, and religion and then combined to create one network diversity score for each person.</p>
 
<p>The analysis of data shows that a more diverse network is associated with increased political participation, confirming past research. However, this effect was muted when the researchers accounted for news sharing characteristics. In this model, those respondents who were more likely to share or disseminate news saw a positive relationship with political participation, but there was also no statistically significant relationship between those that tended to just read or seek news and political action.</p>
 
<p>Finally, the researchers added interactive effects to their test. They found that news posting did significantly moderate the effects between social network diversity levels and political participation. The previous strong relationship between news sharers and political participation remained. However, the other key variables in the last model showed minimal or no statistically significant relationships. </p>
 
<p>This study has helped confirm the political participation effects brought on through social media. But, the researchers have added an additional nuance in understanding this relationship, namely the critical factor of quality and depth for news engagement. The authors believe that people, as they continue their migration onto online environments, can find meaningful political experiences through social media, but only if they actively engage with the news while using these platforms. In this age of new media, the consumption of news no longer has to be a passive activity.</p>
