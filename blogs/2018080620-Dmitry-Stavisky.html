Dmitry Stavisky is the co-founder and CEO at <a href="http://edwin.ai/">Edwin.ai</a>, an innovative education technology company redefining how people around the world learn English to succeed at work and in life. Its mission is to improve the economic prospects of over 800 million students learning English as a foreign language. Edwin combines the latest AI technologies, effective pedagogical content, and an innovative business model to achieve this goal.

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Edwin?</b><br>
<p>I learned English as an adult, so I know how hard it is to reach proficiency. Learning to converse in English was particularly hard.</p>
 
<p>When I was responsible for international operations at Evernote, I did a lot of travel and I was surprised how low English fluency was in most countries. I was even more surprised when I realized that English is part of public school and university curriculum in many of these countries. Students spend a lot of time studying English. In many cases their families also spend a lot of money paying for private lessons. But the outcomes are often quite poor.</p>
 
<p>That’s the problem we are solving at Edwin. We are building an AI-powered English learning service delivered by chatbots, voice assistants, and professional human instructors. Our initial focus is on motivated students studying for standardized English as foreign language (EFL) tests, such as TOEFL and TOEIC.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Edwin will change the way individuals learn English?</b><br>
<p>Our goal is to help millions of people around the world learn better English faster and thus improve their economic prospects and broaden the life horizon. We believe the best way to learn a language is to study with a tutor, 1:1. That’s the gold standard of language education. But it’s prohibitively expensive. Fortunately, recent advances in AI and other technologies enable us to automate a large part of EFL curriculum when teaching teenagers and adults. At Edwin, we rely on AI-powered bots and voice assistants to do the bulk of English teaching and language practice, freeing teachers to use their valuable time for the most nuanced tasks. Our goal here is to provide our students with better outcomes in ⅓ the time at ⅓ the cost of existing methods.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>One meta trend is advances in AI that make it practical to use for education. I’m talking about things like Machine Learning, speech technologies, Natural Language Understanding. We are starting to use these tools to give teachers superpowers. These new technologies enable them to offload tedious repetitive teaching tasks and to focus on doing what humans do best: motivate learners, explain complicated concepts, lead discussions, and solve student problems.</p>
 
<p>Another notable technology trend is the emergence of conversational user interfaces. Education is conversational by nature, especially language education, so these new messengers and voice assistants are very promising platforms for educational services.</p>
 
<p>At the same time many families and communities are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the old learning formats and methods and ready to try new things. This trend is very pronounced in foreign language learning.</p>

<p>Taken together, these developments will allow us to move from factory-model classrooms and methodologies to more effective, personalized education.</p>
 
<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to Edwin?</b><br>
<p>Oh, Edwin keeps me quite busy! I’m also advising  a couple of technology startups that are in adjacent domains, educating young kids and developing speech technologies.</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>Well, I’m not a big Twitter user. I’m getting my technology and business updates mostly through the "social editor" of my Facebook circle. I’m also listening to several podcasts: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-edtech-podcast/id1107282759">The Edtech</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-all-turtles-podcast/id1304493828">The All Turtles</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/waking-up-with-sam-harris/id733163012">Waking Up with Sam Harris</a>.</p>
