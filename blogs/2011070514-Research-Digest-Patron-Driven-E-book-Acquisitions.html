Budget concerns have pushed an <a href="http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~mbolin/tyler.htm">increasing</a> number of academic libraries, including this one, towards a patron request driven acquisitions model. Student ILL requests are evaluated for suitability to our collection, but purchasing decisions are still made by a librarian. This paper goes further to explore the results of student on-demand e-book purchasing through vendor <a href="http://www.myilibrary.com/">MyiLibrary</a>.
 
<b>Review</b>: 
The library at Southern Illinois University Carbondale entered a patron driven e-book acquisitions agreement in 2008 when MyiLibrary approached their purchasing consortium, the Greater Western Library Alliance. Initially, 9,000 selected MARC records were added to the catalog to represent titles available for student initiated purchase and SIUC placed a deposit with MyiLibrary from which purchasing funds would be withdrawn. Students were allowed to access the full text of these titles three times before purchase was automatically initiated. 

Between November 2008 and April 2010, 470 e-books were purchased in this fashion and 235 were used again after purchase. Usage data shows in-depth and significant use of purchased resources. The authors found that while e-books purchased through MyiLibrary were significantly more expensive than their paper counterparts, usage statistics showed that patron selected items circulated more robustly than traditionally acquired items in the collection. 

The authors found that students often initiated purchase of e-book titles the library already owned in print, suggesting a high demand for instant and remote access. There were a few issues encountered around MyiLibrary's access and licensing policy, including an inability to discover titles through Google catalog searches and difficulty in adding purchased titles to OCLC. 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
Instant access to appropriate resources was perhaps the most fervent wish of librarians in the age of paper; negotiating this gift is the greatest test of librarians today. This particular model is extreme and balances an organized structure for patron driven purchasing with strict licensing and usage specifications. A bargain must be struck between the speed of access and the quality of records, licensing, and preservation. An increasing number of our patrons may simply ignore items that are not available remotely and instantly. Patron-initiated e-book purchasing is a good way to connect this population with legitimate resources though this particular model may need to be refined.
