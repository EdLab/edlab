Private! 

Hi team EdLab!*

Thank you again to all of the Pundit fortune cookie slogan contest participants!  Through your hard-work and brain-power, Pundit has a whole collection of witty, fun fortune cookies ready for delivery & stealth "drops" throughout TC in the coming weeks!

<b>Fast-forward to the upcoming <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6779">EdLab Holiday Party</a> on Dec. 14th...</b>
Lets harness the collective EdLab super powers once again to develop amazing fortunes to include in custom cookies to be enjoyed at this festive open house.  The goal of the cookies will be to promote the lab, our work/projects and careers.

<b>Details...</b>
We get 15 different fortunes for this custom cookie order and again, in addition to our URL & logo on the back (or front depending on your perspective), we get up to 111 characters (including spaces) for the message.

Also, please weigh-in here on whether or not you think we should have URL's & correspondent fortunes specific to each EdLab project and focus or stay general and link to the EdLab home page?  

To get the collective creative juices flowing here are a few ideas for fortunes:
