<p>When educators talk about problem-based learning, they may not be thinking about presenting kids with the challenge of tackling a serious disease like lupus. After all, there are doctors and scientists all over the world researching potential cures for these diseases. However, at a school in Culver City, California, the students are thinking about lupus and tasked to "positively and measurably impact the community with lupus" through whatâ€™s called challenge-based learning. They think about the challenge and how it affects the community, and then decide how to develop a solution that might address it.</p>

<p>Two students at the school, for example, decided to create a lupus relief kit, a box filled with items that might help someone recently diagnosed with the disease. The box contains things like aloe vera, sunscreen, and a journal. Through this relief kit, the students hoped to provide practical resources that those coping with lupus might appreciate, and after the students delivered the kits, they certainly seemed to see the extent of their impact.</p>

<p>How can teachers harness challenge-based learning in a way that best engages students and pushes them to think outside the box? How can students be encouraged to think about ways to positively impact their community? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/29987/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:26 saraehardman:</b> It's great for students to be able to apply what they learn in class to make a difference in their communities. Connecting science education to real life for kids brings purpose and meaning to schools.</p>

<p><b>@02:26 Brian.Sweeting:</b> I think this can make all the difference for motivating students. If you can show them how what they're learning in class is directly applicable to improving someone else's quality of life, you can ignite passion that's stronger than just wanting to pass a test or do well in school.</p>
