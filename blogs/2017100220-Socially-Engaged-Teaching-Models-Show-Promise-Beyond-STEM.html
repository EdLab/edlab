<p>In a passive activity, students receive information but do not otherwise overtly engage with the learning material, whereas active learning requires focused motor movement, such as underlining or copying selected text passages. Constructive activities go beyond active: students synthesize their own ideas and generate a novel output; for example, a concept map. In interactive activity, students engage in a substantive exchange of ideas leading to a new level of understanding.</p>
 
<p>This was the premise for a repeated measures study to see if interactive activities are more effective than constructive activities at promoting student learning. Researchers conducted their study in postsecondary STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) classrooms where there is adherence to widespread traditional practices, large numbers of students, increased focus on improving STEM graduation outcomes, and discrete answers on high-cognitive quizzes. The setting, a university biology course taught by the same instructor in back-to-back sections of 350 students for 50 minutes, four times a week, also addressed growing national concerns over improved college STEM courses.</p>
 
<p>The researchers designed paired sets of in-class activities that differed only in their mode of student engagement: constructive or interactive. Each student engaged serially on different days in constructive and interactive activities on different topics. This enabled researchers to analyze student performance using a repeated measures approach. Demographic and student performance data were used to assess potential interactions between activity-type and student characteristics.</p>
 
<p>The results indicate that, in a pairwise comparison, interactive activities promote increased learning more than constructive activities. While the authors acknowledge the improvement in learning is subtle, they argue the data show promise beyond STEM because instructional decisions are likely to be more important as postsecondary courses continue to transition from passive lecture to more involved socially engaged models of instruction, especially in large college classrooms.</p>
