<b>Central Question:</b> Is it ethical or even a moral imperative for adults to use any means available to teach young people about financial responsibility?


<b>Suggested Length of Lesson:</b> 1 Class Period

<b>Standards:</b> Economics, Social Studies, US History, Sociology, Fine Arts, New Media

<b>Vocabulary:</b>
Financial Solvency
Ethics
Morals
Agenda 
Implicit
Explicit

<b>Students should be able to:</b>
Decide for themselves whether or not it is right to express financial mores to children using cartoons.

Debate whether or not we have an ethical or moral obligation to teach our citizens about debt.

Discover what methods and media adults use to express their political, personal or corporate agendas to young people.  

Explore their personal experience with depictions of financial solvency in popular media. 

<b>Activity #1 (20 minutes):</b> Have students watch the embedded Vialogue.  Then, ask the class to write one column of implicit ways the adult producers used to express American financial values to their audience and one column of explicit means.  Also, have students record what they thought the financial "lesson" of the cartoon is.    

<b>Activity #2 (15 Minutes):</b> Have students present their thoughts to the class.  

<b>Activity #3 (15minutes):</b> Have students break-into groups and write down as many examples of messages and agendas adults try to market to young people.  Examples can include religious, political, financial and corporate.  Also have students write-down what medium these adults used to express their messages.  Examples can include blogs, cartoons, videos, commercials, food packaging, comics/graphic novels, video games PSA's, toys, clothing etc.  

<b>Closing Discussion:</b> What commonalities did you find in the medium adults used to try to express their beliefs to kids (refer to Activity #3 results)?  Do you think it is right for adults to express their political and financial views to kids who are too young to vote on these issues? Is it possible to be totally bias-free when creating entertainment for young people?  How do you know when this crosses the line?  Who decides?  How did you learn about financial responsibility?  From a parent or guardian?  Friends?  Cartoons, TV or Movies?  What was the main difference between implicit and explicit depictions of values and beliefs?  Are your favorite characters in movies or tv financially solvent?  If not why?  If so, why?  Do you think we have a moral obligation to teach American citizens about financial responsibility?  At what age should we start?  Using what medium?  

<b>Optional Homework:</b> Have students interview an adult to find-out how they learned about financial responsibility.  For example, did they learn about financial responsibility from a character on a tv show or movie?  From a parent or guardian? Or from a class at school?   Write down their response and add it to a UFR class blog on the issue.
