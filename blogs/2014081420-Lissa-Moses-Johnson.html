<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lissa-johnson/4/45a/551">Lissa Moses Johnson</a> has what very few edtech founders possess: extensive experience in the science classroom. After working as a 6th-11th grade science educator in a variety of settings Johnson merged this experience with her work as an educational content and documentary producer to found, <a href="http://www.mosamack.org/">Mosa Mack Science</a>. The Mosa Mack series of short, animated science mysteries features a young African American girl, and combines Johnson’s deep understanding of what STEM resources science teachers all-too-often lack, and her conviction that the sciences have for far too long disproportionately skewed towards white males. Mosa Mack Science Detective was a <a href="http://www.siia.net/blog/index.php/2014/04/siia-innovation-incubator-program-announces-2014-finalists-2/">SIIA finalist</a> and recently screened at the NY Hall of Science. Johnson holds a Masters in Science in Teaching from Pace University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My educational and professional experiences inspired me to start <a href="http://www.mosamack.org/">Mosa Mack Science</a>. After majoring in biology, I began working in documentary television. I was interested in how media could be used to inspire a broad audience and ultimately focused on its educational impact. I went back to get my masters of science teaching and taught 6th, 7th and 11th grade in public and private school in New York City. I was passionate about my students identifying as scientists, but found there was a disconnect in the classroom. Why weren’t my students identifying as scientists? What was getting in the way of them making this natural connection?
<p>
I knew that nationally, students were failing in science and I wanted to understand why. I looked at the resources available to science educators and found two major problems. The first was that most resources featured an older Caucasian male as the central figure in science programming, which not only perpetuates outdated stereotypes but also sends a message about the types of people who do not participate in science. The second problem was that the resources lacked rigor: they were lecture-based, talking heads, and frankly, pretty boring. I wanted to use media to redefine what it means to be a scientist and began to build Mosa Mack Science. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> While I’m drawing on many of my professional experiences in creating Mosa Mack Science, I would say that being a classroom teacher exposed me to the daily challenges of educators. Within each lesson, teachers have to engage their students, differentiate instruction, challenge and empower their students, promote diversity and of course, teach to the test. I wanted to provide educators with a way to do this with greater ease in the classroom and provide them with a resource that they could rely upon to truly enhance the lesson by addressing all of these challenges.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> My goal is that Mosa Mack Science addresses problems faced by both students and teachers. Students need a resource that invites them to jump into the deep end with science content, something that draws them in on an emotional level. Educators need more resources that empower them to be agents of change in the classroom. Teachers tell us that students are begging for more episodes and teachers themselves see the resource as a "relief," as one educator described it. So far, we’re seeing our goals are being achieved and are working hard to continue to meet those demands from teachers and students.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Right now, there are wonderful high-level discussions going on about what education should look like. We’re, of course, seeing a shift towards online learning and blended learning, which will no doubt have a large impact on the future of education. We’ve carefully and intentionally built Mosa Mack Science to enhance science learning in the many scenarios in which it will be taught.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We are gearing up for our July premier of our next three episodes at the New York Hall of Science. We’ve made some exciting changes since the pilot episode including a complete character web redesign and are looking forward to sharing our work with the world! We are also preparing to raise our seed round of funding to build out our library, have a greater reach, and impact more classrooms.
