<p>When you’re stuck waiting at the doctor’s office or on a long commute do you find yourself endlessly <a href="
http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-live-a-happy-life-according-to-psychologists-2016-2/#2-set-phone-alarms-to-fight-zombie-scrolling-2">zombie scrolling</a> through your social media feeds? <a href="https://shortlyread.com">Shortly</a> hopes to break this unhealthy habit and get you reading again. This free app provides short stories ranging from one to five minutes to pass the time without obsessing over Instagram likes. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I was quite surprised to find that Shortly did not require any sign-up. Simply download the app and start reading! It’s refreshing in an age when many apps try to squeeze out every last bit of user information.</p>

<p>Shortly curates its stories from the best of <a href="
https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/">Reddit’s /r/writingprompts</a> group. These stories pack  inventive and entertaining content into just a few minutes of reading. For instance, here’s one prompt that inspired one of my favorite <a href="
https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6e0rfh/wp_as_a_child_you_were_asked_what_you_wanted_to/di6xrxa/">short tales</a> . 
<blockquote><p><i>"As a child, you were asked what you wanted to be when you grew up, and you said ‘Fire Truck!’ After three decades and extensive cybernetic modification, that dream is realized. The alarm has just sounded! It’s time to fight your first fire."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>All of the authors impressed me with the amount of detail contained in such short posts. Some of the other more memorable stories involved black holes, aliens, and super powers.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While a great app, there are a few improvements that could be made. First, the authors, although given a byline, should have links to their profiles so that Shortly users can find their other writings. Some of the writers are obviously talented and it should be easier to connect to their work.</p>

<p>Additionally, Shortly should add some categories for the stories. Right now, the readings are completely random. A few simple options could give users a little more control over the material. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Shortly is a brilliantly simple concept available for free. Stop zombie scrolling and go download it right now.</p>
