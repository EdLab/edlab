            *** Private please!! ***

Last night I attended an event organized by the CMU School of Design for alumni living in New York City. This event takes place once a year, when the Head of the school and the director of Alumni Relations go on a "promotional tour" of sorts and visit all the major cities where alumni are concentrated.

Now, those of you who have talked to me about CMU probably know that I actually don't have many positive feelings about my academic experiences there. This always seems to surprise people, as it's seen as such a good school. Unfortunately, in my experience, they don't really practice what they preach; they tout themselves as this great interdisciplinary environment for both the arts and technology, but the reality is that programs are very siloed, and there is very little collaboration and crossover across disciplines, especially at the undergrad level. I was the black sheep of the design program for being interested in programming and technology and wanting to take CS classes and incorporate coding in my work; and I was also the black sheep of the CS program for being a right-brained/visual person and wanting to focus on practical coding projects rather than algorithms and theory. My decision to do these things was criticized rather than supported by my community. So, academically, I did not have a great time at CMU.

But despite my disappointment in the education I received, I'm not completely estranged from the design program. I still go to these alumni events once a year because in the end I do want to see the School of Design get better. And they certainly have taken some steps in the right direction; about 2 years ago (just after I'd graduated), they began recruiting for a new professor in computational design, and they ended up getting someone from MIT (and a woman, at that! :D). I've also heard from various sources that as some of the older professors have finally been retiring, it's been a little easier to inject fresh ideas into the program.

But they still have a long way to go. To me, it's extremely telling that almost everyone who has graduated from the program in the last few years has a job title of either "UX Designer" or "Product Designer" (and here we're talking 'product' in the digital/mobile sense, not physical). However, the two majors offered by the School of Design at the undergrad level are industrial design (= physical product design, where they learn drawing, woodshop, physical prototyping, and 3D modeling/CAD) and communication design (= graphic design, where they focus on typography and information design). There is a disconnect between the majors they offer and the jobs that people are actually going into when they graduate, and while it's not like the education that CMU design students receive is completely irrelevant to what they actually go on to do, they are certainly disadvantaged because they're not taught the specific skills and media that they're going to be working with and on in the real world. For some reason, CMU Design has been particularly resistant to students working on mobile and web projects.

The other problem, besides the skills and media, is that design programs also try to prepare you for the kind of workplace you'll end up in. During our senior year, we were required to take a class on the "business of design", that was all about what it's actually like to be a professional, working designer. And even before that, they always had do a lot of group projects to prepare us for that aspect of professional life. In our business class, the kinds of workplaces we discussed: small "boutique" design firms, large corporations where you work as an in-house designer, or freelancing. No one mentioned tech start-ups as another, very viable option. In our team projects, we'd work with other designers or maybe with business/marketing majors. Never with engineers.

I know I'm probably biased because I think my class felt this disconnect the most strongly. We started college in the fall of 2006, less than a year before the debut of the iPhone. It was still in the early years of Facebook and Google, when it was only just beginning to dawn on people what a large impact small tech start-ups can have.

The curriculum didn't change while we were in school, and so by the time we graduated in May of 2010, our degrees were in many ways already outdated.

At the presentation they gave at the event yesterday, they explained how they're currently in the process of redoing the curricula at all levels. They seemed really proud of the fact that instead of the "old guard" (the tenured professors who are ages 60+) redoing the curricula, it's instead being done by the "younger generation" (...who are still all ages 40~55).

And when is the new curriculum going to be rolled out?

...Fall of 2015.

Relatedly, they said they're hoping to finally add a 3rd major. When they first mentioned that, my heart leapt. Would this finally be it?! The long-awaited, long-hoped-for design & technology degree!?

No. It's something they're calling "environment design", and is a collaboration with the School of Architecture.

Now, it's true that there seems to be growing interest in the intersection of design and architecture; I actually know several design majors who ended up deciding to do grad school in architecture. But is that crossover field really where the jobs are?

Overall, the CMU School of Design still sees fit to ignore the impact of technology as much as possible. Instead, they're now trying to shift their focus even more strongly toward "sustainability" (which is largely focused on choices of materials and a focus on service/systems design, in the sense that the sustainable disposal of a product should be taken into account from the very beginning). Again, I'm not saying that's not important, but is that where the jobs are?

Besides that, they talked about the new faculty hired in the past year, and after giving brief bio's of each of the new people, I was dismayed to find that they're probably just going to perpetuate their existence in this little "bubble" they've created where they're skeptical of the impact of technology, because they're continuing to hire people who think just like them.

However, there is some hope in the sense that CMU recently appointed a "Vice Provost of Design, Art & Technology". I do think the presence of such an individual is promising and hopefully will lead to some more change in the right direction (ie. some ACTUAL collaboration between the art/design and tech programs), though I don't think that will ever have as much of an impact as change that were to come from within.

The final interesting tidbit was that, in rethinking some of their graduate programs, the CMU School of Design is proposing two new degrees:
- a professional 3-year "Doctorate of Design" (for people who want to do deep research into one specific area and then go back to the professional world, rather than staying in academia)
- a "Masters of Professional Studies" degree

The latter made me both laugh and cry a little on the inside because the M.P.S. is actually the degree one receives from my masters program, ITP. One of the running "jokes" is that no one has any idea what an M.P.S. is/what it really means, because no one else gives out this degree.



In conclusion: I really want to see the CMU School of Design get better, I really do. But I think they're deliberately choosing to ignore the reality of how the profession has changed because the media we're working with have changed so drastically in the last few years, and I think they still have a long way to go.
