<p> Against all the odds, print publications have been back with a vengeance. This <i>plot twist,</i> as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/business/media/the-plot-twist-e-book-sales-slip-and-print-is-far-from-dead.html">New York Times</a> called it, highlights how the majority of people are not willing to completely give up their physical books for Kindles. Yet research scientists at MIT Media Lab are taking a new approach, not changing the physical status of books, but how we interact with them. Using a combination of four different technologies they developed a way to read books without ever having to open them. </p>
 
<p>Pulling from research conducted by MIT students ten years ago, Barmak Heshmat and his team have created a new device that has the power to decipher characters through objects. "I was really curious, I wanted to know how deep you can actually read through a closed book," he says. The technology Barmak used is a combination of four different tools: radiation that goes through paper, time resolution to distinguish between different pages, spectral information to identify different inks, and an algorithm that recognizes characters between shadows of letters that are often covered by the previous text. Their goal is to make the invisible visible. </p>
 
<p> This new technology has many practical applications; researchers cited their ability to read and analyze antique documents, ones that would normally fall apart if you had to touch the pages. This features yields itself to people like archeologists, historians and students seeking to review delicate text. What other applications can you imagine for this fascinating technology?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@02:23 saraehardman:</b> This is really cool, and I feel like it could have tons of implications for the future. I wonder how long the reading process takes, though. Whether this process takes a few minutes or a few hours could make a difference for how it is used.</p>

<p><b>@03:27 DJRojas11:</b> I'm not sure that it has immediate applications for the everyday reader, but it would open up scores of new artifacts to students of history and could change our understanding of historical events.</p>
