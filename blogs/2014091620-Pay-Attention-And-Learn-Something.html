<p><b>Title:</b> Lead Me Gently: Facilitating Knowledge Gain through Attention-Aware Ambient Learning Displays (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dirk Börner, Marco Kalz, & Marcus Specht</p>

<p><b>Source:</b><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013151400102X"> Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Can an attention-aware display design capture users’ focus of attention and influence knowledge gain?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The study examined the effectiveness of ambient learning display designs. Researchers split 52 university employees into two groups to test the hypothesis that the attention aware-displays attract user attention earlier and longer than other displays and that the amount of knowledge gained by a user increases with the amount of attention paid towards the display. Participants were left alone to fill out a questionnaire while an informative slideshow display looped on a computer nearby. The control group saw just the slides, while the experimental group experienced slides that tried to attract attention by sending visual and audio cues (a blinking shape, a male voice saying "Psst!") which vanished when participants focused on the display. The attention-aware display also presented "achievements," such as a short melody, when users paid more attention to the slides. Afterwards, participants were given a knowledge test related to the information that had been displayed.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> A custom-built sensor measured user attention. Participants in the attention-aware group started paying attention to the display about 2-3 minutes through the first set of slides; those in the control group only started to pay attention after 5 minutes, and missed the first set of slides entirely. The attention-aware display also retained user focus longer, almost double that of the control group. There was a positive relationship between the amount of attention paid to the display and participants' scores on the knowledge test, confirming that the attention-aware display had a medium-sized effect on knowledge gain. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> One limitation of this particular study is that the knowledge test was limited to factual information; it may be interesting to explore how attention-aware displays might influence more conceptual or procedural knowledge gains. Furthermore, the test only consisted of simple recall, and more research is needed to evaluate the influence that attention-aware displays might have on long-term learning. Additionally, the display design itself may lose value over time as users become acclimated to it, and future research should investigate whether the knowledge gain effect is sustainable when people are exposed to the same display design over and over.  Ambient learning displays are commonly implemented in semi-public places (waiting rooms, restaurants, transit vehicles, etc.) and this study highlights one type of design that may more efficiently convey factual information. Further research on attention-aware display design may also yield important contributions for technology-enhanced learning in general. </p>
