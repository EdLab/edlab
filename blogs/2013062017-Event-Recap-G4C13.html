          <p>
            I attended the last day/evening of the 10th annual <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/festival2013/">Games for Change</a> conference yesterday (Look-out for the <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/section/Seen%20in%20New%20York%20/">"Seen in NY"</a> on <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/">New Learning Times</a> soon!).  It was an invigorating experience full of interesting panels, new connections and a general feeling of inspiration and hope. Why? Because there are clearly so many individuals who believe in the power of games to help change minds and improve minds.  

<b>Event overview:</b>
The event was held in the subterranean World Stages space in the low-50's.  Featuring neon panels and "futuristic" touches and fonts (see pics below) the space felt more like a Battlestar Galactica set, rather than a typical conference space (in a good way).  

Panels and presentations were held in theater spaces and they lent themselves well to people both attending and presenting (great acoustics/lighting etc.).  The event's planners included standing tables and spaces to prop laptops for impromptu gatherings and spontaneous meetings.  This was actually one of the best parts of the conference for me... I was able to have a few "free-wheeling" conversations with attendees and new contacts that have GREATLY enriched my professional network and understanding of the EdTech arena.   

<b>Stand-out panels and discussions:</b> 

Out of the few panels and discussions I was able to attend, I was most impressed with the last two.  Both <a href="http://ericzimmerman.com/">Eric Zimmerman</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Brathwaite">Brenda Romero (Braithwaite)</a> stood-out as passionate, unique presenters. Zimmerman, received a standing ovation for his impassioned plea to help foster social change through games and digital communication and Romero/Braithwaite brought the audience to tears (those I could see) with her descriptions of the inspiration behind "Train", her game focused on the Holocaust. 

Overall, I HIGHLY suggest you attend the next @G4C event!  Check-out <a href="http://gamesforchange.tumblr.com/">their Tumblr</a> for more!
