            <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/01/13/education-next-generation-business-managers-afghanistan">The National Institute of Management and Administration (NIMA)</a> is a business school recently opened to students in Afghanistan. The purpose of this institution is to train the next generation of Afghan bureaucrats and business managers. Additionally, the Institute was established in hopes of increasing the number of skilled workers by building a high quality technical vocational education and training system. Since NIMA's inauguration in 2008, about 52% of the more than 1,000 graduates from the first batch have landed a job, while the remaining graduates are pursuing other higher level studies. Presently, 982 students are enrolled in NIMA and 220 of those students are women.

I believe that the Afghan government has done very well by creating this Institute, with the help of the World Bank and Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The Afghan government took a bold step when it realized that the country lacked managers with modern skills. In today's world, knowledge and familiarity with technology has become essential for working and learning. With that being said, I think it makes sense for the country to engage students in learning through the use of technology. The number of females enrolled in NIMA also shows the country is trying to engage its female population in education and professional life. I think establishing NIMA is a sign that Afghanistan is intent on moving ahead as a modern country.
