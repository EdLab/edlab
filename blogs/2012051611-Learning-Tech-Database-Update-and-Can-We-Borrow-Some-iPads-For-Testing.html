Hey everyone here's a small update on the Learning Technology Database Project, and I want to ask you all for a huge favor!

We have completed creating prototype questions for our review surveys, this is what we will ask teachers, students, and technologists to fill out after testing an educational application. This set of review surveys are intended for the math learning applications, so when we created these surveys we made sure that they would be used for math teachers and learners. We want our review surveys to be specifically tailored for each subject, so we will create a set of surveys for each subject. 

With the answers from the review survey we will create what we will call the written "expert" review, and we will also use the quantitative data to create a 3 dimensional graph display vital information about the application like how users learn, how well the app fits in the curriculum, and more. 

So far the team has created the questions for the learners/students, and the teachers. The review for technologist is being created with help from Megha and Pranav. It's good to have tech experts in house helping with the creation of the technologist review survey. With their experience we will have a tech review survey that developers would be able to understand fill out easily.

Now we want to test out our math review surveys with some people in the lab. These individuals will have the review survey explained to them, then play a math learning app, and finally fill out the review survey and give feedback. Feedback can include re-wording a question, adding/removing a question etc. This would be the procedure more or less when we have the professionals review the apps.

Now for the favor, we need iPads to actually perform the testing since for now we are going to focus on mobile learning apps. We are currently borrowing Janets to look for apps, but we need 2 or 3 more to perform the testing. The testing will occur for one or two weeks so we would need to borrow the iPad for that amount of time. When the professionals review apps they would be playing with the app for about 2-4 weeks depending on the app. 

<b>So knowing this can anybody in the lab let us borrow their iPad for one or two weeks?</b>
