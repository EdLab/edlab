<a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/09/08/peds.2010-1919.abstract">Lillard, Angeline., Peterson, Jennifer. (2011). The Immediate Impact of Different Types of Television on Young Children's Executive Function.  <i>Pediatrics</i> (online).</a>

With the release of the psychologist Roy Baumeister's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/willpower-by-roy-f-baumeister-and-john-tierney-book-review.html?pagewanted=all">new book</a> on the subject (along with countless retellings of the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer">marshmallow test</a>), "executive function", which basically means self-control, is in the news.  A new study out in Pediatrics looks at the immediate impact of different media on the executive function of a group of four-year olds.  The authors conclude, controversially, that watching Spongebob Squarepants is bad for your kids.
<!--break-->
Summary:

Relying on the “depletion” theory of executive function (it's a finite resource, and using it up to carry out one task means you'll be less able to control yourself in other settings), the authors hypothesize that fast-paced shows, by requiring more focus and attention to consume, are likely to have a negative short-term impact on children's self-control. They also think there might be negative long-term effects, although these are outside the purview of the study.

They took 60 upper-middle class white four-year olds and randomly assigned them to one of three conditions: fast-paced television, educational television, or drawing.  Afterward, each child was given a series of tests that looked at executive function, by, for instance, testing the child's ability to delay gratification.  Despite being equal at the beginning of the experiment, by the time they had consumed an episode of Spongebob Squarepants, the “fast-paced television” group was scoring significantly worse on these tests.  

Edlab Relevance:

Although the study isn't really discriminating enough to point towards specific prescriptions, it does suggest that one should be cautious in incorporating “gamification” or other attention-taxing elements  (such as forcing the user to make extraneous choices) in educational software.  It suggests as well (to those of us Edlabbers with kids) that you shouldn't let your kids watch cartoons until after they do their homework.
