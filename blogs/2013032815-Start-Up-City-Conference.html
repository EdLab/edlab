I just found out about this conference through ITP's Alumni listserve. I'm not planning to attend, but figured others might be interested, especially since this does seem relevant to what we're doing (especially the LaunchPad initiative!).

Breakout Session A:
I.  From the Classroom to the Boardroom: Preparing Our Students for Success
The number one concern of entrepreneurs interviewed by the Manhattan Borough President's Office was the shortage of talent to fill the jobs of the 21st century economy. Companies are struggling to fill a range of jobs, from low- to mid-level coding, to marketing positions and high-tech engineering slots. This breakout will examine ways to boost the skills of New Yorkers of all ages to meet this demand.
-OR-
II.  Breaking Down Barriers to Entrepreneurial Success
This breakout will examine ways to both make starting a business in New York City easier and make government more responsive to the ongoing needs of the entrepreneurial economy.  

Breakout Session B:
III.  Infrastructure for the 21st Century: How Fast, Reliable Internet Access Can Boost Business Throughout the Five Boroughs
For a city that is an established leader in the technology revolution, New York has slow, spotty internet access–even in Midtown Manhattan–and many communities lack multiple options to create redundant connections. This breakout will look at ways to boost internet speed and reliability, including the promise of municipal fiber networks, expanded public WiFi through public-private partnerships, and more.
-OR-
IV.  Tech as an Engine of Innovation: How Technology is Fueling the City's Diverse Economy
While tech start-ups receive a significant amount of publicity, the entrepreneurial ecosystem goes far beyond social media and information technology to touch practically every sector of New York City's economy. As Steven Rosenbaum, the New York City Economic Development Corporation's (EDC) first ever "Entrepreneur at Large" said, "[New York] is fertile ground for a whole series of tech enabled industries. There's advertising tech, there's fashion tech, there's financial tech, media tech and more." This panel will include entrepreneurs from a variety of fields to discuss how technology is becoming an ever-more integral part of their industry.
