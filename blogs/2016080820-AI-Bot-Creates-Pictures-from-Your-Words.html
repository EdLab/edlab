<p><a href="https://www.wordseye.com">WordsEye</a> is an artificial intelligence bot that transforms your words into visual art. Although it’s technically a social media site, WordsEye’s mission is to unlock the power of 3D graphics by making them accessible to everyone. It’s currently a website still in beta testing, but is available to anyone who makes an account.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>First of all, WordsEye is <i>fun</i>. It’s exciting to watch a random collection of sentences be morphed into a visual image. If WordsEye doesn’t quite get your mental image right, it allows you to swap objects, colors, or textures with others in its database. (For instance, I traded the top hat for a football helmet in the above image!) In addition to being entertaining, WordsEye could have many practical and educational applications. The site could help ESL and special needs students better express themselves, or it could be a tool to teach art or creative expression.</p>

<p>Like the AI bot that <a href="http://bigthink.com/robby-berman/a-computer-wrote-this-movie-and-its-uh-interesting">wrote a screenplay</a>, WordsEye is an experiment in AI creativity. Researchers around the world are testing the limits of AI inventiveness, and experimenting with WordsEye puts users on the front edge of the experience. It’s the type of innovative new product that inspires a grand "wow!" in first-time users.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The application is limited by the amount of vocabulary words it recognizes. It has an impressive stock, but fails to understand more unusual words (e.g., scarecrow, magic 8 ball). In addition, the bot can currently only identify objects, sizes, and orientation—not places or actions. For instance, although you can capture an image of a cheetah standing behind an antelope or a person beside a birthday cake, creating a visual of a cheetah <i>running</i> or a person <i>eating</i> birthday cake is simply not possible.</p>

<p>The graphics in WordsEye are apt, but not high quality; if you hope to create a professional image, you might be better looking elsewhere. Also, creating an image takes a significant amount of time because the bot needs time to process each new change. Even rotating the image or zooming in or out requires a sizable moment to load, and sometimes a specific action takes several tries before the app registers it. Patience is key when using WordsEye.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>WordsEye is an innovative, entertaining app with educational potential. The creators classify the app’s main goal as enabling a new form of creative expression to a broad audience, and WordsEye undoubtedly achieves this. Avoid using it to create professional images in its current version, but enjoy the product for what it is: an imaginative and often surreal ride.</p>
