<p>This study explores how various visual cues in video lectures directly impact student learning outcomes. Researchers had students watch video lectures with one of three visual cue conditions: one with a professor pointing to the relevant material, another with nonhuman visual cues, and a control group without any of the gestures. The team hypothesized that the lecture with the professor pointing would yield the greatest learning outcomes.</p>

<p>The researchers recruited 84 Chinese undergraduates to watch the seven-minute lecture. The students first took a short multiple choice pretest to establish a baseline of knowledge. The groups were then equally divided to standardize scores and demographics. Eye tracking software connected to a high-speed camera was used to record where each student was looking during instruction. Afterwards, students were again given another quiz, this time with a short multiple choice section, a few open ended questions, and a self-rated <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4568l">cognitive load</a> questionnaire.</p>

<p>The analysis of the quizzes showed that students in the pointing gestures group did significantly better than the other two groups in learning outcomes. Students in the pointing group also had longer fixation on the relevant areas of the video compared to the other two groups. Both results confirmed the research team’s hypothesis.</p>  

<p>Interestingly, the nonhuman cues group and the control group without any cues did not have any significant differences in both outcomes and visual fixation. The researchers also did not find any differences among the three groups when testing for mental strain on cognitive load.</p> 

<p>The authors note a few issues with this research. First, the eye tracking technology cannot be used in a true classroom setting, as students needed to be relatively still during the experiment. Second, they acknowledge that there could be cultural differences between students in China and in other countries. 

<p>Overall, this research shows that visual cues in video lectures do have some sort of impact, even if it’s still not fully understood. Teachers and educational technologists should keep this lesson in mind and not overlook the criticality of the human element as they continue to innovate in the sector.</p>
