<p><b>Title:</b> The Effectiveness of Automatic Text Summarization in Mobile Learning Contexts (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangbing Yang, Nian-Shing Chen, Kinshuk, Erkki Sutinen, Terry Anderson, & Dunwei Wen</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513001334">Computers and Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
What length of a summary is enough to convey the main points of a document without compromising content transmitted to mobile learning devices?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Many students mull over questions like "What does this mean in a nutshell?" and "What do I <i>really</i> need to know?" as they search for key concepts in articles and textbooks. Computer automation of this summarization process has been approached from several different angles and is continually being refined. This research examines automatic text summarization so as to provide a tool that adequately summarizes content and provides a reduced quantity of text without compromising the meaning of key information transmitted to mobile devices used for mobile learning. Unlike most other examinations of text summarization by intelligent tutoring systems for learning support, this study quantitatively assessed learning achievements of mobile learners to determine efficiency in summary length. Time and costs required for transmission of content to learners’ devices were also taken into consideration in determining the appropriate volume of the summary content.</p> 

<p>Three groups of five participants each read 100-, 250- or 400- word summaries, while the control group was given the full text. A final group was not given any text but was administered a 5-question multiple choice quiz which all other groups also took after reading their respective texts. All groups read their texts and took the quizzes on an iPad2.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The full-text control group collectively scored 19 of 25 correct answers (5 participants each took the 5-question quiz) and took an average of 34 minutes to complete the task. The following results of the other groups are in comparison to the performance of the control group. The group that received a summary of 400 words (20% of bytes downloaded by the full-text group) collectively answered 17 questions correctly, comparatively achieving 90% of the control group’s correct-answer score. This group averaged 44% of the time used by the full-text control group to accomplish the task. The 250-word summary group (13% of bytes of the full text group) answered 12 questions correctly, achieving 63% of that achieved by the control group, and used only 19% of time of the control group to accomplish the task. The 100-word summary group (5% of bytes of full-text group) answered 10 questions correctly, achieving 53% compared to the control group and used 15% of the time of the control group. The group that didn’t read correctly answered 6 questions, achieving 31% of the control group score. The 400-word summary presented the best results, demonstrating that a summary containing 30% of the original text content can lead to similar student achievement outcomes as those demonstrated by the full-content group.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
It is certain that more refined automation of key information along with appropriate length of summary of a given text will improve the efficiency of mobile learning and reading comprehension in normal readers. Although this study had a methodological in focus, its application of this technology could prove useful in classrooms for students with learning disabilities such as limited attention spans or a sense of being overwhelmed by too much text. Such students could benefit from more concise and digestible amounts of information.</p>
