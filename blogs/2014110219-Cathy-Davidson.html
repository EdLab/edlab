<a href="http://www.cathydavidson.com/">Dr. Cathy Davidson</a> is a Distinguished Professor in the English PhD Program at the CUNY Graduate Center. She also serves as a director of the Futures Initiative, a program dedicated to envisioning the future of higher education. A prolific author, Davidson has written over 20 books including her recent work, <a href="http://www.penguin.com/book/now-you-see-it-by-cathy-n-davidson/9780143121268">Now You See It</a>. Davidson contributes regularly to the Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, among others. Davidson is also one founder of <a href="http://www.hastac.org/">Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory (HASTAC)</a>, a network with over 13,000 members dedicated to "Changing the Way We Teach and Learn." In 2011, President Obama appointed Davidson to the National Council on the Humanities. Davidson is also the first educator to sit on the Board of Directors of Mozilla. She was recognized by the World Technology Network as Educator of the Year in 2012. Davidson holds a BA in Philosophy and English from Elmhurst College and a doctorate in English from SUNY Binghamton.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> I often say that I could not be a historian of the Internet had I not been trained as a historian of the book. I ask much the same questions of the digital as I did of texts: who uses, under what social-cultural conditions of inclusion or exclusion, what legalities apply (copyright, etc.), censorship or free expression, the economics of publication and participation, the relationship of use to participation, and then the role of the new media (mass publishing in the late 18th century, the Internet now) in social and political and cultural movements and cognitive and educational change.   
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> The great and improbably and really gratifying part of being a member of a participatory culture of the Internet is that my work (and that of many of my colleagues) is already having an impact. When we began HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory), some very eminent people literally denounced us as "charlatans"— a very harsh word. Why? Because we dared say that there were connections between disciplines, we dared say that technology was relevant to education, and we dared to say (perhaps this is most important) that, as educators, we had to take responsibility for new modes of learning for, with, and on the Internet. Now, over 14,000 people are part of our HASTAC network dedicated to "Changing the Way We Teach and Learn." And we are working with the Organization of American States and others on fostering the idea of a Latin American HASTAC in Spanish and Portuguese. Finally, the largest public urban university in America has invested in what we are calling the Futures Initiative, which is basically HASTAC’s principles designed to support the next generation of college professors as leaders of institutional and pedagogical change. Amazing. I am humbled and abashed every day by the impact we are having.
<p>
And here is a final point: I don’t buy the handwringing about how higher education "never changes." It actually is changing dramatically, continues to change. More to the point, too many of those who cry for change have motives other than real learning in mind. If higher education is a cash cow for corporations, then change is to be feared. If we are talking about real change for the good of learners and educators, then I’m all for it. But, instead of concentrating solely on what is not changing, I prefer to think about all the ways educators can make changes through alliances with other change makers, through innovative pedagogy, through informal and formal associations with one another, and, mostly, for the direct impact we have on our students.   
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  Clearly the cost of higher education is a real problem. If you graduate with tremendous debt, your choices of a major and a career are constrained by your short term financial prospects. That is a tragedy. We know that the real dividends are longer term, and that they are related to such amorphous considerations as passion, tenacity, grit, interest, connection (to your society, to your interests, to your skills). The person who pursues a field only to make money is far more likely to end up unsuccessful than the person who does exactly what they love. "Success" is never just monetary in the short run but should be measured by the ability to lead, long term, a productive, contented, satisfying, empowering life. That is almost impossible to contemplate when you are $200,000 in the hole and your wages are being garnished by loan sharks or bill collectors.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am writing a book on the history and future of higher education, with concrete recommendations of what educators can do now. I argue that K-12 cannot change until higher education does. We are the goal and the gatekeeper.  So especially in the area of standardized testing, our attitudes determine what K-12 teachers and parents can or won’t experiment with. It is a policy and polemical book intended for everyone:  what kind of society do we want? Are we heading there? Or do we need to step back and reinvest in education as a social and collective good? Obviously I think the latter. We’ve had a fifty-year downward spiral of support for higher education that we are just seeing signs of reversing. I want to push, very hard, in that direction of reinvesting in higher education. That’s why my program at the Graduate Center and CUNY is futures: like the stock market kind, I see education as like the futures market. You all get together and invest now because you know it will pay back handsomely later.
