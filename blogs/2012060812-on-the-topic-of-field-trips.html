          <p>
            Greg's latest <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7750">post</a> about the stereograph at NYPL, and Kate's response to it about field trips, and my nose in historical books about ed tech have got me wondering...

Could we do a "Looking Back" type of piece for NLT?

For example, I came across something called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.F._Skinner#Teaching_machine">teaching machine</a>. I am not quite satisfied with Wikipedia's explanation of it because I can't quite picture what the user would experience (which is I guess important to my understanding of it).

So, I could recommend it being turned into a simple, funky, infographic. I found this from an old brochure on Pocket Knowledge [<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/85152">link</a>], which could serve as inspiration:
<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/teachingmachine.jpg	"/>

BUT... I was also thinking about field trips... and how enriching that experience would be for me, and the viewer too! Maybe if we could get special access to a museum where a teaching machine still exists (or maybe it's not old enough to exist in a museum yet... maybe you could find one in your old principal's broom closet)... we could do a 50 second segment where we take viewers on an "adventurous field trip" on-site with an EdLab'er and try out technologies of yore. Luke could have some fun with this!

I also remember seeing some really random artifacts in the TC basement. Florence Nightingale's cuffs, for example! I'm sure there are many other random things down there that could be shared. 

Also, the benefit of leaving the 5th floor and meeting people/organizations in their own spaces may help to serve our marketing efforts. Getting other organizations excited about being part of our work is a plus...
