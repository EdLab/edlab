          <p>
            Being a graduate engineering student, I always encourage those going to college to look into the engineering discipline (or any STEM discipline for that matter).  One problem that many institutions have when convincing future students to major in engineering is the rigid curriculum that it is often in place.  With so many varying interests among students (even within the same major) there needs to be a push for flexible, independent engineering curricula throughout the nation. This will give students a chance to not only gain the core concepts and ideas behind their studies, but explore the different avenues of their major that interest them.

The article, <a href=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/07/10/flexible-engineering-degrees-gain-popularity-students-seek-specialization>Engineering Your Degree</a> highlights a couple of engineering programs that are flexible in nature. MIT's Course 2-A in Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University's Computer Science, and Cornell's Computer Science are of particular focus. It seems as though both programs have had considerably good feedback.

According to Norman Fortenberry, executive director of the American Society for Engineering Education, "There is a recognition within the engineering community that the challenges that engineers have to address require a greater deal of flexibility; a broader mix of skills than in the most traditional of traditional programs." Clearly, the one thing that all engineering and computer science curricula will have in common: flexibility. And it's really about time.
