<p>Digital library use among university students has been steadily decreasing in the past decade as more students opt for online search engines like Google instead. Because Google provides so many results and is incredibly simple to use, many students don’t see the point of searching through digital libraries, even if they likely have far more academic resources.</p>
 
<p>To promote digital library use, a team of researchers examined the factors that influence user satisfaction and loyalty to these online databases. They conducted the study via survey questionnaires administered at ten different universities in China. Overall, 426 students ranging from undergraduates to post-doctoral candidates participated.</p>
 
<p>The collected findings point to a few essential factors for user satisfaction and loyalty. These include the digital library’s ease of use and how connected its content seems to specific academic pursuits. These points don’t directly relate to the quality of information available. Instead, they relate more to how well the digital library is designed and how effectively it helps students connect library content with their personal research.</p>
 
<p>In light of these findings, the research team provides a few suggestions to help digital libraries expand and retain their patron base. The team suggests that to improve ease of use, digital libraries should have a simple and intuitive interface. To help students make connections between library content and their own research, the digital library should develop a training course or search guidelines that help students realize the importance of the digital library resources. In addition, the research team suggests that digital libraries offer personalized services to students and engage in open communication across various social media platforms.</p>
 
<p>Significant changes are needed to boost digital library loyalty. As the study shows, these changes are less about library content and more about design, communication, and helping people realize its educational potential. Basically, digital libraries have to keep up with all the other content available online, and this particular research team believes this can be achieved with better design and greater perceived usefulness for student research.</p>
