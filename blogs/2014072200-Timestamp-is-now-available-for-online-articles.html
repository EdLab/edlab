          <p>
            Today, I invite you to read an article <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3033050/why-you-should-learn-product-management-instead-of-coding"> Why You Should Learn Product Management Instead Of Coding</a>  from FastCompany. The article itself is well-written, but the new feature <i>reactions</i> is the best part I find. At the end of each paragraph, there is an opaque logo <i>reactions</i> together with with the count of reactions for this paragraph. By mousing over this logo, a tree map is presented with keywords that other readers reacted for this particular paragraph. Readers can either hit +1 to echo previous opinions or one of the default opinions, moreover, they can create their own reaction tab within 25 characters. On the top left corner of the article and behind the author name at the very bottom of the article, a <i>reactions</i> logo shows the accumulative reactions for the whole article. 

<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Others/screenshot-2014-07-22-002105_6bfd30bf54fa4bb193fbad1a310774c4.png">

Why <i>reactions</i>? I guess that the paragraph-specific reactions share the same purpose of the Vialogues video timestamp: to provide better viewer interaction and engagement. Without this function, I can only make comments at the end of the article. When I have an opinion about only one portion of the article/video, I may need to quote the paragraph/manually add timestamp for the part or I probably just forget about it. Vialogues research revealed that timestamped video dialogues are better than YouTube discussion with statistical significance. I am curious how to assess the functional benefit of <i>reactions</i> and whether it works. 

Another highlight is the social aspect of reactions- once a reaction is added, the reader can choose to tweet this article together with the created reaction. People can tweets their reactions and the beginning part of that paragraph altogether easily. However, the tweets of paragraph specific reactions is still not able to link to the position of the article. 

The research potential of reactions lies in an interesting combination of social interaction and text mining. I can definitely see the synergy of Vialogues research and reactions. Currently, only a few of the articles within FastCompany Labs session provides reactions. I look forward to know more about this experiment. 

A future improvement: the colors of <i>reactions</i> tabs are a bit arbitrary. Since the <i>reactions</i> can capture diverse sentiments, why not design an intelligent color scheme to represent the sentiments automatically?
