<p><a href="http://www.intellidemia.com/products/">Concourse</a> is an online syllabus management system that allows educators to enhance their existing syllabi with links, PDF’s, search capabilities, mobile applications, and more. Concourse enables students to link all course commitments to their personal online calendars and shows updates in real-time if changes are made. Syllabi are organized on one simple interface, making them easily accessible and editable for educators teaching multiple classes. Educators can add multiple approved users, like teaching assistants or adjunct instructors, that can view, edit, or enhance syllabi depending on their designated permissions. Educators can also search multiple syllabi by key words and make mass changes instantly.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Concourse makes organizing and editing syllabi a simple process. The platform is very approachable and most educators can begin using it right away with little to no instruction. The main dashboard alphabetically arranges all existing syllabi and separates current courses from past courses for easier navigation. When introducing a new course, educators can choose to upload an existing syllabus, clone another course, or create an entirely new syllabus right on the platform. The interface for creating a syllabus is intuitive and powerful, dividing each section into an individually editable block that be added or removed without affecting the layout of the overall syllabus. </p>

<p>Concourse’s best feature is the ability to insert clickable links, PDFs, images, and other media directly into the syllabus itself, eradicating the need for folder after folder of documents that is a characteristic of platforms like Blackboard. Educators control who can view and edit each syllabus and can alert students to changes in real time. Additionally, Concourse features a "sync to calendar" option so that students never (unknowingly) miss a deadline.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The main navigation panel could use work. While the logo in the upper left corner always brings a user back to the dashboard, an internal navigation menu is needed. A discussion board would greatly enhance this platform and could potentially replace other learning tools. Packages are expensive, ranging from $2-4 per student up to $3,000 for unlimited access. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Concourse is a powerful syllabus management tool that substantially increases the worth and functionality of a traditionally limited class instruction guide. This tool could be especially useful in online learning environments because of its capability for integrated resources and calendar syncing functionality. While expensive, the tool gives educators considerable control over course arrangement and implementation. Though it only performs one task, it performs it exceptionally well; if a discussion area/collaborative space were implemented, it would likely eliminate the need for additional online learning spaces. Add that component and this tool has serious potential to be the next big resource for online education.</p>
