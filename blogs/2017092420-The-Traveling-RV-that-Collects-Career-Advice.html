<p><i>"For 15 years, we’ve made it our mission to talk with professionals of every kind and ask the questions that no one is asking—honest questions about their struggles, successes, and how they figured out the age-old dilemma, ‘What should I do with my life?’"</i> (<a href="http://roadtripnation.com/about">About Roadtrip Nation</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Origins of the RV</b></p>

<p>Nathan, Mike, and Brian didn’t know what they wanted to do with their lives after they graduated college, as the story often goes. So they packed up their belongings, bought an RV, and traveled around the country asking passionate people how they landed careers in fields they loved. Across the thousands of miles and hundreds of interviews, these three friends realized that in searching for advice on how to find their passions, they had developed one: collecting career guidance stories and sharing them with others. They called it <a href="http://roadtripnation.com">Roadtrip Nation</a>.</p>

<p><b>Career Advice Through Storytelling</b></p>
 
<p>Over the past 15 years, Roadtrip Nation has grown from a few travelling college grads to a huge collection of resources for students, teachers, and people of any age trying to find their career paths. The team has several different outlets to help people answer the question: What should I do with my life? These include an interview archive, educational curriculum, a TV show, events around the country, and <a href="http://theonlybookyouneed.com">Roadmap</a> the book. All of these resources are rooted in storytelling, for as the Roadtrip Nation team states on their website, "Advice without story is noise."</p>

<p><b>Current Projects</b></p>
 
<p>The Roadtrip Nation team still travels around the country, interviewing anyone from TV series writers to public policymakers to scientists; as long as someone is passionate about what they do, the traveling team wants to talk to them. Roadtrip Nation has a huge database of interviews available on their website and tools to help people find those that align with their interests. In addition, they’ve turned these travels and interviews into a TV series, currently in its 13th season. The organization also has a series of project-based educational curricula available for teachers to help students in middle school through college explore different career options. Finally, their book, Roadmap, acts as a career guide, helping readers define their interests as a way to determine their final destinations.</p>
