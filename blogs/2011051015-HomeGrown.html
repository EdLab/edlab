<a href="http://www.facebook.com/HipLifeMovie?sk=info"><strong>From the Publis</strong><strong>her</strong></a>: Over  the past decade, Hip-Hop music has merged with High-Life, the  traditional music of West Africa, and this fusion has led to the birth  of a new musical genre called HipLife. Eli Jacobs-Fantauzzi’s new film,  HomeGrown: HipLife in Ghana, is a feature-length documentary about  V.I.P. (Vision In Progress). The film documents ten years of their  journey from the ghetto in Accra to their first international tour. They  grow from being teenagers with a shared dream to musicians with fans  around the world.

<a title="http://breaksbeyondtheballot.wordpress.com/eli-jacobs-fantauzzi/" href="http://"><strong>About the Director</strong></a>:  Eli Jacobs-Fantauzzi is a Brooklyn-based filmmaker making his mark in  the international documentary scene. A graduate of UC Berkeley, he  received his MA from Tisch School of the Arts at NYU in 2004. Before  graduation, he won the prestigious juried Student Film-maker Award from  the Pan African Film Festival for his documentary <em>Inventos: Hip-Hop Cubano</em>,  a film he shot, directed, edited, and produced. Jacobs-Fantauzzi has  traveled extensively in the Caribbean and Africa and produced and  directed several shorts and music videos, including the award winning  music video from Ghana, Besin. His first film, <em>i of MOTION us of MOVEMENT </em>chronicled the life of 4 women hip hop artists in the San Francisco Bay area. <em>Inventos</em>,  is the first in-depth look at Hip-Hop culture in Cuba, which premiered  in Havana Cuba and at the H2O International film festival in New York in  November 2003, and has since shown across the U.S. to great reviews.  Jacobs-Fantauzzi has been featured in <em>Anthem Magazine</em>, <em>NRG Magazine</em>, and the <em>Libertad Journal </em>that wrote, <em>“Inventos</em> embodies the true spirit of hip hop, which is to build a powerful and  useful mechanism out of what is seemingly impossible.” Currently,  Jacobs-Fantauzzi is in production on his next film entitled, <em>HomeGrown</em>,  a unique documentary on hip hop in Ghana, West Africa. He is a powerful  filmmaker, whose philosophy is built on experiences of struggle, and  who is dedicated to craft coupled with commitment to social justice and  awareness.
