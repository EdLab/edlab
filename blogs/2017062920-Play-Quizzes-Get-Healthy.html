<p>Everyone wants to get healthier, but nutrition and fitness are complex topics that can seem overwhelming to dive into (I’m speaking from experience here). Using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/health-iq/id878389915?mt=8">Health IQ</a>, you can learn about health, diet, exercise, and disease all by taking short quizzes developed by professionals in the field.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Health IQ plays on a craze that’s been sweeping the internet since MySpace: online quizzes. Instead of answering Which Character from Friends You Are Based on in Your Chipotle Order, however, these quizzes test your health expertise in various subjects and teach you facts along the way. Topics range from yoga to metabolism to food nutrients and the best way to eat greens. There are even quizzes on various diseases or learning disabilities.</p>
 
<p>After answering each question, Health IQ provides an explanation for the correct answer so that you can learn as you play. Users collect badges that display their mastered skills and find their rankings among others on the app. And with hundreds of quizzes already on Health IQ and more added daily, users will not run out of new information to learn.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The greatest learning aspect of Health IQ comes in the form of facts that explain the correct answers to quiz questions. While this is informative, it is not the most effective way to make knowledge stick. After finishing a quiz on yoga, I felt like I would have to take the same quiz at least once more to retain the explanations provided. The app could be improved if it provided information banks or cumulative quizzes to help users review what they’ve learned.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Health IQ could be an informative app for anyone looking to improve their knowledge of health, exercise, and nutrition. Users should not download it expecting to retain all the information provided, but it could provide a valuable health learning experience that you can fit into pockets of time throughout your day.</p>
