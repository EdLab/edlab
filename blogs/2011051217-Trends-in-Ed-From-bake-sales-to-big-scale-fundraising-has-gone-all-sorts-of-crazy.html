            Gone are the days when parents, realizing too late that the school bake sale is that night, could pick up a box of cookies from the grocery store bakery and call it a day.   

Just a few years ago, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/30Rauction.html?pagewanted=1"> “tricky tray” auction</a> was popular among parents and bargain hunters alike.  These school fundraisers functioned more like raffles than traditional auctions, with auctiongoers dropping part of their ticket rations next to the prize they wanted to win–i.e. a meal at a local restaurant, a basket of DVDs, tickets to a concert.  A winning ticket would then be drawn from the pile of hopefuls.  

Now, as seems to be the order of things, what was once a humble fundraiser has gone and got itself all done up.  Schools desperate to bring in money to save dying programs such as Music and Art have turned to selling big ticket items at well- executed auction events.  These events rival weddings with their propensity towards extravagance and luxury.

If you're looking to buy <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-04/entertainment/29526311_1_budget-cuts-boots-annual-online-auction">Madonna's old Chanel boots</a>, you're in luck! LaGuardia Arts High School's auction ended on Saturday but those boots (and a few other items) are still on sale via the <a href="http://www.gottahaverockandroll.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=7067&searchby=0&searchvalue=None&page=0&sortby=0&displayby=2&lotsperpage=25&category=1&seo=Madonna-Signed-and-Worn-Stunning-Chanel-Leather-Boots">online auction</a> for a few more seconds! Oh, it's closed now. Sorry, I took too long to post this. Congratulations to whoever bid $5,418 for the autographed boots.  …Wow. 

Of course, these luxury auctions are successful because they have a dedicated team to organize the event, they were donated amazing items, and the people who could afford to buy such items were there to make the bids and swipe their cards.  Schools without this exact environment, especially those that aren't in a community with card-swiping auction zealots, would fail.

In speaking of the auctions, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/08/135836634/forget-bake-sales-schools-turn-to-luxe-auctions?ft=1&f=1013">this NPR article</a> astutely points out that their other major flaw is the message it sends to the government.  The government, who has the responsibility to provide quality education to all students, may see this as an opportunity to shirk this obligation.  

Many schools cannot be this self-sufficient, no matter how involved and caring their communities are.  They're past cookies. They can't don't have Madonna's boots. So, how can they cash in?
