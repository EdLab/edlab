<p><b>Title:</b> Assessing Student Learning in a Virtual Laboratory Environment (2010)<p>
<b>Author:</b> Tilman Wolf</p>
<p>
<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The virtual lab is a developing technology that could potentially increase efficiency and intensify learning in online-only or blended classrooms. <i><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5152943">Assessing Student Learning in a Virtual Laboratory Environment</a></i> investigates whether students benefit from use of a virtual laboratory compared to learning solely from lectures. The virtual laboratory used in this study was a supplement to a computer network course and allowed students to perform experiments on real systems via remote access. The system measured pre-lecture, post-lecture, and post-lab retention knowledge. Students were ranked based on their performance on instructor-created assessments. Based on the answers submitted for each assessment, researchers were able to calculate possible or definite learning for labs and the level of learning. They then plotted the results in relation to the studentsâ€™ prior experience.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The researchers were able to label up to 27.7% of the assessment questions, 54.1% of lecture learning and 45.9% of lab learning as observed definite learning. The lab participation was considered almost as important to learning as lecture participation. In addition, based on the observation results, the biggest gains in learning were seen in students who had little or no formal experience in the subject prior to the class.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study found that virtual labs are a good and worthy activity in online and blended learning, especially for subject novices. From a research perspective, more could be done to study the implications of successful virtual lab learning. This particular study was directed at computer network learning, but virtual labs could also be used in the physical sciences and field studies. Virtual labs could decrease institutional costs for blended institutions and enhance learning in online environments.
