Commentto is a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome which allows users to save and comment on web content. Commentto has one primary feature that separates it from Instapaper and its ilk, the ability to read and write “time-coded” comments with others. No longer bound to comment neatly at the bottom of an article, Commentto users can slap their tag on anything, anywhere on the web. 

<b>Pros:</b>
Commentto is very elegant, a must in a sector with so many similar competitors. The creator of the site,  Kandarp Dave, has clearly though very carefully about what users want and do not want in a clip & save add on. The social policies are spot on, Dave is careful to note his intentions behind the subscriber/subscription model. An additional perk of the system is the blog-like profile page, users can unlock a vanity url with their username after they've made at least 30 excerpts over a 10-day period. 

<b>Cons:</b>
Choosing the right browser extension for saving content is a big commitment and users might not be easily tempted away from their old standby. Commentto has some very innovative features and solid design enough to persuade the uninitiated, but inertia and a current lack of mobile connectivity may prevent switchover from competitor sites. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Commentto is only as good as the people who use it. It seems like it could be a good tool for creating conversations around course readings and sharing notes and resources for group projects, but its usefulness depends on building a community. It could be a useful tool for an online learning community struggling with citations and conversations around assigned sources, but it would help if Commentto developed tools to target this market such as group subscribing or course hub profile pages. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Commentto is well-designed and has educational potential beyond its current structure.
