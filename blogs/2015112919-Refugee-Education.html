<p>The seemingly endless crisis in Syria has led to a massive refugee crisis. It has brought the plight of refugees firmly to the global conscience. There have been countless and disturbing images of refugees risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean in hopes of a better life in Europe. The need to find safe housing, access to healthcare, and basic social services are of immediate importance to refugees once they arrive in a new country. Often less discussed, but equally important, is the education (in some cases the re-education) of refugees.</p>
 
<p>Kiron University, a virtual university in Germany, is playing its part to help refugees start, or resume, their education. Germany is home to an estimated 500,000 refugees. Kiron’s platform is especially appealing to refugees as it does not require a lot of the paperwork an individual needs to enroll in regular German universities. All classes are freely available and students can enroll in any MOOCs offered from institutions such as Harvard and Stanford. Students enrolled in Kiron’s program can transfer to an in-person partner school that puts them on the path towards completing their degree.</p>
 
<p>How can we provide such educational opportunities for younger refugees? Join this important discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25261/">Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:17 Nantwi:</b> In some cases, refugees are often highly educated in their native lands or worked in a technical field. Their new homelands should offer them a chance to start or continue their previous education. However, things such as finding them homes, access to healthcare and learning a new language often trump educational plans for refugees.</p>

<p><b>@01:21 bizapp:</b> So I realized that the co-founder of Kiron is speaking German likewise Kirollos and Andrew. However Fatumata is speaking english. How is the language set up in this school? Do all the students speak English or are they divided in groups base on their fluent language? How this is work?</p>
