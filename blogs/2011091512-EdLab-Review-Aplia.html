<a href="http://aplia.com/">Aplia</a> is a website that integrates the class readings from a textbook with automated homework exercises.  I got a chance to mess around with it by taking night-classes at Baruch, and so far I have to say it's pretty impressive. 
<!--break-->
<b>Pros</b>:

The interface is intuitive and non-distracting.  The course assignments are neatly arranged by due-date, making it easy for the student to keep track of his or her responsibilities.  Although you still have to pay to rent the digital textbook, the price is at least substantially lower than actually buying a hard copy.  The homework is fairly simple and gives the student immediate feedback on performance, including explanations of where your thinking may have gone wrong. Animations and videos are included to help students develop an intuitive understanding of the concepts.  Aplia also lets the professor know through class-wide statistics which concepts students are having trouble with, so they can adjust their use of class-time accordingly.  

<b>Cons</b>:

One issue that comes up with these online learning programs is the temptation to “game” the system, by focusing more on advancement than real learning.  Of course, this is a problem with the old pen-and-paper model as well, but it's easier and more tempting to game a machine than a human grader.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>

My impression is that Aplia allows for fairly large efficiency gains in the teaching of introductory or basic classes.  For instance, the Microeconomics class in which I am enrolled has about 300 students, and I can only imagine the teacher-hours it would require for our professor and his T.A.'s to develop and grade homework assignments on their own.  Although I'm not sure that students will be learning any better because of the program, because of Aplia and programs like it we should be able to teach more people with less money, which is always good.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>: 

Aplia is a slick and well-designed program, and there's no doubt in my mind that in a few years most college and even high school courses will be using something like it to manage homework assignments.  We should be thinking about how we'll integrate current and future projects into homework and classroom managements programs of this kind.
