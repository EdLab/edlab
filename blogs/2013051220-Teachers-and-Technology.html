<b>Title:</b> How Teachers Are Using Technology at Home and in Their Classrooms
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Kristen Purcell, Alan Heaps, Judy Buchanan, & Linda Friedrich <p>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> Teachers today must integrate technology into their classrooms if they want to prepare students for the 21st century. A recent <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teachers-and-technology.aspx">study </a>sponsored by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project describes the degree to which teachers are engaging in and incorporating technology into their classrooms, and whether there are discrepancies in digital learning opportunities across classrooms. Over 2,400 middle and high school teachers were surveyed on their use of digital technology in their classrooms, and whether they felt their schools adequately supported educational technology. 
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
On a positive note, the vast majority of teachers felt that the internet has supported their teaching efforts by enhancing access to content, resources and materials. It has amplified their ability to share ideas with teachers and connect with parents. Technology also seems to be infiltrating classroom walls, as 73% of research participants said they and /or their students use mobiles phones to complete schoolwork. Digital tools were mostly used by students to conduct research online, and a good number of teachers assigned interactive digital learning activities, such as developing wikis and participating in online discussions. Perhaps this presence of digital technologies was related to school support. Over 63% of the participants felt that their school did a "good job" of supporting teachers’ efforts to incorporate digital technology into their classroom. 
<p>
Of significant concern, teachers reported "striking differences" in access to technology in affluent school districts compared to poorer ones. Only 21% of teachers working with high-income students versus 56% of those working with low -income students said that lack of resources among students was a "major challenge" when it came to accessing digital technologies. Teachers working in affluent school districts also reported higher levels of institutional support and access to formal training in educational technology.  
<p>

<b>Moving Forward:</b>
Understanding the degree to which teachers integrate digital technology into their classrooms offers insights into students’ access to online learning opportunities. The findings in this study suggest that students from different socioeconomic backgrounds experience unequal access to digital technologies. 

<p>
Adding another layer of complexity, the participants in this study were Advanced Placement (AP) and National Writing Project (NWP) teachers. They represent teachers who tend to work with high performing students, and who most likely have access to resources not readily available to the overall population of middle and high school teachers. It is likely that an even wider gap in access to digital technologies exists among middle and high school students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
