          <p>
            As I was waiting for my pizza last week at a local pizza joint, the owner, with whom I have become an acquaintance, was telling me about her middle-school-aged son. “He always wants to play video games,” she told me. “I try to get him to play with his friends, but he just wants to play video games all day!” 

I didn't ask, but I can't help but wonder if there is an after school chess program at her son's school. Would this - could this - make any difference in young students' social and intellectual lives? 

I don't have any empirical research supporting the opinion, but I believe it would. For example, check out the documentary “Brooklyn Castle” (www.brooklyncastle.com), an award-winning film that follows five students on the I.S. 318 chess team.  

To me, chess is an “anti-video game” and has the potential to play an important role in 21st-century American education because it facilitates creativity, analytical reasoning, and logic. 

And you don't have to stare at a screen to enjoy it.
