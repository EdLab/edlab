          <p>
            Anthony and Hui Soo have made some progess in recent days in making some necessary chnages to the Library's home page.  I would like to use this forum to solicit suggestions as to how we might undertake a larger, more comprehensive re-design.

Last night I had a chance to speak with some TC students and their reaction to the librray site was that the current design made it was difficult to find the catlogs and databases.  It also seemed that they did not understand our reasoning behind the "Content Collections".  They also had concerns about who was involved in picking content for the collections.

Lyn has suggested that we add a feature that highlights content by professor as opposed to by program.  This seems to be a good idea, but begs the question of whether or not we should hold off on such a feature until we unveil Social Scholar.

Keep in mind that the current design of the library's web site was an attempt to push the boundaries on what a librray is.  The new site emphasizes publishing and content production over the library's traditional role of cataloging.

My feeling is that once SS is in place it will no longer be necessary to feature "program collections" on the library site, because such "collections" will be part and parcel of the larger SS system.  Given that potential development, it may make sense to move back to a model whereby the library web site is all about featuring the search capabilities and databases, and less about featuring collections and publications.

Please let me know your thoughts.
