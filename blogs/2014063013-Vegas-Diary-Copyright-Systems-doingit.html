          <p>
            I'm just wrapping up my last day here in Vegas. I present in a little over an hour and the Ignite sessions have been really well attended! I'll try to tweet a pic from the podium :) Here's a report from my weekend:

<b>Saturday:</b>
In the morning I attended a session aimed at technical services leaders in academic libraries, the focus was primarily on developing cataloging standards in the age of web searching, but it was great to get a chance to discuss common issues and compare notes with the crowd. 

I then headed over to the conference center to give my Roomer talk. There were about 60 people there and I was one of nine short presentations. There was only time for four questions at the end, but three of them were about Roomer! 

After that I went to a session sponsored by Innovative Interfaces (our integrated library systems vendor) to hear about their upcoming product developments. Not too much to report here, they have recently merged with two other companies but nothing much should change for us on the front end. After that I attended a panel discussion on copyright developments that had an awesomely rowdy librarian audience. There was quite a bit of hissing. 

<b>Sunday:</b>
I was invited to a small OCLC discussion group in the morning and we talked very deeply about the directions of professional development for librarians. In the afternoon I attended a session sponsored by the Association for Collections and Technical Services and a very intriguing panel discussion about discovery services. A couple of the panelists had done some work analyzing Summon data and it gave me a lot of ideas! 

After my presentation today I'll probably stop by a session focusing on articles on demand and one about library data before heading out to the airport. Vegas was a lot of fun, but I'm excited to get back to work tomorrow! Miss you all!
