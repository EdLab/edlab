<p><b>Title:</b> A Comparison of Gains in Keypad Response Technology Classroom with other Pedagogies in Nigeria (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alaba Olaoluwakotans Agbatogun</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://editlib.org/p/39524/">Journal of Interactive Learning Research</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
Could the use of Keypad Response Technology improve outcomes in Nigerian ESL classrooms?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Teaching English as a second language is an important school subject in many parts of the world. In Nigeria, English is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria">official language</a> of education, government, and commerce. Mastery of English is extremely important for secondary schooling and job acquisition. Nigeria’s ESL system relies largely on lecture-style teaching and has recently experienced disappointing performances by students on national examinations of the West African Examination Council and the National Examination Council. The author sought to examine whether pedagogical changes could improve students’ English proficiency.</p>

<p>The author tested Keypad Response Technology (KRT) which is a battery-powered clicker technology that allows polling in the classroom and student engagement with teacher questions. Several studies indicate the effectiveness of KRT for active learning and classroom communication, and the ability to answer questions without public identification is an appealing way for students to engage with lecture content. KRT was enabled in testing classrooms to project student answers before showing the teacher-corrected answer, so students could discuss the responses with their peers. Then, a second voting round was administered so pupils could change their answers if necessary. The author designated two experimental groups, one to test KRT and the other testing a communication approach similar to KRT, but without the technology hardware. Pre- and post-tests were administered to control and experimental groups of primary students in selected disadvantaged schools in Ogun State, Nigeria.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Results revealed a 26.9 mean gain score for the KRT group, in contrast to the -4.08 score loss in the control group. Students with the lowest scores on the pre-test made the most dramatic improvements with KRT while high achieving students made more modest gains. Interestingly, there was not a significant difference in learning gains between the high and low performing students in the control group, suggesting that while KRT is helpful for many types of students, it maybe particularly effective for struggling students.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The author found compelling results with KRT methods, especially for low performing students, but also saw modest gains using a non-technology teaching method that involved question and answer communication. This suggests that while KRT may be the best choice for Nigerian schools, other teaching strategies that encourage active engagement may also help improve learning. Further research is needed to understand whether these results can be generalized to ESL classrooms in other countries and if student motivation and perceptions of the tool influence learning gains, but the overall results suggest that a move away from lecture-style teaching could be a beneficial strategy in Nigerian ESL classrooms.</p>
