            <a href="http://pubget.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/th_pubget_logo.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket" ></a>

<a href="http://pubget.com/">Pubget</a> is an external federated searching tool for publications in science and medicine. It aims to make searching and accessing scholarly articles quick, easy, and pretty. 

<b>Pros:</b> 
It generally accomplishes those goals. The user interface is friendly and intuitive and the one-click pdf viewing is very slick. Users can bypass Article Linker and the tedium of negotiating a potentially unfamiliar database. The service is also free for libraries and the application process seems quick and easy (Columbia is already subscribed). The customizable latest issues feed is also a nice feature and makes me wish there was a Pubget for library journals. 

<b>Cons:</b>
At present, Pubget focuses on journals in science and medicine. The founder of the site, <a href="http://corporate.pubget.com/about/who_we_are">Ramy Arnaout</a>, was a clinical pathologist who wanted an easier way to access and keep track of publications in the medical field and they have not branched too far from that mission. Their advanced search feature falls far behind that of many databases. There are few ways to refine a search after the fact so the user is forced to trash and try again or sift through potentially off-topic results. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
They have an interesting <a href="http://pubget.com/widgetizer/create">Wigitizer</a> function that will embed a feed of scholarly articles based on the search of your choice. I thought that this might be a good feature to add to mSchool courses. It updates constantly as new information is published and that might help ensure a stream of fresh content, even if the course creator is not updating frequently. 

I think there are also lessons here in the creation of a search structure for technologies like Ednode. It won't have to pack a PubMed-like punch, but results refining strategies might be a way to ensure that broad-level seekers find the information they want. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Pubget is streamlined and lovely, but isn't a search heavyweight.
