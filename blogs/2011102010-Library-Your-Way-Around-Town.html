            I celebrated National Museum Day (Sept. 24) at the <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/home.asp">Morgan Museum and Library</a> (224 Madison Avenue, Manhattan). I would highly recommend a visit:
<ul>
	<li>Happy Birthday, <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=48">Dickens</a>!   In honor of his 200th birthday, the Morgan has a special exhibition   that includes original manuscripts, illustrations, and personal letters,   as well as films and lectures throughout the upcoming months. To get a   feel for the magnitude of Dickens' fame in the mid-19th century is   completely astounding.</li>
	<li>Another current exhibition is <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=49">David, Delacroix, and Revolutionary France: Drawings from the Louvre</a>.   The studies that are included in this exhibition are quite incredible,   from a detailed battle of over a dozen men, each with realistically   unique facial features, to architectural studies, some even   demonstrating the challenges experienced by the artist. Apparently it's   pretty rare that the Louvre lets a collection this large and impressive   travel around, so definitely a neat thing to go see.</li>
	<li>Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?id=53">Lists:   To-dos, Illustrated Inventories, Collected Thoughts, and Other  Artists'  Enumerations from the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art</a> has  since closed, but still a very interesting concept for a  collection, and  therefore worth mentioning. My favorites included a  list for  self-improvement from an artist when he was in primary school  and a list  from an artist to his wife citing the reasons he loved her,  including an  ungrammatical last bullet that he parenthesized he knew was  ungrammatical.<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/10/eastroom.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12878" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/eastroom.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="233" /></a></li>
	<li>There  is also plenty to see in the ongoing collections, housed in Morgan's  recently restored East Room  (library), Rotunda, West Room (study), and  North Room. These rooms  include a Gutenberg Bible, a composition  written by Mozart at the <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=183">age of five</a>, an early collection of poems written by Sylvia Plath, a life mask of George Washington, and <a href="http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=198">Ancient Near Eastern Seals and Tablets</a>. The rooms are as enjoyable to see as the collections.</li>
</ul>
The  Morgan is not on our CU list of free museums,  however,  they do have free admission on Fridays from 7:00-9:00 PM.
