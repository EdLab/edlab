            <b>Knowing What Engineering and Technology Teachers Need to Know: An Analysis of Pre-Service Teachers Engineering Design Problems</b>

<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/2409775310456284/fulltext.html">Fantz, T., De Miranda, M., Siller, T., (2011). Knowing what engineering and technology teachers need to know: an analysis of pre-service teachers engineering design problems. <i>International Journal of Technology and Design Education</i>, 21, 307—320.</a>


<b>Description:</b> It is no question that the world is becoming more digitalized and technology is playing a bigger role in the future of civilization. And there needs to be more manpower behind all this growth. Which is why the American Society of Civil Engineers proposed engineering education reform in 2008 to help increase the quality and quantity of students choosing to pursue engineering — and this “pre-engineering” instruction would start as early as elementary school. So higher education schools have been developing teacher education programs specifically for this need, where the graduates would possess both an engineering degree and a technology-teaching license by the end. The purpose of this research article is to determine the differences between K-12 technology teachers from this program and traditionally trained K-12 technology teachers. 

<b>Findings:</b> 
Because design is a fundamental activity for most practicing engineers, the inclusion of engineering concepts into K-12 curriculum must include engineering design if it is going to stay true to the engineering profession. Therefore, the results of this research indicate that the training of technology teachers should be examined carefully to align with the desired outcomes to teach and become proficient in engineering design. If the objective is to include engineering into secondary education, engineering trained teachers may provide unique abilities for realizing this objective.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
I think this will be an interesting trend in secondary and teacher education reform. It'll be one way to bring to life sometimes abstract, difficult topics in math and science, and make it an exciting experience for students in the classroom. Also, I believe this will help engineering look appealing early on to students whom the field has traditionally failed to engage, including females and under-represented minorities. 

<b>I wonder what you engineers and techies think about this. Is it too much to pursue a full on engineering degree and a teaching licensure? Or is this right on track for the future of secondary technology education?</b>


P.S. Here's a <b><a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1960">Vialogue</a></b> about a technology education program called GitsSmart. It's a bit bizarre listening to young kids talking about optical fibers and motherboards.
