This paper is just published, and on my birthday, so I figure i read it. 

<b>Flagging</b> is a common mechanism for reporting offensive content in social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Vine, Flickr, YouTube, Instagram, and Foursquare, as well as in the comments sections on most blogs and news sites. It's used to filter, report abuse, individual expressions of concerns, etc. it may seem like a ubiquitous mechanism of governance, but there are no direct or uncomplicated representation of community sentiment on it yet. The paper discusses issues on <b>content regulation</b>, <b>user awareness on social platform</b>, controversial examples can become opportunities for substantive public debates, etc. The paper aims to bring more clarity to the range of functions of flags play in social media. It's pretty interesting for researchers to know & to think, especially those who plan on using "engineered features" to quantify community values with practical and rhetorical values.

Abstract:
The flag is now a common mechanism for reporting offensive content to an online platform, and is used widely across most popular social media sites. It serves both as a solution to the problem of curating massive collections of user-generated content and as a rhetorical justification for platform owners when they decide to remove content. Flags are becoming a ubiquitous mechanism of governanceâ€“yet their meaning is anything but straightforward. In practice, the interactions between users, flags, algorithms, content moderators, and platforms are complex and highly strategic. Significantly, flags are asked to bear a great deal of weight, arbitrating both the relationship between users and platforms, and the negotiation around contentious public issues. In this essay, we unpack the working of the flag, consider alternatives that give greater emphasis to public deliberation, and consider the implications for online public discourse of this now commonplace yet rarely studied sociotechnical mechanism.
