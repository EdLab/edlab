          <p>
            I've been in the process of helping folks in CIS "find the value" in the new college portal, which has been purchased from <a href="http://www.sungardhe.com/">SCT</a>, the makers of the administrative systems that manages everything from paychecks to class registration to tax returns (Banner).

One strategy that I think makes sense is to use it as a place where information can be given to students/faculty/staff that is somewhat personalized (since you have to login using your UNI).  Since we will be losing the Blackboard portal (which is not terribly personalized) with the rollout of the newest version next semester, the portal has the potential to do some of this (although it seems to be a long ways from that at the moment).  

To help with this process, I've put together a bunch feeds that give library information to people that may/could be pertinent to them.  These will be displayed on one of more tabs on the portal.  

You can tryout the feeds by substituting my UNI (ac2182) with your UNI.

Databases that you might be interested in (based on your department)
<a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/db_by_uni.php?pdsLoginId=ac2182">http://library.tc.columbia.edu/db_by_uni.php?pdsLoginId=ac2182</a>

PocketKnowledge resources that you might be interested in (based on your department):
<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/dept_feed.php?pdsLoginId=ac2182">http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/dept_feed.php?pdsLoginId=ac2182</a>

Items that you recently added to PocketKnowledge (and if you haven't added any, it will prompt you to start adding)
<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/rss_uni.php?pdsLoginId=ac2182">http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/rss_uni.php?pdsLoginId=ac2182</a>

Your e-Reserve readings for the current semester (from DocDel)
<a href="http://docdel.tc-library.org/rss.asp?pdsLoginId=ac2182">http://docdel.tc-library.org/rss.asp?pdsLoginId=ac2182</a>
(this feed is restricted to on-campus access since it has sensitive information in it, notably class enrollments)

The Library News and Today's Hours
<a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/news_feed.php">http://library.tc.columbia.edu/news_feed.php</a>
(this one is not really personalized but it has good stuff in it)

I think I will also press them to put the AfterEd player somewhere in the portal (I've asked them to sign-up on the Syndication page).

I will also press for the TC Record feed (http://www.tcrecord.org/rss.asp) as well as the new items in PocketKnowledge feed (http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/xml/86).  Neither of these are personalized but they should be very pertinent to people at TC.  

Let me know if there are things that you want me to ask that they add to the portal.  There should be a thing in there for free food (believe it or not, eventually emails sent to TC Community that are about "Free food" will be stripped from the email list and just put in the portal).  Because let's face it, aren't all ICTs just ways for you to find out how to get free food?
