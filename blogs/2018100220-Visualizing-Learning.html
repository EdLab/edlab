<p>Scientists and theorists disagree about the role aesthetic appeal plays in learning. Some advocate for minimizing attractive but irrelevant design elements in order to maximize students’ capacity to absorb and remember content. Others argue that appealing design fosters student engagement and can instill a positive attitude toward learning. Kei Tomita, a researcher at Indiana University Bloomington, designed a study to explore the correlation between appealing visual design and students’ self-reported motivation.<p>
 
<p>Tomita created two handouts for this study: one employed a minimalist design modeled on academic conventions, and the other incorporated visual elements Tomita designated as attractive based on current design trends seen on popular websites such as Netflix, Snapchat, and Instagram. The two handouts contained identical content, which Tomita adapted from a Microsoft Excel training guide. Tomita divided 30 undergraduate students into two equal groups, and both groups were asked to rate the attractiveness and motivating power of each handout. The only difference between the two groups was the order in which the handouts were received: one group saw and rated the minimalist handout before seeing the one with attractive design, and the other group received the attractive handout before the one with minimalist design.</p>
 
<p>The results of the study revealed no significant difference between the motivating power of the minimalist handout and the visually appealing handout. However, the group that was shown the appealing handout first rated its motivating power higher than the group that was initially presented with the minimalist handout. Interestingly, though, the group that saw the minimalist handout first rated the appealing handout as more attractive than the group that received the appealing handout before the minimalist one. These findings suggest that visual appeal does impact perception, but that there is not necessarily a direct correlation between attractiveness and motivating power.</p>

<p>Additionally, Tomita discovered that students’ motivation scores were influenced by the handout’s content in addition to its design. Open-ended responses revealed that some students found the material unmotivating because they were not interested in its subject matter. In future studies, Tomita will assess students with similar levels of interest in the displayed content in order to more accurately understand the influence of design on motivation. Educators can learn from this study that the effect design has on students is not straightforward, and can be influenced by many factors, including what students perceive before entering the classroom.</p>
