          <p>
            Yesterday I attended the Science & Humanities Discussion Panel Event held by the Columbia chapter of Scientists & Engineers for a Better Society. The panel consisted of Dean of Columbia College and Professor of Political Philosophy & Legal Theory Michele Moody-Adams, Professor of Chemistry James Valentini, Assistant Professor of Anthropology Severin Fowles, and Professor of Philosophy of Science Philip Kitcher. This all-star panel certainly made many interesting points on the interactions between the science and the humanities.

Here are my takeaways:

Dean Moody-Adams defended the element of Columbia's Core Curriculum known as the Science Core and claimed that we needed better translators so that those in the humanities could better understand the ideas of the scientific community.

Professor Valentini encouraged scientists and engineers to humanize science for the greater community. He also emphasized the need for application in science classes and the ability to make mistakes in the process of scientific exploration.
Asst. Professor Fowles outlined how the field of anthropology straddles the divide between science and humanities and was at the core of the Science Wars in the 1990s.

Professor Kitcher was very critical of how the Core Curriculum treated the sciences and the overall level of scientific literacy found in Western countries (not just the United States). 

In all of this, I have come to the conclusion that a core curriculum ought to emphasize both scientific literacy as well as the basic philosophy that outlines how and why science works. In order to achieve such a lofty goal, it might be best to teach scientific literacy through the history of science, especially given that said history is a relatively short one. Learning about the great physicists, chemists, mathematicians, and biologists could allow those not interested in the sciences to gain a literacy in the most scientifically valuable ideas. Otherwise, we run the risk of overemphasizing current applications of science in society (e.g. climate change, nuclear energy) without being prepared for future applications of science that we have no way of predicting.
