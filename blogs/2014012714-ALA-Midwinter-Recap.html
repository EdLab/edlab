This weekend I attended the ALA Midwinter conference in Philadelphia. It was pretty darn great just to meet and talk to all kinds of librarians. Here are the highlights from my experience:

<b>Unconference</b>:
The first session I attended was a participant-guided discussion group. I was in a group discussing embedded librarianship, but once the group formed it was clear that we all had different ideas about what that meant. The group was mostly (and most vocally) made up of academic librarians who generally felt that embedded librarianship did the most good in the classroom. After the academic librarians had finished complaining about Summon, the slowness of cloud hosted systems, faculty reluctance to request materials, and other various #academiclibrarianproblems, a few embedded public librarians started to emerge from the woodwork to tell interesting stories. 

One, a librarian from Pittsburgh, told of how she and a group of other librarians from her institution had opened a pop-up, honor system collection in a cheap storefront in a traditionally underserved neighborhood and their pilot program to bring children's programs to family visiting days at the local county jail. Another told of her teen patron-driven efforts to build libraries and promote women's literacy in Nicaragua. 

One of the recurring themes of the conversation was the slow pace of change. Many of the academic librarians that chimed in seemed to feel victimized by the organizational structures of their own libraries and powerless to make change or share their opinions on library-wide decisions. These structures seemed to lack channels of communication between departments. There were so many reference folks complaining of easy system adjustments! It made me very thankful for the lean and fleet structure of our library. 

<b>ProQuest Tech Series: Diving into E-book Usage; Assessing the Swell of Info</b>:
This was definitely my favorite session of the conference. Proquest recently acquired ebook providers Ebrary and EBL and are working with Michael Levine-Clark, The Associate Dean for Scholarly Communication and Collections Services at The University of Denver to get a big picture view of ebook usage. They have provided him with a huge dataset that includes usage stats from over 10,000 libraries, four years, and more than 750,000 unique book records. He has only just started looking at the data, but already had some interesting trends to report. 

He'll release a report with Proquest in March, and is researching the following questions:
<ul><li>Are higher quality books (he defines this by publisher) used more often and more deeply than lower quality books?</li>
<li>Are ebooks used differently by discipline?</li>
<li>Is there a way for us to know whether spending a lot of time on a book and turning many pages is equivalent to deep engagement?</li>
<li>What are best practices for measuring ebook use?</li></ul>

Most of the research he had already done was on general use and discipline-based use. He found that social science titles, including education, turned more pages, had longer sessions, and had more users than any other discipline. He found that technology titles had unusually low and shallow usage, though a content manager from Ebrary was at the talk and thought that this might be related to ebook providers emerging relationships with tech publishing companies and the quickly changing content of technology titles. Ebook providers are not quite up to speed with this discipline and perhaps need to rethink the traditional publishing cycle for this content. The slides for this presentation are <a href=”http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelLevineClark”>here.</a>

This is going to be an interesting study and is really (quite shamefully, considering how long we have been dealing with ebooks) the first of its kind. Unfortunately we really have no idea how people use actual physical books, so we can't make any calls about the different ways readers are interacting with digital books. 

<b>College and Research Libraries Interest Group</b>:
Brian Hughes and I also presented a session on the publishing efforts at Teachers College, which many of you saw at D&R. We had a great turnout and people were really on board with our products. We even had a few signups on the iPads we brought! I think that the magic feedback from the D&R session was the key to our success. EdLab is doing awesome things and people were way excited about it. One of the things that was floating around twitter on #alamw2014 was, “libraries used to be grocery stores. Now they need to be kitchens.” EdLab is a good example of a library that is really cooking and I was proud and thrilled to be able to talk about our scholarly production with a big community of librarians. 

<b>Other</b>:
I also attended several panels discussing electronic resource management like the Innovative Users Group Meeting and a few sessions of the Electronic Resources Management Interest Group. Many of the speakers on these panels were discussing their experiences with things we already use, like Sierra and Summon. Some highlights from these talks were Bob Persing discussing his experiences with the open source ILS OLE by Kuali, Beth Bernhardt's tips for moving to Worldshare by OCLC for both interlibrary loan and electronic purchase tracking, and Len Davidson's experiences building a room reservation system (albeit not as cool as Roomer) using Sierra DNA. 

The rest of my time at the conference was spent exploring my newfound ALA membership and trying to figure out where I fit into the organization. I visited several sessions of the New Members Round Table and talked to many librarians in the networking uncommons about their experiences serving on committees and boards in various ALA subgroups. I also met ALA president elect Courtney Young. 

I stopped by the exhibits and ran into former EdLab staffer <a href=”http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/2948”>Joanna Fu</a> at the ArtSTOR booth! I also attended a dinner with our OCLC representative Rob Favini, OCLC director of partner programs Irene Hoffman, OCLC director of marketing Jenny Johnson, and a handful of  librarians to talk about the future of interlibrary collaboration and the continuing and strange role of OCLC as a library organization/vendor. 

ALA Midwinter was a great conference! I got my librarian fix and so many new ideas.
