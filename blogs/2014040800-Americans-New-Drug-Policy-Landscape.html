          <p>
            It seems the time has come for the public to call a “truce” in the war on drugs. An increasingly amount of Americans are beginning to express positive views on prison sentences for non-violent drug crimes. <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/">According</a> to a 2012 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, approximately 24 million Americans, about 9.2% of the population, reported unlawful uses of drugs. These numbers have risen by .9% in the last ten years. Additionally, the number of individuals who reported using illegal substances increased from 5.8% in 2007 to 7.3% in 2012. 
<p>
I found some of the answers from respondents pretty shocking. For instance, about 69% said alcohol and 15% said marijuana were acceptable. Although many do support its legalization, 54% of Americans believe marijuana would lead to more underage usage. Others feel that it should be only legalized for medical reasons.
<p>
I don't think marijuana should be fully legalized. However in the interest of science, I do feel that if it is used for medical or study purposes rather than for recreational activities, it should be legalized. I share the sentiments of the article regarding underage usage of marijuana should it be legalized. Underage individuals are more inclined to try out new things when it is popular. I also do not feel that individuals should be treated harshly for what they have done. The debate about marijuana and drug sentencing laws hopefully leads to a national discourse (especially in our schools) about the perceived benefits and health risks of illegal substances.
