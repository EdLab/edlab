Sara Basson is an education changemaker who has dedicated her career to helping to make learning more open and accessible to the world’s population.  From her global work in <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/">IBM Research</a> on the Education Transformation Initiative, to work helping to make learning more personalized and developing new technologies to improve career pathways, learning innovation is at the core of Dr. Basson’s work.  She recently completed an assignment with IBM Research-India, where she developed "strategy, business, and user interface design issues for Spoken Web, a tool that created internet-like access for developing regions, using mobile phones and speech recognition."  Increasing access to educational opportunities and creating more adaptive learning tools has been a central theme in all of her many strategic roles and she has contributed over 50 published articles and pending patents to the fields of speech technology and accessibility. In 2011 she was granted the title of Master Inventor in IBM Research.  Dr. Basson holds an M.B.A. in Management and Marketing from the Stern School of Business, New York University, and a Ph.D. in Speech, Hearing, and Language Sciences from The Graduate Center of the City University of New York and an Honorary Doctorate degree from Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My personal educational track has been long and circuitous. I hold a BA in Classics, an MA in Applied Linguistics, a PhD in Speech, Hearing, and Language Sciences, and an MBA. I have had excellent, inspiring opportunities over my professional career, but I see many of them as fortunate accidents rather than the culmination of a well thought-through and guided plan. In my current work, which is technological solutions to address the problem of identifying and pursuing "career pathways," I hope that we can create solutions for students to know what they want, what they are good at, and what offers the most opportunity -  earlier than I did - and to provide students with the tools needed to achieve their goals.


<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have spent many years working in the area of speech technology, and my role has been primarily behavioral science, discovering and designing promising applications, and conducting experiments that assess their viability and ensure a positive user experience. I see the education arena as fertile ground to extend those skills, since there are so many stakeholders to evaluate.  We must consider the needs of the student, the teacher, the parents, and the administrators, and create solutions that provide clear benefit to all parties. Since I often straddle business and technology, my experiences evaluating the business outcomes of our solutions will be critical here … our success will be evaluated not only by the appeal of these systems, but also by measurable improvements in outcomes. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> We are at IBM Research, and so it is in our DNA to think big and bold. We think that the migration of educational materials and student behavior to digital means will open up new arenas to impact results. As we <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/machine-learning-applications/decision-support-education.shtml#fbid=v-MiUOa6LuX">understand more about the student and his/her learning style</a>, history, behaviors, and preferences, we will be able to customize the learning experience to fully accommodate that individual student. Class sizes might grow, but the student's experience will be more personalized and more tailored. As a result, I trust that we will graduate more students, with more passion about particular study areas, and more focus and direction towards applying these skills in professional arenas.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think that learning is impacted now by many trends. The migration from print to digital materials will create more concrete data about students and their experiences than anything we have seen in the past. We will know what the student reads and likes. <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/machine-learning-applications/decision-support-education.shtml#fbid=v-MiUOa6LuX">We will know areas where the student struggles</a>. We will have the ability to identify best matched learning materials based on the student's academic level in a particular area and their preferences. IBM Research has a long history of advances in machine learning and analyzing big data. (Indeed, the IBM Research speech technology community that I come from has used these techniques for decades.) It is a wonderful confluence of circumstances when 21st century technical advances in big data, machine learning, and analytics converge to address a major societal need like education.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Our team is currently working on creating personalized learning pathways that will identify the likelihood of a student's success. For students that are "at risk," we are identifying other students with similar profiles that were at risk at early ages too, but that nonetheless succeeded. We are studying the interventions or specific learning materials that helped these now successful students, and applying those interventions to students that are at risk. We are working on tools to provide deeper analysis of learning materials, so that interventions can be well-targeted for a specific student. (That is, don't just do more reading and problems in geometry; but rather, do focused reading on the topics we have identified as specific problem areas.) We are currently working with the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/42759.wss">Gwinnett County School District</a> to deliver these advanced technologies. My next big project will be to use some of these same techniques to improve a student's trajectory towards promising career pathways. I believe that these new technologies will bring enormous benefit to individual students, and to society as a whole.
