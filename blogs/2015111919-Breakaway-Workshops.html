<p>There is increased pressure on public schools to produce the next generation of innovators and leaders, and no one feels this pressure more than teachers. Some states have adopted stringent annual evaluations of teachers that are directly tied to student scores on standardized exams. This mode of "teaching to the test" has left many educators with little room to introduce new ideas or concepts in the classroom. As a result, professional development workshops and programs are designed to prepare educators for teaching to the test, and are possibly compounding present problems. </p>

<p>A unique program provides professional development opportunities that focus on creativity and new methods of teaching for educators. Breakaway Workshops invite educators from all backgrounds and subject areas to their offices in New York City where they engage in an intensive three-day workshop focusing on design thinking, creating prototypes, and collaboration. The goal is for educators to return to their classrooms with fresh ideas that will engage students and motivate them to think differently and creatively.</p>
 
<p>Is there a need to incorporate design thinking and collaboration into existing professional workshops for teachers? How can we encourage educators to teach beyond the test? Watch and discuss how Breakaway is changing the way educators think on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25061/">Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:11 abagigah:</b> Teachers, just like students, need to learn new approaches of teaching to enable them to enhance the learn experience.</p>

<p><b>@01:41 sanda.amani:</b> This workshop is going to be a valuable asset to teachers who want to elevate their refined teaching skills. Empowering young teachers and creating innovative ways to engage/inspire students will arouse their curiosities.</p>

<p><b>@01:56 Nantwi:</b> This seems a useful exercise for teachers. In essence, they are the students for the day: working collaboratively, highlighting challenges and finding solutions.</p>
