<p>As AI grows more advanced, engineers continue to test its limits in creative fields such as screenwriting and literature. Many people don’t believe that AI will ever surpass human capability in artistic pursuits. Others, such as Dr. Bjorn Schuller, do. Schuller, an associate professor of machine learning at Imperial College in London, thinks that because AI can house an infinitely greater dataset in their "minds" than humans, they will soon be able to generate more fresh artistic ideas, including new novels.</p>

<p>One of the main areas currently holding AI back from this pursuit is its ability to understand and portray human emotion. Although AI is already able to create <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/z43nke/joke-telling-robots-are-the-final-frontier-of-artificial-intelligence">jokes</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/17/googles-ai-write-poetry-stark-dramatic-vogons">poems</a>, and even a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/08/29/artificial-intelligence-is-writing-the-next-game-of-thrones-book/">Game of Thrones sequel</a>, it needs to understand more nuanced human feelings before consistently tackling great literary pursuits, which rely so much on emotion and language heavy with hidden meanings. Schuller thinks that while we are currently still better at crafting novels than AI, that will change within the next two decades. In the age of automation, we thought that creativity-based jobs like fiction writing were safe, but Schuller’s hypothesis begs the question: were we wrong?</p>

<p>Do you think AI will ever create art better than humans? What would the world be like if it could? Ponder these questions and pose your own <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/43995">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:45 Ryan Allen:</b> We've already seen autogenerated academic papers fool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism_Generator">journals</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIgen">conferences</a> with fake papers created by machines. Imagine how much better the technology will become in just 30 years. Also, look at some of the work being done in modern art. It's so subjective that the meaning comes from the interpretation alone. I've seen a plain white background with a small red square at the bottom in MoMA. You are telling me a computer couldn’t already do that?</p>

<p><b>@02:59 Dallas Milanovich:</b> I am a serious skeptic of the claim that AI could ever compete with humans in novel writing. I just don't believe you can program creativity. What are humans if not spontaneous and creative? A world where AI is more creative is one I don't believe is possible and definitely one I don't want to live in.</p>
