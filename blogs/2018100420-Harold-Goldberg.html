<p>Harold Goldberg is a writer of many talents on many topics, but he is particularly known for his writing on video games. He was one of the original video game reviewers for <I>Wired</i> and <I>Entertainment Weekly,</I> founded the New York Game Awards, and has written for countless publications about games, including <I>The Washington Post, The New York Times, NPR,</I> and <I>Playboy</I>. In 2011, he founded the <a href="https://nygamecritics.com/">New York Videogame Critics Circle</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to mentoring underprivileged high school students and older adults through games.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past experiences shape your current work with the New York Videogame Critics Circle? </b><br>
<p>As a journalist, I've been a good generalist for, well, longer than I care to think about. So, I've written about issues in education in the past for <I>The Village Voice</I> and elsewhere. In college, I read <I>Our Children Are Dying,</I> a book by Nat Hentoff about a social justice-conscious principal and the challenges of P.S. 119 in 1960s Harlem. That had a deep effect on me.</p>  
 
<p>When my book, <I>All Your Base Are Belong to Us (How 50 Years of Videogames Conquered Pop Culture),</I> became popular, I had a few offers to become a narrative designer for games or a movie script writer. I'm not against doing that at all, but I believed that forming a critics group that could eventually give back to those who are underserved in the New York City community was more important.</p> 

<p><b>What inspired you to work with the DreamYard Prep School and older adults?</b><br>
<p>Catharine Soros, a friend who's now our board secretary, suggested that I help students write college essays at a great school in the Bronx. I found the educators in this arts-oriented program taught an intelligent but underserved population in the country's poorest Congressional district. So I immediately wanted to help with our New York Videogame Critics Circle and eventually started a games journalism curriculum with educators there. We teach them journalism and how to write game narrative. We have famous game developers speak and we offer paid internships and scholarships, too.</p> 

<p>We work with older adults in Chelsea at the Senior Planet tech center because it's part of another underserved community. Older adults should not be left out of our tech booms.</p>
<p><b>What has been the most gratifying response from students involved in your project?</b><br>

<p>It's the great pride we see in students who are learning the craft of journalism. And when they make social justice game levels based in journalism, everyone from our critics to the educators to the students gets really excited. We'll bring the game levels to our New York Game Awards in January where the world's best game makers will meet these hard-working students.</p>
<p><b>What’s a project you’d like to embark upon in the future, or a new one currently in the works for you?</b><br>
<p>We want to expand to other schools and cities. As students leave the DreamYard, they'll create Critics Circles in their colleges. We feel we have created an engaging education template that can easily be used at other high schools and universities. Next year at the DreamYard, we'll merge journalism, poetry, and game level making for our scholarship contest. We'll have a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet help to judge the students' work.</p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the biggest impact on gaming and game design in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I see narrative becoming more nuanced, and that's important for consumers and critics alike. Esports will only become bigger, so I hope to see more compelling games that fit seamlessly into the genre. Artificial intelligence will allow players to feel more inside games because the experience will feel more real.</p>
<p><b>If you could create a video game that was a metaphoric representation of your life (now, in its entirety, or otherwise), what would it be like?</b><br>
<p>If it were about my life, it would focus on the intelligent critics I work with and the people in the communities we serve. I'd imagine a <I>Persona</I>-like game about a class of bright but underserved teen students. We'd learn about their struggles and those of their families. Immigration struggles. Poverty struggles. Single mother struggles. Bullying struggles. Racism struggles. All of those things. Finally, we'd learn about how education and caring mentoring can help to overcome these challenges.</p>  <p><i>Image:</i> Photo by Nancy J. Parisi</p>
