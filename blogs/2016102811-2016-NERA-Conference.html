          <p>
            Yesterday, Zhou and I gave a talk titled "Bayesian Inference of the Hyperbolic Cosine Unfolding Model" at the  <a href="http://www.nera-education.org/annual_conference.php">2016 NERA conference </a>. The research is on the Bayesian extension of the unfolding model. The model can be applied to examine rater accuracy. The Bayesian extension augmented the model when the data is sparse. In other words, we can incorporate previous knowledges about raters or items into the model.

On Wednesday morning, We took the Metro-North rail's New Haven line, which is Chingfu's daily commuting route, to Bridgeport, CT. The conference was hosted at the next town - Trumbull, CT. 

The sessions started on Wednesday afternoon. We attended separate sessions. Zhou's interests are mainly in the application of technology in education while I'm more interested in recent developments in quantitative methods and psychometrics. The sessions usually have 3-4 talks in each. At the end of the presentation, a discussant who previously read the papers would give some feedback and thoughts on the papers and talks. Question and discussion time were also allocated in each session.

After dinner, <a href="http://scholar.gse.upenn.edu/supovitz"> Jonathan Supovitz </a>, a professor at Penn GSE, gave his keynote speech on a theory of general public and policy maker's perception of academic research. Interestingly, Supovitz worked closely with Susan Fuhrman - the president of the college, when she was dean of Penn GSE. 

Our session was on Thursday morning. A chair, a discussant, three presenters, and about ten audiences showed up for the session. Besides our talk, <a href="https://www.coe.arizona.edu/monica-k-erbacher"> Monica Erbacher </a> - an assistant professor at University of Arizona, and Frank Padellaro - a doctoral student at UMass also presented their papers. Erbacher's research is a simulation study that compares different methods for detecting group mean difference under small sample size. Padellaro's research is on <a ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_item_functioning"> Differential Item Functioning </a>. The discussant - <a href="http://www.psyc.jmu.edu/gradpsyc/people/horst.html"> Jeanne Horst </a> gave her feedback at the end of the session. Our research was well-received. Quoting the discussant, "it was super clear". 

After the presentation, we attended a couple sessions and then headed back to the city. I attached the paper and the presentation slides in case you are interested.
