<p><a href="http://www.activelylearn.com/">Actively Learn</a> is a text layering tool that aims to improve retention and reading comprehension. Instructors can add media, comments, and questions to the text to grab readers’ attention and assess their understanding. The site also lets students interact with one another and respond to peer questions while they do the reading. Actively Learn can be used on web or mobile, so it will work well for BYOD classrooms. The system includes a thick assessment layer that connects reading progress to the Common Core Standards.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The reading interface is comfortably busy, with lots of interlocking media elements. The comments are well organized, with a style that will be familiar to social media savvy students. Actively Learn makes traditional reading as distracting as reading on the internet, which may be a welcome development for modern high school readers. <a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/216913504?accountid=10226">Research</a> suggests that readers who do most of their reading online skim for relevant information before investing in deeper scrutiny. The platform’s rich digital experience, replete with video, images, media connections, and questions, may actually help born-digital readers connect with traditional literature by drawing attention to relevant passages.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The system falls into one of the common traps of e-learning: too much information. Actively Learn exponentially increases the content and text included in assigned readings with the assumption that students will skim for relevant information. A filtering or upvoting system might help ensure that students read the most helpful comments first.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Bringing social and media elements into reading is a controversial step and it does not seem like it will appeal to all readers. Students used to collaborative work on the web may benefit from applying this strategy in reading, especially with challenging texts. Actively Learn changes the purpose of classroom reading from an individual thinking exercise to a social one. Reading and synthesizing thoughts into a web-ready comment and engaging with peers around online content are important skills for digital thinkers, but this strategy seems most reasonable to teach in conjunction with traditional literacy methods.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Actively Learn is the Facebook of reading.</p>
