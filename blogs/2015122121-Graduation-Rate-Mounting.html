          <p>
            There seems to be a never-ending chorus that our public schools, especially those in low socioeconomic neighborhoods, are always in dismay. Critics point to student test scores, teacher retention and a host of other issues as examples that our public schools are failing. One barometer often uses to gauge a schoolâ€™s progress is high school graduation rates. For instance, in 2009, the   <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/16/us/graduation-rates-reach-a-high.html?ref=education&_r=0">high school graduation rate</a> was 60.4 percent in New York City. This became an important policy issue for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who wanted to see an increase in graduation rates before he left office. As a result, Bloomberg highlighted certain areas and policies such as better teacher recruitment, closing troubled schools and adding choice programs, to boost achievement.
 
Across the nation, high school graduation rates have been drastically increasing over the past five years. New studies show that the graduation rate is at its highest ever. During the 2013-14 academic year, 82 percent of students who started as freshmen graduated within four years. 
 
What are other strategies that can ensure we keep raising the high school graduation rate?
