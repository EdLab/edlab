          <p>
            Crowd review is the new peer review. <a href="http://pressforward.org/">PressForward</a>, drummed up by the people of <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and <a href="http://omeka.org/">Omeka</a> and through the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University, aims to break the mold of academic publishing with a democratic approach to scholarly publication. 

<b>Description:</b>
PressForward is a model for a journal that will fold in the academic discourse of the informal web and use the online scholarly community to replace the peer review process. Articles are pulled from known twitter feeds and blogs in the field. The conversation surrounding scholarship on the website will lead to revision and clout for the strongest voices. The most talked-about articles will be published in a quarterly journal. 

<b>Pros:</b> 
It <a href="http://pressforward.org/who-we-are/">seems</a> well-funded and is supported by a pretty exciting mix of scholars and journalists. It is also going to be free. Institutions will be able to use PressForward's model to create their own publications. The one journal they have up, <i><a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/">Digital Humanities Now</a></i>, is quite diverting but doesn't yet utilize the fully-automatic editorial process they hope to achieve with future publications. 

<b>Cons:</b> 
The <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/blogs-elbow-up-to-journal-status-in-new-academic-publishing-venture/31878">article</a> about PressForward in the Chronicle of Higher Education mentioned that they were considering print for the quarterly best-of journal. They do seem to want to emphasize the tradition from which their methods are developing, but that seems a step too far. Their desire to incorporate orphan works in these publications seems a little problematic. PressForward is still quite new; there's currently only one journal running, though four others are in process. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
This project is also concerned with academic publishing and its inability to capture the complexity of scholarly discourse on the web. It's clearly more worried about traditional indicators than Pressible, but it is trying to shake up the creator/consumer relationship in a similar way. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
PressForward is an interesting riff on the publishing process. It's hard to tell at this point how well it will work and what sources it will drudge up, but I'll be keeping an eye on it.
