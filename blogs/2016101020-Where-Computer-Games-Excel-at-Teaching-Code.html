<p>Learning how to program can feel like an impossible task for new students, who are often intimidated by the strange language of computer code. Game-based learning presents itself as a fun, pain-free way to introduce programming concepts, but do video games actually create better coders?</p>
 
<p>Researchers in this study explored this question by mapping game-based instruction onto a traditional teacher-directed coding unit. Adult students from two cohorts of a computing certification course were introduced to Light Bot 2.0, an educational game in which players control a robot using increasingly complex coding concepts. The two cohorts were given the game at different times in their coding unit; one group played the game at the start of the unit, and the other at the end just before their final exam. Students were asked to play the game in sequential order, and were then interviewed and given an online survey about their experiences. Researchers also compared the test results of study participants with course averages. </p>
 
<p>Despite high student approval, the addition of game-based instruction did not lead to any significant improvement in test scores or certificate completion rates when compared with course averages. Still, researchers found that students had overwhelmingly favorable opinions of game-based learning, reporting that the experience was fun and motivating. Some students also used screenshots and vocabulary from Light Bot 2.0 in their final class presentations, suggesting that it gave them a useful framework for talking about new concepts. There is no evidence that study participants learned more than their uninitiated peers, but students in both cohorts felt that the game was an effective and helpful way to learn. </p>
