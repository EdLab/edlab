            Several members on the Design team (Patrick, Gonzalo) and Research team (Joann, George, Stephen, Hui Soo and myself) at the EdLab have been working on our latest website project, Let Freedom Swing, a mini-documentary series about conversations on jazz and democracy. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and famous jazz musician Wynton Marsalis are featured in three 5-6 minute mini-documentaries that explore the concepts and practices of jazz and American democracy. These videos are produced by the Documentary Group, and a curriculum team from Teachers College Social Studies program led by Professor Crocco will develop educational materials to accompany these videos. 

What is it that connects these two great American concepts? I think the following quotes in <a href="http://www.nea.gov/about/NEARTS/storyNew.php?id=06-thepulse&amp;issue=2009_v4">Nat Hentoff's article</a> well illustrate the point:

"One of the beautiful things about jazz improvisation, is that you can take something that we all know, and you can make it into another piece–but it still keeps its identity. It's how the Constitution can be amended, and it's still the Constitution, but here's our take on it. That means it's always new–because the ideas [in its foundation] are valid, they're timeless." (Wynton Marsalis)

"Do you realize that what we do is what the Constitution is all about? In jazz, each of us has individual voices, but we must listen attentively to one another as we play–and out of this whole, comes what we call jazz." (Max Roach)

For now, you can check out these videos in Critter. If you see a beautiful poster featuring Sandra Day O'Connor and Wynton Marsalis around the lab, its our latest website mockup from the Design team.
