            <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01081.x/pdf">Emerson, L. and MacKay, B. (2011), A comparison between paper-based and online learning in higher education. British Journal of Educational Technology, 42: 727â€”735. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01081.x</a>

Researchers at Massey University have a paper that should throw some amount of water on the 'blended learning' craze. Lisa Emerson and Bruce MacKay have published their research in the latest issue of The British Journal of Educational Technology.

<b>Description:</b> Emerson and MacKay were chiefly in clarifying much of the mixed results from past studies on online v. traditional learning. While past studies often were muddied by the modes of learning involved in the course material taught, Emerson and MacKay go to great lengths to control external variables and focus purely on the difference in delivery. 

<b>Method:</b> Emerson and MacKay developed a set of lessons on apostrophe usage that focused on contractions, simple possession, and exceptional possession. Students would go over each topic in sets of small lessons, taking a formative test after each lesson. After each formative test, students were given the choice of repeating the same lesson or moving on to a different lesson. Following the completion of all lessons, the students were given a summative test of 25 questions that were the basis for measuring mastery of the topics. They then surveyed each group of students using a Likert scale and specific assessment for workload stress using a NASA-TLX workload index. 

<b>Results:</b> The results of the summative assessment showed that measures workload and confidence were statistically the same for the pre-test and post-test surveys as well as the levels of stress as measured by the NASA-TLX. However, the results of the summative assessment showed a significant difference in the level of mastery, with those who learned traditionally outperforming those who learned online. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> The point of this study is not to say that online learning is better than traditional learning or traditional learning is better than online learning. The point is that the benefits of 'blended learning' are probably less than the higher price universities and business schools are charging. This study certainly doesn't imply no role for online learning, but the limitations for online learning should be known. Going forward, it is important to keep in mind that blended and online learning are probably better suited for learning non-traditional subjects (or as a <i>cheaper</i> alternative to traditional education). It should also be noted that there may still exist positive synergies between online and traditional learning, but we must be more careful in identifying the positives in online learning.
