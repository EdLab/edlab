<p>Among all the language learning messaging apps catching steam lately, <a href="https://www.tandem.net">Tandem</a> is one not to miss. Similar to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4488/a-multilingual-platform-for-language-and-culture-exchange">HelloTalk</a>, Tandem helps users learn different languages by allowing them to converse with native speakers. In addition, you can teach and talk in your own native language with others who want to learn it.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Tandem is like a social media app for language learning, where your entire profile is geared toward conversing with others. Fill out your favorite hobbies, interests, and topics of conversation, then find others who might have similarities. Each profile has a user’s native language and the language they want to learn, so you can easily find people to exchange with. Also, Tandem has over 2 million members currently, and many people are consistently active on the platform.</p>
 
<p>While the social media component is similar to other language learning platforms, what Tandem does better than these other apps is to offer one-on-one conversation sessions with certified tutors. These video call lessons are reasonably priced, with most tutors charging $15 per hour. I had a lesson with a French tutor named Genevieve and was surprised at how well the session went; sometimes tutoring services are lackluster due to lenient hiring processes or clunky platforms. Yet Genevieve was a natural teacher, and I feel like my French improved just within our 40-minute lesson. To me, this aspect of the app, more than any other, made me feel more connected to the Tandem community.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Tandem is perfect for extraverts, but more reserved learners might find it difficult to start a conversation with others, let alone a video call. While the app tries to get the conversation started by encouraging users to post an introductory question to their profile, it could do this even better by providing a bank of conversational topics and questions that users can paste into direct messages. In addition, while conversing, people often didn’t want to correct the grammar of their chatting partner. While Tandem does have a feature that allows conversation partners to correct each other's grammar, it currently takes some digging to find, and unfortunately no one that I chatted with used it. Making this option more apparent would definitely boost how much it's used.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I really enjoyed using Tandem and feel like my French improved from just a few day foray on the platform. The app felt more like a social media community than other similar language learning apps I’ve tried, mostly because the interface was aesthetically pleasing and it seemed like people were more interested in actually learning different languages rather than just perusing profiles. Finally, the one-on-one tutoring sessions put Tandem over the top in my book and improved my French more than any other feature of the app.</p>
