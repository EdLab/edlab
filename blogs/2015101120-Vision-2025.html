<p>There is a constant argument from government officials and industry leaders about a dearth of skilled workers in today’s labor market. The talent is simply not meeting the demand. This has challenged public education systems across the country to rethink their mission and goals for students. If one of the goals of public education is to prepare students for the labor market, then our public schools have to align those goals with the proper curriculum. San Francisco’s education system is taking the lead on reimagining public education with an ambitious 10-year initiative dubbed Vision 2025.</p>

<p>Though it is one of the highest achieving urban school systems in California, San Francisco public schools also have one of the largest achievement gaps in the state. One of Vision 2025’s primary aims is to close this achievement gap by motivating and preparing students for jobs within their own communities. As the tech capital of the world, San Francisco is strategically placed to partner with major companies such as Google and Facebook to provide educational and employment opportunities for students. The curriculum for Vision 2025 will be built around generating student interest in coding, design, and other technologies.</p>
 
<p>Can other public school systems across the country adopt a similar strategy? Join the discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23501/">Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:39 lassinebamba:</b> I believe this is showing how technology and education are related to each other and how they can both be incorporated with activities that go on in the community.</p>

<p><b>@04:16 yaotse:</b> Technological advances must be incorporated in every aspect of education so children can be familiar the new innovations and inventions that continue dominate the society.</p>

<p><b>@06:07 idrissa10:</b> San Francisco having a diverse community helps to push the vision for education in 2025 forward. People could use their backgrounds to share their voices on how the educational system should be run. The students and community could benefit from this form of diffuse knowledge.</p>
