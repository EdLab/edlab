<span style="color: #000000">Despite  technology’s presence in virtually every public school, its documented  familiarity and use by youth outside of school, and the wealth of  resources it provides for teaching social studies, there has been  relatively little empirical research on its effectiveness for the  teaching and learning of social studies. In an effort to begin to fill  this gap in research literature, this book focuses on research on  technology in social studies education. The objectives of this volume  are threefold: to describe research frameworks, provide examples of  empirical research, and chart a course for future research endeavors.  Accordingly, the volume is divided into three overarching sections:  research constructs and contexts, research reports, and research  reviews.</span>

The book is divided into four  sections. The first section of the book includes three descriptions of  research constructs and contexts in social studies and technology. The  second section is focused on research reports from studies of student  learning in social studies with technology. The third section contains  research reports on teachers’ pedagogical considerations for using  technology in social studies. In the fourth and final section, we  present work that broadly reviews and critiques research in focused  areas of social studies and technology. This volume contains twelve  chapters, each of which focuses on social studies content and pedagogy  and how the field is affected and enhanced with technology. The volume  includes research and theoretical works on various topics, including  digital history, digital video, geography, technology use in the K-12  social studies classroom, and artificial intelligence.

<span style="color: #000000"><strong>Adam Friedman</strong> is an associate professor of Social Studies        Education at Wake Forest University, and was formerly a high school social        studies teacher. His research interests focus on the factors that encourage        and barriers that impede integration of technology into the K-12 social        studies environment as well as teacher education.</span><span style="color: #000000"> A particular interest of his is how K-12 social        studies teachers use technology, particularly digital history resources.        Among his current research projects include:</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> * The use of mobile technology in social studies        education,
* The use of Web 2.0 tools in social studies and citizenship education,
* A North Carolina-wide survey that studies how social studies teachers        utilize the Internet,
* The impact of Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs)        on citizenship education,
* A longitudinal study of technology use among College and University Faculty        Assembly (CUFA) members.</span>
