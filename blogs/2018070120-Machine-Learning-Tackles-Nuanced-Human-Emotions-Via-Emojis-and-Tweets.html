<p>We often think of AI as totally emotionless and rational, running purely on logic and reason, but researchers at MIT insist that in order to function in the world, AI needs to understand human emotion as well. This is particularly true when communicating. How can an AI truly understand the meaning of what a human is saying if it doesn’t understand emotional nuance? (Answer: it can’t.) So the research team at MIT created a machine learning system that teaches AI how to read human emotion via the most common text-to-emotion expressions today: emojis.</p>

<p>The team fed the AI system, called <a href="https://deepmoji.mit.edu">DeepMoji</a>, over 55 billion tweets with emojis so that the machine could associate specific words and phrases with a series of different emotions. Instead of a one-to-one correspondence between word and emoji, DeepMoji is able to learn a range of possible combinations, as well as nuanced emotional sentiments such as irony and sarcasm. Anyone can contribute to this research by giving DeepMoji access to their Twitter and recording how they felt at the time they wrote each tweet. The more data collected, the better DeepMoji will be at reading the emotions behind sentences. The team calls DeepMoji’s software Artificial Emotional Intelligence, and they expect it to play an important role in future AI-human interactions.</p>

<p>If it’s successful, how could artificial emotional intelligence change the way we interact with robots? Do you think it could influence new AI assistants, such as Google’s Duplex? Do you think that emojis provide sufficient insight into how we use language to express emotions?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:43 Ryan Allen:</b> It's interesting because emojis harken back to a more ancient form of human communication, akin to hieroglyphics. So in a sense, the adaption of emojis is kind of a rejection of modernity. I think this research will give us insight into why we like to sink back down into a more natural form of communication.</p>

<p><b>@01:12 Monica Brown:</b> Machines might get better at recognizing emotions, but I don’t think they’ll ever be able to understand them. More than anything, I think this shows how good machines are getting at understanding language.</p>
