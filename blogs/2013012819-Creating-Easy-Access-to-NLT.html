            One of the most frequent mistakes in UX that I've noticed: we so easily assume that people just know, because... we know. This quickly falling into assumption is especially common within the technology world. Everyday,Â something new or some advancement in our knowledgeÂ takes place,Â and of course, someone gets to know something earlier than when others might acquire that same knowledge. Quickly we forget that it's new information, and before long, we're acting as if everyone else also knows. As a designer, I always try keeping this mind.

Last week, I had a moment like this at our NLT launch party. Someone asked me how to install the NLT icon on their smartphone, so they didn't have to type the address each time. I had assumed that tidbit of knowledgeÂ was already very common, but quickly realized it wasn't, not with everybody.

As many know, our NLT app is built in HTML5, not in the native iOS or Android app languages, so we are free from having to be in an app store. People just need our Web address, which they can open in their browser: www.newlearningtimes.com. That's it! They're in for their daily dose of innovation in education.

But, after their first visit, we'd like them to come back in an easier way. We don't want to make them type the address each time, so the simple solution is the built-in one of 'adding the page to the home screen.'

NLT hasn't had a visual guide for first-time users that would walk them through the steps of adding the NLT icon to their smartphones. Solution: a simple slideshow to visually explain the process. Please take a look, learn (in case you're new to this function) and share with everyone you meet while promoting NLT.

This first guide is for iPhone, with the Android version coming soon!
