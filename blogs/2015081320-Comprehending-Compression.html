<p>This study wanted to uncover students’ preferences for narration speed when listening to audio for learning. Students listened to audio both with and without visuals at the compressed speeds of: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% and then for each speed responded to the researchers’ questions about what speeds they preferred when listening to a lecture.</p>

<p>As asynchronous online learning has become more popular, the topic of time-compressed audio has come to the forefront. Busy people want to have the ability to experience more content in a shorter period of time. This study’s 92 participants were undergraduate education majors taking instructional technology classes during 2011 and 2012. The audio used was pre-selected by the researchers. It discussed the functions of the human heart in 2,000 words, and 19 drawings accompanied the narration for the visuals condition. Participants listened to the audio with headphones and answered the questions for each of the compression speeds in an online survey form. </p>

<p>The results revealed that students preferred audio with visuals and 0% to 10% compression rates. After about 20% compression, the information that students could retain significantly decreased. Previous research on this topic yielded similar results, with information retention significantly decreasing after 25% compression. </p>

<p>For teachers who have concerns about loss of content quality due to audio compression, this study’s results should reassure them that a 10% compression rate is time saving, preferred by students, and unlikely to result in a loss of comprehension. That said, video-hosting platforms aimed at education should give students control of compression speeds as an accommodation, including the option to slow the audio. Future research should focus on compression in other formats such as animation or video and compare these findings with finding from studies like this on audio compression. Future research might also highlight long form audio content, which students may be likely to compress, to examine the implications for comprehension.</p>
