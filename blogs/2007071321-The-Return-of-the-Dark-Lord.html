          <p>
            As I was reading the morning <i>Metro Newspaper</i>, (the free ones they hand out before your morning commute to work) I stumbled across the entertainment section with the latest Harry Potter <a href= http://movies.about.com/od/harrypotter5/fr/harrypott071007.htm>Movie review.</a> I am sure you are all familiar with it; Harry Potter has been “what's hot” for a few years now. The last book of this series was scheduled to be open to the public on July 21st. Its fifth series <a href=http://www.harrypotterorderofthephoenix.com/ >“Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix”</a> debuted in theatres only a few days ago (July 11, 2007). I'm sure most of you who are reading this blog are over the age of say, eighteen. However I can't deny my secret obsession with the series of the young wizard boy. A little childish I know, but I can't help myself; ever since the first book appeared on shelves and one of my friends introduced me to the book, I've been surfing the web (much like the younger generations now) and have been reading alternate endings to these series that the fans themselves have published. So as a devout fan I decided to go with <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/250>two</a> <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/258> friends</a> to see the box office release.
<P>
Excitement, adventure and a few unrequited love scenes are what add to the raving reviews of the tale of this young wizard. The new release of the Order of the Phoenix has led to much publicity, even more so then ever before. Unlike the first four films, which have been adapted by screen writer Steve Kloves, the Order of the Phoenix requires prior knowledge of the series history. While the first few films were intended to fill in the gaps for the newbie viewers, this film will require you to take a trip to Blockbuster before heading to the theatres. Because of the growing maturity of the young <a href= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373889/fullcredits>actresses and actors</a>, this film too will reflect a new level of maturity. 
<P>
David Yates the director, who will also be directing the next film The Half-Blood Prince, takes children's stories to another level. Much like the later writings of JK Rowling on Harry Potter, the film portrayed magic in a dreary, dark and chilling light. Yates is a true visionary! I was most impressed with how he captured the spirit and nature of the book and its characters. 
<P>
The film, while shorter then the others and omitting scenes in the novel, was an opening HIT. The special effects were amazingly accurate to a reader's mind, and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) delivered a superb performance. Although the roles of <a href=http://www.emmawatson-fans.com/>Hermoine</a> and <a href=http://www.rupertgrint.net/>Ron</a> were downplayed more then they should have been, fans didn't seem to mind too much. The seat gripping action scenes only fueled the audience to cheer and root for the all out battle of good versus evil. 
<P>
This movie was definitely worth the hassle of going on the E train during rush hour, and the hassle of trotting through a rainstorm with no umbrella and a pair of flip flops! So whether you are a fan of the world of magic and wizardry or not, this movie will make you want to cry, laugh, root and leave you wanting more… Lucky for you, all your questions about the fate of the wizarding world will come to an end with the release of <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>.
