          <p>
            In working with the awesomely awesome AfterEd.tv staff over the past month or so, I have come to two main conclusions: One, that the Edlab internship is far too great for its own good and, two, that I am actively searching for ways to make it <i>better</i>.

If there is anything that I enjoy more than sitting in front of a computer all day, it's tinkering with things that don't involve a computer at all.  I am appealing to the functional word of lab, as it is present in the title of our location/organisation. 

In doing a quick 'define' search via google on the word 'lab' I found a neat, concise defintion that somewhat contextualizes the point I am trying to make here. 

The NETnet Distance Learning College defines 'lab' as "A classroom where practical learning and demonstration take place in science, language, and other subjects."

Now, with the EdLab as it stands now, there is no question that that kind of learning in demonstration does indeed take place. I have leaned a heck of a lot in my time here.  At the same time, however, I have, over the last few weeks noticed an unfortunate steadfast attachment to protocol and routine. Producers get locked into production cycles (and their computer screens) and are driven ostensibly by just getting things done in time for Fridays. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum.  That is not to say that the final products have not been engaging and impressive. The work that everyone does here has never ceased to amaze me, and I admit that, after watching this weeks releases, I was a bit hesitant to question Edlab at all. But part of me feels that something might come of these thoughts, so I've decided to share them.

Rather than trailblazing and thinking up experimental new uses for all of the technology we possess, we are locked into a cycle of recording and editing that, thought not inherently damaging, is certainly a derivation from the image that I had of Edlab when I applied to work here.Perhaps, for the sake of clarity, I should elaborate on what that image was. I saw a room, not unlike the current space, with people on computers. Where this image derived from reality came in the form the atmosphere. My image of the Edlab was a room full of various forms of technology, from video game consoles, to new and interesting input devices. I saw people taking these devices, tinkering with and studying them in an attempt to find novel uses for them. This was the "demonstration" aspect of the definition of lab that I posted above.  I saw opportunities for me to finally recreate things like Johnny Lee's WiiRemote smartboard. When I saw things like LevelUp! I was gripped with unbridled excitement. Here were people, I thought, who were on the same wavelength as me, people who looked at video games and technology in the academic and creative framework that they were capable of being. I had the chance to work with people who weren't just creating videos about people doing new and interesting things - these were people who rolled up their sleeves and did the amazing work themselves. It was an environment that prized creativity and experimentation over deadlines and questions of audience. 

Of course, I recognized the pitfalls present in that type of environment. It certainly has the potential of breeding a great deal of sloth. Moreover, every experiment needs a goal and one of the challenges in my envisioned Edlab environment was answering the questions of purpose and execution. 

The word 'lab' implies experimentation. The word experimentation implies trying new things and envisioning new uses for established customs and procedures. Experimentation is about figuring out the challenge of novelty, answering the question of why a method or thought process should exist.  

I am the first to admit that the obvious flaw in my logic is that I am muddling my image of with the Edlab is with what my impression of it was prior to getting here. Still, my impression of Edlab was grounded in its mission statement, which says:

"The mission of Edlab is to engage in conceptual development, demonstration projects, and new educational research to explore and document diverse possibilities for the future of education."

Though mission statements are often painfully vague, as is what actually constitutes "engaging," it is obvious from the above sentence that the lab was meant to provide a slightly more extended range of projects than what I have seen since getting here.

I am curious as to what people think. Am completely off the mark? Is there anything to what I'm saying or should I just pop two blue pills and see the reality doctor in the morning?
