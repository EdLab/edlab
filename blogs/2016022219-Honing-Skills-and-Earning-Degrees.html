<p>Although plenty of <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/02/02/465239105/what-is-the-value-of-an-education-in-the-humanities">education discussions</a> focus on the "four-year liberal arts track" that colleges often provide students, this traditional post-secondary framework is not always the right fit for students, and more colleges are changing the type of educational options they have available to their students.</p>

<p>Nowadays, an increasing number of institutions are offering tech-savvy versions of something called "competency-based education" (CBE). Although CBE itself has been used for many years, the emphasis now is on flexible and affordable CBE through the power of new software platforms. CBE is designed to build on skills students have and allow them to earn a degree or certificate that will position them for employment in the workforce.</p>

<p>Is CBE an effective way of providing students who might not otherwise receive a college education with supportive learning? How does it differ from vocational education? How has technology been able to change the way colleges might be able to offer CBE? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/27015/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:25 Brian.Sweeting:</b> Online classes have notoriously low completion rates. Self-efficacy and self-discipline are factors that play into completing an online CBE program. What kind of mentoring and assistance do they have for students who are struggling?</p>

<p><b>@00:51 Beckieb:</b> There are some programs out there that do offer personalized degree[s]. It could be any compound of interests that a student might want to study. Schools like Evergreen, in Oregon provide this kind of degree construction, and I think that this model will continue to proliferate in higher education. </p>
