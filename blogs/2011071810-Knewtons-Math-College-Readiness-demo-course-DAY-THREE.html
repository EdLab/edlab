            I know it seems obvious, but it just occurred to me: 

If I'm reviewing Knewton using this Math Readiness College Course, I should probably see what happens when I deliberately do badly in a particular area of math, because it seems like my math skills are pretty much up to par so far.
<!--break-->
As much as it pains me to leave something unfinished, I'm ditching this “Equations & expressions” unit. How cute are these half-eaten apple icons, though?

Before I go on to the "Coordinates planes" section and pretend I'm terrible at them, here are some thoughts about Knewton, as I've experienced it so far:

- The “Show us what you know” questions feel a lot harder than the questions you get during the workshops and in the test at the end of a unit. That probably means Knewton is doing a decent job of learnin' me good/refreshing my memory, but I swear that some are also legitimately more difficult.  I'm going to prove this, just give me some time.

- There seems to be a lot of redundancy in the video lessons. Almost every video I watch contains about 75% content that has already been covered in other videos. Is this repetition intentional?

- There are also three or four different people (so far) that are showing up in these videos. I'm pretty sure the scripts are all written by the same person (or people), but I'd be curious to know where they came from, who's writing them, and how they decided this particular style of teaching (talking head; stock images and word problems show to the right) would be most effective.  

LATER:
Okay, I just intentionally performed miserably on the “Show us what you know” section. Now I've been rewarded with insanely easy questions like this one:

Wow.
