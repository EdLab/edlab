<p>Facebook has made a social network for digital identities to exist in a purely online community. And the social network expands and extends with each new acquaintance met in real life. It is undeniably a huge part of many people's lives—at least for those who are able to enjoy it. What happens to individuals barred from an online social life due to impairments or disabilities? </p>

<p>Facebook is utilizing some of the most advanced technologies to make for a more inclusive internet community. Facial recognition may have stirred users when it first emerged as a photo-tagging feature, but now developers are using this technology for something more worthwhile. Networks of simulated neurons are getting better at distinguishing images within photographs, connecting images with patterns, and matching them to words. The system enables a digital voice to describe the details of photos and content in a news feed, exposing blind or visually impaired individuals to the information that was previously inaccessible. </p>

<p>Artificial intelligent systems can function as extensions to the human mind. With technology steering us into undiscovered avenues of human inclusivity, who knows what novel experience we will explore next? </p>

<p>Where will inclusive technology focus their advancements next? How is technology making our social networks an extended community? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/27595/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:54 dinosossi2:</b> The rationale for creating technology is fascinating. The idea of using AI to help people with various disabilities can help them lead more vibrant lives. </p>

<p><b>@02:02 jennyshen:</b> Technology seems to be able to bridge different sensory modalities in ways that we haven't been able to before. Whether that's from verbal to text (e.g., voice typing) or visual to verbal (e.g., the feature in this video), it seems to have the power to provide extra support to those with sensory disabilities, which has huge implications for the classroom.</p>
