          <p>
            <p>The following is a response to the seminar “Kafka’s Little Coding Machines.”</p>

<p><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/EDPOP-Machine-Brown-1.jpg" alt="EDPOP-Machine-Brown-1.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p>

</p><p>“A Kafka-machine is thus constituted by contents and expressions that have been formalized to diverse degrees by unformed materials that enter into it, and leave by passing through all possible states. To enter or leave the machine, to be in the machine, to walk around it, to approach it—these are all still components of the machine itself: these are states of desire, free of all interpretation.” - Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature - by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari </p>

<p>

</p><p>Kafka, when distilled to his essence, implies a certain level of absurdity. His absurdist perspective naturally leads itself towards many different things: institutions, organizations, and bureaucracies in all of their seemingly endless forms. </p>

<p>

</p><p>On second thought, each of these terms (e.g., institutions, organizations, and bureaucracies) is different on its face. Each is discrete, separate, and different. However, they all have similar connotations. They imply multiple levels and multiple distinctions. As a collective, they lead to dehumanizing effects.</p>

<p>
</p><p><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/EDPOP-GrayBuilding-1.jpg" alt="EDPOP-GrayBuilding-1.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p>

</p><p>From these preliminary thoughts, a Kafka-machine in itself has similar types of connotations and results in similar implications. The machine seems to be embodied through the form of an institution, organization, and/or bureaucracy within which these different processes, and these multiple possible states, might occur. </p>

<p>

</p><p>The constituent material that the Kafka-machine processes seems to be irrelevant. The machine itself is the constant, the non-negotiable medium within which the message is shaped, formed, and transmitted.</p>

<p>

</p><p>The unformed material that enters and feeds the machine appears to pass through a series of practices and procedures within which this material enters and is shaped.</p>

<p>

</p><p>For example, it could be law. The rules and procedures of the machine shape the language that becomes law to control human and/or institutional behavior.</p>

<p>

</p><p>It could be computer code. The stereotypical computer flowchart is a series of sequential decisions that govern human inputs and machine-produced outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/EDPOP-Machine-Wires-2.jpg" alt="EDPOP-Machine-Wires-2.jpg" /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"></span></p>

<p>It could even be education and the public schools that largely process and produce &quot;educated&quot; people. The rules and procedures that force children to attend school on time, stand silently in rows, and/or submit to the homogenizing assessment of standardized tests are the soft, supple marrow that forms society. The purpose of schools is to shape youth behavior and the society that they ultimately become. And yes, they can sometimes even lead to learning...</p>

<p>

</p><p>We ceaselessly and relentlessly co-exist within systems and constructs, organizations and institutions, bureaucracies and hierarchies, positive and negative states. Thesis naturally leads to antithesis. All of these complications and contestations are nested within one another, the absurdities of human activity that they cause multiply one another. The Kafka-machine has become totalizing, all-encompassing, inescapable. </p>

<p>

</p><p>Acquiesce to the machine. There is no escape.</p>
