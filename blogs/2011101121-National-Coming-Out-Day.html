            Happy coming out day!
<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/10/150px-Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13012" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/150px-Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100" /></a>

I  discovered that today was National Coming Out Day because Ellen told me.   I mean, she told me on Twitter.  Or perhaps it was really Ellen’s  invisible assistant who tweets for her, but I’m happier thinking that  Ellen DeGeneres herself thought to tell me, since we’re on a first name  basis.  And although it’s short notice to tackle a large topic, it seems  appropriate to consider what books we might have on the topic at  Gottesman Library.  What resources are here to help people navigate the  coming out process?

But  first: what is coming out day, and why is it on October 11th?  The  event commemorates the same day in 1987 when half a million people  marched on Washington for gay and lesbian rights; the following year, to  celebrate the march and to keep the commitment alive, Robert Eichberg  and Jean O'Leary came up with the idea of National Coming Out Day as a  way of promoting government and public awareness of gay, bisexual,  lesbian and transgender rights.

We  don’t have a pride-parade’s worth of literature on coming out at Gottesman, but we  do have a few important and useful books.

<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/1557987416.01.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13007" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/1557987416.01-109x150.jpg" alt="" width="109" height="150" /></a>

<strong><em>Mom, Dad, I’m Gay: How Families Negotiate Coming Out</em></strong> (American Psychological Association, 2001) [HQ76.25 .S39 2001] is a handbook by  psychologist Rich Savin-Williams drawing from over 150 interviews with  teenagers, and discussing the range of parental reactions, which he  breaks down by father-son, and mother-daughter coming out experiences.   He approaches the issue from a psychological perspective, but he quotes  from the teens extensively and it’s a useful glimpse into teenagers'  experiences coming out to their parents.

<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/0674016734.011.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13020" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/0674016734.011-104x150.jpg" alt="" width="104" height="150" /></a>

As it happens, Savin-Williams is also the author of a newer book that we also carry, <strong><em>The New Gay Teenager</em></strong> (Harvard University Press, 2005) [HQ76.25 .S395 2005] , and which I read a few years ago.  <em>The New Gay Teenager</em> follows the hypothesis that today’s gay teen now lives in a calmer,  more relaxed and gay-friendly culture and that they often do not feel  the need to come out, or even identify a sexuality at all.  The new  gay teen is actually more like the new... teen.  In this book, too, he  interviews a few hundred non-straight teens and quotes from their  experiences extensively. When I read the book I recall feeling dubious  (it seemed to me he was personally invested in the outcome)  but I also felt kind of sad.  Isn’t gay culture just the best? What  would life be like without feather boas, smoky bars, leather chaps,  Cher, and chain-linked wallets?  Would life still have meaning, or would  it just seem flat, empty? Then I realized: my concept of “things that  are gay” is actually pretty outdated.  I don’t think I’ve seen a  chain-linked wallet in over ten years.  My cat ate my feather boa a few  years ago, and I think I forgot to replace it.  Maybe the new gay teen  has the right idea.

But  back to coming out: If you’d rather approach the issue of coming out  from an educator’s perspective, you might find another book, <em><strong>The Principal’s Challenge</strong> </em>(Information Age Publishing, 2009) [LC2575 .P33 2009],  useful. <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/41MV5yhDSeL._SL500_AA300_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13010" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/41MV5yhDSeL._SL500_AA300_1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a> A  principal in a rural, mid-Western high school realized he knew nothing  about the particular experiences and challenges of his gay/lesbian/queer  students’ lives when a senior in his school came out.  He decided to  take on the personal project of learning more about his students, and  profiles eight gay students’ stories, along with his personal anecdotes  about his learning experience.  The book is meant to help educators,  administrators, and policy-makers whose decisions can affect gay teenagers’  lives, either adversely or positively.

Meanwhile,  I just checked my Twitter feed again, and realized I had gotten it all  wrong.  Ellen told me that Beyonce’s baby is due in February.  It was  The Task Force who told me about National Coming Out Day.  Happy coming out day!
