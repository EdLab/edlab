Her costume covers her from head to toe. She enforces without violence. She's the hero for a new generation. She's... the <a href="http://www.burkaavenger.com/">Burka Avenger!</a> By day a Pakistani school teacher and by night a vigilant crime fighter, this superhero uses books and pens to fight against Taliban-like enemies who seek to keep girls from obtaining an education. <p>

Like any good hero, the Burka Avenger infuses a healthy dose of morality into each of her episodes, explaining to her young audience the difference between right and wrong. Still, despite her virtuous mission, the character faces public scrutiny in real life, much of which is due to her trademark attire. Seen by many as a symbol of oppression, the burqa is arguably one of the most polarizing pieces of clothing a woman could wear. Critics of the show contend that the cartoon glorifies this injustice, but show creator Aaron Haroon Rashid maintains that the burqa deters the objectification of the Avenger (unlike other highly-sexualized modern female superheroes) and, what’s more, is used as a weapon against the oppressors.  <p>

As a topic that could generate a lively discussion regarding women’s education and women’s rights in the Middle East, the focus seems to have gotten a bit off course. Help steer the conversation back on track by joining the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10823">Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i><p>

<b>@01:01 Carla:</b>  An amazing coincidence that this came out around the same time that Malala was shot. I think it speaks to the urgency of action-- this cartoon couldn't have come out at better time. <p>

<b>02:09 Brian.Sweeting:</b> [In reference to the burqa controversy] An important discussion to have, but do you think it detracts from the conversation about inclusive education? Are they inseparable issues?
