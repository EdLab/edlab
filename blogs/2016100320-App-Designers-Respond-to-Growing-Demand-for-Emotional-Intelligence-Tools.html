<p>Technology can take on a therapeutic role when preparing students for social and emotional interactions.
As part of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/back-school-tech-tool-kids-develop-emotional-intelligence/story?id=41636169">ABC’s Back to School news</a> special, reporter Becky Worley covered hi-tech applications for parents to use with their children, citing the app <a href="http://www.qwunder.com">QWunder</a> as a good introduction to emotional and mental health issues for students. The app uses videos, songs, games, and celebrity interviews to discuss topics like grit and mannerisms like eye contact for children. </p>
 
<p>"When it comes to kids, they may need emotional skills before we ever quiz them on reading, writing and arithmetic," says Worley. She also cites her own daughter’s experience using a classroom toolbox, which is filled with empathy, breathing, and personal space tools. One of her daughter’s favorites is "the trash can," where students are encouraged to throw the problems that bother them away. As Worley’s daughter puts it, "I let the little things go." </p>
 
<p>As research evidence mounts in favor of concentrating on social and emotional development in and outside of schools, what do you think can be done to help facilitate such development? What should happen when parents are unwilling or unable to provide support at home? Join the discussion <a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30991/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@01:13 donisossi2:</b> Schools often are the fallback for teaching important skills that are avoided at home. Social and emotional learning may be one of those topics.</p>
 
<p><b>@01:28 RuthS:</b> Generally, we think of social and emotional skills being grown exclusively with human-human interaction, so it's interesting to know that there are apps specifically to help with this development.</p>
