<p>YouTube beauty gurus might be doing a lot more that simply showing how to paint the perfect brows. Beauty YouTubers could be key to making over technology fields as digital literacy educators. Beauty gurus engage in technology for creative self-expression by filming, editing, and often revealing how they shoot their signature looks. Some YouTube beauty gurus have massive followings of young women, the same group noticeably missing from STEAM fields.</p>
 
<p>New research examined the embedded messages and technology usage within the videos of popular YouTube beauty gurus and how these messages resonated with viewers. A content analysis from five of the most subscribed YouTube beauty channels showed extensive editing techniques, external links to engage their viewers, and video messages that go beyond beauty. By including educational messages, beauty YouTubers can be understood as presenting an alternative form of STEAM education, particularly arts technology.</p>
 
<p>Seeing how gurus create their videos could provide viewers with digital literacy lessons that spark their own video production. A second study looked at how these hidden educational messages connect with viewers of beauty videos. It included 272 undergraduate students who watched a selected beauty video, a different genre of YouTube video, or no video in the case of the control group. Participants then rated how much they learned about technology and how motivated they were to produce their own video after watching. Results showed that viewers who watched a beauty video were more interested in video production. However, it didn’t change their relationship to technology. This motivation could be the first step in engaging young people in technology-related fields. </p>
 
<p>More than simply teaching viewers how to master a smoky eye, the analysis of beauty videos showed that YouTube content creators are well-versed in editing techniques to enhance their own videos and act as unlikely digital literacy educators. While study number one showed that educational content is present in YouTube beauty videos, study two showed that this content can inspire viewers to engage in their own video creation. In judging these gurus just on their looks, we may miss the opportunity for these online stars to be digital literacy ambassadors to young people.</p>
