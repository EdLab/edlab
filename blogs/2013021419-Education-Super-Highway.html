<i>As we enter the country’s poorer areas, the adoption gap grows sharply. Hardest hit are low-income schoolchildren, because fewer opportunities to use broadband means fewer opportunities to learn, to interact, and to develop the skills necessary to participate in today’s economy.</i> (Brian Mefford, Connected Nation’s CEO).                
<p>

<b>Bridging the Digital Divide</b><br>
How does infrastructure affect adoption and performance?  This question forms the core of <a href="http://www.educationsuperhighway.org">Education Superhighway’s</a> mission. The group estimates that over 80% of schools do not have adequate broadband access to support digital learning.  This fact is in stark contrast to increased development of and interest in Educational Technologies.  According to <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Boom-Time-for-Education/131229/">The Chronicle for Higher Education & the National Venture Capital Association</a> investment in EdTech rose from $146-million in 2002 to $429-million in 2011. While potentially transformative, and clearly in the midst of a "boom time," learning technologies can only be adopted and transformative if sufficient infrastructure is in place. The Federal Communications Commission & Department of Education highlight this issue in their, <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/digital-textbook-playbook">Digital Textbook Playbook</a>, "Insufficient broadband bandwidth will interrupt learning and instruction, causing teachers and students to fall back to 20th century learning methods and abandon new technologies." Lisa Fung, a representative from Education Superhighway explains to New Learning Times (See Exclusive interview below), "Our children are living in a digital world in this 21st Century.  However, when kids enter the classroom, they go back in time."  Fung goes on to explain that this issue is felt most strongly by institutions that serve underprivileged children, "We do see that schools with a higher ‘free/reduced’ population, have less opportunity for high-speed bandwidth.  In some of the low income, rural areas, even if the schools wanted 100Mbps, it's just not available."  Many people alive in today’s digital world have experienced the frustration that occurs when networks that support daily communication underperform, and schools are no exception.  
<p>
<b>Speed-testing Schools</b><br>
A recent development from Education Superhighway is the <a href="http://www.schoolspeedtest.org/">"Speed Test."</a>  The application allows educators to test their school’s broadband and find out exactly how it measures up to the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Education’s recommendation that schools support at least 100MB per 1,000 students.  Evan Marwell, CEO and founder of Education Superhighway, explains, "Understanding the state of Internet access in America's schools is imperative to ensuring that we can make digital learning a reality for all of our students."  The group will then use this data from schools to "take an inventory" of actual classroom performance that will inform recommendations made by the group for how to allocate over $2.5 billion in federal funds meant to improve school infrastructure. Fung explains the importance of this data collection, "There's data out there showing which pipes are coming to the schools and how much connectivity they will bring. However, what really matters is the experience the teachers see in the classroom and it's oftentimes not the same number."  Education Superhighway also plans to deploy what they have termed "Education Geek Squads" (similar to <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/">these</a>, but ed-focused) to schools to help educators and administrators to use and support new infrastructure.  Fung explains, "What we’ve seen in many schools is that they lack the technical expertise and support. We will be able to supplement their teams with our Geek Squads."  Other groups like national nonprofit, <a href="http://www.connectednation.org/">Connected Nation</a>, are also working to support broadband access in schools and have similar "speed test" applications.  While valiant first steps, one glaring question remains... what next?  Will prioritizing the support of increased infrastructure lead to increased innovation?  And if so, how will innovations adopted by schools, which must now try to allocate from increasingly tightened budgets, support both broadband access and new technologies?  The answer might lay in an additional focus of both groups, helping schools to find volume discounts.  Fung explains, "if schools could aggregate their purchases, they can lower their costs overall for the technology that is needed to increase their bandwidth… So, by aggregating their purchases, they may be able to spend slightly more and gain exponentially more performance."  Perhaps this is the most scalable solution, spending less and freeing-up more resources to support innovation.

Exclusive NLT Interview  with  Lisa Fung of Education Superhighway </b>
<p>

<b>How is the effect of a lack of broadband access felt by a school?  Is it magnified?</b><br>
Our children are living in a digital world in this 21st Century. However, when kids enter the classroom, they go back in time.  But there’s no reason why the classroom can’t be more collaborative, engaging, innovative and <b> connected </b> to all these learning opportunities. We need to make sure our students aren’t being left behind.
<p>
We do see that schools with a higher "free/reduced" population, have less opportunity for high speed bandwidth.  In some of the low income, rural areas, even if the schools wanted 100Mbps, it's just not available.
<p>
<b>Will the (Education Superhighway) "Geek Squads" have an ed background?  Or strictly IT?</b><br>
Yes, the Geek Squads will be experts in understanding how to implement networking infrastructure within schools.  What we’ve seen in many schools is that they lack the technical expertise and support. We will be able to supplement their teams with our Geek Squads.
<p>
<b>How will schools sign up for "Geek Squad" access?</b><br> 
We are in the process of creating that process. However, the first step is to identify which schools are in need the most. Many of these decisions are handled out of the District and State levels and we have partnerships in place with SETDA and CoSN to also work directly with the States in the next steps.
<p>
<b>Will the data from the "Speed Tests" inform how you will recommend federal funds are spent?</b><br>
Yes. Without quality data, it’s hard to make changes and make recommendations. This data will test the ACTUAL performance of what’s really happening within the classrooms. There's data out there showing which pipes are coming to the schools and how much connectivity they will bring. However, what really matters is the experience the teachers see in the classroom and it's often times not the same number.
<p>
<b>Will these recommendations for allocation of Federal funds be made at the local or national level?</b><br> 

These recommendations will be made to the FCC regarding the E-Rate federal subsidy program that helps schools and libraries to obtain affordable telecommunications services, broadband Internet access and internal network connections.  
<p>
We will also provide this data to the state departments of education and school districts so that they better plan their schedule of upgrades and be better prepared for the 2014-2015 online assessments.
<p>
<b>Does lack of broadband access impede innovation in educational technology? </b><br>
Yes. Without adequate broadband infrastructure, many of the digital apps, websites, and cloud-based curriculum cannot be utilized in the classroom. There are a number of educational technology programs and tools that can transform education and help personalize the learning.  However, without at least 100 Mbps of bandwidth in each classroom, it will be difficult.  Additionally, districts are also very concerned about the upcoming 2014-2015 online assessments and fear many of their schools are not adequately prepared. 
<p>
<b>What do you see as low-cost, scalable solutions?  [How can schools afford to purchase more technology? ] </b><br>

There are a number of low-cost scalable solutions and the right implementation will differ from each region. However, if schools could aggregate their purchases, they can lower their costs overall for the technology that is needed to increase their bandwidth. 
<p>
As the largest purchaser of broadband, schools are spending thousands of dollars and purchasing as individual customers.  They are not taking advantage of volume discounts. We see some schools earning anywhere between a 20%-60% discount on networking technology. So, by aggregating their purchases, they may be able to spend slightly more and gain exponentially more performance.

<p>
<b>What additional resources will you provide for educators? </b><br> 
We are working on that right now. Our intention is to ensure that they have enough Internet access and are not the experts in recommending which Ed Tech hardware or software they should use. Would they want more information on how much bandwidth is required to do X? Would they want information to do a lite assessment of their schools infrastructure? Would they want more curriculum information about how the Internet works to each in the schools? We would be interested in what other information they would like.
