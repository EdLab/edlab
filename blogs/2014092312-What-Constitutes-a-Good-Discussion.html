          <p>
            During the past summer, the research team here did a great job building a classification model to predict quality of Vialogue discussions. 193 video discussions were rated on a 1-5 scale. 30 features were extracted from backend data. Random Forests(RF) algorithm was used to perform the classification. The results for binary classification(1-3:bad/ 4-5:good) are promising. The error rate was low at 7.7%. 

RF classification is effective in classification; However, due to the nonparametric nature of the algorithm, the results lack a strong interpretability. For the past week, I've been working on building a classification model using parametric clustering methods. 

I first tried to do classification using all 30 features by Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA). For binary classification, an error rate of 6.2% was achieved. For multi class (1-5) classification, the error rate was acceptable at 19.2%. 

One problem sill exists though. Do all 30 features related to video discussion quality? Video discussion quality is a latent variable which can't be directly observed.  It drives variability of those observed variables which are indicators of video discussion. But in this case, not all of the 30 features are indicators of dissuasion quality. To examine the causal structure, I performed Exploratory Factor Analysis(EFA).  Three factors was extracted and an orthogonal rotation was performed. Then, factor scores were estimated using regression. And LDA model was fitted again using factor scores. The classification error was 18.5%  for binary rating. However, the model is strongly interpretable. 

The results suggest that the first two factors (quality and quantity of comments) are most important in video discussion quality.
