            Lecture on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/landing/hub.php">Coursera</a> held today at Columbia University's Davis Auditorium by Coursera co-founder Daphne Koller.  Learn more about her work <a href="http://mobile.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-01/daphne-koller-brings-the-world-into-stanford-classes">here</a>. 

Not only is Professor Koller a veteran professor with over 17 years under her belt, but she is also an expert in the field of artificial intelligence and a recipient of a 2004 MacArthur Fellowship.  All else aside, she graduated from college at 17... and may know a thing or two about efficient, effective education. 

Check-out the video-based "ad" for Professor Kroller's Coursera course embedded below... 

<b>Start of Seminar...3:30</b>

Inspired to create the course for the "100%" who would not normally have access to this information. 

What problems is Coursera trying to solve?  <b>Scarcity.</b>
For example, in South Africa there was a deadly stampede when students waited to sign-up for classes. 

<b>Cost.</b> The cost of Higher Ed has gone-up over 400% in the last 12 years. 

Online learning is a way to help alleviate these 2 issues. 

Machine learning at Stanford is the most popular SEE course with an avg. of 400 enrolling every year ... the inaugural online machine learning course had 100,000 students. 
 
This semester it will be over 160K. This is ed for the 100%. 

<b>Main components:</b> 
-Video-based. 
-Homework w Deadlines 
-Cohort of students - Q&A 
-Statement of accomplishment 
-Supports existent courses - flipping model for higher-ed. 

<b>Video-based:</b> students really like videos.  Can encourage them not to read. 

MIT's Open Courseware - 7% of 2,000 courses have videos, 100% of these courses are the most downloaded. 

<b>"Modular instruction"</b> - breaks-up long "boring" videos, teachers plan these using "concept maps." (mSchool ideas: can we get examples & images of these? Wiki content for teachers?) Different sets of examples for different levels makes content "adaptive."

<b>Testing</b> is critical for learning... assessment isn't only for evaluation... it is even more critical to create student learning. "Retrieval practice produces more learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. -Science, 2011.  

<b>3:47</b> 

Bloom's model of Mastery-based learning.  Striving to create the same effectiveness in group learning as is one-to-one tutoring environment.  The option to "keep trying" until you get it right.  "The constant is that the students learn what they need to learn and the variable is what they learn." -Salman Khan 

<b>Start of Demo...</b>
Constant "action" on the screen very important & why the instructor "drawing" is crucial. 

<b>Quiz every 5 minutes.</b> Get instant feedback & have the option to get an explanation.  All videos have 3 different playing speeds for different abilities.  Closed captioning on all videos.  

(seems slightly more text-based than Udacity & less of a "dashboard" design ---> more treed-categories).  

<b>How do you deal with 50K+ questions from students?</b>

<b>Q&A forum</b> - shows related already asked questions as you type. Based on ranking - "Stack Overflow model." 
Q's with most votes will be sent to teachers.  Medium answer time for Q's in the forum was 22minutes. "Reputation points"- students like to feel like they are contributing to something. Posts do not seem to use tagging - only ranking.

Internal Stanford classes offered on this same platform.  

Have a "workbench" which resembles a terminal for working-out problems and receiving feedback.  Submission scripts for various problems. 

<b>4:00</b>

Amazing what you can do with data from classes with 40K+ students.  When 6,000 students make the same mistake you are able to create unique error messages etc & discover common misconceptions etc.  Order of magnitude increased.  

Peaks in student interaction with the site around HW due-dates.  170+ countries represented on the site.  

Combined "reach" of Stanford's initial 3 online SEE courses is more than that of Khan Academy. 

<b>Final class stats:</b> AI course 160,000 registered & 23,000 received "statement of accomplishment."

50% retention... higher than the UK's Open U which is paid! 

Software professionals were the biggest category of users, followed by IT professionals - many took course b/c there wasn't one or one of high enough quality at their school.    

<b>What about the 1% (teacher's work in-class at Stanford with paying students)?</b>
<b>Flipping model</b> alive & well here... move "frontal instruction" online & then focus in-class on interactive activities.

Focus on "just-in-time" teaching based on quiz results.  

Real-world guest speakers & real-world design choices etc.  

Interactive sessions were optional and recorded.  Steady attendance rate of 60-80%. 

<b>4:15</b>

<b>Benefits of online classes:</b> 
-Tailor course content to individual's backgrounds & interests (how? I didn't see/hear an example of this?
-Online environment significantly less threatening environment for minority students. 
-Allows use of detailed analytics to improve courses. 
-In-class time used for active learning... flipped model.  

<b>4:25</b>

Strong words re: <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> & the split with Professor Thrun.  Apparently he is viewed as "poaching" professors, whereas Coursera has a "partnership" model with other universities. 

<b>Future plans...</b>
I asked re: future plans to "adapt" content based on student interests and background & her response was that this is one of the most exciting aspect of gathering data on students at this magnitude & this will inform future content & development.  

Thinks we are moving more towards "project-based" learning in-class Khan & flipped model where differences in ability are less evident. 

<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/3224">Manav</a> just asked re: credentialing & real-world job market... employers are asking re: who are your top students & can I access their info as great candidates. 

One professor just asked re: how do you write over 100,000 letters of recommendation?  Automate it!  

Something that is not a 15 week course is the future... what is the notion of grade-point average?  Semesters?  

Working on set of "best-practice" docs that will be shared.  

"Course operation specialists?" Will help instructors navigate these platforms.  Focused on technology & not pedagogy. 

I just asked re: tablets & online learning and Koller's response was that there is increasing overlap.  Khan just released an iPad app - sees these courses going mobile more & more.
