Steve Hargadon is the founder and director of the <a href="http://bit.ly/12UyKc9">Learning Revolution Project</a> and <a href= "http://bit.ly/1wCd4fv">Web 2.0 Labs</a>. He is also the host of the <a href="http://bit.ly/1zdRctp">FutureofEducation</a> interview series, and founder and chair or co-chair of a number of annual worldwide virtual events, including the annual <a href="http://bit.ly/1wEbhbo">Global Education Conference</a>, the <a href="http://bit.ly/1w9i9MB">Library 2.0 Conference</a>, and the <a href="http://admin20.org/page/summit">School Leadership Summit</a>. Hargadon runs a large annual ed-tech unconference, now called <a href="http://bit.ly/1FQMBz8">Hack Education</a> (previously EduBloggerCon). A leading voice on education technology, Hargadonâ€™s virtual and physical events build communities and connections in education, with 130,000 members and over 100,000 participant log-ins annually. Hargadon has been the Emerging Technologies Chair for ISTE, a regular co-host of the annual Edublog Awards, the author of "Educational Networking: The Important Role Web 2.0 Will Play in Education," and the recipient of the 2010 Technology in Learning Leadership Award (CUE).  
<p>
<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
It is interesting to look back and see golden threads in your life and career that have had an impact.  One of the more seminal experiences was living in Brazil for a year as an exchange student my junior year of high school.  Probably no coincidence that my first job after college was organizing and leading group tours for the Stanford Alumni Association which I did for several years.  That I co-founded and run the Global Education Conference seems right in line with that trajectory. 
<p>
Equally as influential was that I grew up as the son of Fred Hargadon, who was dean of admissions at both Stanford and Princeton, as well as being the chairman of the College Board. So much of my early life and thinking revolved around the idea of education, and my dad was a deep thinker on the topic.  He had grown up poor and unlikely himself to go to college, and in fact was quite a late bloomer.  The understanding of education as an experience of personal change, liberating and enlarging one's mind, was always present.  He was always looking past the test scores to the individual, something I hope I've inherited.
 <p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
My interview series, <a href="http://bit.ly/1zdRctp">FutureofEducation.com</a>, has been on a hiatus, as I spent last year taking a trip around the world really thinking deeply about education, learning, and their relationship.  After 400 interviews, I was unsettled--coming to the conclusion that much of what consumes the education conversation has very little to do with the idea of the inherent potential of every child, and much more to do with compliance, control, measurement, and (ultimately) sorting.  I'm somewhat shocked at the number of people I meet who say about their education, "I wasn't in the smart crowd." How are we comfortable with a system of education that has a 25% dropout rate, and then a significant percentage on top of that who leave school thinking they weren't smart?  From a very practical standpoint, it's a terrible outcome for any country's creative capacity.  From a personal standpoint, it's equally as tragic.  I don't think it's anyone's intention that our schools are predominantly a culture that creates feelings of failure, but we've accepted this mechanistic, data-driven, robot-like view of how students should respond, and if they don't survive being beaten up that way, we drug a significant portion of them to stay compliant and controlled.  At some deep level we need to reclaim learning from the institutional systems and corporate profit-driven models that predominate now.  
<p>
The Internet has reminded us vividly that learning takes place everywhere, often and especially outside of institutional settings.  I run conferences now for the museum, library, leadership, and homeschooling worlds in additional to those for traditional educators because I believe we need to bridge these learning professions and to support a learning revolution (hence my <a href="http://bit.ly/12UyKc9">LearningRevolution.com</a> project!).  These free virtual conferences accomplish a great many significant things, including giving lots of opportunities for educators to present to their peers.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
The tension between the existing institutional forces which have controlled the narratives about learning, and the increasing democratization of learning opportunities because of the Internet.  Nobody willingly cedes power, and those in institutions whose lives and work and careers have been focused on education being the institution delivering information will have a hard time releasing the reins.  But the glut of college graduates with low job prospects and onerous student loans will make the connection between institutional education and opportunity harder and harder to justify.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
I let the cat out of the bag on this already--it's the Learning Revolution project.  We've created a space for over 200 partner organizations in a variety of learning professions to share calendar events of free professional development and learning opportunities, and our weekly email with the same goes out now to over 130,000. 
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I have 22,000 twitter followers, and I know that's comparatively not that many, but it is when I tell you that I rarely use Twitter and so that anyone follow me is shocking.  It's not my learning style.  I'm a long-form reader, I like blocks of dedicated time for projects, and Twitter is just too scattered for me to enjoy.  Another example of how people learn and work differently!</p>
