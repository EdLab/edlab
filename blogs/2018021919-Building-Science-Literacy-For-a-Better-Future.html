<p><a href="http://www.sciencepodcastforkids.com/">Tumble</a> is a bi-weekly podcast exploring new scientific discoveries in an appropriate, accessible way for young listeners. Hosted by science journalist Lindsay Patterson and teacher Marshall Escamilla, episodes aim to answer listeners’ science questions and feature the ongoing work of experts through a "well-produced, values-driven podcast that's enjoyable for both kids and adults."</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I really admire the podcast’s philosophy and mission. As explained in the <a href="http://www.sciencepodcastforkids.com/manifesto">Tumble Manifesto</a>, current science education doesn’t always value science as a process, but instead teaches it as static, unchallengeable facts. This has led to serious scientific illiteracy that has "crippled the world’s ability to act on some of our most pressing problems." Therefore, Tumble hopes that it can help foster in children an understanding of how science works, a sense of curiosity, and the belief that science is "one of the most powerful tools we have to shape our future."</p>

<p>This mission definitely comes through in the content of the podcast, which features interviews with specialists and covers a wide variety of relevant and interesting topics, from viruses to ancient primates to Mars. Myths are debunked, new evidence is explored, and recent findings are presented in an engaging style that reminded me a lot of the adult science podcast, RadioLab.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>I initially struggled to appreciate this podcast due to the gap between my expectations and the reality of its framing and overall presentation. Since the podcast is marketed as being for kids, I was not expecting it to be as dense as it is. While I appreciate the fact that the science is not dumbed down and presume that it’s fantastic for kids who want to delve further into a topic that fascinates them, I’m afraid it might lose a less enthusiastic child’s attention if the subject of the podcast is not of initial interest. This podcast doesn’t feature the creative approaches to learning many parents have come to expect of informal education programs for their children, and while this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s something parents may want to keep in mind when considering whether or not it will be a good fit for their child.</p>

<p>That being said, the thing that signaled to me that it was not intended for an adult audience was the hosting style. Tumble emphasizes that it is a podcast for the whole family, but as an adult, I felt the hosts had a tendency to be a bit over the top. Sometimes I appreciated the goofiness, but sometimes it turned me off and kept me from taking the information seriously.</p>

<p>Additionally, the hosts’ clear voice change between interviewing adults and talking to a kid audience led me to lose interest as it conveyed a lack of genuineness. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While this podcast is not completely successful in finding the balance between keeping the attention of younger listeners and valuing older listeners, it does provide valuable information to a generation that is going to need it. Whether its listeners grow up to be the scientists of tomorrow or just concerned citizens, Tumble is an important step towards educating children in the realities of science.</p>
