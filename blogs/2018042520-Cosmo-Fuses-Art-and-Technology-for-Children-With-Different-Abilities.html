<p>Filisia creates tools that combine art and technology to enhance the way children with different abilities learn. As every person with additional needs has a unique set of abilities, says CEO Georgios Papadakis, Filisia tries to engage each user by exercising their particular set of abilities. Their art and technology fused educational product, Cosmo, is geared toward children with cerebral palsy, autism, brain injuries, and learning difficulties. Cosmo consists of a series of dots that flash different colors and emit different musical or recorded sounds. Connected to the iPad app, Cosmo has a range of activities for users that promote physical, social, and emotional learning through music and sound.</p>

<p>In order to create Cosmo, the Filisia team works with over 70 therapists and 100 users in schools, daycares, and therapy sessions, reworking the product along the way. Papadakis said that instead of designing the product for people, they were designing it with them. "We just don’t try to sell something to people," says Papadakis. "We’re trying to find a solution for them." That said, with a hefty price tag (around $650 for the basic product), it’s likely that only more affluent people and schools will be able to reap the benefits of Cosmo for now.</p>

<p>What benefit is there in the inclusive education sector for artists and technologists to work together to create products? What specific learning abilities do you think Cosmos could help its users develop? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/42072">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion: </i></p>

<p><b>@01:56 Melanie Hering:</b> The designer's statement that "I've learned to design with them, not for them" is so critical when working with populations you can't directly identify with, because you need their input to know whether or not you're designing something helpful and intuitive for them.</p>

<p><b>@02:45 Ryan Allen:</b> I like the idea that ed tech innovations do not need to be digital. These are physical items that can be incorporated into a room or space, encouraging movement. Often, screens are relied upon in too many of these kinds of treatments.</p>
