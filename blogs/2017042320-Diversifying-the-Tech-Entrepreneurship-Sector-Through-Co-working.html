<p><i>"The BLUE1647 community is a vibrant example of the ways in which creative professionals, entrepreneurs, change-makers, and nonprofits can come together to make meaningful, lasting impact." </i> (<a href="http://www.blue1647.com/about-us">About BLUE1647</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Fostering a Tech Co-working Space</b></p>

<p>BLUE1647 is an innovation center devoted to preparing diverse individuals for projects and careers in entrepreneurship and technology. Active throughout the U.S., this Chicago-based organization hosts over 100 classes and workshops each year that focus on training young people and adults alike in technology and twenty-first-century skills. In addition, the organization hosts various coding bootcamps and events, such as the Hackathon series the group orchestrated in 2016 throughout 100 different U.S. cities.</p>
 
<p>The organization also fosters a space for diverse individuals interested in entrepreneurship and technology to co-work and collaborate on various projects. BLUE1647 encourages the mingling of students, startups, creative professionals, and nonprofits; after all, some of the worldâ€™s most innovative ideas come from unexpected collaboration. People receive access to these resources by becoming a member of the group.</p>

<p><b>Bridging the Tech Gap</b></p>
 
<p>BLUE1647 is also dedicated to increasing the presence of populations currently underrepresented in the tech sector. This is accomplished in several ways. For one, BLUE1647 runs an internship accelerator that helps minority high school and undergrad students land internships with startups and businesses. In addition, the organization hosts regular classes and workshops that strive to make the tech field more diverse. These include programs such as 1919 Women in Technology Entrepreneurship, Latina Girls Who Code, and BLUE1647 ABLE, a technology class specifically for people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
