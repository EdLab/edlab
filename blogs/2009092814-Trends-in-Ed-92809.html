            The latest New York Times Magazine has the School Issue out, and an article from it is currently ranked no. 1 as the most emailed on nytimes.com in the last 24 hours and no. 5 in the last week.  Now that's a lot of article forwarding.

<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/magazine/27tools-t.html?em">Can Right Kinds of Play Teach Self-Control?</a></em> by Paul Tough reports on the <a href="http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/archive/publications/innodata/inno07.pdf"><strong>Tools of the Mind</strong></a> methodology which states that the key to developing self-regulation is lots of mature and dramatic play.

Some case examples from experiments:
<ul>
	<li>4-year-old children were first asked to stand still for as long as they could. They typically did not make it past a minute. But when the kids played a make-believe game in which they were guards at a factory, they were able to stand at attention for more than four minutes.</li>
	<li>Prekindergarten-age children were asked to memorize a list of unrelated words. Then they played “grocery store” and were asked to memorize a similar list of words.  In the play situation, on average, the children were able to remember twice as many words compared to the non-play situation.</li>
</ul>
