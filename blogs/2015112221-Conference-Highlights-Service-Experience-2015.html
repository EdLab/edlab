            Brian and I have recently returned from the fabled city of San Francisco where we attended the <a href="http://service-experience-conf.com/" target="_blank">Service Experience Conference</a>. 

I tried to take copious notes throughout each of the talks but the emcee, Jamin Hegeman (design director of Adaptive Path, the company sponsoring the event), mercifully summarized each one for us &mdash; in one line! &mdash; at the end of the conference. 

I’ll add those summaries here with some personal commentary, but that wasn’t even the most interesting part of my experience there. Stay with me for Part III (or just jump to it. Otherwise it’s going to be a while until you get there).

<div id="example" style="display:none">

The conference was set up in a large conference room with one talk after another. Talks were generally 30 minutes long unless they were keynotes (those were 50 minutes long). 

Keynote: Inside Out | Outside in
Shelley Evenson,<a href="https://www.fjordnet.com/" target="_blank"> Fjord</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Set change agents up for success</b>
<li>Fjord offers its employees a chance to win a grant from its Innovation Fund. It encourages them to think of creative projects that will “make the world a better place.” Fjord wants to enable employees to bring their passions to life (and to work). 
</ul>

Talk 2: Spreading Service Design
Marc Hebért, <a href="http://www.sfhsa.org/" target="_blank">The San Francisco Human Services Agency</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Focus on the challenge, educate by doing</b>
<li>Using the <a href=”https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=rapid%20improvement%20event” target="_blank">Rapid Improvement Event</a> to design and iterate within a government agency. 
</ul>

Talk 3: A Journey to Service Design
Megan Miller, <a href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University IT
<ul>
<li><b>Pretend to be responsible for the entire service experience</b>
<li>Although she knew little about the field at the time, Megan unofficially changed her job title to Service Designer because she believed it was the future of Stanford’s IT department. She was so convincing they later made it official and one upped it to Senior Service Designer. 
</ul>

Talk 4: Doberman and DoITT: A Case Study in Creating Cultural Change
Phi-Hong Ha, <a href="http://doberman.se/" target="_blank">Doberman Design</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Feed it back</b>
<li>Be aware of how your team is experiencing a project. Go so far as to map your team’s vital signs-- where were their highs and lows? At low times, consider giving team members a “love shower” (not what you would expect!: write compliments to that person on post its and stick them all over that person). 
<li>Doberman is the group behind those funny Oscar ads you may have seen in the subway:

</ul>

Talk 5: Designed to Serve: Shaping New Staff Roles for Innovative Services
Molly Ackerman-Brimberg, <a href="http://www.ziba.com/" target="_blank"> Ziba Design</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask yourself: would a real person be better?</b>
<li>Design for humans. Getting the call center script right doesn’t make the service innovation <i>work</i>. How can you do this so that you’re actually caring for the people you’re designing roles for?
</ul>

Talk 6: Notes on Change From 7 Years of Service Marketplace Evolution
Ian Arthurs, <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/" target="_blank">TaskRabbit</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Demand more than cheaper better faster</b>
<li>Even though the original users of TaskRabbit loved the platform, the team behind it felt it wasn’t going in the right direction. They drastically redesigned the site and, of course, the original users hated everything about it. Unfazed, the team believed the right people would find it and love it. Even though they alienated those first customers, everyone is much happier about the current-day project. 
</ul>

Talk 7: All or Nothing and Everything in Between! Diverse Approaches to Helping Your Organization Develop a Human-Centric Approach to the Development of Business
Brian Gillespie, <a href="http://www.scad.edu/" target="_blank">Savannah College of Art and Design</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Find a lever and lean on it</b>
<li>It’s not about personas and wireframes. No one cares about those on their own. But do something with them... e.g., do a customer experience audit from the POV of a persona
</ul>

Talk 8: Bushwhacking to the Gold: Experience & the Human-Centered Enterprise
Lynn Stott, <a href="http://www.vividthink.com/" target="_blank">Vividthink!</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Communicate well, build relationships, lead</b>
<li>These are all the qualities of a changemaker. 
</ul>

Talk 9: Putting Service Design Into Practice
Katie Koch, <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/" target="_blank">American Express</a>
<ul>
<li><b>When in doubt, keep it simple</b>
<li>Katie was one of our first seminar-on-Vialogues presenters!
</ul>

Talk 10: Conceiving Urban Putt: Adventures in Experiential Retail
Steve Fox, <a href="http://www.urbanputt.com/" target="_black">Urban Putt</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep in mind, if a golf ball can do something, it will</b>
<li>I think this one is pretty self-explanatory. 
</ul>

Keynote: Buy it or grow it
Mark Jones, <a href="http://www.uhc.com/" target="_blank">UnitedHealthcare</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Outsource that shit</b>
<li>“I wanted to go to a place with the worst possible service and make it better.” 
<a href=”http://midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/history_heritage/ethnic_towns/new_glarus_wisconsin.html”>Mentions New Glaris, Wisconsin</a>- service design done at the town level!! It all went Swiss
</ul>

Talk 12: A human-centered talk on service innovation
Dana Cho, <a href="https://www.ideo.com/" target="_blank">IDEO</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Mix high tech with high touch</b>
<li>Design for people. Example: <a href=”https://www.societyofgrownups.com/”>The Society of Grownups</a> (SiNY material, mebbe?)
</ul>

Talk 13: Call It What You Will: Service Design in the Federal Government
Jeremy Canfield, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">18F</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Build small wins that people can see</b>
</ul>

Talk 14: On the Other Side of the Line: Designing with Shoppers in Mind
Francisco Guzman, <a href="http://instacart.com" target="_blank">Instacart</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Spend time with your service providers</b>
<li>Did you know Instacart hires its own shoppers? I always thought it was the employees of the grocery store doing the shopping. Anyway, the amount of support and training these shoppers gets is Zappos level care. Instacart not only cares about its customers, but its shoppers, too. 
</ul>

Talk 15: Exposing the hidden choreography of restaurant choreography
Wyatt Starosta, <a href="http://opentable.com" target="_blank">OpenTable</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t let tech get in the way of you and your guests</b>
<li>I have a lot more on this in Part III. 
</ul>

Talk 17: Emerging Issues and the Future of Service Design
Birgit Mager, <a href="https://kisd.de/ target="_blank">Köln International School of Design</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t be too cheap and don’t be too small</b>
<li>Birgit lost a lofty Lufthansa design deal because she didn’t ask for a big enough budget and only had a few people on her team. 
</ul>

<b>Part III. The Service Experience Experience </b></a>
<div id="example3" style="display:none">
Here’s where I talk takeaways. 

<b>1. Cuh-cold as ice-ice</b>
The conference opened with the host announcing we’d get started with an icebreaker. There was a audible groan from the audience. It was faint, but I heard it. Actually, it was me. Thankfully, it was quick and painless and didn’t involve too many awkward exchanges with strangers. Jamin the merciful stays true to his name. 

<b>2. Style and panache</b>
Among the tired-and-true powerpoint presentations were some phenomenal standout performances. These were the people who incorporated excitement and <i>drama</i> into their talks. 


<i>The can’t-look-away intro</i>
Let’s start with Mark Hebért (Talk 2) who let his slides do the talking for him in the beginning. It commanded attention. Without someone narrating what was on the slides, I had to pry my eyes away from my computer screen in order to absorb what was happening. 

I was able to capture a little of it on video to show you: 

<iframe src="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play_embedded/26218" width="540" height="700" frameBorder="0" scrolling="No"></iframe>



<i>Drawn to the stage</i>
Then there was house favorite, Megan Miller. A self-proclaimed service designer (who later got Stanford to officiate the title), Megan’s background as an artist was on display in her presentation. She told the story of her service design journey (all of which took place over the past year) while her accompanying illustrations delighted on the giant screen behind her. She was so well practiced that the whole thing felt like something I’d pay to see on Broadway. 

I didn’t even think to get a video of her presentation, but here is one of her slides. Just imagine a sweet, excited voice explaining what’s going on. 

<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Vialogues/screen-shot-2015-11-22-at-82052-pm_e6b641332ee3456882a94a330304b6e6.png" />



<i>So dramatic</i>
Wyatt Starosta of Opentable also exercised an element of theater in his presentation. In explaining the great lengths that Michelin-star restaurants go to to excel at customer service, Starosta similarly propelled the average role play into something extraordinary. While members of his team played the parts of hostess and head waiter, Starosta was the pampered patron. The difference between show and tell in this presentation is what made it memorable. He could easily have created a slide deck and talked at us for 30 minutes, but instead he <i>showed</i> us what behind-the-scenes of high end dining looks like. He used balloons as symbols of information. As actors passed the balloons back and forth to each other, they were learning more about Wyatt-the-patron and improving their service (and hopefully his experience) in real time.

<i>The Donahughes of San Fran</i>
Finally, there was the interview that took place live in front of our faces. On the hot seat was Jamin the Emcee who was being interviewed by Pat Quattlebaum, also of Adaptive Path. It was a format they were trying out for the very first time. The most interesting thing about this was that Pat was basing the entire interview off of questions the audience submitted prior to the talk (but at some point during the conference). They submitted via the conference app (which is the next and last (thank God) thing I’ll review). 

<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Vialogues/screen-shot-2015-11-22-at-83637-pm_0e49a63944f04bceb4f5f974184bb8ce.png" />

The most exciting part of this talk was the anticipation of possibly having your question deemed good enough to be asked in front of the crowd. I thought both of the guys on the stage did a great job, especially Jamin, as he had no prior knowledge of the questions and could not practice his answers. 


<b>3. Phone-friendly</b>
I can’t even stand how long this post is. If you’re still around, allow me to reward your endurance by talking about my favorite aspect of the conference-- its app! 

An app for a conference is not a novel idea, but a <i>good</i> and <i>usable</i> conference app definitely stands out. 

<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Vialogues/photo-1_e17848717a5a4453b831fdd70d189eb1.PNG" />

The app allowed you to easily find out about talks, authors, and announcements. Best yet, ALL of the questions for speakers were asked through this app. You didn’t have to raise your hand in a crowd of hundreds and deafen your neighbor by shouting a question at the speakers and you DEFINITELY didn’t have to line up at a microphone stand and wait patiently for time to run out before you had a chance to ask your question, forcing you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oabcM9SOF-E" target="_blank">Charlie-Brown-George-Michael away.</a>

<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Vialogues/photo-2_d92d75b22faf43d68378b4fbce903a77.PNG" />

The idea was that, during a talk, audience members would direct questions at a presenter. Immediately after the talk, Jamin would go through the questions (on the spot) and ask the presenter what he thought were the best ones. He did have to prod and remind everyone throughout the conference that they could/should be taking advantage of this feature, and often times only 1 or 2 people posted any questions. 

If you asked a question but it was not picked to be read aloud, [the nice] speakers would answer them in the app. Here’s a question I asked to Mark Hebert: 

<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Vialogues/photo-3_8442bbe33a9d4240967e3e3e68f97f15.PNG" />


</div>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example4');">
<b> TL;DR</b></a>
<div id="example4" style="display:none">

I went to a service design conference wherein the format was as educational as the content. 

In all, it was a worthwhile way to spend 2 days. This isn’t the last you’ve heard from me (us) about service design, but I promise no more epics.
