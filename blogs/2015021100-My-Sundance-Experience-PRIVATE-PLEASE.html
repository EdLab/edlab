            In December of last year, I was awarded a Sundance Post-Production grant for my documentary film project, “The Road From Hainan,” and I was selected to attend the 2015 Sundance Film Festival as a fellow of the documentary program. Now that I've been back for a while and had a chance to recover from the whirlwind of meetings and seminars, Luke asked if I could share some of my experiences on the blog. So, here goes:

Departure 

My flight to Denver from New York was at 7 AM, so I had to get to the airport around 5 AM. Half of the people waiting at the gate seemed to be reading magazines like “Cinematographer,” “Filmmaker's Magazine,” or “Cinema Scope.” On the plane, the couple seated next to me were working hard on their laptops. I peeked at the guy's computer and saw the Sundance logo on the top of the document. I almost blurted out, “Hey, are you going to Sundance? Me too!” But I restrained myself, as I didn't want them to remember me as that creepy person who was watching them on the plane. 

When I switched planes in Denver, there seemed to be even more filmmakers around — everybody was talking about the Sundance film schedule, and I spotted even more filmmaking magazines. On the plane, everybody seemed to know each other; people bumping into each other in the aisles would exchange familiar glances or greetings, which made the flight seem like it was on its way to a class reunion. 

Arrival 

We arrived at Salt Lake City around 1pm. An hour later, the driver dropped me off at the Sundance film festival headquarters. I had to pick up my credentials at the DFP office. There I met the staff I'd been communicating with on the phone in person for the first time. After some small talk and taking a few moments to take in the scenery, I met the director of a film pitching workshop. I didn't know who he was at the time, but he said he read about my project and was impressed by the story, and he looked forward to our meeting in the coming days. This felt like a good start to the week.
 
Day1
The first day was mainly informal meetings with documentary program alumni. At the party, I saw the two people who sat next to me on the plane and found out that they were producers from a film that was nominated for an Oscar last year. They would be advisors in the pitching workshop the next day in which I'd pitch and they would give me feedback. This was exciting, but also a bit intimidating. I regretted that I didn't say something to them on the plane. I guess the lesson of this experience is to take networking opportunities at the risk of seeming creepy.

Day 2
The pitching workshop began early in the morning, and I felt that I did well. I got a lot of good feedback, and people seemed to be quite interested in my film's story. It was a pleasant surprise, as I was quite nervous after overthinking how I would present my story the night before. 

Later in the day I went to a social impact workshop that focused on how filmmakers can maximize the potential impact their films can have on audiences and on social issues. There I learned of the existence of a job called, “Impact Producer,” which is the title given to a person whose sole job is to help increase the impact of a film. Before this meeting, my assumption was that impact was something that either happened or didn't happen as the result of a film's release. This workshop demonstrated to me how much time and money is required if a filmmaker hopes that his or her work will be truly impactful. 

Day 3
We met with film festival programmers from the Toronto Film festival, Human Rights Watch Film Festival, Full Frame Documentary Festival, New York Film Festival, and a few others. 
They talked about what they were looking for in the films they were programming for their festivals, what the trends are in contemporary documentary filmmaking, who their audiences are, etc. We had another chance to pitch our stories, which was quite an incredible opportunity considering that under normal circumstances, these programmers make their selections from thousands upon thousands of submissions.  

Day4-Day 5
Both of these days were packed with industry meetings. From 9 AM to 4 PM, I met with funders, broadcasters, and distributors. The people in the industry who decide which films get made, which films get funded, and which films get sold all were gathered together in a single conference room. These were the people who were behind the films I saw at theatres and on Netflix. It felt like seeing the people behind the curtain. 

Each meeting was like a speed date; they lasted 30 minutes, and when the time was out, a staff member would ring a bell, and I'd switch to another table. Each conversation started with an introduction and my pitch for my film. At the end of the day, I gathered all of the business cards from my meetings and tried to figure out the next step. It was exhausting. 
 
Day 6
The sixth day was a strategic planning workshop. I didn't know what “strategic planning” meant, exactly, until I got there. The lecturer was from an organization that funded artists and their career development. The lecturer's point was that if they planned strategically, artists could be financially successful as well as creatively. I found this message to be particularly uplifting, and I appreciated that it was included in the lineup for the week's workshops. 



My biggest regret from the experience was that I missed out on most of the films I wanted to see because of my busy schedule.  I shouldn't complain, what with all of the intensive workshops and the opportunities to meet so many of the gatekeepers of the documentary film industry, but it would have been nice to see what some of this year's big docs are. 

To me, the biggest surprise from the whole week was that Sundance is more like grad school than a festival. During the production of my first film, I've enjoyed every aspect of the filmmaking process, from pre-production to production and post-production. It wasn't until the completion of the film did I realize that filmmaking is a strange hybrid of art and business. It never occurred to me while making the film that I would have to develop a completely separate skill set that would enable me to find the funds I needed to finish the film and to get it distributed. My experience as a fellow at Sundance revealed to me how much more I have to learn about the process and how important it is to be prepared to seize opportunities when they present themselves.  

The genesis of the film
I came to the United States in 2011 to study documentary; I wanted to develop my ability to tell untold stories in China. In the summer of 2013, I returned to China to make my first documentary. I contacted a human rights activist, Ye Haiyan (AKA Sparrow), who has become nationally and internationally known for her advocacy for sex workers' rights, migrant workers' rights, and children's rights. In 2006, she founded China's Grassroots Women's Rights Organization, the first organization of its kind in China. She went to work at a brothel for free to offer sex for migrant workers and live-blogged her experience at the brothel in order to expose the working conditions of poor sex workers and migrant workers. I was hoping to make a film in which she would be a main subject; through the window of her activism we would see a socially disadvantaged group whose voices are rarely heard. 

When I arrived in China and when we finally met up, she was busy responding to a breaking news story in the island of Hainan: six elementary school girls had allegedly been raped by their principal. 

“THE ROAD FROM HAINAN” -Storyline
The film opens in Hainan Province as Sparrow and her colleagues demonstrate in front of the school.   Knowing that Sparrow was already known as one of the most famous advocates for sex workers in the country and that her twitter messages shaming China over women's rights are followed by tens of thousands of people, the local police did not prevent the protest.  But as soon as she leaves Hainan, Sparrow is arrested and detained.  Her lawyers work to release her while they also try to find the parents of the victimized girls who have been pressured by State security to remain silent. 

At each turn, the activists are followed and harassed by the police.  As part of the travelling group, a young Chinese filmmaker Nanfu Wang captures each confrontation with her camera, which reveals among other things, just how many undercover security agents are working the streets.  Throughout the film there are scenes where security agents threaten Wang, interrogate her, and confiscate and break her cameras.  Shooting with a close observational mode and adding a personal voice over, Wang narrates this human rights travelogue between the provinces of Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hubei.

Sparrow's eventual release spells more trouble as a hired mob demonstrates outside of her house.  Balancing this struggle for rights and expression, there are also touching and humorous moments of everyday life where Sparrow is just trying to care for her 12-year-old daughter thrown into this storm since Sparrow is evicted from her home.  Her daughter Yaxin gets a crash course in women's human rights in China. As the activists travel to several locations, they are repeatedly arrested, evicted, and forced back on the road.   At the end of the film, the lawyers eventually locate one of the fathers of the abused girls and travel back to Hainan to interview him in a powerful and heartbreaking testimony.  And Sparrow has nowhere to turn except to travel back to her home village, a place she has not seen in years.   

In the film's coda, the story jumps to the spring of 2014 as Sparrow's belongings, stranded alongside the road in the middle of the film, were later purchased by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and reassembled at the Brooklyn Museum in New York as an installation to protest freedom of expression and to honor the activism of courageous women in China today.
