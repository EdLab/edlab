          <p>
            I am pretty elated to share with you the feedback I received for Author Feedback. First of all it was well received and everybody appreciated the idea of a tool like Author Feedback.

Main ideas that were shared were
1) Make Author Feedback Tool accessible to people without having to submit the Final paper so that they can change the paper on their own timeline and submit it finally to the Evaluator System.
2) Automatic Author Feedback Tool should intelligently recommend peer reviewers before the paper gets uploaded finally for the editorial team to look at. Reviewers should be picked up based on the category(For e.g. Administration, Education, etc) the paper is selected into.
3) Include Social Networking concept where authors are able to connect to authors who have like minded interests.
4) Evaluate: What is the likelihood of a paper getting accepted/rejected and check whether the paper gets finally rejected/accepted by the editorial team of the journal. This would give a measure as to how much successful the tool is in estimating the papers outcome which would help authors in waiting for the journal to approve or withdraw from the journal.

More of a comment were
1) Use of LSA and topical categorization for suggesting the categories which the papers fall into, rather then reinventing the wheel.
So for e.g. there has been prior research done for finding out which paper fits which conference (based on topical categorization).
2) Is it feasible to make it open source for other system/journals to benefit.
3) Include the accepted paper review too.
