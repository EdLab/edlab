            <b>When ETS Meets TFA…</b>
If there was a software that proofreads your paper, would you use it?  It can't provide suggestions on qualitative areas like argument, word choice, voice, and so on, but Educational Testing Service claims that its new online evaluation tool helps to improve writing skills.  

<a href=https://proofwriter.ets.org/index.php>Proof Writer</a> is an online tool that gives feedback on grammar usage, mechanics, and style — all within seconds at a click of a button.  To market this product, <a href=http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.c988ba0e5dd572bada20bc47c3921509/?vgnextoid=2e40e98adabaf110VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&vgnextchannel=dd2d253b164f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD>ETS and Teach for America have recently entered a joint venture.</a>  At first I thought this marketing strategy would include allowing TFA corps members trial access to aid their teaching — well, not exactly and maybe just not yet.  ETS is currently encouraging prospective TFA corps members to receive feedbacks on their application essays from ProofWriter at a low fee.  

Couldn't help but to question what ETS would or could do with all the essays that enters the ProofWriter system.  So I decided to read the terms and conditions, ha!

I'll leave the rest to you:
<blockquote>4. Users of the Service
You shall be solely responsible for whom you permit to be users of the PROOFWRITER service and You agree that to be responsible and liable for all users of the PROOFWRITER service. You agree that the privacy of user information, essays, and feedback is the sole responsibility of You and those individuals whom you permit to use the PROOFWRITER Service. <u>ETS does not share user with anyone other than to You, your own information and the information regarding your users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ETS shall retain the right to use any non-personally identifiable information collected as a result of the PROOFWRITER service for research and development purposes.</u></blockquote>                
 
<b>iPhone-App-a-Day</b>
<a href=http://www.squarewheelsoft.com/nextread/nextread.html>Next Read</a> is for those who love to read and could use some help organizing the interest.  Let's see, there's actually a lot you can do with this.  It allows you to 1) search books the Amazon way; 2) rank books by the value of suggestions and recommendation sources according to your own scoring system; 3) add books to your reading list, and 4) share the list with whomever you'd like.  Feature no.2 — organizing other people's reviews according to your own scoring system — sounds like an excellent idea.
