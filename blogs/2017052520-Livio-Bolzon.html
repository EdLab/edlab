Livio Bolzon is a co-founder of <a href="https://codemoji.com">Codemoji</a>, a coding platform that encourages students to focus on building intuitive and relatable emojis. The ultimate goal is for students to focus on creating and building code and mastering its fundamentals. Codemoji is his first enterprise. Bolzon is currently taking courses at Northwestern University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Codemoji?</b><br>
<p>While at college in St.Louis, I took business classes and computer science classes. The CS classes helped me come up with the idea for Codemoji.com. Most of the stuff I learned that has helped us grow codemoji was learned while doing. In the early years of college, you don't learn anything that will really help you launch a startup.</p>
 
<p><b>What motivated you to choose emojis as a way for students to learn coding?</b><br>
<p>Emojis are fun and we felt that students would be able to stay more engaged. We also thought that we could explain complex concepts to the students at the same time, but still keep it fun. Also emojis give us a lot of room to make add-ons to our platform and bring in different emojis. I think emojis are awesome and students and teachers are using them more and more as a language. I do not see emojis going anywhere anytime soon.</p>  
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think that we will see more schools teaching coding to their students, but I think we will also see more focus on outcomes. I think this because right now many of the coding platforms used in school do not focus on outcomes and, as a result, coding has become stranded. From this, schools will need to prove that students are learning more to justify investing time on coding.</p> 
 
<p><b>What were some initial challenges in starting Codemoji and how did you overcome those challenges?</b><br>
<p>The biggest challenge with codemoji was finding all the right people that wanted to build this into something amazing and help a lot of students along the way. Also, Codemoji operates on a very small budget, so we had to overcome that while still trying to compete against some of the larger coding platforms for kids. </p> 

<p><b>What is next on the horizon for Codemoji?</b><br>
<p>The whole Codemoji team is working on new products both for the web and physical products for the classroom to teach students in a different way. Going forward, Codemoji is looking to approach larger schools districts and have our product be more widely used by schools and teachers across the U.S. and abroad.</p>
