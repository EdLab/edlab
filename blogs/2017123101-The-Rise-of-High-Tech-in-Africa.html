            <p class="p1">Africa has not seen the full potential in the rise of technology yet. This has provided enormous
opportunities for innovators longing to diversify the use of technology in
Africa. Take the story of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/12/africa-technology-revolution/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=link_twp20171218ngm-Africatech2&amp;utm_campaign=Content&amp;sf176705941=1"><span class="s2">Karuiki</span></a>. He was born in a farming village where
electricity was scarce. His superb grades in primary school qualified him to
attend a prestigious high school. A teacher gave him the key to the computer
lab where he learned to code regularly. Karuiki eventually moved to
Kigali, Rwanda. He landed a job designing an automated ticketing system for the
city's bus system. However, Kigali's transit was unreliable and often
overcrowded. Due to the inefficiency of the transit system, Karuiki and
his colleague thought about how to they could provide the city with an
Uber-like motorcycle that was efficient, affordable, and safe. After Karuiki
created a promotional video describing the concept, an American venture
capitalist expressed interest and the rest, as they say, is history. Today the
startup is the first and largest motorcycle ride-sharing company in Africa. Additionally,
gross revenue for 2017 is projected to be over a million dollars. The emergence
of the high-speed internet has inspired innovators such as Karuiki to develop
ideas that can improve many lives. With the continent poised to be the fastest
growing continent in the world, there is no better time than now for its
budding innovators. </p>
