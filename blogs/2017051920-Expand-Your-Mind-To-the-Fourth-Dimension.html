<p>Some mathematical concepts are almost too difficult to wrap your mind around, and for me (a former math student with terrible spatial recognition), 4D objects are one of them. <a href="http://fourthdimensionapp.com">The Fourth Dimension</a> is an interactive digital book solely designed to explain this topic. It hopes to literally expand your mind.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The Fourth Dimension app is a 30-page digital book that, instead of relying on static images or videos, requires you to interact with each page. These activities bring more clarity to the concept, as readers can learn while doing instead of passively taking in. On top of that, the information is well scaffolded, beginning with easy-to-understand points and working up toward the full complexity of the fourth dimension. To explain the concept, The Fourth Dimension discusses what the first, second, and third dimensions are and constantly refers back to easily digestible concepts to explain the fourth dimension. It also gives you clear directions on how to approach each activity, and at several times instructs you to reread certain passage until you understand.</p>
 
<p>In addition, The Fourth Dimension has a simple but pleasant interface, sound effects, and the type of nerdy humor that charms you and makes you laugh. For instance, just before you first expand a shape into the fourth-dimensional space, the app notes, "In the event that you observe worrisome fractures opening up in the spacetime continuum in your vicinity, please turn off your iPad at once." This brings entertainment to what could easily be a dry explanation.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While The Fourth Dimension does the most it can to explain the concept, readers might still be confused on the topic after finishing the book for the first time. It’s such a difficult topic to grasp that this is understandable, but users should note that it might take a few run-throughs before feeling like they get it right. Also, the app is $2.99, which might compel some people to Google the concept rather than buy the app. While I think the scaffolding and clear explanations make the cost worth it to those who really want to master the concept, it might not be worth the price for the casual user.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The Fourth Dimension provides a clear explanation of an incredibly complex mathematical concept. Although it might take users a few read-throughs to feel confident with this idea, the book guides readers through the information in an easy-to-follow way. You’ll be sure to understand the fourth dimension better after reading through it. Now, I’m off to go draw some tessaracts.</p>
