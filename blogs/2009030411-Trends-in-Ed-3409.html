            <b>Museums Turn Visitors into Game Players</b>
A couple of weeks ago, a friend forwarded me <a href=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99244253>an NPR article</a> about museum professionals incorporating alternate reality game concepts to turn their patrons' visits into an interactive educational experience.  Since today's seminar is on games, today's Trends in Ed is a nod to that effort. 

<b>Case-in-Practice @ The Smithsonian American Art Museum</b>
<a href=http://ghostsofachance.com/>Ghosts of a Chance</a> is an alternate reality game which invites players to create handmade artifacts to unlock stories that will safeguard the museum from restless spirits.  Recreating artifacts alone would be just an arts and craft activity, but add a twist of scavenger hunt and voila: the museum collection gives a part of the clues (to find out what and how they need to recreate) and players are encouraged to communicate using cell phones to break different codes as a team.  

From July to October of last year, players solved clues that were planted on Facebook, YouTube and other multimedia/social networking websites and the results are on display <a href=http://ghostsofachance.com/main_site/index.php>here</a>.  Although the large-scaled game is over now, the museum-sponsored game will continue to be available to the public by appointment for groups and individuals can also participate in the monthly walk-in game.  
 
<b>iPhone-App-a-Day</b>
New Zealand's National Museum, Te Papa, created a new interactive exhibition called <a href=http://www.ourspace.tepapa.com>Our Space</a>, and there is an <a href= http://appbeacon.com/apps/001350/our-space>iPhone app</a> that allows people to get into their exhibition space by allowing users to take photos and send them to friends.  It would be more interesting and participatory if users can send them to the museum for a collective display.  It's free so I downloaded and tried it. The simplicity of it took me by surprise and I thought it was more of an interactive play than anything artistic or educational, but such an approach to drawing patrons to participate virtually is surely a trend.
