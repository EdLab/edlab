            <strong>Title</strong>: The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks

<strong>Author</strong>: Rebecca Skloot

<strong>Publisher</strong>:  Broadway

<strong>Call number: </strong><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=The+immortal+life+of+Henrietta+Lacks&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit" target="_blank">RC265.6.L24 S55 2011</a>

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a  poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave  ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the  most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown  in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for  more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a  scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a  hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the  polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom  bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro  fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold  by the billions.

Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

Now  Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored”  ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories  with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying  hometown of Clover, Virginia—a land of wooden slave quarters, faith  healings, and voodoo—to East Baltimore today, where her children and  grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.

Henrietta’s  family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years  after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her  husband and children in research without informed consent. And though  the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human  biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As  Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family—past  and present—is inextricably connected to the dark history of  experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the  legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.

Over  the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in  the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah,  who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed  with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when  researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space?  What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at  the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why  couldn’t her children afford health insurance?

Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.
