<strong><a title="From the Publisher" href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/graphic_novels/?gn=1736">From the Publisher</a></strong>: Y: THE LAST MAN, winner of three Eisner Awards and one of the most critically acclaimed, best-selling comic books series of the last decade, is that rare example of a page-turner that is at once humorous, socially relevant and endlessly surprising.

Written by Brian K. Vaughan (Lost, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD, EX MACHINA) and with art by Pia Guerra, this is the saga of Yorick Brown—the only human survivor of a planet-wide plague that instantly kills every mammal possessing a Y chromosome. Accompanied by a mysterious government agent, a brilliant young geneticist and his pet monkey, Ampersand, Yorick travels the world in search of his lost love and the answer to why he's the last man on earth

This volume of the critically acclaimed series collects issues #49-53! Yorick and Agent 355 prepare for their ultimate quest to reunite the last man with his lost love, while the person, people or thing behind the disaster that wiped out half of humanity is revealed

<strong><a title="About the Author" href="http://marvel.wikia.com/Brian_K._Vaughan">About the Author</a></strong>:  Brian K. Vaughan (born 1976, in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American comic book writer best known for the series <em>Y: The Last Man, Ex Machina, Runaways</em>, and <em>Pride of Baghdad</em>.

As an undergraduate film student at New York University, Vaughan took part in Marvel's Stan-hattan Project, a class for fledgling comic book writers that also helped Joe Kelly break into comic books. Vaughan's first credit was Cable #43 (May 1997).

Vaughan has written for most of the major DC and Marvel characters, including Batman and the X-Men. He has also written several screenplays, stage plays, and short stories, but mostly he prefers writing comic books. He has stated in an interview with Wizarduniverse.com that he prefers to write his own creations like <em>Y: The Last Man</em> and <em>Ex Machina</em> because he doesn't think he's the best at using his "voice" with company-owned characters. Vaughan was hired in late 2006 as an executive story editor for the television series Lost.
