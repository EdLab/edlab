          <p>
            For low-income high school students, applying for college always seems difficult as their schools usually don't have a college counselor and students are unlikely to get advice from their parents.  But now it seems that technology can help them out, in a more entertaining way than traditional counseling.  A USC professor and game designer Tracy Fullerton claimed that college admission process is just like a game that is usually played once at such high stakes. This idea is exactly what drives <a href="http://collegeology.usc.edu/">Collegeology</a>, a leading game lab at University of Southern California, to develop college counseling tools for low-income students who don't have access to traditional college counseling and need application strategies that help them shine among thousands of competitors.

The idea is also motivational, as students receive college application advice in a fun and snarky environment. This time, Collegeolgy will make an eye-catching move to combine the game with Facebook by launching a new college counseling tool called Mission Admission. By playing around, students could not only learn, but probably also share their strategies, experience, and testimonials with their friends among their Facebook network.
