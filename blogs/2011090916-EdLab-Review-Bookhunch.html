            <a href="http://bookhunch.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee401/lacostello/th_bookhunch-250x134.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket" ></a>

<a href="http://bookhunch.com/">Bookhunch</a> is meant to be a social, crowdsourced review site for new and unpublished literature. Readers are able to leave their mark on the in-site book display to interact with other users and earn points for additional access privileges. There are very few books available on the site right now, but if they gain access to the exclusive pre-pub content they're after, a big user community should follow. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The concept seems very cool and it's currently invitation-only (mine a few days after I requested it) so they've built a very engaged user-base that seems to reflect the ultimate purpose of the site. Users leave insightful comments against an in-site view of the book content. Most of their books are public domain, but as the site develops it should be easier for users to find interesting content. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The interface leaves something to be desired. The single-page book view is flush with the left side of the screen and makes the page look skewed. Comments, instead of being shown as you read, are grouped in an easy-to-miss hyperlink. The site is also very simple, perhaps to a fault. It's difficult to understand the purpose of the site based on the <a href="http://bookhunch.com/about.html"><i>About</i></a> feature and there's no blog or FAQ content. I'd like to see a more robust, customizable UI with view options for the book, but that may come in time. The site is very new and has the construction excitement of a developing project.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
This is another example of a potential future concept for publishing. I think this could be useful for self publishing, especially if users are able to comment-edit. It may also have educational applications; I would love to see an in-class Bookhunch conversation, especially considering the classic content that's available now. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Bookhunch is developing a social community around reading online. It's too soon to tell what kind of community and what kind of reading will be featured, but it is an idea with a lot of potential.
