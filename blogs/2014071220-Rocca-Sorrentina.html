<b>Lands of the Past</b><br>
Propelled by the low-cost of building spaces in <a  href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life</a>, the Missouri Humanities Council engaged with digital and historic experts, researchers, and educators from a wide range of backgrounds to create an 18th century Italian coastal island called <a href="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2013/11/3-virtual-environment-platforms-that-inspire-learning/">Rocca Sorrentina</a>. The Missouri Humanities Council received donations from Dr. Kathy Spoehr and Dr. Luther Spoehr of Brown University that made the project possible. Though widely researched, the applications for Second Life in the field of education have, as of yet, not found a strong foothold. Now, however, the island has become a leading example for teachers and students and is finding a place in schools. So let’s take a step back into the past, and see what it’s like to pretend to breathe and live in a world that no longer exists…. 
<p>
Curated and imaginatively developed, the island is run by the executive director of the Missouri Humanities Council, Geoff Giglieranao (known as Aldo Stern in Second Life) and Kathy Spoehr, a cognitive science professor from Brown University (known as Serenek Timeless in Second Life). People, or sims as they are called in Second Life, attend organized public events held five times a month. Activities include discussions on the culture, history and literature of the Renaissance. Rocca Sorrentina now has a community that "lives" there and the six hundred to eight hundred visitors a month can explore, among other attractions, the cabinet of curiosities, a sword cutler’s shop (recreated based on information from <a href="http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=780" > Diderot’s Encyclopedia</a>) and fencing. There is a replica of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Capra_%22La_Rotonda%22">Andrea Palladio’s Villa Capra La Rotonda</a> that has beautiful gardens, music recitals, poetry readings and lavish dinners. The art galleries have regular rotating exhibits and sims can purchase period pieces and clothing from the stores. 
<p>
<b>Pedagogical Implications</b><br>
Beyond being a beautiful place to visit, Rocca Sorrentina is an immersive, experience-based learning environment.  Students are given period clothes to wear.  The island is currently used by teachers and researchers from across the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan, and it has emerged as a cost effective way to implement experience-based learning in the humanities. Students learn about history, literature and the humanities through immersion and play; they lounge in the Academie reading history and poetry, observe grand architecture, and frequent art museums with rotating galleries. By observing, interacting and exploring, students can more fully immerse themselves in the texts and concepts they are learning about in their humanities classes. Students direct their learning and engage in imaginative play. By taking on the lives of historical figures (i.e., playing dress-up and attending events) and by finding resources (i.e., in the library) their curiosity drives their education. 
<p>
Virtual environments from different historical periods aim to marry the extensive knowledge of historians and scholars with the advanced design and immersive experience capacity of online virtual spaces like Second Life. These virtual spaces will be sure to change the landscape of education.
