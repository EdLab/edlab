<b>Preparing Kids for the Future</b><br>
The first five years of a child’s life are some of the most important, which is why Hillary Clinton, representing the <a href="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/">Clinton Foundation</a>, teamed up with <a href="http://thenextgeneration.org/">Next Generation</a> to create <a href="http://toosmall.org/about">Too Small to Fail</a>.  This initiative, founded in January 2012, aims to improve the health of children ages zero to five.  In order to achieve better conditions for these children, Too Small to Fail works to provide parents and businesses with research on children’s brain development and how nutrition and health play a role in that development.  This age group is one of the most important because this stage helps define how the child will develop later in life. By providing caregivers of young children with information on how to improve their child’s physical and mental health, this early childhood initiative hopes to prepare the next generation for their future.  
<p>
<b>Using Social Media to Deliver Research Results</b><br>
Too Small to Fail works to reach out to these parents and other caregivers and businesses invested in childcare in innovative ways through social media. For example, they use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/2smalltofail?ref=ts&fref=ts">Facebook</a> and <a href=" https://twitter.com/2SmallToFail">Twitter</a> to provide quick updates on new research in the field.  Through these short posts, which include links to research articles (See an <a href="https://twitter.com/2SmallToFail/status/350010515134750720">example tweet</a>), the group can deliver timely, interesting and useful content to parents and caregivers.  For example, tips might include simple ways to create nurturing child/caregiver relationships. 
<p>
<b>How Can This Help our Future?</b><br>
By providing parents with resources on early learning and health, Too Small to Fail hopes to help the next generation become healthy and successful in the 21st century.  In order to accomplish this goal, the project works to promote a number of things including: national discussion about early childhood development, the importance of nutrition and health for young children, and the benefit of taking small actions proven to improve learning and health in children. Too Small to Fail is definitely a step toward bringing greater awareness regarding how to boost the health and learning conditions for young children.  Parents can use their suggestions to better understand early brain development, and organizations can use the research the group conducts to figure out ways to improve conditions for families. With their help, parents and both for-profit and non-profit organizations can work together to help better prepare the next generation for their future.
