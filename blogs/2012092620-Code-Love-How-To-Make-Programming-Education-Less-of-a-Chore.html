<b>Title:</b> Teaching the novice programmer: A study of instructional sequences and perception <br>
 
<b> Author: </b> D. A. Kranch, 2012 <br>
<p>
<p>

It’s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/overblown-claims-of-failure-watch-how-not-to-gauge-the-success-of-online-courses/260159/">no secret</a> that online programming education courses can be overwhelming to the tech-inexperienced, but how can we help guide and retain new coders? <a href="http://www.springerlink.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/content/588366603h23u1k5/fulltext.pdf?MUD=MP">Teaching the novice programmer</a> summarizes the findings of a study that used a group of college-age programing novices to test for the optimal chunking and content in an introductory online course. The students were recruited from a traditionally tech-averse discipline and evaluated for three criteria found to influence programming skill in prior studies: math skill, programming self esteem, and time spent playing video games. The author presented rearranged instructional sequences to three statistically similar groups of these students and had them rate the effort and difficulty for each module. 
<p>
The author was looking for particular differences in the way novices and expert programmers think, chunk learning programs, and analyze code. The researchers examined the code-analysis patterns of expert programmers against the top 5 performers in each of their test groups to see if any particular learning strategy allowed their novice programmers to think more like experienced programmers. Unfortunately, the author found that the arrangement of the content and modules had no effect on the retention or analysis of fledgling coders. He did find that novices found syntax easier and more pleasant and retained more theory than actual programming in their first few lessons. This could be a valuable insight for course design. Instructors shouldn’t be afraid to focus on syntax and structure first and generously delve into theory before rolling out the code. 
<p>
Programing education has moved to the mainstream with the rise of tools like Codeacademy and the growing prominence of online programming MOOCs like those recently offered by Coursera, Udacity, and EdX. As programming takes a more central place in education, more research is needed to discover the best ways to teach and retain early students. This study offered some new insights, both into the process of learning code and the eventual brain changes that result from becoming a coding expert, but the findings suggest that there’s much room for innovation in course organization.
