            Monetary policy is defined as the actions taking by  central banks to control macroeconomic policy objectives such as price stability, full employment, and stable economic growth. The federal reserve is the central bank and they are responsible to establish stability in pricing and and employment.These objective are referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. The  Federal Reserve acts as an independent agency of the federal government away from much of political influences. Fiscal policy is a broad term used to refer to the tax and spending policies of the federal government. Fiscal policy decisions are determined by the Congress and the Administration; the Federal Reserve plays no role in determining fiscal policy.

Fiscal Policy is very important in order the government to earn revenue and service the country.
The Federal Reserve uses a variety of policy tools to foster its statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. One of its main policy tools is the target for the federal funds rate which is the rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans. The Federal Reserve's control over the federal funds rate gives it the ability to influence the general level of short-term market interest rates. In the long term economic outlook  adjusting the level of short-term interest rates allows the Federal Reserve to influence longer-term interest rates and key asset prices. These changes in financial conditions then affect the spending decisions of households and businesses.
