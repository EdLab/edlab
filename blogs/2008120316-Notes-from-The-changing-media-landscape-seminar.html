          <p>
            I took the following notes during Duy Linh Tu's EdLab seminar presentation today, and I thought I'd share:

<b>The changing media landscape</b>
From 1995 through 2005 we accessed online material primarily by navigating to a homepage and clicking through it until we found what we were looking for. Since 2005, the experience of surfing the web has changed dramatically because of RSS. Today, only 20% of people get to online information through a bookmark. The other 80% get it through RSS or a search engine. With RSS, content is organized to fit onto the small screen of a Blackberry or other mobile device. This increases the importance of a good headline. Headlines must match the simple "noun-verb-noun" structure to get the point across quickly in limited RSS feeds. Headlines can no longer rattle on in the old "pun-colon-statement" style (so beloved by academics).
Suddenly, headline writers have double the work (they have to rewrite their headlines to make sense for RSS feeds).
<b>Write for the audience</b>
Now, you have to write content for audiences who use mobile devices. You have to respond to not just how people use your information, but how they will find it and consume it.
Using Google Trends, you can see how people search for items. If you're selling anything, you need to know what people call it, and how they write it. You have to eliminate all the jargon.
Here's an example: <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=%22skinny+jeans%22%2C+%22tight+jeans%22">"skinny jeans" vs "tight jeans."</a>. Notice how this new phrase ("skinny jeans"), previously meaningless, became the predominant way to describe a product over a period of a few years.
An institution;s imposed style guide can be a problem when you depend on readers to find material through a web search.
Example: <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=%22nba%22%2C+%22n.b.a.%22&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0">"nba" vs "n.b.a."</a>
The New York Times style guide requires that abbreviations always contain a period after each letter. This ensures that google searches will not give priority to NBA-related content when visitors they search for "N.B.A."
<b>Social bookmarking</b>
Social bookmarking sites such as Digg are a good indicator of what an audience likes. Mainstream media is now having to adopt these new communities. One example is the BBC - every online article provides the opportunity to add the piece to a social bookmarking site.
Social bookmarking forces the traditional media to compete with the little guys.
Before, there was no way to know how many people read a print piece in a newspaper. Now you can quantify that.

Should content producers worry about what the masses think? Should we as content creators give people what we think they need, or do we give them what they want?
