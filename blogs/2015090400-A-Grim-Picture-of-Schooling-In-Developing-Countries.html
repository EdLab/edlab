            As the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) readies to conclude at the end of the year, the focus has shifted to sustainable development goods and post 2015 agenda. One of the MDGs goals was to achieve universal primary education. Safe to say, a lot of countries will not meet this target come December 31, 2015. Recent studies have showed many African children are motivated to attend school. However, they are not learning in school. According to <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/09/17-africa-education-crisis-van-fleet" target = "blank">figures</a>, 40 percent or more of children's in seven countries do not meet the minimum standard of learning by grades 4 or 5.  Over half of in-school students in countries such as Ethiopia and Nigeria are not learning basic skills by the end of primary school. There are many challenges facing education in Africa and the rest of the developing world. 

Due to economics constraints, many countries cannot make education free to all students.  In those countries where it is free, there is a lack of learning due to many factors such as lack of quality teachers. For example, in my native Guinea there are more private schools than public. Publics schools are not only crowded but also lack school resources such as books, quality  teachers and buses to ease transportations.
