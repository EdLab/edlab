          <p>
            After recording approximately eight percent growth in GDP in the past few years according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India is now considered one of the most promising economies in the world. It is estimated that by 2022, 700 million Indians of working age will be seeking to earn a livelihood, of which only 200 million would be college graduates. In order to sustain and further facilitate the growth of the Indian economy, there is a dire need to improve the higher education system in the country. India's higher education system ranks the third largest in the world in terms of number of students.

However, one of the biggest issues facing the higher education system is the central tenet that it revolves around. It focuses on examinations at every level as opposed to empowering students with skills they can readily apply once they step into the workforce.

The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) was formed in 2009, announced by the Finance Minister in his 2008-09 Budget speech, in order to contribute to skilling/up-skilling 30 percent of the targeted Indians who will be seeking to earn a livelihood. Even though the NSDC has managed to train approximately 100,000 people in 220 districts across India by 2012, the common man doesn't yet have accessibility to these skill development programs. A bulk of the skills-related training is fragmented and restricted to a very small set of people. It is also being carried out by corporations to meet in-house requirements. This situation requires consolidation and scale, which can be achieved by utilizing Internet based solutions to reach remote areas.
