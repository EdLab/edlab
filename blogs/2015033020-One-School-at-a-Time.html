<p>In some regions, one of the biggest challenges to education is just providing students with access to a classroom. In too many communities throughout the world, it’s not unusual to find students learning in run-down and makeshift learning spaces. This is compounded by other problems like weak government education policies and infrastructure, especially in remote villages where delivering supplies can be difficult. Often the responsibility of meeting basic educational needs is taken on by nonprofit organizations. </p>

<p><a href="https://pencilsofpromise.org/">Pencils of Promise</a> is one such <i>for-purpose</i> organization that is hard at work ensuring students in developing countries enjoy safe and clean learning environments. Initially focused on countries in Asia and then Latin America, the program now extends to Africa. In fact, the scope of their work has grown so much that they are able to build a school every 90 hours in impoverished communities internationally—an enormous task that is largely financed by individual donor contributions.</p>

<p>How are organizations such as Pencils of Promise able to build so many schools? And should this be the work of nonprofits, governments, or a combination of both? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/19776">Join the discussion on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>00:21 MartinPaper:</b> I think this is a very important lesson for organizations and startups everywhere: start with one thing and do it incredibly well. Only after this should you think about expanding! </p>

<p><b>01:15 bizapp:</b> I am curious as to what other support Pencils of Promise provide the school once it is built. Since most of the schools are built in remote and impoverished communities, I am sure there is a lot of work that will go into maintaining the school and ensuring students are learning in a good environment. </p>

<p><b>01:30 sarpong18:</b> This is an important endeavor by the founders of Pencils of Promise. Having grown up in a developing country, I am all too well aware of the problems facing students in and out of the classroom. It would be great to see the schools equipped with some technology to make it feel a little bit more like a 21st century school. </p>
