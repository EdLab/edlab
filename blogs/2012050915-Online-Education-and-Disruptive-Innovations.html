In this week's issue of the New Yorker, there is an article featuring <a href = "http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/14/120514fa_fact_macfarquhar">Clayton Christenson</a>, a professor and author of "The Innovator's Dilemma" (unfortunately the link is paywall-blocked).  Christenson investigated why success is so difficult to sustain among companies, and studied cases ranging from disk drive manufacturing to the steel industry.  He found that often cheaper, lower-quality, low-end, mass-produced products took over markets, labeling them "disruptive technologies."  These low-end technologies eventually improve and surpass the existing technologies.  (Examples include the transistor radio vs. vacuum tube radios, digital cameras vs. film/chemical cameras, etc.)

Christenson has applied these ideas to other industries such as healthcare, technology, and education.  He did make a failed prediction that the iPhone would not succeed, because he viewed it as a luxury, high-end version of an existing technology (cell phones), not realizing that the iPhone is a "distruptive," cheaper version of a laptop.  

An idea I find most interesting is that it is likely that online education is currently a "disruptive technology."  Currently it is cheaper, less high-quality, and more mass-produced than traditional college courses.  If the theory of disruptive technologies applies, it is only a matter of time until online education "surpasses" traditional college courses.  This argument, however, has an assumption that education is like a technology or a product, when in reality it may be a very different market than disk drives.  Any case, it is an interesting time to be involved in online education.
