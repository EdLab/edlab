<a href ="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523980802283889"> Jarmon, Leslie, Traphagan, Tomoko, Mayrath, Michael. 2008 Understanding project-based learning in Second Life with a pedagogy, training, and assessment trio. <i>Educational Media International</i>, 45(3), 157-176</a>

<b>Description:</b> This paper describes a study that uses the game Second Life for a project-based graduate interdisciplinary communication course, which turned out to be very successful according to them. The authors of this paper found that project based learning through 3-D online virtual worlds like Second Life enhanced the quality and experiences of student learning.  There seems to be more usage of Second Life as a learning tool than most people think; it is mostly used for team learning activities. According to the research done in preparation for the paper, diverse people interacting through the Internet are more likely to experience positive contact, which makes for a good argument when it comes to using most online tools for education. In terms of learning in a 3-D environment, it allows for a more experiential learning, with a chance to have social interactions with different people across the globe.

The course itself involves project-based learning where students are required to come up with different communication strategies, for which they can apply and test in the 3-D environment of Second Life that wouldn't be available in the classroom. Students wouldn't just test their interdisciplinary communication skills online but in real life as well. After the course was complete, the authors assessed the course on two levels: the first on how to use Second Life for teaching in general and the second on context-specific research on the nature of learning in Second Life. Various ways of collecting qualitative data were used including student surveys, content analysis of photos and movies taken in Second Life, a focus group, and content analysis of their worldview journal, which was assigned in class. The results were very positive with most students saying that they have learned a lot in their course through Second Life.


   
<b>Edlab Relevance:</b> I found this paper interesting because during the last Trustee rehearsals, when my group was coming up with ideas for a smart school, one of the ideas we had was having classrooms taught in a virtual world like Second life. We joked around about how learning can also be done in World of Warcraft, but it seems like that might even become a reality. Although the idea might seem silly the way it seems that there is a increasing amount of classes using Second Life as a learning tool, I even found a video on a presentation in Second Life.
