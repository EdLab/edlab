<p><i>"Code is creative. Girls are creative. Everything else is just logistics."</i> (from <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/">Made with Code</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/">Made with Code</a> is a collection of resources and media created and curated by Google and aimed at inspiring girls to code by showing the creative and practical applications of web development. The backbone of the site is a series of well-produced videos that feature "mentors" and "makers," adult women who have applied their individual passions and talent for coding to business, art, and social justice projects. There is also an area where interested girls can find coding events in their area, connect to a mentor, and find resources to begin their development journey. The project draws on strong partnerships with female empowerment organizations like Girls Inc. and the Girl Scouts of America, strong technology contacts at MIT Media Lab and Mozilla, and links to major coding groups like Black Girls Code and Code.org.</p>

<p><b>Breaking the Bro Code</b><br>
The website, with its inspiring videos and on-point resources, addresses the elephant in the room: even though technology permeates our society, women are drastically under-represented in the startups, labs, and companies pioneering the way. Moreover, even though increasingly more jobs require computer skills or are being re-imagined by developers and coders, only 1% of girls choose to major in computer sciences.</p>

<p><b>The Power of Mentors</b><br>
The videos of mentors on the site feature amazing women doing exciting work with their computer science skills. As these videos poignantly and powerfully show, women are out there changing the world in breathtaking ways, whether curing cancer or re-imagining the art form of dance. The underlying philosophy behind the site is that by showing girls all the cool and exciting work they can do with computer science skills, they will be inspired to realize their unique ambitions and dreams in the form of code.</p>
