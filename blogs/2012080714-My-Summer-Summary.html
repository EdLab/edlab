<b>Let's start at the very beginning.</b> Jo and Laura have been two of the best intern bosses of all time. They assembed a winning "team library" for this summer. I loved collaborating with Greg and Rebecca on so many projects, and I know we all appreciated the freedom we were given to explore our interests. Our time was divided into many different areas of focus, like the library, Vialogues, mSchool, fighting crime, etc. 

<b>Library.</b> Since we're librarians, we really enjoyed the range of library projects we got to tackle this summer. While permanent library staff members went on vacation, we got to step in and take over practical everyday responsibilities, like acquisitions and interlibrary loan. In additon to the hands-on education of these experiences, our frustrations with programs like Millenium and ILLiad confirmed in all of us the need to develop better library software. So we wrote a <a href="http://www.bilinguallibrarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/political-pictures-barack-obama-library-cool.jpg">17-page proposal</a> outlining the benefits of an open-source replacement for the library's <a href="http://www.alatechsource.org/blog/2006/03/how-opacs-suck-part-1-relevance-rank-or-the-lack-of-it.html">online catalog</a>, a product called <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>. Other things we did include, but are not limited to: attending the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7763">ALA Virtual Conference</a>, going on archival adventures in the sub-basement, and working on various independent projects. For example, I got to research and write a proposal for a new ebook ordering system.

<b>Vialogues.</b> Just before <a href="http://vialogues.pressible.org/joann/vialogues-officially-award-winning">AASL announced Vialogues as one of the 25 Best Websites for Teaching and Learning</a>, we planned a big promotion to spread the good news with school librarians. Part of this project included researching, emailing, and Tweeting influential school librarian bloggers, as well as creating <a href="https://vialogues.com/search/tags/?q=library">#library</a> related Vialogues. Since then, we've continued brainstorming more ideas for future Vialogues promotion and adding content to the site.

<b>mSchool.</b> Or is it Edfluences? Even though we're still not entirely certain how to explain the inner workings of the mSchool galaxy, we designed and created learning experiences for the launch of Edfluences. (But we still haven't come up a better name yet.) Along the way, we learned some exciting HTML and CSS code to trick out our Moodle courses. The courses I created include <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/moodle/course/view.php?id=1258">Google Search Strategies</a> and <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/moodle/course/view.php?id=1260">Welcome to EdLab</a>. We also had the opportunity to lead a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/mschool_dandr.pdf">weekly D&R meeting</a> to get your feedback on these learning experiences and to discuss the future of mSchool... Edfluences... alternative learning platform.

<b>Etc.</b> When we were not working on a specific project, most of my time went into researching and creating content for various EdLab streams, from blogging about MOOCs and library entrepreneurialism, to posting historical photographs on Archival Revival, to writing long-winded Research Digests for NLT on K-12 technologies, cell phones, data curation, and more! Overall, this summer introduced me to the exciting world of ed tech and has enriched my perspective on what it means to get educated. No matter what form it takes in the future, I'm looking forward to continuing to work at the intersection of creativity, learning, and technology.  

Also, I will never forget my short-lived EdLab basketball career, which famously ended in the epic accident known as the “Riverside Dive.”  In the aftermath of that experience, I learned the true awesomeness of my EdLab colleagues, as Avi taught me how to make delicious apple milkshakes while Kate boldly removed gravel out of my face. Plus, I got to take my first trip to a New York City emergency room, which was definitley enlightening. 

<b>After EdLab.</b> 

As I said in my <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8136">earlier blog post</a>, this Thursday is my last day of work at the EdLab. On Monday, I start my new job at Scholastic, which is located in SOHO. You are probably at least somewhat familiar with <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/">Scholastic</a>, the children's book publisher who brought you series like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Goosebumps, The Babysitters Club, and Clifford the Big Red Dog, to name a few. I will be working as an executive assistant for the president of trade, the main publishing division of the company. Scholastic is a wonderful company with an <a href="http://manonamission.blogspot.com/2005/07/scholastics-schl-mission-statement.html">inspiring mission statement</a>, and I am thrilled to be joining their team.
