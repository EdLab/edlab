          <p>
            I come to ponder at when I should ask for help. If I'm working on something and hit a writer's block, what's the maximum amount of time that should pass until I ask for help? For example, yesterday I was trying to get wireless internet working in Ubuntu Linux. I ended up debugging the problem in two stressful hours. Obviously at EdLab, I won't ever let that happen. I may have asked someone after 15 minutes for insight and solve the issue in a half hour.<br>
If I'm coding something at EdLab and get stuck, then as a junior developer we are encouraged to research our problem. In many cases, especially with basics, there are code snippets and similar questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> that are archived for searching. Sometimes, I may not find the answer to my question at I'm Feeling Lucky and may require an alternative Google query.<br>
At the end of the day, I want to optimize my productivity at the workplace. As long as I have an obtainable objective (Trello), then I must have the means of achieving it because the task was given to me in the first place. Could this also mean that I lack creativity in innovating new technology? I'll find out soon enough and adjust accordingly. <br>
I may find it difficult to ask for help because I don't want to seem too dependent or I don't want to snap someone out of a coding tunnel. Someone could have been daydreaming about an anti-gravity blue print for all I know and I snap them out of it, thus no more anti-gravity gun.
