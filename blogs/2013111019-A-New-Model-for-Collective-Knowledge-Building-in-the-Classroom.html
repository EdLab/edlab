<p><b>Title:</b> Designs for Collective Cognitive Responsibility in Knowledge-Building Communities (2007)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianwei Zhang, Marlene Scardamalia, Richard Reeve, & Richard Messina</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10508400802581676">Journal of the Learning Sciences</a></p> 
<p><b>Research Question:</b> Are elementary students capable of assuming collective responsibility for knowledge development?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Each year within the science curriculum during the approximately 4-month study of optics, the 4th grade teacher in this experiment employed a progressively more collaborative knowledge work group model—fixed small groups; interacting small groups; and opportunistic-collaboration small groups. Fixed groups, where collaboration takes place within groups on distinct topics related to the overarching theme, are a standard approach to inquiry-based classrooms. Interacting small groups, where students mainly collaborate within their groups but also participate in some cross group-sharing of information, is being implemented more often. However, these types of groups do not mirror the process of much of the knowledge creation that takes place in the real world. Opportunistic-collaboration groups, in which groups form, dissolve, and re-combine as part of generating knowledge on multiple sub-themes under a unifying goal, are uncommon in schools but more closely resemble how scholars, scientists and innovators collaborate.</p>

<p>This experiment compared the effectiveness of each collaborative knowledge group model based on students’ collective cognitive responsibility and knowledge gains. To facilitate such an uncommon approach to exploring and sharing ideas, the authors created Knowledge Forum, a computer-based shared knowledge space where students log and expand their ideas, models, problems, plans, data, etc. This software was used in all three years of the experiment. In the first and second years of the experiment students were divided into six fixed groups based on their interests. Groups in the first year explored their topic, ran experiments to test their ideas and logged their data in their group-specific Knowledge Forum files. In the second year, groups were asked to align their experiments according to the larger community’s top-level research theme. This required inter-group discussions and full class approval of group-specific experiments.</p>

<p>In the third year, students were not divided into groups but rather participated together discussing the shared top-level research theme. They started out sharing a single Knowledge Forum file. Students were instructed to investigate any sub-theme that emerged during their exploration of the main theme. Each student was responsible for adding to the Knowledge Forum file. Students clustered into small teams, disbanded and reformed over the course of the unit. Students initiated full-class discussions as well as new Knowledge Forum files in order to manage the expanded information logged. The teacher declined the students’ proposal to form small groups to work on specific themes in order to provide the students the freedom to explore multiple topics. The analysis of effectiveness of each collaborative knowledge group was based on students’ collective cognitive responsibility and knowledge gains.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> 
The findings of this study suggest that an opportunistic-collaborative framework for scientific inquiry generated the greatest increase in collective cognitive responsibility as well as in knowledge advancement—at the community level as well as at the individual level—compared to the other two collaborative work models. Contrary to obvious concerns that a more organic approach to group work would give advantage to high-achieving students over lower performing students, the results did not confirm this. Rather, results indicated that differences in learning outcomes between these two groups of students were generally the same across the years, the only difference being that lower performing students made greater gains in depth of understanding during the third year than those from the first two years. This depth of understanding was demonstrated by the scientific sophistication and level of complexity the students evidenced in their reflective essays written at the end of the unit.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Creating a workforce for tomorrow does not begin in high school. Skills involved in collaborative knowledge building can be promoted among young students as this research demonstrates. More research on appropriate pedagogical approaches and curriculum to promote collective cognitive responsibility is needed to promote the growth of such practices. Key to this investigation was the use of the Knowledge Forum software created specifically for this study to manage the students’ data collection, organization and access activities. Research is necessary to understand what types of software can best facilitate collaborative work within the classroom. </p>
