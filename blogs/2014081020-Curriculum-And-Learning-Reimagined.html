Investment in education technology-focused startups <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/26/education-technology-startups-raised-nearly-half-a-billion-dollars-in-q1/"> has grown rapidly in the past five years</a>  and a variety of creative products and services in this field make it an exciting emerging market. Some companies want to gamify educational experiences and create fun games for learning; some are eager to find better approaches to help educators get more accurate and real-time understanding of students’ learning so teachers can provide personalized assistance to students; still some others try to create online platforms for efficient teaching and learning. What would it look like for all of these innovative ideas to be integrated into K-12 curriculum production? <p>

The learning division at the edtech conglomerate <a href="http://www.amplify.com/curriculum"> Amplify</a> aims to fold the latest technologies for K-12 curriculum production into its customized tablets. As the president of Amplify Learning, Larry Berger, states in this video, they want to create a curriculum that is "as immersive as films, as engaging as video games, as social as social media and as analytically sophisticated as search engines." This definitely is not an easy task. Aside from technological challenges, <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1644">controversies around technology integration and student data</a> present new obstacles for these curriculum innovations. <p>

What do you think of this new method of curriculum production? Do you think it can revolutionize students’ learning experiences in schools? Share your thoughts with other educators <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16050">on Vialogues.</a><p>

<b>@01:03 Wang:</b> Traditional textbooks present lots of facts that are often incoherently organized and are not effective for learning. Listening to kids is crucial for the production of an engaging school curriculum. I wonder how this was done in Amplify's process of curriculum production. <p>

<b>@02:42 johnlee: </b> A Seinfeld writer joins the team and wants to make grammar learning less boring.<p>
