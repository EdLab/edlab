<a href="http://www.getpocket.com">Pocket</a> (<a href=”http://getpocket.com/blog/2012/04/introducing-the-all-new-read-it-later-now-called-pocket/”>previously known as Read It Later</a>) is a multi-platform application that allows users to quickly and easily save websites, pictures, and videos and access them from a variety of devices (both on- and offline).

<b>Pros:</b><li>Very easy to add online objects to your list with a single click</li>
<li>Items can be tagged, searched, and organized</li>
<li>Native apps for a variety of browsers and mobile devices (as well as a web presence for those times you're at someone elses' computer) which all sync to your account, meaning you can pull up your saved links anywhere, anytime, even when offline</li>


<b>Cons:</b><li>The new interface (the main difference between Pocket and its predecessor) is quite pleasing to the eye, but not all that intuitive. I had to play around with each of the icons to figure out what they were, and tended to fumble</li>
<li>While there are several interesting features, like tags, which make it easy to organize your saved items, the tagging process is more complicated than it probably should be (I would have liked the ability to tag right from the list without going through separate screens)</li>
<li>As a result of the rebranding, there is an inconsistent product image, which is confusing. (For example, the Firefox add-on still has the Read It Later icons, while the Android app uses the new Pocket ones.) </li>


<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
While Pocket is not directly targeted to the education market, it can certainly be used by teachers and students to save and organize materials they find around the web. With its seamless integration, a student can save an article they find for a research project and easily pull it up at home or from their tablet or phone.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Though the interface could be more intuitive and the branding more consistent, Pocket is a simple product that does its thing very well.
