          <p>
            I don't know if I'm the last to have heard about this, but check out this <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/games/2007-04-29-mindreadingtoys_N.htm#uslPageReturn">article</a> about <a href=http://www.neurosky.com/>NeuroSky</a>, a company trying to find a niche supplying commercial scale brainwave-reading sensors for various applications, including toys and video/virtual games.  While this technology has been around for decades and is used routinely in hospitals and neurological research, NeuroSky has generated a decent amount of <a href=http://www.neurosky.com/press.html>press</a> around their attempt to integrate that technology with the gaming world.

The company is conscious of the potential educational market for their product, as the article describes: “Boosters say toys with even the most basic brain wave-reading technology – scheduled to debut later this year – could boost mental focus and help kids with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and mood disorders.”  As with most things, there are skeptics, including those who question the possibility for the transfer of virtually acquired skills and abilities to the non-digital world.  Others question whether the technology will make a meaningful difference.  “‘It's hard to tell whether playing games with biofeedback is more fun – the company executives say that, but I don't know if I believe them,' said Ben Sawyer, director of the Games for Health Project, a division of the Serious Games Initiative.”  I can understand how gaming might be less fun if my less-than-desirable competitive thoughts had effects within a game without my conscious intent!

According to the article, there are other start-ups competing within this niche, offering biofeedback devices already integrated with popular gaming systems.  I remain skeptical about the robust educational implications of these gaming applications.  Its not that I don't think gaming can be seriously pursued, but rather that these products are being developed to make gaming more entertaining while paying lip-service to educational concerns, rather than exploring how gaming itself can be educationally oriented.  The latter seems more likely to occur in educational research institutions, however glacial their pace, rather than in for-profit ventures.
