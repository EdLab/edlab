<p><a href="http://www.mindconnex.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=7&Itemid=40">Shakespeare in Bits</a> is an audiovisual study guide for Shakespeare’s plays. With the full, unabridged text and cartoon animations, this tool immerses users in the story, aiding in their understanding of this complex Elizabethan playwright. The plays covered by this app include the widely taught comedy, <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream,</i> and the famous tragedies <i>Macbeth, Hamlet, Julius Caesar,</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Each play is supplemented with plenty of helpful background information and context to  enrich the reader’s experience of the story.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The animation is lively and colorful, yet simple enough to not distract from the scenes. There are loads of great features, such as summaries of each scene, modern definitions of archaic words, margin notes that provide questions to ponder, historical context, and commentary on the language. The app is easy to navigate and has ample descriptions and notes, which increase the reader’s familiarity with the material. The most useful part of Shakespeare in Bits is definitely the voice acting. The tone and intonation that is heard while either reading along or watching the animation clarifies tone and emotion, both of which may be difficult to perceive from reading the static text alone. Finally, this app is available on a wide variety of devices, which is always a plus.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There is a fee required to use this app, which ranges anywhere from $4.50 to approximately $15. Although there is a great amount of helpful content, the various notations and highlighted text can overwhelm the senses as you try to watch the animation and to focus on the text, which can demand excessive video pausing. This can undercut some of the benefits of having such a wide array of content by interrupting the flow of thought.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The animation is the real star of Shakespeare in Bits by providing visual support to demystify the action of the play for viewers. The mechanical movements of the characters can be comical at times, but they add an endearing quality to the story, something that can be particularly appealing to younger audiences. This app would most certainly be helpful to teachers, students, and even casual learners who seek a companion to help them with some of the most popular of Shakespeare’s plays.</p>
