<p><a href="https://www.dancerealityapp.com/">Dance Reality</a> is an app developed by two salsa dancers who have used Apple's ARKit to create a way for people to learn and practice common dance moves. Footprints are placed on the floor in front of you, and you follow the animated instructions either alone or with a partner. The platform also provides voice-over and syncs your steps with music.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>What feels special about this app is that the courses offered by Andy and Bee (the CEO and COO of Dance Reality) actually feature them in AR, making you feel like you’re enrolled in a real dance class. The AR is high-quality and the instructors don’t feel unnaturally polished and robotic, but casual and genuine, making the experience more inviting and comfortable. The authenticity shows in the little surprises that are caught on video as well, such as a moment when the couple’s cat walks into the scene.</p>
 
<p>The variety of dance offerings is impressive and exciting. I definitely downloaded the app thinking I’d just be learning salsa, but the inclusion of other latin dances along with everything from hip-hop to ballroom makes this a much larger resource than I first realized. While not all dance lessons are free, many are, and the cost of downloading additional lessons is minimal (between $0.99 and $3.99), which is great considering how expensive in-person dance classes typically are.</p>

<p>The idea of using AR for placing footprints is brilliant. While tracking and following a dancer might be easy for some, having specific spots marked on the floor as I was dancing was something I found very helpful. I can’t imagine a better way to achieve this than through AR.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It’s clear this app is still very new because there are some pretty serious logistical and content-based problems that need to be addressed. First, while Andy and Bee’s classes feature instructors as well as step patterns to follow, many of the dance offerings don’t have an AR instructor to guide you through the lesson. This makes classes like hip-hop and ballroom, which depend heavily on upper-body movement, less effective. Hopefully this will be improved over time.</p>

<p>While I like that the courses by Andy and Bee take things really slow, the ability to skip steps or fast-forward through certain instructions would be helpful for faster learners or those with a bit more experience. Additionally, the AR wasn’t the most reliable; I sporadically struggled to get the app to detect the floor, which is required before any lesson can begin and was therefore very annoying. Also, the inability to watch both your feet and the instructor at the same time reflects reality, but seems like something this app could fix by placing the AR instructor’s feet right in front of your own.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Ultimately, as a free resource, I think this app is worth the download. It has plenty of room for improvement, but its foundation is good, and I think it demonstrates the great potential of AR for dance and other physical activity instruction.</p>
