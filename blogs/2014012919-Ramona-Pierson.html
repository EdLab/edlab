Ramona Pierson just might be one of the most inspiring people on the planet.  So inspiring in fact, that there is a movie about her life rumored (at the end of <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/declara-co-founder-ramona-piersons-comeback-odyssey">this article</a>) to be in the works.  In her early 20’s Pierson was hit by a drunk driver while running and spent over a year in a coma.  After regaining consciousness she went on, over the next three years (and 50 surgeries), to recover from injuries that included, blindness, paralysis and reduced speech.  Pierson then rose "phoenix-like" from this experience to become a global thought leader in the fields of technology and education.  Pierson got her professional start as a neuroscientist at the Palo Alto Brain Center and VA hospitals and then went-on, from 2005 onward, to found knowledge-focused companies in both the public and private sector.  Pierson was also the CIO for the Seattle Public School system for three years and in 2007 founded, <a href="http://synapticmash.com/">SynapticMash</a>, a company that developed, "educational solutions for end-to-end learning for districts and states" and delivered personalized, automated education.  In 2011 Pierson co-founded and currently serves as CEO of, <a href="https://www.declara.com/">Declara</a>, a company devoted to increasing an organization’s ability to collaborate, innovate, learn and benefit from the group’s "human capital."  Pierson also founded Learning without Borders, which offers technology and training to educators and learners. At 16, Pierson enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley and was recruited by the Marine Corps two years later for her extraordinary talent for data and algorithms. Pierson then went on to receive an undergraduate degree from Fort Lewis College and a master's from University of San Francisco. She's also studied and participated in fellowships at The New School and the University of Washington.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> My education background is in neuroscience, computer science and mathematics.  I deeply wanted to understand how you could combine these disciplines to create a learning system that was personalized for each individual.  To get closer to this area, I ended up earning a teacher's credential to understand the world of educators and the challenges they face day to day.  This gave me the ability to approach my work not just as a technologist, but as an educator as well.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> There have been several - from working at the VA hospital, which formed my early thinking on learning systems, to the founding of my prior company in Seattle.  This company, SynapticMash, was one of the first to develop a personalized learning system that was rolled out across Indiana. We were acquired by the British interactive learning company, Promethean World, and I stayed on for some time. I then went on to start Declara in 2012.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b>   Today, education does not just stop in grade school, high school or university. Continued learning is where the world is going - with people needing to accelerate their learning, be it in government institutions, schools or corporations.  I believe that with Declara, we can impact the continued learning landscape for people around the world.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> There are a few broad trends that I see in my area of expertise.
Social collaboration - where human beings reach out to anyone anywhere and share content openly - is probably one of the bigger trends we are witnessing.  The advent of social networks across the globe is fueling this trend and we still have far to go.
<p>
Another trend is countries having the desire to level up their education.  Just like with mobile phones where developing countries leapfrogged the developed world by embracing mobile first, the same could happen with continued education.  We are already seeing this in Mexico, where the country wants to level up their ministries, education and public organizations with continued education.
<p>
We are also going to see more emphasis placed on the professional development of educators. Today, in the US, we are largely focused on tools for student learning and teacher accountability.  I believe we will want to move to leaning in on the continued education of the educators themselves, where they share and collaborate with one another to increase their learning and innovate faster for themselves and their students.

<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Today, I am solely focused on Declara.  We develop a platform, called 'CognitiveGraph,' to accelerate learning in corporations, schools and institutions around the globe.  Similar to the way the Human Genome stores genetic information on an individual to give each one their own personality, physical appearance and way of thinking, the CognitiveGraph analyses and observes how users interact with massive amounts of data — be it searches, tweets, posts, blogs, videos, likes, recommendations, messages or web content — to create a personalized cognitive learning map tailored for each user.  
<p>
Over time, Declara's CognitiveGraph adapts to deliver the right content, connections and context to users at the right time, by anticipating individual intent.  This results in deeper learning, faster innovation and a higher return on human capital across organizations.
<p>
I am just getting started with Declara.  For now, it is my current and next big project.
