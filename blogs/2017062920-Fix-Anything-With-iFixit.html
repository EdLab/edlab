<p><i>"Our site empowers individuals to share their technical knowledge with the rest of the world." 
</i> (<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Info">About iFixit</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Startup Origins</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com">iFixit</a> began the way that many startups do: in a dorm room. Kyle Wiens and Luke Soules began the project as roommates at Cal Poly in 2003, eventually expanding the operation to a house and hiring employees before finishing school. Now, the site has thousands of visitors each day perusing over 28,000 free repair manuals, ordering parts, and asking and answering questions.</p>

<p>Wiens and Soules started iFixit with the belief that everyone has the right to maintain and repair their products. Too often, big companies withhold information on how to fix their devices and refuse to sell individual parts to users. So, the two roommates created a wiki-based site where they published their own repair manuals and sold parts that they acquired largely from tech products on eBay.</p>

<p><b>How-to Guides Galore</b></p>
 
<p>Now, iFixit has repair manuals and troubleshooting guides to over 8,000 tech devices. From iPhones to laptops to cars to cameras, iFixit has a step-by-step instruction guide complete with pictures to help you fix almost any issue that could possibly arise. Each guide also tells you which tools and parts you will need to fix the problem, which you can buy directly on the site. Site members can also pose specific questions on an answers forum and respond to others. It seems like the iFixit community has a dedicated base of contributors who are willing to teach you how to approach any technological problem.</p>
 
<p><b>iFixit Community</b></p>

<p>As a wiki, iFixit has become a hive mind of tech repair as community members can write their own manuals or edit others. In addition, the site teaches users how to become contributors to iFixit by listing instructions on how to write an effective repair manual and take helpful pictures. At the end of the day, iFixit states that while no one knows how to repair everything, everyone likely knows how to repair something.</p>
