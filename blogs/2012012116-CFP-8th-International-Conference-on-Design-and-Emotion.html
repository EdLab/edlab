CFP:  8th International Conference on Design and Emotion
LONDON 2012 - OUT OF CONTROL
11th-14th September 2012
Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design

CALL FOR PAPERS
Dear Colleagues, The organising committee of the 8th International
Design &amp; Emotion Conference, London, 11th-14th September 2012, is very
pleased to invite you to participate in this conference.
This conference is a forum held every other year where practitioners,
academics and industry leaders meet and exchange knowledge and
insights concerning the cross-disciplinary field of design and
emotion.

We are looking for researchers, academics and practitioners to submit
proposals for the following:

1) Paper Submissions
Full Papers are expected to contribute widely applicable long-lasting
knowledge to the discipline. Accepted papers will be presented in the
conference programme and published in the proceedings. The paper
length is a maximum of 12 pages (approximately 4,000-5,000 words plus
figures and tables) in the specified format, which will be detailed on
the website (including a template).

Short Papers (Posters) are expected to describe research that is more
appropriate for the interactive poster session. The paper length
should be a maximum of 5 pages (approximately 2,000 words plus figures
and tables) and an additional page containing a full-page image of the
poster in the specified format for the publication in the conference
proceedings. The first submission requires a short paper manuscript
without the poster page.

2) Case Studies
Case studies are invited for submission to present design projects
that address issues and insights in design and emotion, or to
communicate and discuss your approach to enhance emotional effects.
These must include a summary description in a maximum of 5 pages
(approximately 2,000 words) in the specified format and a maximum of
30 slides illustrating the design, design process and use.

3) Workshops &amp; Masterclasses
Workshops &amp; Masterclasses of either a full or half-day will be held on
11th September 2012 prior to the main programme of the conference. The
purpose is to provide a platform for presenting and discussing novel
ideas and emerging issues in a less formal way than the conference
itself. The format of each workshop/masterclass is to be determined by
its organiser, but each one is expected to include ample time for
general discussion.

THEMES AND TOPICS
While Design &amp; Emotion is the overarching focus of the
conference-allowing us to consider all aspects of the relationship
between human experience and design understood in its widest
senses-the theme this year is "Out of Control".

For a number of years, uncertainty, crisis and chaos have been
keywords describing the experience of many of us. A world driven by
uncertainty, crisis and chaos demands different responses from design
(as a community, a practice and a process). On one hand we can
mitigate against these-designing systems which can withstand, or
manage, the challenges they produce. Here there is a focus upon design
as a "problem-solving" activity. On the other, we can use them as
springboards to a creative future. In this way, design as "opportunity
mapping" becomes important.

We would like to encompass both of these approaches to design and to
examine how they impact upon, or are generated by, the whole spectrum
of human emotion experienced at the macro (socio-cultural), micro
(personal), meta (philosophical), processural (methodological) and
strategic levels.

This conference is open to any theoretical, empirical or
methodological work on Design &amp; Emotion and we are particularly
interested in receiving papers from researchers, academics and
practitioners in the following topic areas (though they are by no
means exhaustive and other work relevant to the theme will be
considered):

Society/Culture:
Socially Responsive/Responsible Design
Design for Behavioural Change
Design &amp; Space/Environment
Design for Digital Media
Corporate Social Responsibility

The Self/The Object:
Design &amp; Identity
Design &amp; Well-Being (inc. food, healthcare &amp; love)
Design &amp; Illusion, Fake &amp; Fraud
User Experience (inc. Human Factors &amp; HCI)
Experience Design

The Philosophical:
Design without Emotion
Design, Affect &amp; the Materiality of Experience
Design, Magic &amp; Enchantment

Processes, Methodologies, Tools &amp; Methods:
Research Methodologies
Theoretical Foundations
Empirical Approaches

Design, Strategy &amp; Innovation:
Design &amp; the Future (foresight/trends)
Designing Services
Business Experience
Branding

SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS
Submission and review processes will be handled by our conference
system. All submissions will go through a blind-review process with at
least two reviewers considering each proposal. All submissions
accepted in the second review will be asked to submit the final
manuscripts in the camera-ready format. The detailed authoring
guideline will be available on the conference website.
