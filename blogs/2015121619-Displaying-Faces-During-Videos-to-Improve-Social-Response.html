<p>The proliferation of multimedia within formal educational settings has resulted in a relatively robust library of research that suggests best practices for the effective design of audiovisual instruction. There are few substantial financial or technological barriers to the creation, dissemination, and use of instructional videos. Despite the ease of use within instructional settings, there is an ongoing debate regarding the use of the instructor's face within these educational materials. Some research demonstrates that displaying the face is costly in terms of incurring additional cognitive processing. However, other research shows that a face induces preferred social response. Also, the image principle, as demonstrated by picture-in-picture video, is often endorsed by learners but does not show any improvement in learning. Two field studies, which relied on natural observations of participants and self-reporting, measured online learner response to video lectures with, and without, the instructor's face. </p>
 
<p>In the first field study, which lasted eight weeks, student participants were allowed to watch online video lectures with or without the instructor’s face showing. Those who saw a face reported a better learning experience. Those choosing not to watch a face explained that they did so largely to minimize and avoid distraction. </p>

<p>In the second field study, which lasted ten weeks, cognitive load and perceived social presence were higher when the face was placed strategically in the frame. However, the attainment of learning outcomes and rates of student attrition did not change. In addition, students who preferred to be verbal learners demonstrated much lower rates of attrition and cognitive load. </p>

<p>This study is important in highlighting the necessity of differentiating instructional design when using multimedia for teaching. Also, the social cues associated with an instructor’s face provide corresponding social cues that improve motivation to continue completion of a course. Further, the study provides evidence that instructional design should be made to account for individual differences in multimedia instruction. Finally, the researchers suggest that future research could allow learners to choose a preferred presentation style in an effort to reduce their cognitive load and prospective rates of attrition. </p>
