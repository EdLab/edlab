          <p>
            One particular role of a secret service intelligence agent is to scout out an area and location before the president arrives. They plan days to even months ahead, securing each location and planning out every single possible hotspot. A major part of their plans usually consist of hidden units. Secret service agents might be playing roles as civilians, or even the guy pretending to deliver milk. In a way they act as spies making sure that the health of the president is secure. 

For example, when I went to Fleet Week many years back, I remember that Bill Clinton, who was president at the time, was on the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy.  When I arrived on the west side and stepped foot on the docked Intrepid, I immediately noticed men in tan trench coats and dark sunglasses walking around with an earpiece connected to a transmitter in their jacket. These were the obvious agents that just stood around for presence and intimidation. Then there were the agents that were undercover and less noticeable. For example, a few of them stood on the bow of the Intrepid overlooking the water in civilian clothes, but what gave them away were their earpieces. There were also a few agents just standing around in McDonald's pretending to sit there after a long meal of uneaten fries and burgers. I also was informed later that night on the news that they had positioned snipers within the area and 360 degrees surrounding it to make sure that all of the location was secure. 

I will never forget those moments because they looked so cool in their uniforms and looked so confident in the way they stood staring at the crowds of people that walked by. For them to have so many people in one location awaiting the presence of the president must have taken weeks to prepare for. They were probably scouting out the area days before the president was even scheduled to set foot in New York City.

Before leaving you this week, I would like to ask all of you one question. 

Would you ever be willing to jump in front of a bullet for the president?
