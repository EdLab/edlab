<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>
<div>

"We all know one hard and undeniable truth: Physical beauty comes with tremendous power, and tremendous benefits. Those who possess it are generally luckier in love, more likely to be popular, and more apt to get better grades in school. But very few of us realize just how much looks affect every aspect of our lives. Recent studies document that people blessed with good looks earn about 10% more than their average-looking colleagues. They are also more likely to get hired and promoted at work. What exactly is this "physical attractiveness" phenomenon and how does it affect each and every one of us?

Dr. Gordon L. Patzer has devoted the last 30 years to investigating this unsettling phenomenon for both women and men, and how it touches every part of our lives. In <em>Looks</em>, he reveals not only its impact on romance, but also on family dynamics, performance in school, career, courtroom proceedings, politics and government. <em>Looks</em> is the first book to explore how the power of beauty affects both sexes and how the rise of reality TV shows, cosmetic surgery, and celebrity culture have contributed to our cultureâ€™s overall obsession with being beautiful.

Unflinching and topical, <em>Looks</em> uncovers the sometimes ugly truth about beauty and its profound effects on all our lives."
