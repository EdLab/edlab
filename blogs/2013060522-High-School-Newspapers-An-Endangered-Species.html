          <p>
            My high school, Frederick Douglass Academy, had a school newspaper as was custom for most high schools across the country. I always felt that the school was just wasting money print papers students barely read. Although, the newspaper mainly focused on school activities, events, and news, some students were not interested in reading the school's newspaper. After all, the newspaper came out every month reporting old news, activities, and events. This was one reason why students and handful of staff members never enjoyed reading the newspaper. Additionally, one of my teachers complained that the newspaper had too many errors in it. 

According to this <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/06/01/187534165/are-high-school-newspapers-an-endangered-species">article</a>, only 1 in 8 New York public high schools have a student newspaper. This ratio clearly shows that not every public high school agrees with the idea of having a student newspaper. It is good for students to show their writing talent, but what is the point of it if no one is really paying attention to what they are writing. Another reason why students have chosen not to read their school newspaper is social media. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have proven to be the quickest way to read or hear about current news. It can be argued that these social networking sites inform people about current news quicker than the local news channel and newspaper. If having a student newspaper is costly to the government or school's budget, then the best action to take is to terminate such extra curricular activity and turn into a school requirement, which could be a writing class.
