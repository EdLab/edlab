            Just want to say before I get into this that I do not support going to a profit school at all. They all have high tuition rates, which means most students must take out student loans. Students who attend these for-profit school will most likely will not able to pay back these <a href ="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44093876/ns/today-back_to_school/t/us-opens-new-front-fight-for-profit-colleges/"> loans</a> because of the fact that their degrees does not really help them get a <a href ="http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/02/news/economy/education_federal_funding/index.htm"> job</a>, as advertised in their commercials. Their graduation rates are also very low for various reasons.

So why write about for profit schools getting anything at all? Well I came across this<a href ="http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2011/09/01/For-Profit-Schools-They-Get-IT.aspx?Page=2"> article</a>, in which the author argues that for profit schools should embrace the use of technology more than non-profit schools. One part of the article that really caught my attention was the fact that, according to the article, for profit colleges spend more than 10 percent of their operating budgets on technology infrastructure. Not for profit schools on other hand spend less than three percent. I think this is frightening news since we have become increasingly dependent on technology. I carry my laptop everywhere now like my life depends on it, and on top of that my phone is like a mini computer!

The instructors at for-profit schools use technology tools like online chat, discussion forums, the use of ebooks, and an online library, etc. Being done with college for a while now, I'm not sure if most not for profit schools use these tools as well, but I certainly hope so. I believe that not for profit schools should mimic this extensive use of technology on their campuses as well since more and more jobs will require a great understanding of computer use (like programming, documenting and chart drafting, etc). With other countries stepping up their technology game, it's time that we stepped up ours to compete with them.
