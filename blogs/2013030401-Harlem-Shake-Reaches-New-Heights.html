            The Harlem Shake is the new dance sensation. Many people have been downloading their own version of the new dance on YouTube. On a flight from Denver to San Diego, 18 Colorado College students (on their way to an ultimate Frisbee tournament) came up with an idea to do the dance on the plane. It started as a joke but later became reality. The FAA did not like the idea of the dance being in a plane and they don't think this was safe. After the video received many views, others searched more videos on the Harlem shake on a plane and eventually the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewjQrx7XnYw">video</a> caught the FAA's attention and now there is an investigation into the safety of other passengers during the taping of these dance videos.

I personally don't think this should be an issue. As the searches on YouTube prove, this is the only time this has been shot on a plane. Additionally, no one was suppose to be in their seat at the moment the video was shot and thus meaning it was safe. I also don't think people were forced to do as many can be seen sitting down. Most importantly, nobody got injured and the plane landed safely. It seems to be a fun dance. Should these college students get into trouble for coming up with the idea of doing it on a plane?
