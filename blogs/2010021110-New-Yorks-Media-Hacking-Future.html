            A friend recently twittered a link to this <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/02/10/whatsGoingOnInNy.html">post</a> by <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>. The title is "What's Going on in NY," and I think the prediction (observation?) he's making is relevant or should be relevant to the work going on at the EdLab.
<blockquote>
All my career there's been a tension between technology and media. Very early in my career I saw they'd meet, and I made a good choice to put myself firmly in the technology world, because that's where the growth was. I don't think that's where it is anymore. 

I also don't think the growth is in media, believe it or not. I don't think the big organizations are going to turn the corner. I think they're finally coming around to that belief too.  

But if it isn't tech and it isn't media, what is it? Ahhh. 

We don't have a name for it yet. I call what I do "media hacking" and like the new Japanese doctor on Lost, I am using a phrase that only approximates what's going on. 

Here's what's going to happen, imho. 

There are a bunch of smart, mostly young, people who work either in tech startups or inside big publishing companies who will, in a few years, form the companies that are hybrids of technology and publishing that will lead us into the future. They won't be like Google, Facebook, Twitter or Apple. And they won't be the NY Times, Time-Warner or even the Huffington Post or Gawker. But they will learn from all of them. 
</blockquote>
To give this some context, Patrick and I recently heard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc Searls</a> talk about the internet with the take home point being: it's early.
