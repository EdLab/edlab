Assessing the Cost and Value of Bibliographic Control. <i>Library Resources & Technical Services, 55</i>(3), 124-137.</a>

There's been a lot of buzz lately from the <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/892637-264/library_of_congress_provides_details.html.csp">Library of Congress Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic Control</a> and their recent official anti-MARC stance, but this article delves further to explore a bibliographic control-less future. 

<b>Description:</b>
The article first describes the difficult and recent birth of cost/benefit analysis in technical services librarianship. Though time and cost have played a role in cataloging decisions since the Library of Congress began offering pre-made cards at the turn of the century, until the 2000's there was not a concentrated effort in the community to evaluate our metadata practices towards evolving material types. The article describes the testing procedures for RDA by the Library of Congress Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic Control in crafting their recommendations for the bibliographic future. 

The recommendations consider discovery success, use, display understanding and web compatibility as indicators of value in bibliographic control. It's unclear if traditional methods, even the largely stripped-down RDA, are more successful by these measures for the keyword and full text searches of today. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
I've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially in terms of our archival collections. Bibliographic control really appeals to me: it's clean and pretty and unites librarians in a gorgeous double rainbow of organizational love, but it's not the only way anymore. Maybe it's not even the best way. I'm excited to see the developments in this field as the Library of Congress Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic Control continues their work, but perhaps it's time to build a system around the kinds of search work our patrons are doing today and deeply evaluate the non-librarian benefits of traditional bibliographic control.
