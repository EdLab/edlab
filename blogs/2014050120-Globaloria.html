<b>Game Design & Traditional Education</b><br>
<a href="http://globaloria.org/">Globaloria</a> is a K-12 game-making curriculum, safe platform for game design, and a connected curriculum developed by education nonprofit, <a href="http://www.worldwideworkshop.org/aboutus/aboutus">WorldWideWorkshop.</a>  Described as, "the first learning network where students design, program, and share their own STEM and social issue games."  Since their beta launch in 2006, Globaloria has blended team-based learning with a digital curriculum to foster and support three major tenets of 21st Century learning, including; game production, networked learning, and open source development.  Unlike other products like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/947">Gamestar Mechanic</a>, in which a drag and drop interface is utilized for more informal game play, Globaloria makes use of a more structured curriculum and platform designed specifically for formal learning settings.  As the Founder, President and MIT-based researcher, <a href="http://www.worldwideworkshop.org/aboutus/the-workshop-team">Dr. Idit Harel Caperton</a> explains, "Courses focus on game-design and coding, MIT-style, project-based, with industry-standard tools and software engineering practices--making it a first pick for principals/schools looking for college and career prep opportunities in STEM & Computing."  Globaloriaâ€™s end goal is to transform classrooms into "networked design studios" that result in student-developed, STEM-focused digital games.  Learners who engage with Globaloria courses develop and strengthen their math, science, and digital literacy skills and knowledge of computer programming languages ranging from Flash to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript">ActionScript</a> as they develop their own games.  For access to the Globaloria suite of resources each school pays a yearly subscription fee and is provided with scaffolded support in the form of a private wiki, editable online project development spaces, and multimedia support.  In addition to a dedicated suite of learner and instructor resources developed to support the curriculum, Globaloria provides extensive professional development for instructors and is built to "scale-up seamlessly" within a school.

<b>Globaloria & the Global Knowledge Economy</b><br>
Through a STEM-focused game design curriculum based on emphasizing an iterative design process, Globaloria is helping traditional US schools to integrate both technical and scientific reasoning into new and existing curricula.  In addition, the Globaloria curriculum emphasizes the critical thinking skills necessary to excel both in college and later in the global knowledge economy.  Students are encouraged not only to iterate and redesign their ideas, but also to follow this Globaloria-designed process of "play, plan, prototype, program and publish" (for more on this process <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2776">watch this vialogue</a>).  As Dr. Caperton explains, "Students learn to follow an iterative, engineering and design process wherein they play, plan, prototype, program, and publish their own original educational games; all the while participating across the social learning community. In this way, students are not only gaining the hard workforce skills of coding, but also the practices that will make them effective innovators, creative problem-solvers, collaborative team members, and expert computing professionals."   By following an established design framework and publishing their finished games both for peers in their immediate cohort and globally, young learners are held accountable for design decisions that would usually only affect a handful of traditionally isolated learners in formal learning settings.  Instead, Globaloria is creating a platform that allows the connected classroom to more clearly align with the goals of many 21st century companies and institutions, all while creating unique gaming content that is relevant far beyond the walls of one school.  "Global" learning indeed.
