            <a href ="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/education/03incentive.html?_r=1&ref=education"> A recent article in the New York Times</a>, tells a story about a math teacher from South High Community who taught an Advanced Placement course, and was able to make most of his students receive higher scores on their AP exams. He had help from the National Math and Science Initiative, which is a non-profit organization that provided laboratory equipment, special training for teachers, organized afternoon and Saturday sessions, and paid $100 to each student who scored a 3 (out of 5) or above on the AP exam. Teachers were also paid a bonus for students scoring a 3 or higher. This story will of course begin the debate of whether or not we should provide bonuses for students who do well on these types of exams. It does seem to be a big incentive for students to pass exams, and it's much like how people work harder at their jobs to get a bonus.

Before the money incentive, 50 percent of his students earn a high enough score on the AP exam to qualify for college credit, but that teacher currently has 70 percent of his students earning high scores. One interesting thing that changed in the AP classroom was that a class that normally needs students to have special requirements for admission now has a come one, come all policy. That means any student who was interested in taking the AP class could sign up for it, and if they score high on the exam, they get the $100 bonus.  In the aforementioned article, the math teacher will reportedly receive $7,300 extra to his yearly salary. This bonus will have teachers working hard in preparing their students for this exam. The one bad thing that could come out of this is  teachers might teach their students to score high on the exams and not actually make certain that each student understands the material. Also while I'm sure the money incentive helped a bit, I think the extra practice sessions during the afternoon and Saturdays helped students pass the exam a lot more. Now that we have this success story, it's going to definitely refuel the debate over whether cash bonuses can improve performance for students and teachers.
