            <b>HBS Moves in a More Digital Direction</b>
Harvard B-School has long been considered THE leading business school. Pairing an enviable faculty with a roster of alumni that includes titans of industry, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/most-impressive-harvard-business-school-students-2013-4?op=1">Fortune 500 heads, politicians and startup founders</a>.  What the program has lacked until now, is a business-focused online presence.  However, Harvard does currently offer (non-business related) courses through the edX platform (see all courses <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx/allcourses">here</a>). 

<b>Another X Marks the MOOC Spot</b>
Harvard B-School will soon launch HBX as this first foray into the world of online education and MOOCs.  Listed below are quotes describing this soon-to-launch initiative from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-09/harvard-business-school-launching-online-learning-initiative#r=hpt-ls">this recent Bloomberg Businessweek article</a>: 

<blockquote>
“This is a lot bigger than meets the eye,” Fernandes says. “They're going to get high visibility with students all over the world. I don't want to say it's going to displace face-to-face education, but it's going to be a big piece of the pie.”

Few details are available, but the effort, known as HBX, has been underway at least since June, when Jana Kierstead, executive director of the Harvard MBA program, was named to head the new initiative, according to her profile at LinkedIn (LNKD).
</blockquote>

<b>Big Questions</b>
1) Will a HBX degree really carry the same weight as a more traditional in-person MBA? (perhaps more in high tech/startup worlds?) 

2) Will this new initiative follow more of an "OLA model" and provide "Online Learning Activities" (credit for this term to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/9856">Professor Robert Lue's keynote at the 2013 #sciamlearning summit</a>) to support in-person instruction? 

3) How will HBX make money?  Follow the UC Berkeley model of charging similar fees for online/in-person programs (example <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/MASIC/">here</a>?  Utilize existing "Signature Track" on Coursera platform? 

4) Will an "entrepreneurship" focused EDX make the most sense online, with more traditional focus area courses solely available in-person? (Wharton's experiment is a possible example... the UPenn program offers <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/60889088289/the-wharton-foundation-series">first-year foundational courses as MOOCS on Coursera</a>)
