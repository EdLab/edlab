            <b>An Analysis of Textbooks from a Cultural Point of View</b>

<a href="http://www.tesol-journal.com/PDF/A3_V5_TESOL.pdf">Ahmed, F., Narcy-Combes, M.F. (2011). An Analysis of Textbooks from a Cultural Point of View. Tesol Journal, 5, 21-37</a> 

This very interesting research study focuses on the cultural unfamiliarity between ESL learners and foreign textbook authors in Pakistan. The authors refer to a study that explains how a textbook is most "useful if learners, teachers, and textbook authors share the same cultural values." If not, they all should at least be familiar with each other's cultures. There is a cultural gap between the learners first culture (C1) and the Anglophone/target language cultures (C2). One of their research methods was a textbook cover analysis to see what cultural misunderstandings and gaps were represented. They asked Pakistani students a series of questions to see how they interpreted the textbook cover illustrations.

<i>English Alive:</i>
The illustration depicts a boy whose clothes and overall picture reflects his condition of extreme poverty. The answers of the students in the table shows that the learners do not want to be represented in the way the boy is been presented in the illustration. 

<i>New Oxford Modern English:</i>
The front cover is a scene from a typical village in Pakistan. The family in the illustration is portrayed in a very happy way. However, the clothes of the children are full of patches. From a Pakistani cultural point of view, patches on clothes are a symbol of extreme poverty. Also two of the children are shown without shoes which is culturally unfavorable. 

<i>Oxford Progressive English:</i>
This picture is about a polo, which is a famous regional game in northern part of Pakistan. This is the most culturally sensitive and accurate textbook cover out of the three. 

The study concludes that an ESL textbook should ideally be specific to that one learners' culture because it promotes more concentration on the learners' language requirements.

<b>EdLab Takeaway</b>
Just always something good to keep in mind when developing curriculums, tools, and products that serve a diverse range of cultures and people.
