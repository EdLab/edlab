          <p>
            I am coming to the end of my life in high school. In retrospect, I am very proud of the many things I was able to accomplish. I started high school soon as I arrived from Ghana and took me quite a long time to become acclimated to life in high school, and America. Overall, high school has been a bittersweet experience and it has prepared me well for the personal, social and educational challenges that surely awaits in college.

I am still deciding which college to attend for the fall. Fortunately, I am being recruited to play collegiate soccer by several public and private institutions. One of these schools, SUNY Canton, recently invited me for a visit.  I stayed on campus for three days so I was able to feel a little bit of the college experience.  The visit was very much an eye opener in so many ways. Almost immediately upon arrival, I felt a connection with everyone and everything at the school. I was able to meet members of the student body and some faculty members, who presented some of their research. I was also able to train with the men's soccer team. The diversity of the student body and faculty was evident and that appealed to me a lot. Overall, members of the SUNY Canton community were welcoming and it is a school I am seriously considering. I am visiting several other schools in the coming weeks and hope to make a decision soon.
