<p>What are the critical components of successful K-12 online schools? Can effective online teaching be learned? A recent study of teachers at the Open High School of Utah sought to identify trends and best practices. To analyze teachers’ experiences and perceptions, the authors proposed six indicators of teacher engagement, including how the teachers communicated with students, parents, and school colleagues; how they designed and organized their courses; how they developed caring relationships with students; how they monitored students’ learning and online behaviors; how they gave specific instructions; and how they motivated students’ learning within an online instructional environment.</p>

<p>The authors found that teachers used multiple methods, including instant messaging, video conference, phone calls, and text messages to communicate with students and parents. Compared to parents of students in face-to-face environments, parents of online students tended to be more proactive in interacting with teachers online regarding their children's education. In collaborating with their school colleagues, teachers further established an "online faculty room" which served as a community learning center in the virtual space of the school.</p>

<p>The school applied a coherent curriculum designed and enacted by teachers. Individual online instructors could further modify the content for the needs of their students. In order to ensure that students were able to learn in a safe and nurturing environment, the school initiated an anti-cyberbullying program to track students’ online activities within the school system. Teachers’ online instruction was differentiated in the form of one-on-one tutoring sessions: teachers provided constant constructive feedback to students as part of their instructional responsibilities. Teachers also used video and audio systems to monitor students’ academic honesty. </p>

<p>The study offers a helpful case study of the Open High School of Utah, though it was situated in one online high school and limited by its sole focus on teacher perspectives. Future research that involves virtual ethnography with classroom observations and student interviews is needed. Research that looks at students’ informal online learning beyond the school-based virtual space might also be helpful to understand effective student engagement models for the emerging online teaching and learning trajectories in the K-12 system.</p>
