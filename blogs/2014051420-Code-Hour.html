<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-hour-of code/id762950096?ls=1&mt=">Code Hour</a> is a free app developed by Codeacademy that aims to teach learners with no prior programming experience about the basics of coding in an hour. The app has seven sections that introduce basic ideas of data types, variables, comparisons, and if-else statements in programming and HTML syntax. Each of these sections contains three to four sub-sections to facilitate learning. At the end, learners are invited to work on their first website with customized bio information and background design and can share their website with friends via the provided link.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The learning activities on this app are broken into bite-size tasks, so even learners with no prior programming experience will find it easy and unintimidating to start their first activity. The small tasks within each section also make it easier for users to find time in their daily commutes or during breaks to learn to code from this app. Creating a first website as the capstone activity for this code hour learning is a great idea because this process is relevant to every learner's daily digital experience and provides a real-world achievement at the end of the lesson.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although the beginning tasks are basic, asking players to fill in only a few words at a time, they do not provide an introduction to basic programming syntax (e.g., the use of var, print, quotation marks, curly brackets, etc.) so some might struggle to understand how they work in real life programming. Learning about HTML and creating a first website are relevant to most users' daily experiences. However, the connection between introductory sections in the app, such as comparisons, variables, and if-else statements, may not seem as relevant to users' daily computing lives.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The Codeacademy Code Hour app provides a great starting point for learners to understand how computer programs work. Although some learners might not be comfortable enough to proceed without understanding programming syntax, for those who are used to tinkering to learn new things this app is a great start. It would be great to see code hour series from Codecademy to help people continue learning about advanced coding on the go.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>The Codecademy Code Hour app helps users gain quick understanding and experience programming in an hour.</p>
