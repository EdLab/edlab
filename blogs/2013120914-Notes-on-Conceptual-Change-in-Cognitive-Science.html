            This book chapter elaborates on <b>Mental Model Transformation, Belief Revision and Categorical Shift.</b>

Researchers describe at least three conditions of human prior knowledge:
<ol>
<li><b>no prior knowledge</b> of the to-be-learned concept. So, learning consists of adding new knowledge.
<li>some correct prior knowledge about the to-be-learned concepts, but that
knowledge is <b>incomplete</b>. So, learning can be conceived of as gap filling.
<li>incorrect or misconceived prior knowledge. So, learning is changing prior misconceived knowledge to correct knowledge.
The categorizations sound very straightforward, but it takes decades for cognitive science researchers to study this complex, interrelated issue, which are very inspiring and useful for instructional designers and teachers.
</ol>

For instance,
<ul>
<li>In what ways is knowledge misconceived?
<li>Why is such misconceived knowledge often resistant to change?
<li>What constitutes a change in prior knowledge?
<li>How should instruction be designed to promote conceptual change?
</ul>

Refuting false beliefs with correct statements that contradicted those beliefs can lead to belief revision.

However, not every piece of our prior knowledge can be split into extreme polars (correct or incorrect). A lot of time, compound elements (concepts) are overlapped. Students' knowledge consists of an interrelated system of false beliefs and correct beliefs, forming a coherent but sometimes flawed mental model. How should we design instructions to induce mental model transformation, given that we have defined conflicting models in terms of different predictions, explanations, and elements? Since mental models and correct models conflict at the mental model level (flat earth vs. spherical earth), a holistic confrontation may induce successful model transformation. 

One way to design a holistic confrontation might be to have students examine a visual depiction (e.g., a diagram) of the flawed mental model, then contrast it with a diagram of the correct model, in terms of the predictions, explanations and elements of each model. Current research is not yet aware of offering this kind of <b>holistic confrontation</b>. And studies have proven the "in conflict‚Äù flawed mental models can be transformed into the correct model when false beliefs within a flawed model are refuted by instruction and recognized by students as contradictions. This way, students can self-repair their flawed mental models.
