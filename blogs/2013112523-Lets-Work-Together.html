            In marketing, there will be times where the thought of a partnership will come to mind. Do you take it? That answer is entirely up to you. Do you feel like you can solely conquer the problem you are trying to solve? Do you think you are being overwhelmed? These are only two out of the many questions marketers have, will or is asking themselves at any given moment. The thought of a strategic alliance or partnership is in the mind of a lot of marketers at one point or another.

There have been many mergers and alliances throughout history. Take Gillette for instance. They merged with Procter & Gamble (P&G) for approximately $57 billion. Read more on this <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/28/news/fortune500/pg_gillette/">here</a>. Many of today's companies are creating alliances or merging in an effort of making their business grow and generate more revenue. As they say, "money makes the world go round." It is worth noting that not every business that merges maintains the success they thought they would achieve. Legendary stores, Sears and Kmart, experienced this <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/34467713/page/10">failure of a merger</a>.

There are definitely benefits in strategic alliances. When an alliance with two or more companies occurs, they are then able to share their resources and even finances. As usual, wherever there is pro, there must be a con. If you merge with an under financed company, you have to bare their problems as if they were your own.
