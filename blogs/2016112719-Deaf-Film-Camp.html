Father Tom Coughlin was ordained in 1977, becoming one of the first deaf priests in North America. Four years later, he purchased what many would later nickname "Heaven on Earth," a rundown property on Fourth Lake in the heart of the Adirondacks. The former Mohawk Hotel with its tree-lined vistas and barn-red main lodge, was in a dire state of disrepair. But through the tireless dedication of volunteers and some elbow grease, it would open its doors as Camp Mark 7, named after the Bible chapter, and provide educational and life-affirming programming for deaf, hard of hearing, hearing KODA (Kids of Deaf Adults), and hearing visitors of all faiths. In the summer of 2013, <a href="http://www.deaffilmcamp.com/"> Deaf Film Camp </a> debuted at CM7. Founded by Stacy Lawrence, the camp recruited deaf and hard of hearing cinephiles ages 12-17 and paired them with deaf artists like filmmaker Wayne Betts, Jr., screenwriter Kalen Feeney, and animator Braam Jordaan to create shorts and their ever popular music video series. Today, DFC operates under long-time supporter Michael Kaufer and attracts teens from all over the world. Braam Jordaan has returned to share his love of all things art along with video producer/director Storm Smith, Switched at Birth star Daniel Durant, filmmaker Jay Kowalczyk, creative content developer Douglas Ridloff, sign language consultant Lauren Ridloff, and photographers Clare Cassidy and Tate Tullier. Unlike any other film camp, at DFC these teachers share a culture and a language with their deaf participants. Instructors and staff work hand-in-hand with sponsor organizations like the <a href="http://www.ntid.rit.edu/"> National Technical Institute for the Deaf </a>, <a href="http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/"> Gallaudet University </a>, and <a href="https://www.convorelay.com/"> Convo </a> to help develop creative pipelines and internship opportunities for campers later in life. The two-week camp gives students lifelong skills in story development, filming, editing, directing, and acting. Further, students learn the value of their contribution to the world of filmmaking as deaf artists and just how important their perspective is for all audiences.
