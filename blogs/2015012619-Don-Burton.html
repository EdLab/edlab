<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I have always viewed the human mind as a last frontier of science. As a student in college, I studied all the cognitive sciences from biology and neuroscience to philosophy, psychology and anthropology. How the brain gives rise to mind and how we realize our full potential as humans is one of the most complex and important topics, yet relative to other fields and we still have very little hard understandings. Yet we are on the cusp of discoveries that I think will have huge implications for our educational practices.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b>  Instead of the research side, I am on the application side of realizing human potential. I hope to take the best of what we know about learning and development and create products and services that make a difference in the education of our learners. I have been doing this for decades starting with the Disney Education group who wanted to build a Scholastic type business back in the 90’s. My dream is to re-invent education for the digital/information age instead of the industrial age system we have in place now (see my latest talk on the topic <a href="http://bit.ly/1xwcEa7">here</a>).

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> 3 broad trends:<br>
1. Advances in cognitive sciences especially neuroscience will cause a complete reframing of how we understand learning and the best ways to support it.<br>
2. Technology trends will continue to put new devices and new media in the hands of learners that help us reinvent our tools for learning.<br>
3. Global capital flows and the increasingly low cost to get Startups up and running will create an increased explosion of innovative ideas and offerings that come to the market place with the major disruptions and successes happening in the periphery of the traditional schooling/education systems at first (e.g., B2C and B2B, not B2I)<br>

<p><b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> At Burton EdTech, I am currently working on creating a platform for a wide variety of edtech investment and innovation from upstream ideation labs experimenting with state of the art technology and cognitive sciences, to an accelerator model incubator like our current Kaplan Edtech accelerator, to a studio model incubator where we found an idea and team putting in more capital and more time in the startup, to seed and Series A Funds that invest in successes from the upstream incubators and in ideas outside our incubators that we really love in the market place.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?<br>
<b>Answer:</b>  Iconoclastic Educator: Roger Schank <a href="http://bit.ly/1zmylts">@rogerschank</a> (explore his NLT Profile <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/639">here</a>); Iconoclastic Investor: Marc Andreessen <a href="http://bit.ly/1xRJ0eF">@pmarca</a>; and of course: myself <a href="http://bit.ly/1EyZR80">@dcburton</a>.</p>
