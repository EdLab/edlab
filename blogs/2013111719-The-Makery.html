<b>A Maker-Space for All</b><br>
STEM subjects have become increasingly important in education, but that doesnâ€™t mean that kids enjoy studying science, technology, engineering, and math.  To help inspire kids of all ages to want to learn more about STEM, <a href="http://www.nycmakery.com/">The Makery</a> hosts workshops for kids to learn about and tinker with technology (Take a look at their <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9862">behind-the-scenes video</a> on how The Makery works).  The Makery is run by <a href="http://htink.org/main/">HTINK</a>, an educational services cooperative that created this pop-up makerspace in the summer of 2012 to provide hands-on workshops for kids to "make something awesome."  What makes The Makery different from learning about STEM subjects in school is the emphasis on "spreading the joy of making." Students are not just reading books and taking tests, but rather, taking tools apart to put back together and developing electronic devices that they can play with later.
<p>
<b>Unique Workshops</b><br>
At The Makery, every workshop is unique; kids can come to multiple sessions to work on a variety of projects that experiment with things such as 3D printing, computer programming, photography, and soft circuits (take a look at their upcoming workshops on <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/org/3221203684">Eventbrite</a>).  While searching for a permanent space, The Makery continues to "pop-up" around different communities in New York City to reach out to as many kids as possible, often hosting at the <a href=" http://brooklynbrainery.com/">Brooklyn Brainery</a> and the <a href="http://theinvisibledog.org/">Invisible Dog Art Center</a> in Brooklyn, (learn more about how <a href="http://makezine.com/2012/08/14/nyc-makery-a-pop-up-makerspace-for-kids/">The Makery can be found at the Invisible Dog</a>).  
<p>
By offering these workshops that combine creativity and STEM education, The Makery is building a space where kids are not only able to learn about these fields, but also where they can get hands-on experience and gain a deeper understanding of subjects they may, or may not, have access to in traditional classes.  Moreover, when students have the opportunity to create things themselves, they often feel pride in their work, and this may spark interest in creating more things.  Though they may not have a permanent space yet, The Makery is proving to be a source of rich project-based learning opportunities for those who may not have these resources at their schools or homes.
