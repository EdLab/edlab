          <p>
            I'm fascinated by games, though I sometimes feel as though I come to them from an outsider perspective — I barely played any while growing up (I didn't encounter a single console until the ripe old age of 25!). I've generally resisted playing any games on my iPhone, and I've tried but failed to see the addictiveness of popular games like Angry Birds, Words with Friends, and Fruit Ninja. But games still hold a special allure, and I love trying to understand why and how people play.  

In the New York Times article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/angry-birds-farmville-and-other-hyperaddictive-stupid-games.html _r=1&ref=magazine&pagewanted=all">"Just One More Game..."</a> Sam Anderson discusses the recent proliferation of mobile games, as well as the addictiveness of these "stupid games" and their impact on productivity. In one memorable line he notes, "Plants vs. Zombies, ate up, I'm going to guess, a full 'Anna Karenina' of my leisure time."   

I do feel that he fails to address one key point: that not all games are “stupid games.” One could make a point that <i>all</i> forms of entertainment produce enjoyable but unchallenging media. But a movie like “Wrath of the Titans” can't (and shouldn't) be compared to “Mulholland Drive,” nor should “Twilight” be judged by the same standards as “Madame Bovary.” I would argue that “smart games” develop a strong affinity for characterization and storytelling in players and can hone puzzle-solving skills. I'd like to see how educational games can harness the qualities that these "smart games" possess.     

Relatedly, I'm planning on going to <a href="http://www.nyas.org/Events/SciEdDetail.aspx?cid=e3f1704d-40e3-4d62-a606-122322deb6b8">“The State of Games in the American Classroom”</a> at the New York Academy of Science on 4/17/12. Let me know if you want to join as well!
