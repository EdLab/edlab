Most teachers lead discussions by starting with an open question, then invite students share their ideas, opinions, and answers within the classroom space.  However, this video shows a professor who uses an experimental approach for his in-class discussions. During his lectures, <a href="http://rotolo.syr.edu/">Professor Roloto</a> will ask his students to discuss on Twitter, adding their comments in real-time.  With their discussions online, he hopes it will expand to larger audiences around the world.  That way, his students can learn from people with different mindsets and opinions, creating a diversity of thoughts on a single topic. His belief that social media should be incorporated into the classroom stems from the simple idea that social media is popular among so many people, so why wouldn’t teachers use it to their advantage?  <p>

Professor Roloto isn’t the only one using Twitter for teaching; other teachers are explaining <a href="https://www.teachingchannel.org/blog/2013/06/20/twitter-in-the-classroom/">why even kindergartners and elementary school students can benefit from using Twitter in the classroom</a>. They note that learning is augmented when projected into the "real world" through social media and technology. <p>

Do you think social media should be used to enhance discussion in the classroom, or is it too difficult for teachers to monitor unproductive activity on these sites during class?  Add your opinion to the <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9930">discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<b>@00:10 sjohnson:</b> The professor uses social media in the classroom to try to mirror the real world in the learning environment.  Is social media the real world? Is how you’re discussing on Twitter how you discuss in the "real world?"<p>

<b>@00.47 jmanlapid:</b> This has a lot of potential. Questions that are asked by students aren’t recorded anywhere however only at the will of the other listeners in the room. This back paneling and aggregation of student questions along with their relative answers can really supplement the curriculum at hand. <p>

<b>@02:29 mabel.zhuang: </b> Social media can create a classroom environment more like the environment students will find in the real-world.  <p>
