          <p>
            This week the Chicago Tribune <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/education/ct-met-high-school-to-college-0831-20110831,0,3381218.story?page=1">published</a> their original analysis of student performance in the Chicago higher education system.  Their findings indicate that, as seems to be the case across the country, students today seem to be largely unprepared for college work.  Of course, this isn't <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/12/15/2010-12-15_cuny_freshmen_not_up_to_it.html">exactly news</a>, but one interesting issue the article raises is the disconnect between high school and college performance.  It appears that performance in high school as measured by grades is not a very good predictor of performance in college, indicating that, for whatever reason, the Chicago public school system is failing to prepare their students adequately for college, and failing to properly inform their students of this lack of preparation. 
<!--break-->
A survey released by the College Board this week supports this finding.  As an <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/college_bound/2011/08/students_want_more_rigor_in_high_school_to_ready_for_college.html">EducationWeek blog</a> makes clear, substantial percentages of surveyed students believe they were inadequately prepared for college, that college was more difficult than they had expected, and that the requirements for graduation from high school should be more difficult.

The Chicago Tribune reports: “The average freshman GPA was 2.52 across all state universities and community colleges, roughly C+ work, based on the state's tracking of more than 90,000 public high school students who graduated between 2006 and 2008. In high school, those same kids exceeded a B average – 3.08. Graduates who enrolled in Illinois' four-year public universities during that period averaged a 2.78 GPA as freshmen, compared with 3.37 in public high schools.”

We often talk about grade inflation in college, but maybe a more serious issue (an issue with more serious consequences) is grade inflation in high school.
