<p>Videoconferencing technology is responsible for the development of an entire industry of online language education services that connect native speakers to eager learners around the world. The popularity of such platforms is illustrated by the expansive growth of Beijing-based company VIPKid, which currently connects more than <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/rapid-growth-in-education-tech-risks-harming-the-learning-experience-vipkid-ceo-says.html">500,000 Chinese students to 60,000 American teachers</a>, almost double their numbers from last year. However, connecting people across the globe via video can provide other opportunities for learning beyond language acquisition and practice; it can also enhance intercultural knowledge. Education researcher Yun Dai wanted to better understand the effectiveness of videoconferencing technology to influence deep intercultural learning.</p> 

<p>Dai’s study participants were three cohorts of 20 students at undergraduate universities in the U.S., China, and Taiwan. Research was conducted during a course on global innovation and product design in which all participants were enrolled. In order to determine whether videoconferencing could foster cultural self-awareness, deep cultural knowledge, and knowledge of culture-specific information necessary for intercultural competence, Dai had participants describe, compare, analyze, and reflect on everyday activities and cultural practices. Ethnographic data was collected through participant observation of two group-based projects, and discourse analysis was utilized based on class videos and audio interview transcriptions.</p>
 
<p>Results of the study revealed that as student groups undertook the two progressive tasks, they worked through various levels of understandings, moving from surface to deep learning. The groups unanimously recognized the importance of stepping back and recognizing the role of culture in their everyday lives. After scrutinizing, reflecting, and sharing their experiences, then comparing and contrasting their experiences with those shared by their international counterparts, the participants demonstrated an increase in intercultural knowledge.</p>

<p>This study demonstrates the potential of videoconferencing technology to achieve important learning objectives in global education programs and to create wider opportunities for intercultural learning and awareness. Digital technology has the power to connect people, no matter the distance; and utilizing it to decrease prejudice and increase empathy, self-awareness, and innovation is a truly important application.</p>
