            Most global sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup receive great recognition by the media and it is highly anticipated by fans. However, there is always some level of controversy, especially concerning citizens of that country. 
Citizens in host countries argue the huge amounts of money spent on these big sporting events could be better invested elsewhere such as healthcare and education. The upcoming World Cup in Brazil is no exception to this controversy. 

Citizens, politicians and celebrities in the South American country have all expressed their anger and frustration at organizers for the excessive amount of money spent on the tournament thus far. However, as this <a href="http://www.aworldatschool.org/news/entry/from-stadiums-to-schools-education-in-the-2014-world-cup">article</a> highlights, the organizers of the World Cup are planning on building 22 new schools in Brasilia, Brazil's capital city. The schools will serve as a lasting legacy of the tournament.  The schools will be built using 2,000 tons of leftover metal from the construction of a stadium in Brasilia. The new schools are expected to provide a positive learning environment for up to 13,000 children.

I never thought about schools becoming a lasting legacy of a sporting event. I think this is a great initiative and the idea should be used for other competitions in the future. Education will greatly benefit that society. Sports have a massive impact on society so by fusing major sports competitions with education will benefit children in a lot of countries who face problems receiving a quality education.
