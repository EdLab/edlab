<p>Food waste is a huge problem in this country. In fact, an estimated <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/american-food-waste/491513/">30-40% of food</a> produced here is never eaten. While there are many reasons explaining why this is the case, one is that big food distribution businesses often end up with food surpluses that they subsequently pitch. If the food can’t go on the shelves, it gets put in the garbage bin instead. Yet with <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/hunger-and-poverty-facts.html">42 million Americans insecure</a> about getting enough food, <a href="https://www.spoileralert.com">Spoiler Alert</a> knew that this surplus could be put to better use feeding people who need it.</p>

<p>Spoiler Alert is a tech startup that connects food distributors with non-profit partners. The online platform syncs company inventory systems to help them keep better track of their products as well as engage in real-time communication with organizations that serve meals to those in need. One Boston company that uses Spoiler Alert, Sysco, was able to provide over 300,000 meals this past year to nonprofits, and that number will continue to grow over time. Spoiler Alert helps solve the food waste problem while strengthening communities, all over its digital platform. It’s truly an innovative tech company making the world a better place one fewer pitched food item at a time.</p>

<p>What do you think might be some of the barriers to companies using Spoiler Alert? What other tech companies are addressing food waste or climate change? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/38721/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:39 csd2126:</b> Changing inventory systems is no easy task. This could be a barrier to using Spoiler Alert.</p>

<p><b>@02:39 Claude.Bosse:</b> I could also see nonprofit organizations being barriers to using Spoiler Alert as it seems like they are truly getting 'leftovers' companies don't want.</p>
