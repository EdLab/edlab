<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inaturalist/id421397028?mt=8">iNaturalist</a> helps you learn about local ecosystems as you identify and document living organisms in your area. Snap a picture in nature, and the app will help identify the organism, and then plot it on its built-in, satellite map for other users to see. iNaturalist is building a community of nature explorers who want to learn more about their surroundings.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>iNaturalist has several compelling features. First, it has astute recognition capabilities; snap a picture, and the app will use that as well as your location to determine what the image is. It can recognize plants, animals, insects, and fungi. In addition, you can browse the observations that others have documented in your area. Each entry contains the original picture, information about the organism, and comments. Other users verify the identification by voting, and some observations are vetted as up to research standards and shared with scientists. In addition, users can join different identification projects with other members of the site, trying to document species in specific areas, such as in city parks.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because the data in iNaturalist is sourced by users, there are much more thorough collections in areas with greater populations. Rural areas don’t have as many documented observations as cities despite the fact that they probably have larger ecosystems. While this limits the iNaturalist community in these areas, it does open the door for greater exploration in them.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>From using this app, I learned a lot about the plant and animal ecosystem of my neighborhood in Manhattan. The iNaturalist community is strong and seems to only be growing, so I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about plant and animal species.</p>
