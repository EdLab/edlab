            So after lots of questions and really good discussions with EdLab members, I have pretty much focused my efforts down to the idea of concentrating on videobooth style installations for the library and EdLab. I will still be presenting some other documentation of my process as well.

Why a videobooth? Videobooths are not particularly new and most people have some sort of videobooth software on their computer. Many also often have the ability to upload from their phones. But as you all know, video is time confusing and tough to produce. Given this, how do we establish a hi-bandwidth(lots of users) stream with a low barrier to entry?
One way is to make it really simple and remove the problem of choice. See the Ted video below to hear a little bit more about why it's really nice sometimes to have less choices. I love the fact that my garden timelapse camera has only one button.

<object width="334" height="326"><param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff"></param> <param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/embed/BarrySchwartz_2005G-embed_high.flv&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/BarrySchwartz-2005G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=320&vh=240&ap=0&ti=93" /><embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="334" height="326" allowFullScreen="true" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/embed/BarrySchwartz_2005G-embed_high.flv&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/BarrySchwartz-2005G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=320&vh=240&ap=0&ti=93"></embed></object>

The key features are the fixed physical location and the device specificity. The installation will likely just have a simple one or two button interface and then videos will go directly to YouTube or Vimeo or blip or social media site of your choice.

How do you enable users to give you immediate feedback on the books they are reading, what they think about the library, etc? Librarians and others can also make quick and dirty posts regarding longer and larger projects they are working on. It's a way to leave smaller documented steps in between all the produced videos.

I also believe by having a video record of the public spaces, you will build some trust and value for that physical space. This is related to public logfiles for projects such as Wikipedia and Linux. 

I think the videobooth concept although not new, has great potential for education and cultural documentation. 

More of my notes on the <a href=http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARG7uR4_1QgeZGNwZnA0NmpfOTZoaHNwNG5ocA&hl=en">project</a>.

This is also relevant to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3021">Skye's recent post</a> where he noted how helpful it was to have flip cams that he could give out to the various groups at tables.

We're talking about installing a simple prototype in the fifth floor hallway. Please let me know if you have any ideas. Hopefully i will have a quick and dirty prototype running by the presentations on Friday.
