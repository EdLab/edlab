Flowers are blooming, birds are singing, bugs are buzzing! As we pass the midway point of April, Earth Day is on its way; with nature being so busy, there's no better time to celebrate the planet.

This staff picks collection captures the spirit of the holiday, which was first observed as a teach-in that took place at many American colleges and universities. Since its launch in 1970, much has changed. The ways we study and connect with our planet are vastly different, as are the things we know about Earth and its place in the universe. I gathered materials across many subjects -- from everyday reuse and recycling to water protection, wind power to interplanetary colonization -- to demonstrate what it is that we have learned. Scientific discovery not only helps us preserve our planet and everything on it, but it also gives us the ability to create great works of fiction. Many of the works listed here are true. Those that are not were chosen because they are based in inquiry: the driving force behind how far we've come as a species.

<em>Something Stinks!</em> by Gail E. Hedrick

<em>Silent Spring</em> by Rachel Carson
SB959 .C3 1962
<blockquote>When the public protests, confronted with some obvious evidence of damaging results of pesticide applications, it is fed little tranquilizer pills of half truth.</blockquote>
