<p><a href="http://odysseytranslator.com/">Odyssey Translator</a> is an offline translator app designed for travelers that allows users to learn phrases and questions pertaining to their current needs. Complete with voice recordings of native speakers, this app will instantly translate sentences as you tap them out wherever you are. It is offered in nine different languages and while the initial, limited version is free, the complete phrasebook is accessible with an in-app purchase of $4.99.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The specific purpose of this app shines through in its user-friendly interface. Different brightly colored boxes, labeled and illustrated, organize different categories of conversation clearly and cleanly. Ranging from <i>dining</i> to <i>transportation</i>, each topic has subtopics that narrow the search for what type of phrases and vocabulary a user might be searching for. For example, within the <i>medical</i> category, subtopics include symptoms, allergic reactions, blood type, medication dosage, and injuries. Then, within each subtopic are a variety of subjects, objects, verbs, and question words pertaining to that category, allowing you to quickly select and learn how to spell and pronounce the phrase you’ve created.</p>

<p>Beyond being clearly setup for fast, easy use, I appreciate that Odyssey Translator takes the time to break apart the different components of a phrase so that you understand what you’re saying instead of strictly parroting. As each word or phrase is tapped and added to the sentence the user is creating, the foreign equivalent is highlighted and spoken clearly and slowly by a native speaker. This encourages the user to learn to speak for themselves instead of simply flipping their phone around to show another person the text.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Odyssey Translator is excellent in its current format for providing quick access to translations for travelers, its utility is limited strictly to this. The search function only allows you to look up words in your own language, not the target language, and even then is limited to what exists within the categories the app offers (for example, no animal name translations can be found). While the app may be useful for travelers who just want the basics, those who’d really like to go beyond simple phrases will likely discard Odyssey after a few weeks.</p>
 
<p>Another sign that this app isn’t ideal for someone truly interested in learning a language is that it’s handicapped by an exclusively English lens. The differences in grammar and language structure aren’t explained, and even the alphabet, which you can learn in a section labeled <i>Roman Alphabet</i>, forces the target language into an orthography that doesn’t always work. For example, in the Spanish language app, the Roman Alphabet section doesn’t include letters like "ll" and "ñ", which is problematic, because they are not letters a native English speaker is going to look at and immediately know how to pronounce. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While Odyssey Translator never claims to be more than a traveler’s fast and easy-to-use companion, I think it has a lot of room for improvement. Without a comprehensive dictionary, versatile search function, or accurate portrayal of the language being learned, this app falls short of being the dynamic translator it has the potential to be. </p>
