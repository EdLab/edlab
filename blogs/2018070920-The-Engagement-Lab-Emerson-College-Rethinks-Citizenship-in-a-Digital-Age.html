<p><i>"Whether they are used in classrooms or town squares, the tools and processes we develop make civic engagement meaningful for citizens and communities."</i> (<a href="https://elab.emerson.edu/about">About Engagement Lab</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Civics in a Digital Age</b></p>

<p>Civic engagement is changing in an increasingly digital world, and the <a href="https://elab.emerson.edu">Engagement Lab @ Emerson College</a> is researching how and leading the way forward. Founded in 2007 by Dr. Eric Gordon, the Engagement Lab creates media, technology, and games that aim to solve disparities in civic participation in countries around the world. The Lab has a staff of researchers, designers, programmers, artists, and students who create projects and tools to help advance their mission of reworking what it means to be a citizen in a networked age.</p>

<p><b>Developments and Projects</b></p>
 
<p>The Engagement Lab has both applied research and design components that feed into its development and projects. Some of the ways the Lab is progressing civic participation include hosting workshops on topics such as civic games and data literacy, creating tools for classrooms and communities to support civic learning and engagement, and designing artistic projects that initiate dialogue around civic issues. In addition, the Engagement Lab recently launched a 12-month graduate program in Civic Media, Art, and Practice that trains students to use creative media and technology to advance civic issues and community organization.</p>
 
<p>A look at the Lab’s project list shows their efforts are extensive, global, and focused on many different civic issues. One recent project, called <a href="https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/boda-boda">Boda Boda</a>, involved designing a game that helped motorcycle cab drivers in Uganda learn and maintain first aid skills. Another game-based project, <a href="https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/atstake">@Stake</a>, taught users how to deliberate effectively with others while building empathy and creativity via both a tabletop and mobile game. One of the Lab’s recent research efforts, <a href="https://elab.emerson.edu/projects/a-tethered-world">A Tethered World</a>, evaluated the mobile phone habits of 800 students across eight different countries. Each of these, as well as the many other projects the Lab has completed, strive toward making a significant impact in civic participation in a tech-filled world.</p>
 
<p><b>Individual Efforts, Big Impact</b></p>

<p>The Engagement Lab is founded on the belief that play and new technology can provide creative opportunities for people to participate in civic life in a meaningful way. Their efforts also demonstrate confidence in the idea that big changes in civic participation come from interacting with and educating people at the individual level, in their daily activities, and in their interactions with others.</p>
