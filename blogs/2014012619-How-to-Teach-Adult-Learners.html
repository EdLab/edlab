The advent of an information society and knowledge economy has transformed how we live, learn, and work in modern culture. Increasingly, fewer people envision a life where learning stops once they graduate; rather, most plan to be lifelong learners -- catching up with the latest technologies and knowledge in order to work effectively in a dynamic new world. As "learner" no longer describes solely young people but also refers to many adults, more attention needs to be paid to how to teach adults effectively. <p>

The current industrial model of education remains deeply rooted in traditional ideas about teaching and learning, and instructor-centered professional development reminds many adults of their boring-yet-required school days. What are some pedagogies that would tap into more adult brain power and engage them in meaningful deep learning? How might problem-based and constructivist approaches be used for adult learning? This short, 3-minute clip shares a few simple principles and tips for teaching adults. Watch this animated video for a quick overview, and share your learning or teaching experiences with adults <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12044">on Vialogues</a> <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@02:47 Carla: </b>"Take the spotlight off you and let it shine on your students." This is a great sentiment. Just because you're no longer a sage on the stage doesn't diminish your role in the classroom. In fact, you are that much more important, as I'm sure many adult learners are more used to the old lecture and may not be comfortable with this new style. Your role as facilitator/guide should help them transition, though. <p>

<b>@02:50 Wang: </b> This video does a great job to put problem-based and constructivism learning into plain words with engaging animations. These are also widely promoted pedagogies for great education for kids as well. I wonder what are some other aspects that distinguish effective pedagogies for teaching adults from teaching children? <p>
