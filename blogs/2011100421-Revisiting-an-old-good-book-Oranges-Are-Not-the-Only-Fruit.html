            <strong>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</strong>, Jeanette Winterson<strong></strong>

<strong>Where I got the book</strong>:  I’ve been re-reading old paperbacks on my bookshelf at home one by one,  so I grabbed this off my own shelf.  (Our bookshelves are organized by  color of spine, not by author or subject (gasp!) and so right now, I’m  reading through the orange section.<strong></strong>

<strong>How you can find it in the library</strong>: PR6073.I558 O7 1987 (at Barnard and Butler)

<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/10/cover_oranges_arne_not1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12779" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/cover_oranges_arne_not1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

<strong>Plot synopsis</strong>: The  young Jeanette (not to be confused with the author--it’s a novel) is  adopted by an evangelical family who raises her to become a  missionary.  Though she’s an outcast at school, Jeanette grows up  thinking herself special, and feels perfectly comfortable living among her extensive quirky cast of church friends and relatives until  she discovers she’s attracted to her best (female) friend, and her  finely balanced home-life falls apart.  Spunky, clever, and full of  religious witticisms, Winterson’s first novel won the Whitbread Prize  for Best Fiction and is taught in many college English courses.

<strong>Why I'd recommend it</strong>: I  first read this book when I was an undergrad (for fun, not for class) and loved it, and was  curious to see if I’d feel the same now.  If anything, I appreciated  this book far more on my second read; I’m not sure I originally picked  up on the dexterity of Winterson’s sly religious puns or fully grasped  her extended metaphors (executed through a series of fairy tales that  break up the main narrative).  Many of the scenes are so funny I was  crying laughing while on the subway--a situation I find vaguely  embarrassing.  I kept laughing and then thinking to myself, “Self, pull  it together.  Think of something sad.”  But curiosity would compel me to  keep reading again, and again I’d start laughing.  But more than her  humour I appreciate her depth.  For instance, a passage toward the end,  when she’s struggling to leave her religion (she starts speaking to a  demon who appears on her windowsill in the form of an orange).  “I knew I  couldn’t cope, so I didn’t try. I would let the feeling out later, when  it was safe.  For now, I had to be hard and white. In the frosty days,  in the winter, the ground is white, then the sun rises, and the frosts  melt....”  It’s the sort of book I read more and more slowly as it  progressed, hoping I could somehow avoid finishing, but alas! I finished  it.

Time for the next book in the orange section of my bookshelf.
