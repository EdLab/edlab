<p><b>Title:</b> MTClassroom and MTDashboard: Supporting Analysis of Teacher Attention in an Orchestrated Multi-tabletop Classroom (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Martinez-Maldonado, J. Kay, K. Yacef, M. Edbauer, & Y. Dimitriadis</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxybWFydGluZXptYWxkb25hZG8yfGd4OjQyMWI4OWI1Y2U2NzJhM2U">International Conference on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
What can teachers learn from real-time classroom information and how does it change their teaching?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Multi-touch software in the classroom is meant to enable collaborative group work in a digital environment. MTClassroom is a software program designed for small groups of students collaborating together on a multi-touch surface. Teachers are able to control the learning environment through MTDashboard, a command center accessed through a handheld device. The dashboard lets teachers initiate and end classroom activities for each group, message students, and engage with a visualization of student progress.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxybWFydGluZXptYWxkb25hZG8yfGd4OjQyMWI4OWI1Y2U2NzJhM2U">MTClassroom and MTDashboard: Supporting Analysis of Teacher Attention in an Orchestrated Multi-tabletop Classroom</a> investigated teacher interaction with the MTDashboard to guage whether access to this real-time information informed teacher behavior and attention towards particular groups.</p>

<p>The authors studied students in the School of Business at the University of Sydney over two semesters during which MTClassroom and MTDashboard were used in group activities. Each session examined small groups of 4-5 students in classrooms of up to 20 students. Between the two semesters and based on input from the teachers in the study, the creators of MTDashboard added support for visualizations of student participation to the teacher control interface. These visualizations enabled teachers to see the number of touches for each group and which group members were contributing the touches. The authors considered data collected by the MTClassroom and MTDashboard systems, notes on teacher behavior taken by researchers in the classroom, and interviews with teachers. Using data from the MTDashboard, they analyzed the physical distance between the teacher and each group throughout the group activity with attention to teacher engagement with the dashboard and the actions of the teacher directly after looking at the dashboard.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Teachers reported that they used the participation information on MTDashboard, but also monitored verbal participation the old-fashioned way. The authors found that teachers did change their behavior after looking at the dashboard. In the experimental sessions, the teacher attended the highest-performing group 18% of the time while control teachers attended the highest-performing group 43% of the time. This likely means that teachers, informed of group activity in real time, were more likely to help struggling groups than teachers who did not have access to real-time information. They found that groups that experienced teacher interventions in this way had more interactions and collaborations with the instructor thereafter, which is an encouraging indicator of greater engagement with classroom work. Overall, the real-time data seemed to have an impact on teacher interaction with student groups and seemed to help ensure that low performing groups received more teacher attention.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Providing feedback for teachers is challenging, especially when it comes to real-time classroom information. With the explosion of new classroom technology and improvements in this stream of research, it will soon become possible to provide teachers with more immediate feedback. This research considered multi-touch technology, but this type of real-time feedback could apply to any adaptive system including educational gameplay, clicker technologies, and participation with online resources or a learning management system. These results are a promising glimpse into a future of greater classroom participation and useful student information.</p>
