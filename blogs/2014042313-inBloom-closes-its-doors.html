          <p>
            On April 21st inBloom decided to close its doors. With 100 million in support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, it was hoped that this would be the thing to bring the future of education to the present. The bud didn't bloom and now it has wilted, but its seeds of hopes and controversy will no doubt continue to have hold the potential for growth.

The hopeful hope for a system that can aggregate student-data in such a way that teachers in classrooms, administrators and policy makers can use the data to inform instruction, school design and policy reform. 

The concern is that individuals will not act so ethically with the information. 

In the end, the concern was about what exactly inBloom collected (in inBloom it is a wide range of data points from social security to grades, income to ethnicity to behavior issues to learning strengths and weaknesses) and what would be done with that information. In the end, the concern won out. Colorado and Louisiana both backed out of using inBloom and New York State passed laws against using such systems. 

There are many reasons to doubt a system collecting and comparing so much information about individuals, especially if that information sets out to predict future outcomes for individuals in unethical ways (there is no evidence from what I read that inBloom led to such mis-use of data, but the potential is still there). 

But what is the potential for such a system? How could we collect data that would radically transform how teachers teach in a classroom? What data would we collect? Collecting data has allowed us to understand so many elements of our life and society.  It is not an understatement to say it has radically changed the way we think and live. In medicine, another field with deeply ethical issues, it has been revolutionary. Is there a way data can transform education that is ethical?
