<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
My educational trajectory started with my training in special education back in the 1970s in which technology was a major tool (assistive technology) for customizing teaching and learning. The foundation that technology can be an effective teaching and learning tool shaped my current work in emerging mobile technologies for teaching and learning.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
It is the hope that my work will help people to utilize their mobile devices of smart phones and tablets as effective teaching, learning, and workforce tools. I would like to see students use their phones to support their education programs, learning styles, keeping informed, being engaged, and to foster creativity. My motto is: "Education On-Demand and Within Your Hands"
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
There are two trends that will have a major impact on teaching and learning, (1) emerging wearable sensor driven technology (like your smart phones, glasses, clothing, and communities) and (2) the innovations of smart gadgets and tools (such as your smart football helmets, smart homes, 3 & 4 D Printing, robotics. etc). Children as young as five will be able to code and program technological devices. Your smartphones will be able to diagnosis diseases, inform you of potential physical and environmental risks. In other words there will be a seamless connection among people and between things. (You will be connected to your car and your car will be connected to the highways, etc.)
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
Due to my years of work in identifying mobile apps for education I have proclaimed myself as the first <b>"App-ologist"</b>  (a person that studies mobile devices and apps for education and workforce development). I am currently working on the expansion of my Mobile App Resource Center Website (curation of over 50,000 mobile apps) called <b><a href= "http://bit.ly/15DSG4w">"Appapedia"</a></b> where educators from PreK to the world of work may find mobile apps for their preferred mobile device that are aligned to their program areas. My goal is for educators to come to this free open source website and not only find apps for their program but to register (free) to automatically receive notification of new apps in their areas. In other words, educators would not have to constantly search for apps. Apps would constantly come to them!
<p>
My next major project is the exploration and evaluation of smart gadgets and tools (iGadgets) for education and workforce development. I have started collecting gadgets that connect to your smart phones in order to determine the educational value and safety for teaching and learning. I have collected over thirty types of gadgets for your smartphone such as your iHealth Blood Pressure Kit, smart fork, sensor basketball (94Fifty), WINK Hub for connecting your home with your phone, Sensordrone (detecting gases and temperature), etc. Just think in the future your phone would be able to transform into tools for workforce, medical, communication, etc. Yes, your phone will be able to diagnosis diseases, translate languages on demand, identify objects, etc.
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<a href=" http://bit.ly/1zDxisQ">Helen Crompton</a>, <a href=" http://bit.ly/1yMVTKm">George Saltsman</a>, <a href=" http://bit.ly/1GIs6rm">Elliot Soloway</a>
