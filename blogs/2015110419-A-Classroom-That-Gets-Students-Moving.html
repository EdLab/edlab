<p>Walking into a school in the Eanes Independent School District (ISD) in Texas might be a little disorienting at first. After all, these classrooms are not made up of wooden desks lined up in discrete, isolated rows. Instead, students sit in rolling chairs with attached desks that allow them to wheel themselves around the room, free to rearrange into constantly changing groups. The walls are bright shades of green or orange, and the glass paneling that replaces traditional bulletin boards diplays student work.</p>

<p>Eanes ISD is piloting this new type of learning environment based off of a combination of ergonomics and aesthetic appeal, with the goal of engaging students in a novel, dynamic way. Even though some teachers were initially concerned that the rolling chairs would be a distraction for students, they reported that students seem to feel much more comfortable in this flexible classroom, even acting more friendly toward one another as they maneuvered around the room.</p>

<p>The setup is meant to encourage student autonomy and motivation, with students using their chairs to move into groups or across stations. Teachers act as facilitators instead of sole controllers of a fixed classroom environment, and students are given the freedom to stand up and move around rather than being forced to sit in the same chair for the entire day.</p>

<p>Should teachers relinquish a certain degree of control to allow students to move around throughout the classroom? Does this type of classroom setup lead to productivity or chaos? Add your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/17992/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:35 Carla:</b> It's very interesting that students feel more of an ownership of their space when it's flexible. I would've thought it would be the opposite, that students see the desk they always sit in as their property.</p>

<p><b>@00:52 Sappho:</b> I worked in a classroom that used these chairs! It does make it easy for students to move into groups and then move back out into big groups. Sometimes, though, students would slip out of the chairs because they are very smooth.</p>
