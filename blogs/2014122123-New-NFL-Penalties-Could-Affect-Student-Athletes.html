          <p>
            The outrage that followed Ray Rice's assault on his then fiancÃ©e and the backlash against the NFL for its lack of action on the topic has forced the league to  <a href="http://news10.com/2014/08/29/new-nfl-penalties-could-affect-student-athletes/" target = "blank">adopt new and more stringent penalties</a> for such offenses by its members. The new measures state that players will face at least six weeks of suspension on their first offense. However, the league did not stop with just pros, it outlines measures for athletes at the college and high school level. Student athletes who have a history of violence prior to college might face a stricter punishment on their first offense or might not be allowed to join the football team of their choice. 
<p>
I hope these measures will serve as a "serious wake up call" for all athletes. Most high school and college athletes try to emulate the lifestyles of professional athletes. If professional athletes are forced to set good examples, I believe that will go a long way in educating prospective athletes. Other sports leagues should adopt this initiative by NFL. Domestic violence and violence of any kind should not be tolerated. Athletes serve as role models for many kids and prospective athletes. In order to have future athletes who set good moral values, it is necessary to have current professional athletes who exhibit good such values.
