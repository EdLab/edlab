<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

"Just as variety is the spice of life, differentiation is the spice of learning." -Breaux and Magee, <em>How the Best Teachers Differentiate Instruction</em>

This accessible and practical guide shows teachers how to provide their students with a variety of ways to strengthen their understanding of new material. A selection of assessments is also available to ensure that students have mastered classroom content, regardless of their individual learning styles, abilities, and needs. Contents include:
<ul>
	<li> What is differentiated instruction and why do we differentiate?</li>
	<li> Know your students</li>
	<li> Management for differentiated instruction</li>
	<li> 12 ways to differentiate</li>
	<li> And more!</li>
</ul>
"Although there are many books available on differentiation and RTI, most of them overwhelm teachers with too much information and not enough practicality. This book is a practical and readable resource for teachers who have limited time to devote to outside reading." -Susan Gorman, Director of School Improvement, Osawatomie School District, KS
