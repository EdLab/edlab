            Fisher Price has produced a new video piece portraying their projection for <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/en_US/future-of-parenting/index.html">"The Future of Parenting"</a> which includes a whole species of interactive toys and parenting tools... most of which appear to rely on principals of floating 3D animation (the closest I can imagine the actual technology being is <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/video/projection-mapping-912849">Projection Mapping</a> or some kind of reactive hologram). It shows an idealistic (and super-normative) family living in a fully networked home complete with integrated lighting, baby monitoring, 3D fabrication and documentation.

The film is beautiful but the really impressive part is the length and breadth of the research and talent behind it. In the accompanying PDF <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/resources/images/FOP/FisherPrice_ThinkingBehindTheVision.pdf">"The Thinking Behind the Vision"</a> they break down the process and the collaborators.
<blockquote>IN ORDER TO WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE FUTURE OF DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY, we talked to the best and brightest from the worlds of art, science, technology, and design. From early childhood development specialists and innovators to futurists and thought leaders, their insights took us to a life a decade away from the here and now - where technology has heart and parents have help.</blockquote>
The cohort of experts came to a few core principals and insights about the interaction and technology they imagined:
<ul>
	<li>Dynamic Simplicity
<ul>
	<li>Experiences that evolve with people, generating meaningful new life through intuitive and constant updating over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Contextualized Response
<ul>
	<li>Responsive learning and play inspired by what is happening at a specific moment in time and place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Keep it Human
<ul>
	<li>Technology that becomes invisible reflecting and reacting to human expression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Imaginative Immersion
<ul>
	<li>Environments become a threshold where anything can be an immersive display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>No Boundaries
<ul>
	<li> Experiences do not live in isolation but connect and flow in the spaces between redefining open-ended and contextual play.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Quantified Self
<ul>
	<li>Meaningful intelligence that collects and connects the data driven insights between what people are saying and why they are doing it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
I think there's a lot to be learned from the effort of this collaboration about how to combine learning and technology seamlessly and intuitively into everyday activity. We are relying less and less on having to <em>read the instructions</em> in order to understand and use the tools we rely on the most which means either that we are becoming more aligned with trends and necessities in user interface, or that UI is slowly coming closer to our most basic selves.

How can we be better at creating an intuitive language around learning technology and learning spaces (that aren't completely fictional)? How can we explain complicated concepts other than expecting people to read the instruction manual, and then make sure that the rules for that interaction is the same or similar for a whole network of connected uses, users and devices?

In the meantime does anyone know how to program for responsive projection mapping?!
