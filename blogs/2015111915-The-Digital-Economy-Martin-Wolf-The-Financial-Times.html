            <b>Evaluating the Importance of the <i>Digital Economy</i>   </b>
<i>How important is digital technology to the new economy?   </i>

There is an almost incessant chatter about technology these days. One of the most recurring ideas is the disruptive impact of digital technology on the world. However, among leading economic thinkers, there is a strong disagreement regarding what some call the <i>Digital Economy</i>. A recent discussion examined the Digital Economy, its economic consequences, and other key questions. For example, what is the significance of the Digital Economy for both U.S. and global growth? How is the Digital Economy transforming traditional industries? And what are the implications of the Digital Economy for developing countries as well as cross border trade? Presented below is a synopsis of some of the main themes and ideas that were examined during this panel discussion. To make reading of this material more intelligible, I focus on one speaker at a time. The speaker discussed below is Martin Wolf, CBE. Mr. Wolf is a Columbia Global Fellow, as well as Associate Editor and Chief Economics Commentator for the <i>Financial Times</i>.

<b>What is the <i>Digital Economy</i>?</b>
-Naming this phenomenon the <i>Digital Economy</i> may not be accurate or particularly useful—this is not a trivial point. However, the Digital Economy consists of, among other things, knowledge and information processing. As a result, these are elements used within the economy as a whole and not a distinguishable, completely separate, discrete part of the economy.
-Digital technologies transform all parts of the economy and specifically alters the types of activities we already participate in as opposed to necessarily creating new ones. As such, again, we should not think of the Digital Economy as a separate economy unto itself but, instead, a transformational force within the existing economy. As a result, conceived in this manner, the process of digitization—converting analog activities into bits—and communicating more effectively due to a shared digital infrastructure, has more radical, profound implications on how we define ourselves as humans (e.g., for more on this idea, please see Yuval Noah Harari’s book <i>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</i>)

<b>High-Tech v. High-Touch</b>
-We need to distinguish between <i>high-tech</i> and <i>high-touch</i> activities. High-touch implies dealing directly with other human beings—for example, those involving children and old people, such as education or health care. Due to their human elements, these activities are least open to transformation from growing digital technology as opposed to purely mechanical endeavors. This has implications in terms of the productivity growth of high-touch activities (e.g., technology may not profoundly improve their productivity due to their human base).

<b>Effects of Transformation</b>
-Digital technology helps shift comparative advantages. For example, technology can help improve mechanized routines, organize cross-border trade, etc. An increase in the presence of virtual businesses means there is not necessarily a need for a great deal of physical infrastructure or financial capital for these types of entities to begin, operate, and flourish. This can lower barriers to entry in terms of economic activity. However, due to the dislocation inherent in online ventures, taxation can be correspondingly difficult (e.g., how do you define what is a taxable versus non-taxable entity when it is online? And how do you define the territory where the tax burden should be paid if the business is truly multinational in nature?). Finally, as a result, how do you protect bricks and mortar retailers (and other types of traditional analog businesses) from Amazon, eBay, and their online brethren?

<b>The Productivity Paradox</b>
-The sectors where productivity growth is highest are normally where productivity growth started out being the lowest (e.g., it is relative). 
-The manufacturing and agricultural industries once achieved higher productivity due to the development of increased mass transportation, improved health, decreased infant mortality rates, the rise of the internal combustion engine, and the widespread availability of electricity. Unfortunately, today’s current economy consists of sectors such as health, education, manufacturing, and tourism that together account for an enormous proportion of total economic activity, but their productivity growth rates are currently low. Digital technology may not impact them very much in terms of promoting productivity growth, as discussed above. And unfortunately, as their productivity growth rate has declined, the Digital Economy has had relatively trivial impact, especially in comparison to disruptive forces in the 19th century such as increased/improved transportation, health, electricity, and internal combustion systems, as mentioned above.

<b>The Economics of Digital Information </b>
-Digital information has zero cost of dissemination. As a result, this apparent affordance also poses a huge problem due to appropriation (e.g., once the information has been accessed, it can be easily shared on a global basis without payment to the original content creator).
-Due to the phenomenon of zero cost dissemination, traditional revenue models for information-based businesses have collapsed (e.g., newspapers, magazines, etc.).
-Historically, news organizations sold a joint product: (1) news, and (2) advertising. New “digital platforms” (think Facebook or Google ecosystems) have started to increasingly produce/sell advertising (and, as a result, earn revenue) that traditionally went to mass media companies. Essentially these platforms act as aggregating parasites that have cannibalized news and media organizations. There is virtually zero cost for disseminating this information across the world. Therefore, since this aggregated content is produced for nothing, it is not economically useful.

<b> Information Impacts Distance </b>
-Lowering cost of information can essentially reduce the distance from the market (especially for online goods). As a result, low cost information can have a beneficial impact.
-There will most likely be a time, not far off in the future, where smartphones will be ubiquitous. With them, you can increase access to all the information available on the planet. However, how this unprecedented bounty of information is used can be depressing…
-Low cost information sharing through the internet has profound implications—it is <i>hyperglobalizing</i> the world. Information of all types is an important input into the production of all things.

<b>Leapfrogging </b>
-The developing world has benefitted from “leapfrogging.” Leapfrogging implies improving very quickly, and surpassing previous analog bottlenecks, due to technological interventions. 
-For example, due to the wide availability of mobile phones, some countries have effectively worked around the problem of a poor (or a complete lack of) fixed line telephone systems (e.g., India). Similarly, by using mobile phones to act as a mechanism for payments, Kenya has “leaped over” bank failures.
-This “leapfrogging” is potentially transformative. For example, simple farmers equipped with smartphones could have access to global markets, better pricing, etc. This could potentially have a very big impact on their lives and wider impacts on the global economy.

<b>Inputs Not Gadgets </b>
-How do we measure a Digital Sector that produces stuff (e.g., goods and services)?
-Google as an input to other companies, individuals, etc. is an interesting concept.
-However, although Apple’s gadgets are interesting in and of themselves, analyzing them may not be useful to think of in terms of the Digital Economy (e.g., Apple’s products are simply an extension of the traditional, analog-base,d consumer electronics microeconomy, not a completely different economy).

<b>Paul David on Electricity </b>
-Paul David’s work on electricity has been very important and truly informative. More specifically, there was a long lag in productivity regarding electricity until people figured out how to use it correctly (e.g., self-powered motors in individual pieces of equipment allowed factories to be spread out on one expansive floor so that there was sufficient spacing to handle equipment/goods, hence improving productivity, etc.). As a result, perhaps there is a similar lag with digital technology (e.g., perhaps we haven’t figured out an efficient way to truly leverage the affordances of digital technology in any impactful way that improves productivity)
-Nobel Laureate Robert Solow once quipped (and inadvertently created the idea of the “Solow computer paradox”)—&quot;You can see the computer everywhere but in the productivity statistics.&quot; This paradox has been defined as the “discrepancy between measures of investment in information technology and measures of output at the national level.&quot; 

<b>Developments More Impactful Than Digital Information </b>
-There are at least two phenomena that are arguably more important to productivity than digital technology and the Digital Economy, as per Paul David’s work discussed above.
-First, electric lights created a huge surplus in productivity. They extended the day by 2 or 3 hours, especially in more remote locations like Northern Europe burdened by low daylight.
-Second, clean water also contributed strongly to productivity. Great numbers of children survived due to higher quality water, providing a colossal surplus, especially when compared to something relatively unimportant like an iPad. 
-Overall, electricity has resulted in, again, a colossal productivity surplus—we have consistently undervalued electricity's impact.

<b>New Data Sources </b>
-The Digital Economy, the digitization of analog information, and the native creation of purely digital sources, collectively results in huge new data sources.
-However, despite this growth in “information,” do we “know” more about the financial sector than ever before? For example, did these additional data sources help us during the 2008 financial crisis? Probably not.
-Major financial reporters, university economists, etc. have no idea about the true financial sheets of any major corporation. As a result, the Digital Economy isn’t giving these constituencies much…
