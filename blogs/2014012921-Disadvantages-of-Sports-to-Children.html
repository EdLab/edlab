          <p>
            There are several benefits that come from playing sports such as collaboration, teamwork and commitment. On the other hand, there are also several disadvantages that come with sports. According to this <a hrep="http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/disadvantages-children-sports-1115.html">article</a>, most children engage in sports and are unfortunately prone to some of disadvantages. 

Physical injury was mentioned in the article and it emphasized how a lot of children who engage in sports end up injured due to the intense physical nature of most sports. Another disadvantage is the bad behavior of other children, whether teammates or opponents. These children mostly exhibit bad sportsmanship and sometimes do whatever it takes to win a game.

As a child, sports were very fascinating to me and for this reason I engaged in four different sports: soccer, ping-pong, basketball and volleyball. They all exposed me to different sporting environments and taught me a lot in terms of sportsmanship and sort of injuries I could expect. I wouldn't call injuries in sports as a disadvantage. I would rather call them challenges. There comes a point in sports where an athlete will be challenged and that are when determination and perseverance comes in handy. Also, as an athlete, you choose whom to learn from so in essence, the bad behavior of teammates or opponents should not affect you in any way. One part of being a great athlete is the ability to transform disadvantages into strengths.
