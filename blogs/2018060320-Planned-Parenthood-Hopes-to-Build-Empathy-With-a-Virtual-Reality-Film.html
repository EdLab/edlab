<p>Planned Parenthood is increasingly using emerging technology to reach out to younger generations. Among their tech projects, they created a virtual reality film documenting what it’s like to be a patient walking through the line of protesters roosted outside many Planned Parenthood clinics. The film, <i><a href="http://www.acrossthelinevr.com">Across the Lines</a></i>, was debuted at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and has since been used in many different educational contexts, including with government officials.</p>

<p>Dawn Laguens, Executive Vice President and Chief Brand Officer of Planned Parenthood, says the goal of the VR film is to increase empathy for staff and patients regarding the struggle they face each day walking into the clinics. The film is set in three parts and uses a combination of real footage, CGI, and audio collected from protests. The first part takes place in a real examination room and depicts a conversation between a visibly shaken patient and her doctor. The second depicts a flashback to the patient driving up to the Planned Parenthood clinic and being approached by protestors. The third section transitions to CGI and places the viewer in the shoes of the patient, where they encounter attacks from protestors.</p>

<p><i>Across the Lines</i> is meant to educate and build empathy at a precarious time for women’s health in America. Regardless of political affiliation, it hopes to build a more supportive environment around Planned Parenthood clinics, one in which women don’t have to feel traumatized just for walking through the door. What would this experience be like if it were a typical video clip rather than a VR video? Do you think VR helps build empathy better than other forms of media?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:38 Ryan Allen:</b> I didn't even realize Planned Parenthood had these kinds of apps. Information seems like a key aspect of their mission, so outreach through smartphones is obviously important for the younger generations. </p>

<p><b>@00:53 Melanie Hering:</b> I think it's important to make the experience as realistic as possible - like Dawn Laguens says, it's far more meaningful when you step into the shoes of someone being yelled at by protesters versus watching from a third-person perspective. It's more likely to make you think twice about what these women have to deal with.</p>
