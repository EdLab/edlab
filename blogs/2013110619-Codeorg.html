<b>Anyone Can Learn How to Code</b><br>
According to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/hadi-partovi">Hadi Partovi</a>, one of the founders of <a href="http://www.code.org/">Code.org</a>, by the year 2020, there will be around 1.4 million jobs in computer programming, with only around 400 thousand studying computer science in college.  However, the problem that might explain this disparity lies with the fact that most young people are not aware of exactly what computer science is; in fact, "9 out of 10 [high] schools don’t even offer programming classes." This is why Hadi founded Code.org with his brother, <a href="http://crunchbase.com/person/ali-partovi">Ali</a>, to make computer science and programming available for everyone who wants to learn.  Code.org provides a variety of options for students to learn how to code both as a part of their formal education at school and casually at home by helping to <a href="http://www.code.org/teach">bring programming classes to schools</a> and offering online courses and tutorials.  Overall, Code.org is introducing exciting new initiatives to spark interest and provide the tools necessary for kids to learn to code (watch this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8324">Code.org promotional video</a> that has already been viewed in countless schools and by over 10 million people from around the world).
<p>
<b>A Variety of Learning Options and Tools</b><br>
Similar to how the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> strives to spread resources to support computer science curricula and programs in the UK, Code.org works to encourage and provide these tools in the US.  Among these learning resources are online programs like <a   href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, and <a href="http://codehs.com/">CodeHS</a> (see the <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/806">NL Sector piece on CodeHS</a>). Some of these resources and platforms make coding easier to understand for younger kids, while others are designed specifically for high school students.  In addition to these programs, there are online university-level courses taught by real professors available on sites such as <a href=https://www.coursera.org/category/cs-programming>Coursera</a>, as well as a number of mobile and iPad apps for kids to use to practice and gain computer science skills.  
<p>
<b>Inspiring Millions</b><br>
Code.org hopes to spread the word that there is a worldwide shortage of computer programmers, and that these skills should become just as essential as learning to read.  By inspiring students to start engaging with code from an early age, Code.org hopes that every student will have the opportunity to learn computer programming.  With the number of resources available in their database of programming schools, online courses, and apps, it seems that they are on the road to reaching out to millions of people around the world.  The group’s next goal is for schools to incorporate computer science into the regular curriculum.
