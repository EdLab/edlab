While vacationing in Atlantic City during the holidays, I saw a very interesting commercial about a website called <b><a href="http://www.k12.com/">K12.com</a></b>. This website provides an online alternative to traditional brick and mortar K-12 schools as students learn online and received individualized help from the website's teachers. This is a very interesting idea and before seeing this commercial, I would have never thought of K-12 education taking place completely online. When I think of online education, my mind immediately goes to post-secondary online education like the <b><a href="http://www.phoenix.edu/">University of Phoenix</a></b>. From what I see on K12.com, it seems that if students are enrolled into the online program, parents are expected to be involved 3-5 hours per day. This is a very important factor parents need to consider before enrolling their children since some parents might not have the time to do so.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> This is a very interesting concept to me, and a good alternative for some students, after all every student learns at a different pace. The individual tutoring would be more beneficial than the one size fits all teaching in the traditional brick and mortar schools. Although I do have my reservations about online learning when it comes to STEM subjects, since complete online learning would not be able to completely replace science laboratories. I believe that students should learn the theory of a STEM subject, but more importantly, apply their knowledge in a lab, any type of STEM lab, and yes there is such a thing as a math lab! In this week's Science Edition, I talked about virtual dissecting, if K12.com can incorporate this type of application in their program then I might not be as reserved about using the online learning program. Online learning has become a hot topic as of late, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves. Let's keep learning everyone.
