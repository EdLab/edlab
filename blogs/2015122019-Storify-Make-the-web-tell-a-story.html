<p><a href="https://storify.com/">Storify</a> lets you curate social networks to build social stories, bringing together media scattered across the Web into a coherent narrative. Through the Storify platform, users can search multiple streams and embed relevant media into their articles. Users can share their stories, notify people quoted or sourced in their stories, and search stories on the Storify platform. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Storify is an exciting opportunity for bringing blended journalism into the classroom. It offers immense potential as a tool for teaching media literacy skills, as students collect and curate sources from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Giphy, Youtube, Flickr, and others. The drafting tool allows for seamless editing, as users drag and shuffle text or embedded media in order to create a compelling narrative. Classes can also browse stories from a variety of authors, including major news streams like CNN and organizations such as Human Rights Watch as well as individual authors, allowing users to evaluate effective and less effective authorial choices. Students can also search stories by topic, such as "Women’s World Cup," and discover themes from gender equality to sports enthusiasm, which presents an opportunity to analyze the author’s perspective through the different curatorial and narrative choices. Storify could also be used to spice up blander assignments like book reports or subject-specific presentations. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The pitfalls of Storify for educational use are perhaps less specific to Storify and more of the inevitable caveats to online media. You do need to create an account to use Storify and you need to link Twitter and Facebook accounts to use those streams. Depending on a student’s search terms, the volume of results can be paltry or overwhelming. Further, information that isn’t already online (a locally stored photograph for example) cannot be embedded. And, while there is plenty of material from established outlets such as the Huffington Post, there is also a lot of poor quality journalism. But all of these flaws can be turned into learning opportunities with some advanced planning. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Storify is another media curation tool that can be either a success or a flop depending on execution. For a classroom, the opportunities for lessons on media literacy, author’s craft, and online community engagement are worthwhile. However, the need for accounts and log-ins to use the best features alongside the challenges of cleanly filtering the social media world can pose limitations for educators. </p>
