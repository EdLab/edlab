<p>Millennials are often referred to as digital natives and considered the early adopters and gatekeepers of new technology. Anecdotes about kids setting up clueless parents' social media accounts and teaching them basic netiquette rules are the subject of many memes, but how often is that dynamic true? A recent survey sought to clarify just how many young people act as intermediaries between the internet and their parents. </p>
 
<p>The study used a self-administered mail survey with items on education, socioeconomic status, and gender. It asked about the frequency of certain internet activities such as sending email, online shopping, bill paying, blog reading, and using social networking sites. Three-fourths of the respondents said that their digital media literacy came mostly from their own efforts before they asked for assistance from their children. The remaining respondents attributed the majority of their understanding of these systems to their children. Parents from lower socioeconomic groups and female parents more commonly depended on their children for internet literacy.</p>
 
<p>These results suggest that while the majority of parents give the internet the old college try on their own, a significant percentage of kids can be appropriately considered the brokers of technology in their families. While this doesn't bode well for the self-efficacy of those parents, it boosts the tech confidence of their children, which could have implications in other areas of life, particularly in science and technology subjects in school. Even though this is a fairly basic survey, it opens up questions about how the personal use of technology affects other areas of learning, especially across different socioeconomic levels.</p>
