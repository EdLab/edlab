<b>Title:</b> Action Video Games Make Dyslexic Children Read Better
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Sandro Frenceschini, Simone Gori, Milena Ruffino, Simona Viola, Massimo Molteni, & Andrea Facoetti
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213000791">Current Biology</a>
<p>
<b>Research Question:</b> Can video gaming improve the reading abilities of dyslexic students?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
As many parents and teachers have experienced first-hand, teaching dyslexic students to read can be a difficult and intensive process. Although we’re still a long way away from a full understanding of what causes dyslexia, there is evidence to suggest that one issue is attentional dysfunction, i.e., a difficulty in rapidly orienting visual and mental attention towards the correct letters.
<p>
The proven ability of video game training to improve attention and focus inspired the authors of this article to investigate whether video games might be useful in teaching dyslexic students to read. To test these effects, the authors of this study took a group of 20 dyslexic students, tested their reading and attentional skills, and split them in half and set them playing different minigames (one group given action games, one group given non-action thinking games) in the Wii video game Rayman Raving Rabbits.  After they’d played the game for 12 hours, their skills were tested again.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Testing the accuracy and speed of the subjects’ reading abilities, the authors found that students in the action video game group saw improved reading abilities, and improved attentional abilities. The nonaction video game group, on the other hand, did not see statistically significant gains in their reading or attentional abilities.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The findings of this small study should be taken take as provisional until there is further research. However, the results are suggestive enough that researchers and educators may want to start thinking about how to harness active gaming as a learning tool. If a few hours of a casual mass-market game can improve reading and attention, what might we be able to accomplish with tools specifically developed to harness these learning aids?
