<p>When the first T. Rex was uncovered in 1908, only part of the skeleton was discovered. Based on the structures of related animals, like chickens, paleontologists engaged in educated guesswork to construct the rest of the model. However, while the first T. Rex construction turned out to be surprisingly accurate, early paleontologists’ reconstructions of other dinosaurs, like the brontosaurus, were completely botched, leading to decades of misunderstandings. Today, though, skeletons on display are nearly 100% accurate, thanks to a greater dinosaur sample size and reliable digital technology.</p> 

<p>Dinosaur research has exploded in the last few years; paleontologists are <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/science/why-today-is-the-golden-age-for-dinosaur-discoveries.aspx">uncovering almost one new species a week</a>. This is largely due to more countries opening their borders to paleontologists, but new technology is responsible for most of the learning that happens once bones are brought back from the dig site. From CAT scans to digital models to 3D printing technology, digital tools are leading to more comprehensive and interdisciplinary study of dinosaur bodies and their environments.</p>

<p>How has digital technology opened doors for paleontological learning for everyday citizens? How about more generally in museums? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50749">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@03:43 Anna Curry: </b>Technology opens up new possibilities for sharing and displaying information so that it’s easier to tell the story they want to tell. Humans learn through stories and technology is an incredible tool to help us use this old medium.</p>

<p><b>@04:45 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>It's so important to remember and to teach kids that the theories taught in empirical science are largely fill-in-the-blank stories. The Big Bang, for example, is not a theory we have pieced 100% together like the T-Rex. There are still many pieces missing and made-up with scientists' best guesses. That's not a bad thing, but it's important to remember that just because it's science doesn't mean that it's been proven.</p>
