          <p>
             <a href ="http://www.spreeder.com/">Spreeder</a> is a website with an application that helps you read quicker. There is no sign up, which is a relief for someone like me who has signed up for too many of these kinds of websites. The homepage states that the website is free to use, but it also provides a link to a software which also helps you read quicker, but that comes with a cost. Also on the homepage is an introduction and a description on how to use the application on the website.

<b>Pros:</b> This website is so easy and simple to use, and there aren't any advertisements around (only the link to the software previously mentioned). You can start your way to reading quicker with the sample text provided or you can paste in your own text (like an online article for example). I like this feature of the website because it does not restrict you to practice using their text, you can learn to read what you want quicker. You can also customize how fast the words appear, and how many words appear on the screen at a time. If you feel like your a fast reader, you can adjust the application to a higher speed and more words.

<b>Cons:</b> This website may feel too simple for some people, who are used to having extra features with a learning applications like the the “bragging rights” feature for example. They also have a Bookmarklet feature that is suppose to make it easier to copy/paste articles to speed read. I tried using this feature but it doesn't seem to be working for me, and it doesn't seem that necessary to have.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> I thought this website might be useful for some EdLabbers who might be interested in reading quicker; it doesn't hurt to have this extra skill. This site gets you started right away right from the home page with the instructions and suggestions. I think we can learn from this “less is more” styled website for own future projects.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> I think it is a website better suited as a mobile app. Most people read on the go, like on buses for example. I believe many people would be interested in learning how to read quicker on the go. With this website's simple but customizable features it would make a great app.
