            <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.21553/abstract">Copeland, Andrea J. (2011), Analysis of Public Library Users' Digital Preservation Practices. <i>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</i>, 62(7), 1288—1300.</a>

This article examines methods of digital self-preservation and creates a distinction between personal information spaces and personal information collections. The personal information space represents all digital material controlled by the patron while collections refer to “islands” in that space in which materials are curated, organized, or preserved in some way. A small study organized by the authors attempted to identify digital information and preservation techniques of public library users.

<b>Review:</b>
The study of public library users found that most saved information, primarily photos, email, and word documents, to a computer hard drive. Some users mentioned that they shared documents and photos via social networks or email, but did not identify this as a preservation technique.  Many users found that as their information space grew, their personal classification schemes failed and items became difficult to locate with browsing and file search techniques. Some users also identified disaster preparedness techniques, like saving documents to an external hard drive. 

In interviews, users also suggested that they folded materials created by others seamlessly into their personal information spaces. In the most commonly used preservation environments, metadata for these borrowed items is difficult to change. In short, the archivists of tomorrow will be digging immense and badly-identified caverns of old word documents and piles of unlabled photos of uncertain provenance. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
I was drawn to this article after visiting the archives and poking around Pocket Knowledge thinking about the future or our digitization efforts. I think that marketing Pocket Knowledge as a place for creating self-curated collections and educating about self-produced metadata as a best practice for organization is nearly as important to the future of our archives as digitizing our past. So many users in the study feared losing data to personal errors, device failures, and tech obsolescence that a maintained, private, and well-organized archival database seems like a natural fit.
