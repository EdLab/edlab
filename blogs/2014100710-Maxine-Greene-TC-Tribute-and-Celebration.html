Yesterday I attended the TC celebration of Maxine Greene and her life and work at Teachers College and beyond. The force of her intellect and her compassion for others was palpable--I kept thinking she was in the room. Her writing focuses on a wide range of questions, from education, to the imagination, to society, to politics. I use the word question intentionally here--she is famously quoted for saying, "there are no answers, only questions." Similar to other work I have been doing at the EdLab--notably my Vialogues write-up on Un-Googleable Questions--I am interested, like Maxine, in how we can ask better questions. As I see it, Maxine Greene's philosophy is particularly relevant given that in the edtech/ education innovation space there are many questions. It is the wild west, and educators, innovators, and entrepreneurs are pioneers into un-charted areas. As Maxine suggests, we will never find a single answer. Questions about technology in the classroom, robots and makerspace will always lead to more questions--this is the nature of education! and in Maxine's view, this is also what it means to live, learn, teach, and know. 

In my opinion, in the process of design, whether a curriculum or space, it is helpful to have a philosophy, core beliefs and values, guiding one's vision. I believe Maxine offers many beliefs and visions we can hang our hat on as we imagine possibilities in new frontiers at the intersection of education and technology. 

Maxine was an advocate of the arts in all forms and its educational power and potential. One of my favorite quotes of hers from the tribute is: "Art can't change the world, but it can change those who can."
