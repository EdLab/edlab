<p><a href="https://www.clusterflunk.com/">Clusterflunk</a> is a course collaboration platform aimed at students that encourages peer learning and facilitates communication. The system was the need-based creation of two college students who wanted to bring the interaction of a social network to online and in-person courses. Clusterflunk is powerful because it creates a rapidly-updating, permanent record of student engagement in a particular course that rolls over from semester to semester. With time and use this product could lead to a growing library of content that could contribute to the further development of a traditional college course.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>It actually seems like students are using Clusterflunk for its intended purpose. The tool is in heavy use at two institutions (University of Iowa and Northern Iowa) and students, particularly in science and math courses, are using it to form study groups, share notes, ask questions about content and systems, remind each other of past lessons, and give general tips like the times and locations of office hours. Students seem engaged, jumping in to help each other with homework questions as quickly as they would reply to an update on Facebook. The site itself is uncomplicated, though minimally organized, and seems best used over the course of a semester with many active participants. If growing content is the goal, the site should invest in some sort of tagging or long-term organizational strategy.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site is new and testing in 4 pilot schools. The founders, who recently <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2013/05/clusterflunk-founders-take-leap-of-faith-leave-school-to-build-company">dropped out</a> of the University of Iowa to work on the site full time, are very engaged with the community and well-represented on the site. They keep their former classmates and peers updated on their progress with school-wide posts and seem to be in tune with the needs of their community. The site is very boutique at this point, with users required to submit a mini-essay to get their school considered for inclusion; lowering the barrier to entry could encourage more schools to sign up for the site.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Clusterflunk makes students active participants in their community of learning and, while it is not the first tool to do this, it presents this action in the familiar form of curating content and sharing on a newsfeed. As Clusterflunk acquires more users, activity on the site may change the behavior of instructors by preventing the replication of content from semester to semester. Class collaboration and discussion is happening on every CMS, but rolling this content over through time could help students and faculty members develop better learning opportunities.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Clusterflunk is an active network with historical value.</p>
