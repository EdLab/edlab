          <p>
            I was amazed by the fact that my friend's three-year-old son was able to use iPad in ways beyond my belief. The little boy visited my home last week with his parents, spending most of his time (including in the restaurants) on the new iPad they brought. I was so surprised to see the boy skillfully browsing, launching, and switching between a dozen of games he regularly played including the popular <a href="http://www.angrybirds.com/">Angry Birds</a>. I have to confess I almost lost my interest in playing Angry Birds because the stages towards the end were just too difficult for me. But the boy didn't seem to be bothered much about the difficulty level, and he's already half way through all the levels. In the rare occurrences of some unconquerable stages, he would defer the game to his dad to complete and pick up the next stage. 

The parents said they never lend the iPad to the child at home but they found the iPad as a great companion for the boy which can keep him quiet while traveling, at restaurants and when visiting friends. Even then, the boy had picked up all the necessary skills to operate the iPad, including using the App Store to purchase and download new games. Most amazingly, the boy somehow understood he had to download free games only. He doesn't read English but he knew those games that has numbers next to the title would cost money. This stunt was discovered one day when the mom found there were three new games on the iPad which neither she nor the dad had downloaded. So she asked the boy where those games came from and the boy said he downloaded them. The boy might have watched the parents downloading apps over the shoulder, but was never taught to do so. Gees, my dad didn't know how to download apps until I taught him a dozen of times!

"Jobs was a genius", concluded the boy's dad, "Even a three-year-old can figure out how to use iPad by himself. Who would not buy one?"
