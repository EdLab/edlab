This book helps students learn to analyze and interpret research data using SPSS by demonstrating how to compute a variety of statistics covered in intermediate statistics courses. This edition features SPSS 15.0, but it can also be used with SPSS 16 &amp; 17 or earlier versions.

Each chapter introduces several related statistics in a user-friendly manner and provides instructions on how to run them and interpret the outputs. The book reviews research designs and how to assess the assumptions, accuracy, and reliability of data. The authors demonstrate how to: choose an appropriate statistic based on the research design and level of measurement; use SPSS to help answer research questions; and interpret and write about SPSS outputs. The examples use real data contained on the book's CD.

<strong>Nancy L. Leech, Associate Professor, Research, Statistics and Evaluation Methods, University of Colorado Denver</strong>. My interest in research started as an undergraduate psychology major at the University of Colorado Boulder. I worked as a research assistant for a number of professors, assisting them in various aspects of their research studies. After graduation, I worked full time as a counselor for battered women. After completing a master's degree in counseling, I entered into my doctoral studies with the intention of being a therapist. As I worked through my coursework, I realized I excelled in and enjoyed statistics and research. I also learned that my counseling background served me well in teaching research and statistics. During my doctoral studies, I worked as a research assistant and grant/program evaluator. From these experiences, I had three epiphanies: (a) retaining research and analysis techniques is difficult for many researchers, (b) for many students and faculty, research and analysis can be extremely frustrating, and (c) the ability to investigate and analyze research questions is imperative in order to increase scientific knowledge, thus, helping to make informed choices. These realizations have impacted my teaching as well as my research agenda.

Michelle combines current academic research and resiliency research in support of hundreds of Title I schools achieving equity and excellence. She is an author of several books and multiple educational reform articles and works to help students and teachers build positive relationships and meet their academic and personal success goals. She is an avid advocate of parents as partners in school reform and is diligent in making that process possible for her districts.
