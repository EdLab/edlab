<p>Even in its most basic form, embodiment as a way of learning has huge advantages in the classroom. Never heard of embodiment? Think back to an elementary school teacher who might have prompted you to rub your hands together as fast as you can to represent and experience friction and heat production. Chances are your nine-year-old self was more capable of understanding both concepts after feeling it firsthand rather than being given a wordy definition to write down. This is just one example of embodiment as a learning tool. Now, with technological advances like the Xbox Kinect, the ways in which we can become or experience the concepts we aim to learn are seemingly endless.</p>
 
<p>This rests at the core of research on using Kinect, a motion-sensor and webcam-based extension of the Xbox that allows users to <i>be</i> the controllers as they dance or play sports, to explore physics education. Students used the Kinect to learn about kinematics and mechanics in two ways: the first was to test if the Kinect could detect inanimate objects (not at all) and the second was to use the Kinect to detect their movements and collect data for making graphs of their velocity and acceleration.</p>
 
<p>The first time the researchers conducted this trial, they realized that the students required a lot more scaffolding in reading the data in the graphs. The data was not clean nor conclusive, so they added more scaffolded instruction using a physical model (a ramp and ball) to produce data for the students to practice graphing before starting the next trial. The students reported that they could see their movement on the screen and relate this motion to specific data points on their graphs.</p>
 
<p>Although the visualizations and embodiment experiences created by Kinect in this study were successful in engaging the students and helping them understand the relationships between displacement, velocity, and acceleration, essential concepts in a physics class, the researchers also note that the Kinect cannot achieve as much as a standalone tool. The scaffolded instruction using the physical model were essential in providing students the necessary foundational knowledge to best understand what those Kinect visualizations really <i>meant</i>.</p>
