          <p>
            For most non-profit schools, finding a good college for students does not begin until the 11th grade. According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/nyregion/college-hunt-starts-earlier-at-new-nyc-private-schools.html?ref=education">New York Times article</a>, however, Avenues and Leman Manhattan (two for-profit schools) are starting the college hunt during freshman year. This practice raises several questions: Should high students start looking at colleges earlier then the 11th grade? Should the entire four years of high school be devoted to getting students into college? Should student start worrying about the admission process, and the chances of getting into the college of their choice, much earlier?

One argument for starting the process in the 9th grade is that it allows students to start thinking about how to fill college applications with things like extracurricular activities. It can also allow students to think about what they would like to major in, and what career path they would like to follow. If students have a better idea of their career path, it may lower the number who are in college for more than the usual four years due to switching majors. This can help keep the student loan debt as low as possible. On the flip side of the coin, some people believe that starting the process earlier would put more pressure on students to perform well and it may overwhelm students.

So after reading about both sides of the issue, when do you think the right time is to start the college application process? Will starting earlier necessarily increase the number of students going into college right after high school? Should students focus more on the process or their studies? These are just some of the questions we should be answering as we follow this new trending educational practice.
