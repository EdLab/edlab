<p><i>"Learning Equality is committed to enabling every person in the world to realize their right to a quality education"</i> (<a href="https://learningequality.org/about/">About Learning Equality</a>)</p>
 
<p><b>Reaching the Less Reachable</b></p>

<p>Over half the world’s population doesn’t have regular internet access, which is a huge impediment to creating digital learning opportunities that can benefit everyone. To address this problem, Learning Equality is launching open-source, offline platforms that extend the reach of online educational materials to low-resource communities like rural schools, refugee camps, orphanages, non-formal school systems, and prison systems.</p> 

<p>Learning Equality’s two main platforms, KA Lite and Kolibri, aim to provide materials to these hard-to-reach populations while serving both curricular and contextual needs. This means providing global content as well as locally relevant materials, which instructors can use to customize educational curricula to fit their courses, all while pulling from an international database wherever they are.</p>

<p><b>A Tale of Two Platforms</b></p>

<p>Learning Equality co-founder Jamie Alexandre developed the idea for the company while interning at Khan Academy, when he realized how many more people Khan Academy could reach if its resources were available offline. This idea turned into Learning Equality’s first platform, KA Lite. An open-source platform for viewing and interacting with Khan Academy videos and exercises, KA Lite can be used when no internet is available. It has been installed in over 194 countries and has reached approximately 4.5 million learners.</p>

<p>Kolibri, Learning Equality’s newest project, is another open-source platform requiring no internet, but one that aims to provide seamless authoring and peer-to-peer-sharing of educational materials. Making a vast library of resources available to low-cost devices, Kolibri allows for more customization of courses. It also includes tools for personalized recommendations, feedback, and self-paced and collaborative learning.</p>

<p>Learning Equality’s goal is to make a quality education accessible to everyone, no matter where they live. Through attempting to design for everyone, and building communities around their products, they look to be well on their way to be achieving just that.</p>
