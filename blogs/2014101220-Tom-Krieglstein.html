<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I graduated high school with a ‘C’ grade point average and got rejected from most of the colleges I applied to. My best option was a community college that was closer to my family home, thereby making my commute to college shorter than my journey to high school. My high school best friends all went out of state for college leaving me alone. Needless to say, I didn’t enter my college experience on the highest of spirits.
<p>
In my first year, I took a job connected to Student Activities and my boss was the advisor for a few student groups on campus. He encouraged me to join one of his groups and that’s when it all changed. For the first time since I was little, my excitement for school, learning and growing was rekindled. Something about leading a group on campus, for the student body, gave me a sense of purpose in school and learning. I instantly went from a passive student to an active leader.
<p>
My past experience is exactly why I dedicate my time supporting schools to create a powerful co-curricular culture in which students, just like me, find purpose and meaning in the daily actions of schools. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> After I graduated, I worked for a program called <a href="https://www.supercamp.com/landingpages/lp-academiccamps.aspx?src=GOO10&cmps=ASearchUS&spec=Brand&kw=super%20camp&gclid=CPTu8MWV3L8CFUYA7AodbRkAWw">SuperCamp</a>. SuperCamp is an academic and life skills program for students. For three years I was one of their lead facilitators running hundreds of students through a 10-day intensive program. Through SuperCamp, three major outcomes occurred:<br>

<b>1)</b> I learned there is another way to teach and it’s not the way 95% of us are taught in the classroom.
<b>2)</b> I became a master of public speaking and facilitating groups. Many of the skills I learned, I still use today.
<b>3)</b> I learned so much about group dynamics that I created my branded leadership training program, Dance Floor Theory.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> My ultimate goal is to shine more light on the value co-curricular activities have on the development of a student. There is great research that shows how powerful "out-of-classroom" activities are on student development, but yet it’s often the least funded part of the school experience. I want to change this.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Funding and demand. As schools press hard on budgets, they are forced to focus more and more on maximizing outcomes. While in theory it sounds nice, we don’t need a world filled with more bankers and lawyers. We need poets, writers and social workers as well. We need the Liberal Arts. I worry that tight budgets and lack of demand will squeeze the Liberal Arts out.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Swift Kick has been, and continues to be, my main project. Through Swift Kick we help schools create a powerful culture of student engagement.
