<b>The Details and Back-story</b>
Last spring <a href="https://www.schoology.com/home.php">Schoology</a>, who already had a successful, free social networking tool for teachers, added a fee-based "enterprise level" ecosystem for school-districts.  This new premium model includes features ranging from expanded performance analytics to curriculum and professional development.  Another major selling point for schools is that all communications are unified across one tightly integrated and easy to-use platform.  From grading to professional development, teachers have a one-stop-shop for class management resources and a safe, school-sanctioned social network.  

Schoology recently beat-out <a href="http://www.edmodo.com/">Edmodo</a>, a leading free social networking and microblogging platform (learn more in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6099">this EdLab review</a>), to win the favor of the Palo Alto Unified School District.  As the Director of Technology for Palo Alto Unified points-out in <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/19/how-new-yorks-schoology-beats-silicon-valley-startups-to-win-palo-alto-school-district/">this VentureBeat article</a>, "we needed a manageable platform that could be expanded to all grade levels and provided education specific components such as an assignment dropbox.‚Äù  

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>
Moving beyond their sole focus on free services, Schoology has managed to successfully offer a "freemium" services at the enterprise level while maintaining their existent assortment of no-cost offerings.  This transition can be a rocky road (think New York Times), and with the recent adoption by the Palo Alto school-district, it seems Schoology has successfully navigated this tricky double-path of both free and paid services.  

<b>EdLab Takeaway</b>
As we consider adding paid features to existent and future apps here at the EdLab such as Vialogues, mSchool and ResearchBroker, what will users willingly pay for?  What differentiates us from other free offerings on?  I think, as in the case of Schoology, the key seems to be many well-defined and curated features offered as a part of a turn-key, unified, easy-to-use platform seems like the answer to entice users beyond the realm of the "free."
