          <p>
            A report which aired on NBC News last weekend stated that over 250,000 K-12 students in over 30 states around the country are now enrolled in full-time virtual schools. This is a 40% increase in enrollment since 2008.

This is a massive experiment, and for distance learning to be successful, it is important to treat it as such. That is, well thought out metrics are essential in measuring how this new environment alters student outcomes. A massive investment in a ill-measured experiment could produce undesirable results that make getting support for future changes in the structure of education a lot more difficult. In addition, as Professor Natriello outlined in <i>Modest Changes, Revolutionary Possibilities: Distance Learning and the Future of Education</i>, "The rapid growth of distance learning does not offer educational researchers much time to become fully versed in key questions so they can set about planning and executing new families of studies. Once the basic patterns for the development and delivery of distance learning become established, it will be more difficult for research results to have an impact."

I am particularly interested in measuring the effects outside of standard academic markers. It is crucial, though more difficult, to implement metrics for social skills to truly understand the effect of virtual schools. Schools are about much more than numbers and letters and this must be taken into account when assessing the impact of distance learning and determining how it should evolve. Are video conferences and other online communication enough or should we augment virtual schools with some periods of in-person contact? I'd love to hear people's thoughts on appropriate metrics and methods to asses the growth of a student outside of academic achievement in a distance learning environment.
