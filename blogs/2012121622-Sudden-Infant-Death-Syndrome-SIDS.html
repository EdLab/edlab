          <p>
            <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/sleep/sids.html">Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</a> claims the lives of over 200,000 infants each year in the United States alone. It is defined as the unexpected death of a child under the age of one that can neither be explained through a review of family medical history or an autopsy. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, SIDS is one of the leading causes of post neonatal deaths and is also the third leading cause of overall infant mortality. Despite the decline of SIDS deaths in recent years, there are still disparities between racial groups. In fact, African American Infants are two or three times more likely to die as a result of SIDS than their Hispanic and Caucasian counterparts. As a high-risk population, there may be multiple risk factors that contribute to why SIDS is more prevalence in the African American community.

The reasons for the disparities in SIDS have been associated with such factors as low birth weight, smoking, use of alcohol, socioeconomic status, sleep patterns and social support, even though there are no evidence of an actual cause. Many studies, both in the United States and around the world, show that black infants have a higher risk for SIDS regardless of their socioeconomic status. Studies show the decline of SIDS mortality in California from 1990 to 1995. They found that in spite of the overall decline, the rate among African American is still high. SIDS among black infants has declined by 20% compared to 41% among white infants. 

There have been several other studies that has focused on a lack of information about SIDS during maternity, especially among African American women. Once such study looked at Mississippi where it there was a significant increase in SIDS between 1995 and 2005. Based on the data collected, they concluded the difference is due to the lack of knowledge about SIDS specifically, among black women in rural Mississippi. Some of the women reported never receiving information on SIDS during and after pregnancy and those who did, did not fully understand what it meant.  This enforces the argument that black women are already exposed to risk factors that increases the probability for SIDS and other infant related deaths.
