<p>We’ve long asked whether we, as humans, can trust robots. But we’ve neglected to ask the counterpart question: can robots trust us? The human-robot interaction lab at Tufts University is exploring this question. Matthias Sheutz, the program’s director, believes experimentation is important as robots become more integrated into our daily lives, including as household, classroom, or service-oriented companions.</p>

<p>"The overarching goal in our lab is to make robots natural and safe for humans," says Sheutz. "We want them to blend into human societies and act in a way that is consistent with our moral and normative expectations." Part of blending into human societies involves forming relationships and loyalties with particular people. This is impossible without trust. And if robots don’t learn to trust, the ideas of ownership and allegiance between human and bot couldn’t exist.</p>

<p>This brings us to some serious philosophical questions: Why is it important for robots to integrate seamlessly into human societies? Should humans trust robots as much as robots trust humans? In what circumstances is it important for a robot to trust a human? Help us ponder these questions <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/35583/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:33 csd2126:</b> I liked the example that was provided of a grocery shopping robot being stolen by someone else or not knowing who is it's owner. AI voice recognition can be used to restrict commands to one voice. I can see this as being useful in maintaining privacy as well given that these robots may be used for all sorts of things in the future.</p>

<p><b>@01:33 Joseph.Banks:</b> I disagree with the above comment. What the creator is talking about goes far being voice control when he explains a scenario where we'd want a robot to save a child that is in danger. In this case, the robot isn't simply following commands but sensing what is happening and following a program to intervene. I do think privacy is a concern though especially if robots are continuously taking in information from their surroundings.</p>
