          <p>
            A few days ago, I was browsing the NY Times when I came across this <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/regulators-say-social-network-violated-child-privacy-law/?ref=technology">article</a> on how the aptly titled children social networking site, Skid-e-Kids, were allowing children under the age of 13 to register without parental consent, which is the requirement prescribed by the administrators of Skid-e-Kids, the self described “Facebook for children ages 7 to 14.” Particularly interesting in the article was how researchers have noted that though sites like Facebook requires children over 13 to register, there is still a large number of children under 13 on the site. To further complicate the matter, researchers also noted that some parents even help their children (those under 13) lie about their age in order to register for Facebook and other such sites.

As often the case with the “it” and popular, often times people, regardless of age, will find a way to become part of that “it” item or movement. My two younger brothers (ages nine and 13) often ask about Facebook and why I spend so much time on it (so they think) and I try to explain to them that for me, it is a great way to stay in touch with my friends and family. Though they haven't expressed an interest in joining Facebook, I am curious to see how they will use it. If parents are encouraging their children to sign up for Facebook and other sites even if they are under the age of 13, then they must surely have a good reason. I know there has been a lot of talk about the huge potential of social networking sites in education (sites such as Hoot.me immediately springs to mind) and I wonder if that is the reason why parents are urging their children to signup. 

As a place where educational software is developed, though not specifically for children under 13, I am interested in knowing how EdLabbers think about the under 13 signup requirement and how instances such as those already aforementioned can be avoided.
