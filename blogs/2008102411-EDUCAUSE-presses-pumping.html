          <p>
            It looks like the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/">EDUCAUSE</a> presses are pumping hard in anticipation of the <a href="http://net.educause.edu/e08">annual conference</a>.  There have been a couple of interesting research reports and compiled volumes they've put together in anticipation of the conference.   

<a href="http://www.educause.edu/thetowerandthecloud/133998">The Tower and the Cloud</a>
About: The emergence of the networked information economy is unleashing two powerful forces. On one hand, easy access to high-speed networks is empowering individuals. People can now discover and consume information resources and services globally from their homes. Further, new social computing approaches are inviting people to share in the creation and edification of information on the Internet. Empowerment of the individual -- or consumerization -- is reducing the individual's reliance on traditional brick-and-mortar institutions in favor of new and emerging virtual ones. Second, ubiquitous access to high-speed networks along with network standards, open standards and content, and techniques for virtualizing hardware, software, and services is making it possible to leverage scale economies in unprecedented ways. What appears to be emerging is industrial-scale computing -- a standardized infrastructure for delivering computing power, network bandwidth, data storage and protection, and services. Comsumerization and industrialization beg the question "Is this the end of the middle?"; that is, what will be the role of "enterprise" IT in the future? Indeed, the bigger question is what will become of all of our intermediating institutions? This volume examines the impact of IT on higher education and on the IT organization in higher education.  
Note: The <a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/PUB7202f.pdf">Benkler piece</a> is worth a read.

<a href="http://www.educause.edu/thetowerandthecloud/133998">The ECAR Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology, 2008</a>
This 2008 ECAR research study is a longitudinal extension of the 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 ECAR studies of students and information technology. The study is based on quantitative data from a spring 2008 survey of 27,317 freshmen and seniors at 90 four-year institutions and eight two-year institutions; student focus groups that included input from 75 students at four institutions; and analysis of qualitative data from 5,877 written responses to open-ended questions. In addition to studying student ownership, experience, behaviors, preferences, and skills with respect to information technologies, the 2008 study also includes a special focus on student participation in social networking sites.
