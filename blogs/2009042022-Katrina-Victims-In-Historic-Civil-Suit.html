          <p>
            In what many legal pundits are predicting could spark a rush of similar lawsuits and spell headache for the US government, federal district court judge Stanwood J. Duval recently ruled that residents whose homes were ruined by Hurricane Katrina could go ahead with <a href="http://www.louisianaweekly.com/news.php?viewStory=1108">their lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers.</a> The Justice Department had been fighting on behalf of the Army Engineers to have the case dismissed in legal wrangling that has delayed the case for three years. 

At the heart of the matter is whether the Corps was responsible for the failure of the levees during Katrina. At issue is the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO), a navigation canal that overpowered the levees meant to serve as a safeguard to the people and homes in St. Bernard Parish, New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward. Plaintiffs claim MR-GO intensified the surge of the storm and wave attacks. MR-GO was built in the 1960s and almost immediately, many experts and environmentalists warned the Corps that MR-GO will cause massive chaos should a hurricane strike New Orleans. 

The case,<I> Robinson v. United States</I>, is been billed as the largest ever litigation involving the US government. One of the government's main arguments was based on <I>sovereign immunity</I>, which basically states that the government is protected from certain kinds of lawsuits. The government's sovereign immunity argument was rejected four times, setting the stage for the trial to finally commence. The government will have to deal with 400,000 other claims if the plaintiffs win the case and it could cost them as much as $100 billion in the final tally. 

The trial started today and is expected to last three weeks with testimony from high ranking Corps' officials as well as renowned flood experts. The case will be heard by Judge Duval with no jury present.
