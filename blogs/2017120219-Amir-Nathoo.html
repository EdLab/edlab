<p>Amir Nathoo is co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://outschool.com">Outschool</a>. He previously worked at Square leading the Square Payroll product and founded Trigger.io before that. He is a board member of the Gifted Homeschoolers Forum.
 
<p><b>How has your education and previous professional experience shaped your current work as CEO and Co-founder of Outschool?</b><br>
I've worked in software for my whole career, and I've thought about education a lot since both my parents were teachers. For me, Outschool came out of combining those two interests. I am lucky enough to have the opportunity and experience to start a company and believe the timing is right for technology to transform how education is delivered.</p>

<p>I received a great education in the UK from a selective school and then went to Cambridge University where I studied for a Masters in Engineering. I started my career at IBM but always knew I wanted to build my own businesses, so I left in 2007 to found my first company. We ended up building Trigger.io, a mobile development platform, and the team was acquired by Square in 2013.</p>

<p>My experiences with independent learning have heavily influenced Outschool and transformed my life. I taught myself to code from age five because at the time you needed a lot of technical knowledge just to start a computer game from a command prompt. I aspired to write my own computer games, but no schools at the time had coding or computer science courses. Seeing my interest, my parents found a retired economics professor who had started teaching computer studies on the side.</p>

<p>Independent learning outside of regular school isn't just about acquiring niche or vocational skills. It's also about meeting and collaborating with others around a shared interest. At Outschool, the most inspiring moments are when we see learners join a class from diverse locations like California, Georgia, Utah, Ohio, Canada, Russia, and Australia. They learn with each other and explore a shared interest led by a passionate teacher. In the current political environment in the U.S., connecting learners from different backgrounds, cultures, and views seems more important than ever. Luckily for us, we see this everyday.</p>
 
<p><b>What trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
Online learning is poised to play a much larger role in kids' education. We see a future where in-person learning is enhanced by online learning to offer a breadth and depth of educational opportunities not possible today. Most schools can't offer a broad enough range of classes to allow kids to pursue all of their interests and meet all of their unique educational needs.</p>

<p>Parents of young kids today grew up with the internet, and that has changed their expectations of how their kids will learn. They expect choice and are looking for education options that can keep pace with a world that's being transformed by technology. You can see that demand in a whole raft of trends, from personalization initiatives in schools, vouchers/school choice programs, project-based-learning, and interest in alternative approaches.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work with Outschool will change how individuals approach learning? </b><br>
Our marketplace connects motivated learners, teachers, and parents together, giving them real choice and personalization. Rather than having a fixed curriculum, we give teachers the freedom to offer the classes they're passionate about in the way they want. That allows learners with many different interests and styles to find what they need.</p>

<p>Outschool classes are interactive, meeting in small groups over live video chat. Self-study, using other content like videos, textbooks, and websites, is important and happens between live sessions. But it is the live meetings and interaction that form the core of Outschool classes and is so engaging for kids. Kids learn from, and are accountable to, their peers as well as the teacher. Group classes can be cheaper for the parent while also earning teachers more, as costs are split.</p>

<p>Our goal is to reach millions of families worldwide and have them learn and connect through live online classes. I'd like to see interactive online classes become a standard format and Outschool become every kid's second school.</p>
 
<p><b>What other projects are you currently working on or have planned for the future?</b><br>
As a startup project with an ambitious goal, Outschool is all-encompassing for me. I also occasionally invest in or advise other tech startups. In the future it would be amazing to see startup companies formed by teams of kids who met through Outschool!</p>
