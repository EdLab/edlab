<i>Information has become the driving force in our lives, and the ominous threat of this ever-increasing pile demanding to be understood has made most of us anxious…It happens when information doesn’t tell us what we want or need to know. <b>(The introduction of Wurman’s book, </b></i> <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Information-Anxiety-Richard-Saul-Wurman/dp/product-description/0385243944> Information Anxiety</a>).  
<p>
<b>From Travel Guides to TED Talks</b>  
<p>
Michelle Obama recently presented Richard Saul Wurman with the National Design Award’s Lifetime Achievement Award for his work as the founder of the highly respected <a href="http://www.ted.com/pages/registration">TED conferences</a>.  Of the awarded, Obama noted, "He does this work not for fame, fortune or money, but just really to do something good." Originally from Philadelphia, Wurman trained as an architect at U Penn in the late 50’s, went on to coin the term "Information architect" and pioneered the field of information architecture in the late 70’s.  Fittingly, it was this desire to make sense of the information that began to flood people’s lives in the early days of the internet that led Wurman down the path of content curation for which TED is known.  Taking complex ideas and distilling them into easy-to-understand visual formats is also a hallmark of Wurman’s other best-known accomplishment, the <a href=" http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062772910/roadtriamericare"> ACCESS series of travel guides</a>.  Known for clear visual representations of travel information grouped by neighborhood, these guides are the perfect embodiment of all the concepts Wurman extolled in information architecture (simplicity, ease-of-use, clear instructions), and established his place in the pantheon of pioneers who work to help us organize and make sense of the flood of information available in our modern lives. 
<p>
<b>A Revolution one "talk" at a time</b>
<p>
The TED conferences, founded by Wurman in 1984, have featured novelties such as the introduction of Apple’s first Mac computer and the introduction of Google search. It was also through the TED platform that Sir Ken Robinson’s 2006 viral sensation, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html"> "Schools Kill Creativity"</a> (viewed over 11 million times to date) became so popular.  As in his development of both the field of information architecture and the ACCESS travel guides, TED Talks seek to make groundbreaking innovations available and easily accessible to the masses.  Short, freely available video captures of these talks are shared on the TED blog and Wurman, who currently continues to promote social good through design, still very much believes that information and design should be both beneficial and accessible.  This should be a rallying cry for the education world to design new solutions that follow these guidelines.  TED’s recent entry into the world of online learning, <a href="http://ed.ted.com/">TEDEd</a>, is an example of Wurman’s potential to become an architect of not just information, but also education.
