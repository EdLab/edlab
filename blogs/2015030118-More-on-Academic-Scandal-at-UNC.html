          <p>
            Many reports have surfaced over the last few months about the academic scandal at the University of North Carolina (UNC). I have been following the development of this issue for some time now and it seems the scandal is more intense than I initially thought. Reports in the past indicated that most student athletes were enrolled in classes that do not exist and yet received high grades for these "fake classes."

This  <a href="http://www.si.com/college-football/2015/03/01/unc-admissions-officer-admit-student-athletes" target = "blank">article</a>sheds more light on the admission process of student athletes at UNC. A former admissions director has indicated that she felt too compelled to accept student athletes that she felt weren't qualified. Most of the students she was pressured to admit either did not take entrance exams or were months past the admissions deadline. These reports show how some schools prioritize sports over education. Student athletes are likely to fail in graduate school if they were accepted into an undergraduate program just because of their ability to play sports. Who should be blamed for prioritizing sports over education?
