<p><i>"June Labs makes it so easy to communicate with great educators, receive meaningful feedback and iterate quickly."</i> (<a href="https://junelabs.com/">About June Labs</a>) </p>

<p><b>Effective Education Tools Through Collaboration</b></p>

<p><a href="https://junelabs.com/">June Labs</a> is an edtech company that enables a collaboration triad between their project, technology companies, and educators to create better educational tools and applications for students. This California-based company communicates with companies and educators to foster the practical connections necessary for relevant and significant technological advancements. June Labs hosts a growing network of school administrators, districts, start-ups, and other edtech companies to ensure that what is invented is harnessed as relevant digital tools for tomorrow’s education. Educators are not only invested in this relationship to support the achievement of their own students, but are also incentivized with part-time consultation income to contribute to this network. <p> 

<p><b>Avoiding Application Flatline</b></p>

<p>Educators have the insight into, and knowledge of, their students’ needs. Thriving tech companies have the creative power to foresee technology trends. When these parties operate in isolation, they tend to leave a trail of missed opportunities and short-lived products. To avoid this, June Labs eliminates the guesswork by playing middleman; making sure that what educators need in the classroom is produced by the companies making the apps. Ideally, everyone reaches their full potential. <p>

<p><b>A Thriving Edtech Ecosystem </b></p>
 
<p>While many applications and technology companies have the right intentions, June Labs bridges the gaps between educators and technologists to create the conditions for the development of learning tools to meet the needs of educators and their students.</p>
