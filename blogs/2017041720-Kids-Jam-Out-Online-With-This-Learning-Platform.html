<p><i>"Learn what you love, love what you learn!"</i> (<a href="https://jam.com/">Jam</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Kid-driven Online Learning</b></p>

<p>San Francisco startup <a href="https://jam.com/">Jam</a> was co-founded by internet entrepreneur Zach Klein. Klein was previously involved in creating notable online communities Vimeo, Collegehumor, and DIY.org. In his latest project, Jam, kids are given the chance to develop their expertise through online courses designed specifically for young learners.</p>

<p>Jam creates online courses for kids that teach skills they can’t learn in school. The courses are self-paced and work year-round. Jam courses are designed by experts in their fields to inspire kids as they learn. Course activity is monitored by moderators to keep Jam a safe online community where experts can answer any learner’s questions. Learners can also chat with peers to find answers or share insights. Each course also outlines how much parental supervision is needed to complete. </p>

<p><b>Learning by Doing </b></p>
 
<p>Jam explicitly states its approach to pedagogy, which is to promote learning by doing and asking questions. Course topics include: building anything with LEGO, inventing your own machines, becoming a music star, and more. Jam courses target various age spans with most content appealing to kids around 9- to 14-years-old. Each course involves several quests or projects for kids to complete. Courses can be completed with the use of everyday materials so parents don’t need to purchase extra items. Tip videos help kids develop the techniques or skills needed to complete the suggested projects. While Jam courses are paid, there are daily scholarships that reduce course costs.</p>
