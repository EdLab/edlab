<i>The publishing industry is in the midst of profound change that goes much deeper than simply using new tools and technology to publish in new formats. That's why over 1,000 of the best minds in publishing gather every year in New York for the O'Reilly Tools of Change (TOC) Conference. No other publishing conference provides such an intelligent blend of practical experience, technical expertise that you can immediately put to use, and strategic insights</i> (<a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013">TOC site</a>).  <p> <b>Tic, TOC Goes the Publishing Clock</b><br> Keeping with the spirit of an O’Reilly Conference (check-out <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/32">this NL Sector article on OSCON</a>), the <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013">Tools of Change (TOC)</a> conference has maintained this rebellious "Open Source" spirit (It was at an <a href="http://oreilly.com/about/">O’Reilly event that the term "Open Source" was coined</a>).  Through a <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/stype/keynote">distinct group of speakers</a>, an assortment of workshops and unique opportunities for open, freewheeling dialogue around the future of the book, the conference, which was first held in 2007, has been at the forefront of the next big trends in publishing.  This year’s conference will take place February 12th-14th in NYC and include <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/content/office-hours">Office Hours</a> an <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/content/author-revolution-day">Author (R)evolution Day</a> and <a href="http://www.toccon.com/toc2013/public/schedule/detail/27033">Startup Showcase</a>.  Known for the range of <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/browse?publisher=12%2C103&publishername=O%27Reilly%20Media">animal-themed "how-to" guides</a>, the conference creates and reinforces the unconventional learning opportunities and <a href="http://makezine.com/about/index.html">"DIY" spirit</a> that O’Reilly media has helped to pioneer.  This emphasis on the free transfer of knowledge runs like a river through the whole conference and helps contribute to an event that <a href="http://www.crn.com/">CRN</a> describes as, "the gold standard for drawing together a critical mass of thought leaders."  <p> <b>Amplifying an eFuture</b><br> While not explicitly focused on educational publishing or the digital evolution of textbooks (the conference IS partly sponsored by Inkling.com), there is a connection as explained to NewLearningTimes by general manager and chair of TOC, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3764">Joe Wikert</a> (see exclusive interview below): "What we're really discovering is that the issues we discuss at TOC not only span many areas of book publishing (e.g., trade, reference, textbooks, etc.) but they bleed into other areas of content management and distribution. (e.g., newspapers, magazines, etc.)"  O’Reilly is known not only as an arbiter of forward-leaning ideas, but also, through conferences like OSCON and TOC, as a crucible for new concepts and "memes."  O’Reilly’s "about" page describes this transformative role in the technology community, "Since 1978, O'Reilly has been a chronicler and catalyst of leading-edge development, homing in on the technology trends that really matter and galvanizing their adoption by amplifying ‘faint signals’ from the alpha geeks who are creating the future." With this emphasis on an open transfer of knowledge at a conference like TOC, these "faint signals" of the future of both educational technology and the textbook are amplified to catch the attention of teachers, technologists and publishers. <p>
 
  <b>Exclusive New Learning Times interview with Joe Wikert, General Manager and chair of TOC.</b><p>  <b>While not explicitly focused on educational publishing or the future of the textbook... TOC seems ripe to explore these issues.  How do you imagine TOC impacting educational publishing and the growth of eTextbooks? (I noticed Inkling.com is a sponsor!)</b><br> What we're really discovering is that the issues we discuss at TOC not only span many areas of book publishing (e.g., trade, reference, textbooks, etc.) but they bleed into other areas of content management and distribution (e.g., newspapers, magazines, etc.) We're likely to see the distinction between a "book" and a "magazine" become harder and harder to measure in the future. A good example here is Kindle Singles. Are they really "books" or something else? Regardless of how you classify them they still face many of the same challenges as all other types of digital content. <p> <b>O'Reilly has been at the heart of the Open Source and "open" movements for quite some time... how is this conference a part of that movement?  Is it?</b><br>  "Open" is a very important concept within O'Reilly. We support open standards and platforms. Walled gardens, the likes of which you see from so many retailers these days, are a bad thing for consumers. Most consumers haven't realized it yet but they're building an ebook library with one of these retailers that basically locks them into that platform going forward. We believe HTML5 is a better platform for ebooks than anything we're seeing today from the major retailers. HTML5 is an open standard and content distributed in that format doesn't require a proprietary e-reading device or app; you can read it in just about any modern browser. This is just one example of how we are advocating more open standards and platforms across the publishing industry. <p> <b>What unique learning opportunities have the organizers built into the conference experience?</b><br> We try to focus on both the here and now, with practical hands-on sessions, as well as explore the future with more open-ended discussions about where the industry is likely heading. The event schedule is packed with terrific speakers and all the major topics are covered. But one of the reasons we get so many repeat attendees every year is because they know TOC is *the* event for industry networking. The value of attending is as much tied to meetings and hallway chatter as it is about scheduled sessions. <p> <b>Open knowledge transfer and a DIY spirit is alive and well with the O'Reilly guides... does this spirit infuse the TOC conference?</b><br>  The DIY equivalent in our industry is the self-publishing movement. We realize the importance of this area and that's why we launched our Author Revolution Day, which takes place the day before the main TOC event. As far as open knowledge transfer is concerned, we're firm believers in the concept (see note above about the importance of everything "open"). That's one of the reasons we launched our <a href="http://toc.oreilly.com/">community site</a> last year. If you scroll through the articles on the site you'll see a large number of community members not only adding to the discussion via comments but writing the articles themselves. The TOC community site is quickly becoming the virtual industry water cooler where change is openly discussed. <p> <b>What do you imagine are the tools used by change makers in the publishing world?  Are tablets and mobile technologies the only answer?</b><br> Tablets are obviously a very important device. In fact, they're quickly replacing the dedicated ebook readers (e.g., the E-ink-based devices from Amazon, B&N, etc.) Prices have come down over the past couple of years and battery life has improved dramatically. Look at the iPad Mini. It's a fraction of the weight of the original iPad and offers a content consumption experience that's second to none. Mobile phones can't be overlooked either though. We're seeing a convergence in the sense that tablets are getting smaller while phones are getting larger. More and more phones are becoming viable e-reading devices; and since your phone is always with you it means access to your ebook library is right there too.
