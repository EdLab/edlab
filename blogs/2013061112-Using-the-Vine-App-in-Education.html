          <p>
            I've noticed that the fairly new Vine app has become pretty popular these days, so I decided to include it as one of the tools businesses can use in my Social Media Marketing course.  For those who don't already know, Vine is a video-sharing app that was released just this year.  It's limited to only six seconds long, kind of like how like tweets are limited to 140 characters, and its video-sharing is similar to Instagram's photo-sharing.  If used carefully, I think Vine could be really effective for companies by either showcasing new products or having short “behind-the-scenes” videos.  

Because they are so short, they are extremely easy to film and upload, while giving followers a little sneak peak of what's happening.  After reading more into it, I became curious about how Vine can be used for learning and came across this Edudemic article, <a href="http://www.edudemic.com/2013/03/how-to-use-vine-in-the-classroom/">How to Use Vine in the Classroom</a>.  As we see more and more classrooms incorporating technology into teaching methods by using laptops, iPads, and apps, maybe we'll see more schools including Vine in their class projects.  

Of course, there are still a lot of drawbacks with using Vine in the classroom as of now-- for example, there is no way to control the amount of uncensored content students may come across-- but do you see Vine as a classroom app in the future of education?
