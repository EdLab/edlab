<b>Title:</b> The Role of Student Characteristics in Predicting Retention in Online Courses (2014)
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Justin D. Cochran, Stacy M. Campbell, Hope M. Baker, & Elke M. Leeds
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11162-013-9305-8">Research in Higher Education</a>
<p>
<b>Research Question:</b> Which student characteristics are associated with the likelihood of withdrawal from online classes?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Disproportionate attrition rates in online courses have long been a thorn in the side of techno-evangelists and other heralds of the brave new digital world. Although a great deal of information is available on which characteristics tend to lead to student dropout in traditional courses, little work has been done to see what, if any, of this knowledge will carry over to the online world. Effective interventions canâ€™t be developed without a robust understanding of who tends to drop out of online courses, and why.
<p>
This study looked at a sample of 2,314 undergraduate students enrolled in online courses at a large state university in spring 2010, and examined how a variety of individual characteristics, including age, gender, race, GPA, college of study, class status, and financial situation interacted with each other and with the likelihood of dropping the online course.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Across the board, upper-class students and students with a higher GPA tend not to drop out of online courses. Unsurprisingly, students who have passed previous online courses are more likely to stick it out in future online courses. Surprisingly, on the other hand, the evidence is much more fixed for the effect of having a student grant or scholarship, with students in some categories, with certain grants or scholarships, being more likely to drop out than others, without any clear across the board effect. The authors also break down which factors are significant within different majors; for instance, business majors are less likely to withdraw if they are male or black, and science majors are more likely to withdraw if they have student loans or a Hope Scholarship.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The most promising thing about online education may be all of the data it inevitably generates about the student population. Although the data from this study are voluminous, compared to the kind of fine-grained understanding of student behavior we could potentially develop, the conclusions drawn are fairly broad-brush. We can already draw some fairly common-sense policy implications, such as reserving online courses to seniors, or to high-performing students, but as we extend online education throughout higher education, more personalized data should allow us to develop more fine grained recommendations to minimize dropping out.
