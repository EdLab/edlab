          <p>
            While researching ways to form an ed-tech review I came across an article that poses this question: <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/10/01/does-ed-tech-need-its-own-consumer-reports/">Does ed tech need its own Consumer Reports?</a>  The author believes that just have a rating for each ed-tech would not be much help for educators unless these ratings considers class size and learning level to teachers' and students' familiarity with technology. Which makes sense, when forming an ed-tech review one should consider the teachers' and students' needs and if the learning technology is effective in completing their learning goals. But the challenge to this may be that learning technologies are constantly being updated, so that by the time the review of the learning technology is published, a new version of the app would be already released.

The more interesting part of the article was their mentioning of a new nonprofit program, that will try to overcome this challenge called <b><a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/files/downloads_and_links/THP_ChatterjiJones_EdTech_DiscPaper.pdf">EDU-STAR</a></b>. The more I read the EDU-STAR paper the more it sounds like the Learning Tech Community Reviews (LTCR) project. EDU-STAR would evaluate and report on learning technologies specifically targeted for K-12 students. The evaluations would be based on the Common Core State Standards. This is so that consumers, in this case mostly teachers and schools, would be more confident that the learning technology their purchasing would be a worthwhile investment. It sounds similar to the goals for LTCR but EDU-STAR goes about this in a different way. 

EDU STAR would evaluate learning technologies by running quick, low cost, and rigorous testing trials in K-12 schools and then reporting out the results to the schooling community and the creators of the learning technology who would make improvements based on the report. The testing would be performed by students who would play with the learning technology and answer questions, sound familiar? This process would provide quick evaluations, which would be delivered to the developers of the learning technologies so that their next product would improve based on the evaluation report.

So far the LTCR way of reviewing learning technologies is to let educators, learners, and ed-technologists test a product and fill out a review survey. The review surveys would be hopefully quick to fill out and will address what educators, and learners need from a learning technology. This method would hopefully become a more in-depth Edlab Review. If anyone has come across any research on evaluating learning technologies, or have an opinion about how it should be done, feel free to comment.
