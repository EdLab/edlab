<p>The playwright is the thing, especially when it comes to William Shakespeare. The new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shakespeare/id285035416?mt=8">Shakespeare app</a> turns all the world into a stage for the Bard’s beloved work by providing a comprehensive set of text-centric e-resources. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app includes what any lover of the English language would expect: text of his plays, poems, and sonnets. It also includes Passport, a virtual ticket to events held around the world that are supported by participating venues. It even offers a feature called BardFind, a way to locate Shakespearean theaters anywhere they can be found. If you are on the road, and looking for high brow entertainment on the open highway, the Shakespeare app can direct you there. </p>

<p>For those who are more studious, Shakespeare includes detailed backgrounds that provide overviews of scene locations and participating characters. Settings are widely adjustable; you can customize fonts, sizes, and colors to make reading letter perfect. The search function helps you quickly find works when you need them. Finally, if you are slight of build, or bad at keeping track of smaller written works, Shakespeare may make your bookkeeping more manageable. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The Shakespeare app is awfully text-heavy. If you want your iPad offerings to be more multimedia in nature, you probably need to look elsewhere. Given this, the interactive experience is a tad bland. Although most iPad-toting high schoolers should be able to navigate the app easily, they may find it boring after a short period of exposure. Although the free version of the app provides a comprehensive selection of works, resources like glossaries, quotes, portraits, line numbers, and study guides are exclusive to the Pro Edition. Depending on your needs, coughing up $10 may be worth it; however, 41 plays, 154 sonnets, and 6 poems available in the free edition should be sufficient for most. </p>

<p>On a final note, Shakespeare’s works invoke an era of romance and tragedy, history and bygone days—reading these words with a digital device feels heretical. Shakespeare might be best savored over a hot coffee in a small corner of an old local coffee shop, bringing you back to a different, more gilded, age. Words without thoughts never to heaven go. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you are a fan of the Bard, or just an annoyed high school student trying to complete an English assignment, the Shakespeare app can bring the prince of words to life. For those who find reading Shakespeare a chore, this text-centric app provides a little bit of relief, but many will still find it tough slogging. Lay on, Macduff. </p>
