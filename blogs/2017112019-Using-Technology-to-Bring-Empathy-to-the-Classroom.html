<p>In Harper Lee’s novel <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, Atticus Finch tries to teach his outspoken six-year-old daughter, Scout, a little trick: "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it." The little trick, of course, is empathy, and it’s easier said than done. With this video from Common Sense Education, teachers can learn ways to apply the wealth of digital tools available online (like PenPal Schools, Digital Classroom, Skype and GarageBand, to name a few) to teach kids empathy.</p>

<p>Building social and emotional learning skills has traditionally required face-to-face interaction, meaningful discussion, and reflection. But technology takes the process a step further supporting learning with hands-on strategies that help students build empathy in digital spaces and become responsible digital citizens. This video explores three specific approaches: how to model and practice digital citizenship, how to introduce kids to different perspectives and people from different backgrounds, and how to help kids turn empathy into action. </p>

<p>Classrooms are complex and diverse environments and, like the community in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, they are also ideal spaces for students to take an inward look at themselves and a closer look at their peers. Do you think moral social issues should be dealt with in the classroom? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/40441">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:11 Coach Rick:</b>These kids today think no one sees what they do online. Makes for real nasty stuff. No way would they say this stuff in front of me or even if they thought I knew who they were!</p>

<p><b>@00:36 Buster Wainwright:</b> Pen Pal Schools looks like a cool app. I had a pen pal and because of him I wanted to travel and experience different cultures... the trouble today is that culture has become political, which kind of makes empathy all the more important.</p>

<p><b>@00:47 RuthS:</b> I am incredibly skeptical of the claim that VR headsets can increase empathy, especially when they are the cardboard headsets. Using these, students can observe different settings around the world, but I don't think that would increase empathy any more than watching TV.</p>

<p><b>@00:50 Cinthia Fabian: </b> To piggyback off Ruth's comment, my other concern in regards to this "VR increases empathy" idea is that you can't just visually plop yourself into a new/foreign/contentious situation and then claim to understand the nuances of what's happening. I'm doubtful of how well VR can capture context, relational/power dynamics, etc.</p>
