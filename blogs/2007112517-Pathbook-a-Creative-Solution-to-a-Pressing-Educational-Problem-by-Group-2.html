The <a href="http://nsse.iub.edu/NSSE_2007_Annual_Report/docs/withhold/NSSE_2007_Annual_Report.pdf">2007 National Survey of Student Engagement</a> finds once again that American students are not as engaged by their education as they could be. The study's main finding is that students who engage in "high impact" learning experiences in collaborative environments report much higher levels of educational engagement than their peers do. The NSSE Survey concludes that schools should structure the learning environment so that students can engage in more collaborative, high impact work. Our group asks the question: What can the EdLab do to promote collaborative work that supports engaged learners both inside and outside of educational institutions?

 

As we thought about how the Lab could support this work, we found ourselves returning to a belief that we should utilize existing online social networks (see the most recent issue of <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/254">First Monday</a> or <a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/">Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</a> for a discussion of this). Although we would not invent the social network, we would create a tool that takes advantage of existing social networks as a means to achieving our educational goal.


The proposal is to develop a Facebook application where students can track the path of their education by inputting courses taken, books read, places visited, educational experiences, blog entries etc. into a "map" that organizes the data meaningfully in its internal relations as well as in relation to their friends' educational paths. The proposed name is Pathbook(a merge of Pathways and Facebook). In our presentation on Wednesday, we will describe our new educational tool and explain how it will make learning a significantly more engaging experience.
