            <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/05/28/afghanistan-girls-strive-for-a-bright-future-at-refurbished-high-school" target = "blank">Education Quality Improvement Program</a> (EQUIP) was created in Afghanistan to increase access to education, particularly for girls. EQUIP receives financial support from the World Bank and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. Since the establishment of the program, there has been a significant increase in school enrollment. For instance in 2002, girls' enrollment was estimated at 200,000, but currently stands at 3.4 million. Afghanistan's education system has not been able to reach its full potential due to instability. However, the introduction of EQUIP is helping to change that. They have managed to build new school buildings with larger classrooms and have provided learning materials.
<p>
A group of people that has been instrumental to the success of EQUIP is the <i>shura</i> or council. They consist of teachers, local elders, parents, and students. Their desire is to see students in various communities receive the best education. As a result, they often meet to discuss issues faced by schools. For example, an estimated 2,000 girls are enrolled at a local high school. Up until the last decade, many girls in Afghanistan were not allowed to attend school. This is still an ongoing problem in some parts of the country. In the Balk province, the <i>shuras</i> have helped to enroll as many girls as possible. As a result, many of the students are optimistic about their future.
