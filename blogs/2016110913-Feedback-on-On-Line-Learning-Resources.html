            Jackie H., Ryan and my feedback on the Emerging Forms of Online Learning Seminar:"Let's Create a PLN"

1. What do you think are the learning/teaching goals for each online learning opportunity?
-To introduce the Learner to the principals and resources of a Personal Learning Network.
-To indicate the relative benefits of a PLN and offer examples of existing PLNs.

2. What theory or approach to learning do you think informed the design of each learning 
opportunity?
-Possibly the approach to teaching the principals of PLN is through a type of PLN via Rhizr. 

3. What is one strength for each online learning opportunity?
- General appeal - multiple examples available.

4. How could each learning opportunity be enhanced?
-Introducing the principals of PLNs would be more effective with a flow chart or graphic other than the word cloud which is more of a result than a process. Here are some we found:

<img src="http://joesabado.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/personal-learning-network3.png" />

-Spell out what PLN is as early as possible and in heading - nobody who doesn't already know what a PLN is could possibly find this, and it's designed for someone who doesn't know what it is (for the same reason Rhizr may not be the right medium as it is a platform for people already introduced to PLN or teaching practices. This Rhizr should be linked from a more popular and public platform so that it is accessible for people who would best be served by this resource).

5. How effectively did the online learning resource address the following questions?

i. What are the limitations of your emerging form for learning and teaching?
 - they make suggestions about blending media types (audio, written, visual, social media etc) 
but they don't provide insight which is best suited for specific interests... so Evernote is great for embedding all files but it's not as easy as Pinterest (with their plug ins and buttons for streamlining adding content)
- Make a spectrum of applicability of the resources showing their use-cases (i.e. THIS is best for visual, vs research vs business vs data vs connectivity etc)

ii. What are the educational applications of your emerging form?
-ultra-accessibility with many opportunities for feedback and interaction. Easy to update and reorganize but NOT easy to graduate out of (if you pick on format you are kind of locked-in)

iii. What are the sociological dimensions of your emerging form?
- accessibility levels the playing field so in theory anyone with access to a computer (and the capacity to use one) could benefit from this. However it is rather meta-only someone with an understanding and interest in this kind of learning theory/process would really search this out, not a beginner - which is it's intended audience. This subject and the media it uses create a feedback loop instead of being a jumping-off point to further insight and access. It could wind up being redundant.

iv. What research did you use to create your online learning resource?
-it appears that this represents an agreggate of other resources and approaches and an overview of this process. The research is a curated collection of other people's examples of the same principals, which I feel like I could have done myself, so what makes this special?
