            I discovered that we had the novel <em>Let the Great World Spin</em>,  by Colum McCann, when a student checked it out.  The student said s/he  was doing a project on New York novels and was, at the time,  also checking out three other fantastic novels.  It got me thinking about what other New York novels we might have  in the  collection.

How  might you find other books like this?  One way is to do a subject  search by entering in the terms you think best describe the book you  want and seeing which terms come up, and narrow from there. You can also  find a book you know and search for similar books.  If you go into any  record and click “full record” you will see a list of subject headings  the Library of Congress has assigned to the book.  These subject  headings link to other books described the same way. In this case, If  you do a subject search for “New York (N.Y.)--Fiction” you will get 28  results, including:

Edwidge Danticat’s <em>Breath, Eyes, Memory</em>
J.D. Salinger’s <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>
Daniel Menaker’s <em>The Treatment</em>
and <em>New York Stories</em> (an anthology of stories that looks excellent, judging by the author list).

You  could search for many aspects of fiction, including “Haiti--fiction”  (in the case of Danticat), “psychotherapist and patient--fiction” in the  case of Menaker, or “runaway teenagers--fiction,” in the case of <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>.   Because it’s fairly difficult to predict these varieties of fiction,  you might also want to do an advanced search and enter fiction in one search box  with New York in the other, connected by the boolean AND.  This will  yield more results than using the authorized term New York  (N.Y.)--fiction, but sometimes that’s useful.

Back to <em>Let the Great World Spin</em>. This  book is <strong>fantastic</strong>.  It’s Colum McCann’s fifth novel and won the  National Book Award in 2009. The plot follows a group of characters in  New York City, all connected by a single event: Philipe Petit’s historic  walk across a wire strung between the twin towers in 1974.  The  characters’ lives prove richer and more fascinating than the event that  binds them; McCann’s has described the novel as an attempt to process  his grief over 9/11, but even the connection to 9/11 remains muted,  beneath the surface. McCann’s gift as a storyteller (in my opinion) is  that he lets his characters be human. Compared to, for instance,  Jennifer Egan’s <em>A Visit From the Goon Squad</em>,  which is technically savvy and very smartly written (including, in my  opinion, a perfect first chapter), McCann tells a story from varied  viewpoints in a way that feels organic--it feels, when reading it, that  the story <em>needed</em> to be told this way in the service of his characters. McCann is generous to his characters; I never felt  that he was writing to impress me with his skill, but rather, that he  was trying to impress his characters with his honesty.  Unfortunately, artistic integrity is not a subject heading!  It's a beautiful book-- consider checking it out.

“Elegantly  weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives, McCann’s  powerful allegory comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city’s  people, unexpectedly drawn together by hope, beauty, and the “artistic  crime of the century.” A sweeping and radical social novel, <em>Let the Great World Spin</em> captures  the spirit of America in a time of transition, extraordinary promise,  and, in hindsight, heartbreaking innocence. Hailed as a “fiercely  original talent” (San Francisco Chronicle), award-winning novelist  McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in  us a sense of what the novel can achieve, confront, and even heal.”
