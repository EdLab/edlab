            Hi all!

As promised, here are some of the highlights from today's D&R. 

I took notes on what people gave as praises/prompts:
Common praises: Straightforward, concise, contains the "why"
Common prompts: Too broad/general, does not address need

Video from the presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHbpbGi7keg

Developing pitches for your personal role vs. for EdLab as a whole

Brainstorming Session: What would you emphasize in building a pitch for EdLab? (Add your own in the comments!)

Pranav model (Starting with an "Imagine" scenario (e.g., Learning Theater))
Providing concrete examples
Main goals: Research, design, and innovation
"Continuously disrupting educational technology for people", "Playfully innovating learning and education for humans"
Portraying mission (looking for key words)
Keep it broad but still within the scope of the future - be general enough so that mission is relevant 5 years in the future (being general gives a future model; specificity can lose a chunk of constituency)
Mission statement doesn’t have to last forever. Part of EdLab’s goals is to keep changing
Relationship with the library at TC. Ambitious design and research projects to support the future of learning that exists outside traditional schooling
"EdLab is a multifunctional unit of TC, because TC helps teachers, and TC wants to make the education system more efficient. EdLab started from the library, but now we have more ambitions. We have experts publishing their research, we create systems, we are a self-sustainable system under TC."
"The world is changing. Education is more complex. At the same time, we want to make sure education is affordable. EdLab is a pioneer in helping TC obtain that mission."
For a TC audience: "EdLab is an organization affiliated with TC that encompasses a range of teams working on the functioning of the library (finding books, resources, catalogs; booking rooms) and presenting the face of scholarship at TC. Moving beyond the library to show what learning looks like in that changing landscape particularly with new technologies like mSchools and Vialogues."
We change a lot but the one thing we haven’t changed is our commitment to learning—how to make learning more relevant, more effective, more engaging. 
Hybrid learning environments
Relevance of physical space
Having a community to better understand learning and teaching

Thanks for your attention guys! Happy Tuesday!
