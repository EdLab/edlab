            <b>Demo Night Branding</b>

Welcome back! 

Part 2 in this series: the Presentation of our Branding Choices for the Demo Night event.

<b>Today's Meeting | 3rd design meeting</b> for <b>"Demo Night" </b>
—————————————————————————————————————————————
After my first blog entry for the Demo Night Branding, we had 2 additional team meetings. 

Our selected direction is below, and is based on ideas of how we would like to present Demo Night: 

- elegant / fun 
- clean / fun
 - dark w/ accent (gray, black etc w/ pop color) 
- juxtaposition 

Especially, <b>Juxtaposition: the Pairing of Opposites</b>

The core idea behind the direction is simply this: 
Putting 2 different things together as the one, "Demo"+"Night".

What this Demo Night branding tell's us: It's an event full of <b>serious talk & discussion</b>, and it's a <b>fun & entertainment</b> event at night. 

<b>And now… our new Demo Night Event Branding:</b>

<br>
<img src="http://www.umcreate.com/demonight.gif">
<br>

Time to talk once again about "what is branding?". It's much more than just the look & feel.

Let's start by thinking about what branding shouldn't be: some restrictive set of rules that makes everything look identical or boring. It should just be a few baseline rules that add control.

<b>It's 'the guide'. </b>
Remember, Branding is creating 'Public Persona'.

It gives a team (not just those on the design side) some consistent ideas of how to present and talk about our event: Demo Night. 

As noted in my first post in this series, it's really about starting out with a very small set of rules. Colors and typefaces, images being handled a certain way, and creating consistent messaging that works across devices, platforms and physical forms. And creating a system that can be flexible enough to accommodate new needs as they arise.

Branding is also the way to unite a team with shared ideas, develop a deep understanding, and it helps to create the intangible value by controlling presentation to our audience. That's another very important rational for branding, and the real value of these blog entires. We all need to be presenters for Demo night, and this will help us to present with (the same) shared ideas. Achieve that, and we'll have coherent, consistent messaging, and that will ultimately be effective —and make it a successful event.

<b>A different look at Branding and Perception Control</b>

Think: "<a href="http://bit.ly/QYtStY" target="_blank">Genius Training</a>" Guide for Apple Geniuses (leaked on Gizmodo). Apple, in this case, works very diligently to control perception during customer interactions with Geniuses (their in-store 'help desk'). This perception has quite the effect on the brand and future purchases, as they've noted and tracked in their observations. Another great example of branding and experience control is had when you visit the Magic Kingdom. These are a couple of high profile examples of branding extending beyond just the graphical look and feel, to the intangible.

Next Installment:
Let's see how this branding grows, as it flows across real design forms over the next couple of weeks!
