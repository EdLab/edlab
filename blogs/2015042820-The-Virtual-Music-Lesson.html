<p>Is Skype a viable platform for distance music learning? This case study examined a one-on-one lesson between a piano instructor and college-level student to assess the impact of virtual music education at this level. The authors concluded that, though there are some challenges, the digital learning experience was positive for both student and teacher and the process could be widely and formally implemented in college-level music education.</p>

<p>The authors conducted lesson observations of the student and teacher and made video recordings of these lessons for later analysis. The data was collected over the course of 16 weeks, which included eight 50-minute lessons in addition to bi-weekly e-journals in which the participants wrote down their reflections.</p>

<p>This case study examined a student and teacher pair that had previously worked together face-to-face and were already familiar with one another. Though this case is particular, the researches believe that the elements and characteristics of Skype-based video music lessons can be carefully generalized. One of the most significant barriers for college level virtual instruction has been resistance by institutions to implement this strategy, so it is worth noting that the university, music department, professor, and student were all excited and wiling to model this innovative practice. The student and teacher reported that the synchronicity of the lesson was particularly important to their feeling that this was a "natural" way to teach and learn.</p>

<p>The pair also benefited from the electronic compatibility of their instrument, using the Yamaha Disklavier keyboard to transmit "ghostly" sound, key presses, and foot pedal use from student to teacher.  Before lighting on this solution, they experienced a few difficulties unique to music instruction including audio delays on Skype and experimentation with different hardware to transmit the best sound.</p>

<p>In this case study, the researchers examined a teacher student pair that were excited about the potential of the platform and experimented with different tools and settings to achieve mastery of the format. The pair found virtual instruction natural and beneficial and enjoyed increased flexibility. The importance of connecting students to particular teachers across great distances and the ease of implementation of this solution seems like it could entice more college music programs to adopt virtual instruction. Additionally, while technology advanced enough to support quality audio and visual cost between $2,000 and $15,000, this amount is feasible for a university and may not be necessary depending on the instrument.</p>
