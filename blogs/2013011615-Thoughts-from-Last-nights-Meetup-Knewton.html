Manav, Nara and I traveled down to Knewton's offices for last-night's #EdTechNYC Meetup: "I Like it When you Call me Big Data."  <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8715">Here</a> is one of the original EdLab blog posts describing the event.  

<b>Setting:</b> Knewton's new offices are swanky, stocked with beer (even a tap!) and snack bar.  However, the space for events is NOT ideal (too few chairs, awkward, small screen - dark area in the front).  The event was PACKED!  Thankfully we arrived 30 mins early and were able to secure chairs towards the front of the room.  On a positive note... the chairs are VERY comfortable. 

<b>Takeaways:</b>
-@Knewton's founder Jose Ferreira, provided a "boilerplate" intro to the event... how & why the adaptive learning platform harnesses millions of data points to adapt course material to student needs (check-out their white paper <a href="http://www.knewton.com/adaptive-learning-white-paper/">here</a>). However, due to "non-disclosure" agreements he could say very little... 

-Steve Hodas from the DOE's Innovation Initiative made an official announcement of their <a href="http://nycschools.challengepost.com/">"Gap App Challenge"</a>.

-IBM seems to be a bit behind (or possibly really, really ahead) ... but making an attempt to connect with startups to partner with to collect ed data.  The "data is the new soil" comment was insightful, but not new.  (See Sharon's build on this idea in the Twitter stream above.)

-C8Sciences.com was by far the most compelling & is a fascinating new company with a platform developed by a Yale U psychiatry professor and an ex-gymnast.  Their focus on responsible tracking and assessment of young people's data is refreshing and potentially extremely useful for assessment.  I whole-heartedly vote for a seminar from C8Sciences!  

-The contact from Marist College... while well meaning, didn't seem to have ANYTHING new to add to the data conversation.  That being said, it does seem that Marist hopes to move in the direction of tailoring course content to student needs and is in the process of creating an "early warning system" for undergrads at the small liberal arts college.

I am excited for more EdTechNYC events in the future... the group always makes an effort to host a great event even when the panelists fall short!  At the very least, they definitely get points for a creative event title!
