<i>We are very excited to share our work and community movement through Educade.</i> (Lucien Vattel Founder, CEO and Executive Director of <a href="http://gamedesk.org/">GameDesk</a>)

<p><b>The Technicolor Edtech Library</b><br>
<a href="http://educade.org/lesson_plans">Educade</a> is a library of digital educational resources to help educators and parents find new edtech tools to use. Launched in 2008 with the help of AT&T and <a href="http://www.gamedesk.org/">Gamedesk</a> the platform aims to "put fun and creativity back into learning" by providing free lesson plans along with engaging edtech products. The financial support for Educade is a part of <a href="http://about.att.com/content/csr/home/people/aspire.html">AT&T Aspire</a>, a $350 million corporate commitment to helping more students graduate. The Educade library organizes every resource with the proper metadata tags for better searching. Educade makes great use of color to show the learning subject for each resource, which makes the digital library look vibrant. Each lesson plan and edtech product is bolstered with plenty of metadata to give users a good idea of what the resource contains.</p>

<p><b>Not All Learning Tools Make the Cut</b><br>
<p>The most interesting thing about this educational resource platform is that adding a resource to the library is more involved in comparison to similar sites. When educators share learning resources they are encouraged to add plenty of information to describe those resources. Some information that is required includes title, description, metadata tags, images, and any other information that may be vital for educators. The site also encourages users to add pictures of the learning resources. After submitting a lesson plan or resource for review it may take several days to receive a response. Learning resources submitted with little to no information are not added to the library. This filtering process ensures that all educational resources on Educade have robust descriptions, which helps educators get a good idea of the learning goals of the resource.</p>

<p>The advantage to the long and very selective resource vetting process is that the library consists of mostly high quality learning resources with good descriptive information. The disadvantage to this process is that, compared to similar platforms, Educade has a smaller library of learning resources. Teachers and parents will appreciate that some resources include lesson plans that describe ways to use the resource in the classroom. This information could be very valuable for teachers looking for new ideas for improve instruction. Moving forward, key questions include whether this library will grow and whether the more demanding metadata requirements will remain.</p>
