<p>Can teachers integrate play into the classroom as students age out of toys and games? What elements of play are presented in middle grades classroom curricula? Fun and play are strong tools for motivating and engaging students, but as students age into adolescence, incorporating these elements into the classroom may pose a challenge. A recent study investigated the practices of novice teachers across fourteen classrooms to capture and record instances of students’ joyful learning in relation to play, imagination, and creativity.</p> 

<p>The study revealed a number of approaches to encouraging play, including: featuring flexible curricular spaces for students to create imaginative and artistic work, encouraging students to take on particular roles through pretend play, allowing students to participate in activities integrated with physical play, and cultivating student sense of ownership through choice and self direction. Teachers’ use of humor also played an important role in avoiding stressful conditions in the classrooms. </p> 

<p>The concept of play defined by the study, though different from play-based learning in early childhood, is oriented toward the kind of playful, joyful learning that affirms students’ participatory roles as active enactors of their own curricula. Those elements of play identified cannot simply be imposed in classroom activities without first considering students’ learning contexts. For example, the use of humor might not be appropriate for presenting controversial content. Thus, teachers should carefully incorporate those elements according to the curricular and cultural practices in their classrooms.</p>

<p>The findings of the study contain lessons for  teaching and learning in both offline and online settings. While physical play is not applicable in an online environment, other elements such as the availability of choices, self direction, and pretend play (for example, via digital avatars) might contribute to the ways online instructors position students on positive, playful online learning trajectories.</p>
