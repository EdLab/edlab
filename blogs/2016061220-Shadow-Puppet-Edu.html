<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shadow-puppet-edu/id888504640?mt=8">Shadow Puppet Edu</a> can make anyone into a video creator. Users can pull pictures and videos from their camera roll or search and add images from Google Maps and various educational websites, such as the Library of Congress and NASA. Once the pictures are arranged in the desired order, users can record overlapping audio, music, text, and emojis. They can even draw on the pictures and videos in real time. After polishing their video project (or as the app calls it, Puppet) users can share it on numerous social media apps. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app provides users with an incredible amount of flexibility, meaning they will truly get to exercise their imaginations. For example, font type, color, and presentation style are entirely up to the user. The app’s navigation makes it easy to trim video clips and rearrange images; the process is intuitive enough for a child to pick up quickly. Users can record audio, and if they’re unhappy with that, rerecord it without a problem. Users can also control how much time each image appears, making them move forward as quickly or slowly as they desire. </p>
 
<p>The app makes it incredibly simple to create a new project. Users can either create one from scratch or draw inspiration from one of the many idea templates available, such as "digital storytelling" and "if I were president." Each idea template also includes a historical example, a tip to get started, and a reference to the Common Core ideal it exercises. One final perk: for teachers and parents just getting started with Shadow Puppet Edu, there is an in-app blog that provides tips, guides, and ideas so that projects can reach their full potentials.  </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>To be honest, this app does not have any obvious negative aspects. It is great for creating educational videos. If your intent, however, is to make a movie, this app is not for you. The quality of videos and pictures are only as good as your iPad camera, and there are no features that allow for slow motion or other video effects. As such, Shadow Puppet Edu may not be your ticket to Tinseltown. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Shadow Puppet Edu is perfect for children who would enjoy exercising their documentary-making skills and teachers who want a new and fun way to introduce topics in class. Since the app’s emphasis is on creating educational projects, kids are sure to learn from an array of topics and skills while exercising their creativity. There is no doubt that young learners will be proud of their completed projects in Shadow Puppet Edu and keep coming back to make more. </p>
