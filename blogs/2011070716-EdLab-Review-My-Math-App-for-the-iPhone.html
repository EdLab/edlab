Given that the founder of Brainscape, Andrew Cohen, came and spoke with us a week ago, I thought it was worth going over another flashcard application, in case Steve's idea for an adaptive SMS flashcard app resurfaces, but this time in the field of math specifically.

<b>Description</b>
'My Math App' is a very simple and intuitive math flashcard application for teaching addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Sets of flashcards with simple single and double digit problems on them. Each set contains 25 flashcards and there is a timer to see how quickly you can get through them while maintaining accuracy. 

<b>Pros:</b>
Simplicity! This application is, at its core, functional. It does what it is supposed to do and does so well. For someone who simply wants to gain familiarity with basic mental math, this is a great way to practice. There are no sign ups, the first screen simply asks you what operation you want to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) as well as the skill level (starter and advanced). It is nice to see an app that does not over do itself. Once you choose one of the flashcard sets, there is a small icon you can touch to better fine-tune settings to adjust for difficulty, number of digits, number of questions, and whether or not you would like a timer and a help button. I was glad that the icon was small and sequestered, since it emphasized its practical function over its customizable features.

<b>Cons:</b>
The UI, while not totally amateurish, is not as sleek as it could be. There is an ad-free version of the app because the free app has ads at the bottom of the screen while you input the numbers. I made the frequent mistake of touching the ad instead of the number. I also found pressing number icons on a touchscreen to be a real hassle on a small device like an iPhone.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
If we do decide to build a flashcard application, I think we ought to value the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a>. A student who is downloading a flashcard application would like to get to task right away. Emphasize functionality, hide the customization. The other thing to note was the very rigid format of the flashcards. Much of math is not memorization; rote learning is most appropriate for quick mental computation in the mathematics education setting.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
"My Math App" is a simple, easy-to-use application that does an effective job at sharpening the mind and building mental math skills.
