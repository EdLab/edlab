            If you have a problem in writing, the study below would help you motivate yourself. 

How much writing would you get done if you were told to abstain from writing, or to write only when you were inspired? Boice (1990) reported on a "writing intervention" with 27 faculty members. All faculty reported problems getting their writing finished yet all had perfectly manageable writing projects to complete. Boice assigned faculty to one of three conditions. Perhaps the most desired assignment was given to nine faculty who were told not to write for 10 weeks except "in case of emergency." Faculty in this "abstinence" group assumed that the 10 weeks away from writing would let them develop more, and more creative, ideas for their writing. Boice told a second group of nine to schedule 50 writing sessions over 10 weeks but to write only if they felt in the mood to write. (Another nice assignment, right?) These "spontaneous" writers also predicted they would experience more creative writing ideas. Boice told the remaining nine faculty to schedule 50 writing sessions over the 10 weeks. But, if they did not write at least three pages during each of these scheduled times, for a minimum total of 150 pages, a prewritten check signed by each would be sent to an organization they hated. (The Democrats? The Republicans? The NRA? Planned Parenthood?) Faculty in this "expensive contingency" group, clearly having drawn the short straw, predicted that they might be productive but definitely not creative. Know what happened? The group "forced" to write produced over three times as much as the spontaneous group and over 15 times as much as the abstinence group. By the faculty members' self-report, the third group, forced to write with an expensive contingency, had a "useful, novel idea" each writing day; the rate was half as often and a fifth as often for the other two groups, respectively. One faculty member, forced to write, said: "It really isn't what I thought it would be. I don't feel the pressure because I don't even think about it very often....It feels good to be so self-disciplined. What I really like, though, is how easy it is to start writing. No struggle. I look forward to it. I think about what I'm going to write during the day. Sometimes I'm tempted to start sooner. That sure doesn't sound like me" [laughs] (Boice, 1990, p. 81)
