          <p>
            I hear about <a href="http://www.wimba.com/" target="_blank">Wimba</a> a lot but today was the first time I tried it. Some of you may have explored this tool already but others may not have. I'm sharing what I learned today about Wimba in this blog for anyone who has yet to learn about it. 

The product I explored is called the Wimba Collaboration Suite, which includes a virtual learning environment (Wimba Classroom 6.0), an instant messaging system (Wimba Pronto 3.0), and a voice chat system (Wimba Voice 6.0). There is not any download link on their website so I guess in order to use this product you have to contact them.

Below is a screenshot of the user interface:

<a href="http://52mijing.net/download/wimba_participant.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://52mijing.net/download/wimba_participant.jpg" width="600"></a>

This user interface appears very familiar to me -- it looks very similar to the virtual course environment that the <a href="http://www.pacyber.org/" target="_blank">PA Cyber Charter School</a> people demonstrated in the EdLab seminar a few weeks ago. This makes me suspect the PA Cyber is using Wimba too.

As we can see in the Wimba student's UI, the main window consists of:

a) a view area where the instructor presents course materials. Any application (e.g. Excel, Word, Photoshop, etc) on the instructor's desktop can be shown in this area so that students can view together. The instructor can also write and draw on an electronic whiteboard integrated in Wimba in this area. The instructor's key inputs as well mouse activities are also captured in this area.

b) a control-bar under the view area consisting tools of: network status; voice switch to start/stop talking; volume control; video switch to start/stop videotaping; phone call option for people who have slow Internet connection but want to talk to the instructor; and media settings.

c) under the control-bar are the chat area and participants view. One can type public messages to the whole room or fire private messages to specific participants. There are buttons to do actions such as "answer yet to poll", "answer no to poll", "raise hand", and change status by choosing emoticons. One can also view the status of a specific participant or statistical summary of status of the whole room.

d) a separate window to show streaming video. Because I am in a demo, I don't know how how the video is controlled by the student or the instructor.

e) in the main window of the demo, there is also an area on the right which are actually bookmarks of the video. I can click one of the bookmarks and go to a specific time in the video. But this area is not present in the Wimba-Moodle course.

According to the Wimba team, the advantages of using Wimba include:

It is said Wimba can be natively integrated in some CMS such as Blackboard and Moodle. I explored <a href="http://www.wimba-moodle.com/" target="_blank">Wimba's example Moodle course site</a>. It seems you can directly launch the Wimba applications in a Moodle course with Moodel database support. We have our own Moodle system too so I think we can install Wimba in our Moodle and test it out. It can be a good tool to distribute a distance learning course.
