<p><i>"At Beespace, we have a distinct point of view about the start-up experienceâ€”that it should be the perfect alchemy of risk-taking and security, of innovation and sustainability."</i> (<a href="https://beespace.org/about">About Beespace</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The Philanthropic Investor</b></p>
 
<p>The business of venture capitalism is thriving in the US like never before as new technology and bright young minds mix to transform the service sector. Even universities like Stanford and NYU have thrown their hats in the ring, creating on-campus incubators. However, one organization is doing things a bit differently. <a href="https://beespace.org">Beespace</a> is charting new territory through their incubator program for social entrepreneurs and non-profit organizations. </p>
 
<p><b>Designing a Non-Profit Incubator</b></p>
 
<p>Founded in 2013, Beespace is currently working with their second cohort of five participants on projects ranging from global health to women in government. Participants go through a two-year development phase where they receive seed money, working space, operation support, access to interested donors, and lessons from experts on executive coaching. They are given time to develop and pilot their ideas to create model organizations that are self-sustaining. One of their alumni groups, Yoga Foster (founded in 2014), helps schools implement yoga inspired experiences into daily lessons. It currently serves around 115 schools with the mission of creating healthier and happier students. </p>
 
<p><b>Judging Success</b></p>
 
<p>Success for these types of organizations is judged through their ability to diversify funding, add paid staff positions, and experiment with new innovative ideas. Beespace <i>venture capitalists</i> are actually a community of philanthropists seeking to <i>#ProfitTheWorld</i>, not their own pockets. In the future, they are looking to partner with other organizations for support with long-term impact assessments, scaling, and collaboration. </p>
 
<p> For those who are weary of start-up education technology companies that need to have a profit motive, Beespace offers an alternative, so new organizations are not forced to take that route. This innovative incubation model opens doors for those who dream that their work will profit the world. </p>
