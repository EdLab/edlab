<p>Design-based learning has been gaining popularity in science education over the last few years as a way for students to engage more actively with scientific inquiry. In a recent study researchers examined the effects of design-based learning on the most neglected STEM subject: engineering.</p>
 
<p>For this study, researchers split fourth-grade students into two groups. Each tackled engineering problems using LEGO blocks with the same teacher, but where the control group received commonly used science pedagogy, the experimental group received an engineering design-based pedagogy. In addition to solving the same problems as the control group, the latter group was required to define the problem, sketch it out, and compare potential solutions on a design card before choosing the optimal design.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that in both groups, students’ science performance significantly improved using LEGO blocks. In addition, the students were more enthusiastic about using LEGO sets in class than traditional learning experiences. Despite this similarity, however, the experimental group showed a significant improvement in problem-solving abilities over the control group. Students in the engineering design-based group were better able to compare advantages and disadvantages between designs and identify optimal solutions.</p>
 
<p>Although this experiment was just conducted in one classroom, it’s likely that similar results would occur across different schools. Design-based education is intended to engage students more in the process of developing and testing their own products, and this particular engineering model gave students the means to more methodically dive into the scientific inquiry process. Using LEGO products in education is hard to beat in the first place, but perhaps teaming it up with engineering design-based pedagogy makes it even more exciting and effective.</p>
