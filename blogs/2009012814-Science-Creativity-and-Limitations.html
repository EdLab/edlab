          <p>
            I have been thinking about today's presentation, and I applaud Jeannie Crowley for her hard and earnest work.  It can't be easy trying to get children interested in science.  

I do wonder about the kinds of limits that science imposes on children and the way it may squelch creative thinking.  Why may this be the case?  Bear with me.  The original line of inquiry posed by Jeannie is: how is the magnitude of an earthquake related to the size of the tsunamis?  Using “scientific thinking,” you quickly start to apply principles of water displacement.  This would undoubtedly be considered the “right answer.”  However, I wonder what happens when a student tries to take it in a different direction, and how the principles of science (and the social context) may come crashing down on them.  

For example, the original question necessarily begs the question, what causes an earthquake?  There are also some scientific answers that helps answer this question (tectonic plates, etc.).  Then the question becomes, why are there tectonic plates?  A scientific answer can likely be found for this as well.  Soon you are getting into the realm of, why is there an earth and a ocean?  This start to get really murky at this point and starts to cross over into the realm of theology and very complicated science.  Easy answers start to disappear, the science gets a little murky, and people start talking about their “beliefs.”  

As an atheist, I necessary move away from the theological answers and would look to science.  However, this necessarily ends with discussions of the Big Bang, which is never quite satisfactory (because perhaps I simply cannot get past the point that there is nothing (time, space) before the big bang.  So what is my point?  I can imagine that the role of the Science teacher is to keep things nice and orderly: keeping the students focused on problems that are easily solvable and modeled.  However, I can imagine if anyone wanted to go beyond this, the teacher may have to steer the student away from looking at some of the bigger issues.  This could be easily aggravated by the “collaborative” setting that most educators try to create, because you certainly wouldn't want one student's beliefs (taught by parents, religious institutions, etc.) to intersect too much with other students, especially if there is a lot of divergence.  Which is to say, science in the classroom has potential to push aside the really interesting questions that may actually motivate students to be interested in science.  Without these big interesting questions, students are really missing out.  

I do think it is possible that the wonder and enchantment that is the thrust of the humanities may actually help students become better scientists than the science classroom itself.  Luckily, having students focus on readily solvable problems is great preparation for work in a country of business men and women!
