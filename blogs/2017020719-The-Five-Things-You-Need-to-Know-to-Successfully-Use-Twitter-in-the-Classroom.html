<p>Researchers assessed Twitter use in classrooms over the span of 10 years by reviewing more than 50 studies conducted during that time on the educational uses of this social media platform. After reviewing the data, here is how they suggest instructors should use Twitter to optimize students’ learning outcomes.</p>
 
<p><b>1. Make sure students are familiar with the platform before requiring it in class.</b>
<br>Not all students use Twitter; in fact, the authors of the study indicate that only about half of the students involved in this 10-year project had accounts on the social media platform prior to using it for class. Because of this, having technological training sessions on Twitter before using it in the classroom is vital to ensure that all students feel comfortable enough to participate.</p>
 
<p><b>2. Establish clear expectations for participation and create a class hashtag.</b>
<br>Instructors can use Twitter in many different ways in the classroom, including as a platform for class administration, homework reminders, student interaction and communication, and course assessment. Because there are so many different uses, it’s important for instructors to establish clear expectations for Twitter use at the beginning of the class so that students are less likely to become distracted. The researchers also suggest creating a class hashtag that students use in every post. This makes it easier for both students and instructor to keep course material organized.</p>

<p><b>3. Consider making Twitter mandatory or grading for tweet quality.</b>
<br>The researchers found that when instructors made tweeting mandatory, students expressed fewer negative reactions and complaints. In addition, students were more likely to participate frequently when using Twitter was mandatory than when it was optional. The researchers also found that when instructors occasionally graded Tweets, the overall quality of online interactions was better.</p>

<p><b>4. Give regular academic and personal support directly on the platform.</b>
<br>Twitter tends to be a platform on which students feel comfortable sharing their personal difficulties or levels of stress. When instructors respond to these tweets, either by recommending school services or offering encouragement, student engagement and grades are higher than when instructors don’t respond. This step can be time consuming, but responding to students’ tweets in a timely manner increases overall course participation and quality. The researchers recommend that for large college classes, instructors create a few different Twitter communities led by TAs so that each group can be a bit more intimate.</p>

<p><b>5. Create broader learning communities by reaching out to other classes.</b>
<br>The researchers recommend creating a broader virtual learning community on Twitter by combining multiple classrooms under the same hashtag. These classrooms should be studying the same subject, but they can be from different institutions. This could give the students different insight into the subject material through new social interactions.</p>
