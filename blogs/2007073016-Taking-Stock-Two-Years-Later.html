            In <i>When the Levees Broke</i>, Wynton Marsalis speaks of Katrina as a “signature moment,” a critical juncture in our history when we will finally be forced to come to terms with who we are as a nation. Indeed, Spike Lee seems to end his film on the cautiously optimistic note that the final word on the entire episode has not yet been written. 

As the second anniversary of the broken levees approaches, you can be sure there will be enormous media attention on where New Orleans now stands in its recovery.  Tracking the rebuilding and recovery as it unfolds is a critical part of the <a href="http://www.teachingthelevees.org">Teaching the Levees</a> curriculum (see Lesson 3 of the college curriculum, “Should New Orleans Be Rebuilt as a ‘Chocolate City'?”, and Lessons 1 and 3 of the geography curriculum, “Land Use Patterns and the Future: To Rebuild or Not to Rebuild?”, and “'I Want to Go Home!' Refugees in the United States?”).

Fortunately, for those who are interested, the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu">Brookings Institution</a> has been doing a remarkable job of tracking the Katrina recovery. In collaboration with the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center, Brookings has been issuing detailed monthly reports on New Orleans and the surrounding areas, tracking 40 different socioeconomic indicators — everything from the unemployment rate to the number of building permits issued and the number of buses up and running.
  
Not surprisingly, according to the <a href="http://gnocdc.org/KI/KatrinaIndex.pdf">most recent report</a> issued at the end of June, New Orleans still has a long uphill climb.  Some of the news is good, but most is, well, sobering.  (For those who don't have time for the full 60-page report, a brief <a href="http://www.gnocdc.org/KI/ESKatrinaIndex.pdf">summary</a> is also available.)

First, the “good” news:

--The population of Orleans parish is now approaching two-thirds of its pre-Katrina level, at least according to mail deliveries, after being cut by more than half in the months immediately after the storm.

--The tourism industry has bounced back: 131 of 142 major hotels (92%) have now re-opened. 

--The Road Home program had closed on almost 25,000 applications by early June, offering an average benefit to homeowners of about $75,000.

--Unemployment in the city and surrounding area is below the national average of 4.5%.

At the same time, however:

--There are still more than 51,000 FEMA trailers in use throughout Louisiana (down from a high of 73,000 a year ago).

--Skyrocketing rents have made it difficult for working-class people to find homes:  the average one-bedroom apartment, which cost $418 a month in 2000, now runs $836.

--Fewer than half the city's bus routes have been restored, and only 17% of buses are operational.  There were an estimated 124,000 bus riders before Katrina, but fewer than 20,000 now. 
 
--Only one-third of child-care centers in New Orleans have re-opened.

--By the end of the 2006-07 school year, only 58 of 128 public schools had re-opened.

--Only half the hospitals in New Orleans have re-opened (12 of 23), and many of them are not operating at the same level as pre-Katrina.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/us/24orleans.html?_r=1&ref=nationalspecial&oref=slogin">The New York Times</a> recently gave a chilling overview of the detrimental effect of the closed hospitals not only on health care in New Orleans but on the city's overall economic recovery.

There is, of course, important information unavailable in the Brookings reports:  for example, there is no indication of how the racial makeup of New Orleans today compares with that of pre-Katrina days, nor, for that matter, what percentage of city residents are living below the poverty level. 
 
But as is usually the case with statistics, a few things can be read between the lines.  Hotels may have re-opened and New Orleans may be filled with tourists, but with so few public buses running, so few day care centers open and rents doubling, it isn't hard to take an educated guess about which third of the population hasn't yet returned to New Orleans.  

We'll be following these trends as the Brookings Institution continues releasing its monthly reports. It is probably still too soon to say what the final signature on Katrina will look like, but these reports provide an invaluable tool for helping us watch it come more and more into focus.
