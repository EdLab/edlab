          <p>
            Just in case you were sleeping well, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2073611,00.asp">new evidence of underground markets for computer exploits</a> are cropping up.  Zero-day exploits (traditionally referring to exploits which arise the same day a vulnerability is detected, though now often used to describe tools which exploit <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196604313">unaddressed vulnerabilities</a>), are being sold for tens of thousands of dollars.  Even worse: your credit card  with a valid PIN only costs $500, though the program to get it on your own costs ten times as much.

As always, the conversation centers around Microsoft products.  But don't forget the <a href="http://www.bitsofnews.com/content/view/4435/44/">recent reports</a> of Mac vulnerabilities most of which were discovered by Secunia, the independent company which <a href="http://www.techworld.com/security/news/index.cfm?newsid=1798">warned us in 2004</a> that all of this was coming.

I'll omit any links but point out that many folks in the field suggests Macs are only "more secure" because they're less used and thus less beneficial to hack.  (Case in point: in the underground markets discussed above, price of exploit is a function of the popularity of product exploited.)  So how to stay secure?  The simple rules still apply: don't open unknown files; don't install programs you haven't verified; and don't give your personal information out to companies unless you really really have to - seriously.

An interesting lesson to be learned is that safety is in numbers: the less used an operating system is, the safer it is.  The real value of Linux can be seen here.  With so many flavors of Linux and so many builds of each flavor, it's just not economical to exploit.  

But don't make the mistake of using less popular software for this reason.  The less popular the software, the more likely it is that the software has less investment and has been tested less; and the more likely it is that the software is vulnerable to common, generic exploits.  In short, be careful and be aware of your own knowledge limitations.  After all, if you don't know how to cook, you likely wouldn't make chicken for fear of salmonella (which a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=salmonella">Google search of</a> reveals their new "refine" functionality).

But most importantly, don't let Mac users tell you that their computers are secure! :)
