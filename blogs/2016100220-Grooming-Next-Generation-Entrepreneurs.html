<p>For years, entrepreneurship education has focused on things considered essential for launching a successful enterprise: business plans, pitching to investors, and building a team, among others. With advances in technology and changes in consumer behavior, entrepreneurs, more than ever, have to think differently and conjure up new ways to build enterprises. An interesting and innovative approach by entrepreneur Steve Blank's class at Stanford’s School of Engineering is changing the way entrepreneurs are trained to meet today’s market demands.</p>
 
<p>Blank is renowned for his "Lean Launchpad" approach. A key feature of the Lean Launchpad is having students come up with an assumption about a product or enterprise that is needed in the market. Students are then encouraged to rapidly test the assumption about the industry on as many users as possible. This paves the way for entrepreneurs to make necessary adjustments to the product before launch. The overall goal of this approach is for aspiring entrepreneurs to reduce the high costs associated with launching a product.</p>
 
<p>Is the Lean Launchpad approach the solution to starting a viable enterprise in today’s entrepreneurship driven market? What are the pros and cons of this approach? Join the discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30959/">Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
 <p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:20 Victoria 57251:</b> I do think that life experience and perspective plays a big role on the desire to be an entrepreneur, both of my parents had their own businesses and never had to request days off so I faced a bit of a shock when I ended up in a polar opposite environment and still am inclined to the freedom of self employment

<p><b>@02:42 RuthS:</b> This program places just as much importance on learning outside the classroom as it does on learning inside the classroom, which probably changes how these students approach their classes and connect them to their daily lives.
