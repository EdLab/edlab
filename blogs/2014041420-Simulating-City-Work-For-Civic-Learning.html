How can we prepare youth to be effective citizens for the 21st century? From the perspective of experiential learning, the more we provide young people with civic-oriented hands-on activities such as voting, student government, and community services, the more we help them to become competent citizens. But how about becoming a mayor, running a city and addressing tough social issues and dilemmas from that position? It doesn't seem likely that we can offer such hands-on activities in the real world. Fortunately, simulations provide a great alternative to such valuable learning experiences. <p>
 
Simulations have gained renewed attention as an effective approach to civic learning with advances in gaming technologies. Popular commercial games such as Civilization and SimCity have been recognized for their potential for civic learning. SimCityEDU, developed by <a href="http://www.instituteofplay.org/work/projects/glasslab/">Glasslab</a>
(a collaboration among commercial, learning, and assessment experts including Pearson, the Institute of Play, and ETS), incorporates real world problems and embedded assessments into the game system. More than 3,000 different data points are collected to help educators evaluate students' understanding of systems thinking. These innovations turn the video game into a comprehensive learning and assessment tool. <p>

This video showcases some middle school students' learning experiences with SimCityEDU. Take a look at how it works and share your views on the potential and limitations of simulation games for civic education <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13314"> on Vialogues.</a><p>

<b>@00:30 johnlee:</b> Ms. Amy had 100% attention from her students as she beta-tested SimCityEDU in her classes and she observed that every kid wanted to use the mouse and help solve missions. This high engagement level is the most important asset of SimCityEDU for learning! <p>

<b>@00:59 Clark:</b> I wonder if partner work is a by-product of not having enough computers, or if there is a deeper goal? To learn teamwork, maybe? It takes a village to raise a city! <p>

<b>@01:32 johnlee:</b> "At our age it is usually the teachers, or parents or principals that are in charge. So finally being able to be in charge of this (world) it's kind of cool!" <p>
