            The New York Times had two articles on colleges falsifying their data to achieve a higher college ranking. Both articles are mostly about Claremont McKenna, an elite liberal arts college in California. Claremont McKenna is usually one of the highest ranking liberal arts colleges although when we consider their manipulation of data such as SAT scores, which is discussed further in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/education/claremont-mckenna-college-says-it-exaggerated-sat-figures.html?ref=education">article,</a> one might begin to question their "elite" status.

Claremont McKenna was just the highest ranking college to admit to misreporting, there are other colleges that did the same. Baylor University had some interesting ways of cheating the ranking system including delaying the test scores of low-scoring students until January to exclude them from the averages. Baylor also offered to pay admitted students to retake the SAT, so they can hopefully increase their score. These are some pretty creative ways to climb the college rankings, this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/education/gaming-the-college-rankings.html?pagewanted=2&ref=education">article</a> discusses how many other schools are fudging the numbers as well. The aforementioned incidents seems to be running rampant, is there a way to just get rid of this ranking system? The college rankings list is looking more like a contest where the winner is the college on who can manipulate their data the best.
