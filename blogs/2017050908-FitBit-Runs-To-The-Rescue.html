          <p>
            <p>I’ve always had a keen interest in criminal justice, especially the methods detectives use to resolve crimes. I came upon an <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/us/fitbit-womans-death-investigation-trnd/" target="_blank">interesting story</a> in which detectives used a now common device to resolve a murder case. The story revolves around a husband who claims a masked gunman entered his house, tied him up and shot his wife. He somehow managed to burn the gunman with a torch. However, detectives argue that his wife’s FitBit tells an entirely different story. Her FitBit was still taking steps well after the time her husband claimed they were attacked. The stored data on FitBit turned out to be the crucial evidence as detectives ultimately decided the husband was responsible for his wife’s murder.<br /><br />I own a FitBit and enjoy all its features. My favorite feature is when it tracks my sleep. From personal experience, there have been times where my watch hasn’t been completely accurate. We can all agree that technology, no matter how great it is, is sometimes buggy and inaccurate. This makes me question how strong detectives believe the data they retrieved from the wife’s FitBit. There are times where my Fitbit claims I’ve reached my fitness goals or shows that I went to sleep at an earlier or later time than I actually did. It does the same with my wake up time.<br /><br />Do you own a FitBit? How accurate is it? Can gadgets like FitBit and Apple Watch become part of the tools detectives use to solve crimes?<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
