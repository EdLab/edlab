<p><i>"Our mission is to launch young people on career and education pathways by engaging them in work-based learning opportunities, creative expression, professional development, and health and academic support."</i> (<a href="https://youthradio.org/about/">About Youth Radio</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Honing Media Skills</b></p>

<p>With podcasts on the rise, media journalism has never been more popular among youth, though few have the resources to make their own media content. The mission of <a href="https://youthradio.org">Youth Radio</a>, is to train diverse youth in digital media and technology and give them the resources to create and publish their own content. Young people can sign up for either the class track or the workforce track and specialize in journalism, music, or multimedia.</p>

<p>Each of these different specializations creates content for a live weekly radio show. Young people work together to produce stories, critiques, and reviews that matter to people their age. Some recent articles and podcasts include "What High School Doesnâ€™t Teach" and "How Can We Protect Youth from Homelessness?" At Youth Radio, teens and young adults hone their digital journalism skills in a professional way. The stories they create are syndicated to 15 different outlets around the country and are available online.</p>

<p><b>Giving Young People a Voice</b></p>
 
<p> Youth Radio was founded in the Bay Area in 1992, a tumultuous and violent time, to give young people an alternative outlet to process their experiences by entering into media dialogue. Even though times are less dangerous today, the organization continues to serve over 400 youth a year and creates hundreds of jobs and internships for low-income teens and young adults. Although the headquarters are in Oakland, the organization has branches in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, DC.</p>
 
<p><b>Resources for Learning</b></p>

<p>Youth Radio not only hosts educational courses, but also provides storytelling resources in digital media and journalism for teachers across the country. After listening to Youth Radio productions, classes can use the available toolkit to make their own podcasts and articles. A big idea may grow even bigger.</p>
