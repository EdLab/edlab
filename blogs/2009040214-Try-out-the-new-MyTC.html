            Although the EdLab is not an an offical test group for the new TC Portal, if you are interested in trying it out, you can at:

<a href="http://my.tc.edu">http://my.tc.edu</a>

If you have any feedback, you can send it to <a href="mailto:mytc@tc.edu">mytc@tc.edu</a> or send it to me and I can deliver the feedback.

The overarching goal of the portal (if I can get it straight) is to provide all online services to students, faculty, and staff in one place using the standard <a href="http://uni.columbia.edu">UNI login</a>.  Up to this point, there have been competing login systems for doing different things, such as using your UNI for ClassWeb but your T-Number (or SSN) to do administrative activities (registering for classes, doing leave reporting, etc.).  The portal should allow you to login and do both, and jump to other services without having to login again (also known as the elusive Single-Signon).  For example, you can login to the portal and download e-reserve readings or book a study room in the library without having to login again (should everything work correctly).  

The portal will most likely be the place that people are directed to next Fall for doing things like accessing their ClassWeb courses.  Of course, there are plenty of things that could prevent this from happening, such as reliability or stability issues that could come up during the testing phase.    

There are really alot of new things that I think could be there.  I have been trying to get the AfterEd player on the "Community" tab but I think I lost that one.  This is one problem with a pre-Web 2.0 way of conceptualizing technology in higher education, which is more like a process sifting through organizational channels only to be denied rather than just doing something and seeing what sticks.
