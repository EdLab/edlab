            When Netflix's streaming service was first introduced to its users, it was a nice perk to having a Netflix account, but nothing more. Now it has gotten to be something that's... well... good. Very good. So good, in fact, that Netflix recently announced a pricing scheme for Netflix: namely, if you want both snail mail dvd rentals and streaming, you will have to fork out a lot of money. It used to be that if you had the streaming plan, you only had to add 2 dollars to the original 7.99 to enjoy the best of both worlds. Now, it's 7.99 EXTRA to add on snail-mail dvd rentals and even more for two-dvd rentals.

The lashback from the online community regarding this decision was enormous. People were saying rather mean things about Netflix that raised the prices, in the end, only by 5 or 6 dollars. I mean, if you like it, you don't keep it, but if you don't like it, then you get rid of it. Right?

That's the thing about social networking. Disgruntled people rage on twitter and other social media spaces and as a result, people that really didn't think much of it at first start raging with them. (continued)

If we want to pursue a pricing scheme for any of EdLab's products later, we must be careful of such repercussions, especially if we were to have a solid user base. At the same time, if we have too little users when we enact a pricing scheme, then the user base will never grow. It's a little bit of a catch-22.

I think making money just got a lot harder.
