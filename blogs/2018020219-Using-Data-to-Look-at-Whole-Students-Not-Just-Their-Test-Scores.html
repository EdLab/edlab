<p><i>"Weâ€™re on a mission to improve student outcomes by helping schools and districts act on data." </i> (<a href="https://www.panoramaed.com/about">About Panorama Education</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Looking at the Whole Child and School</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.buildingbeats.org/">Panorama Education</a> realizes the importance of collecting data on more than just grades and test scores. The organization enables teachers and schools to measure data in four key areas: school climate, student voice (including academic, attendance, and behavior data), teachers and staff engagement, and family and community engagement.</p>
 
<p>Panorama is dedicated to collecting data on the whole child, as well as on the whole school, and has created a series of resources to collect data on social-emotional issues that are generally difficult to measure, such as levels of grit, growth mindset, and sense of belonging. Looking at these levels in addition to student scores and grades could help teachers better understand the needs of their students, whether individually or as a group. In addition, Panorama utilizes surveys to measure teacher engagement and family involvement, realizing that these factors are indispensable to school climate.</p>

<p><b>Platforms and Resources</b></p>
 
<p>Panorama advises schools on using data-driven research and offers an online platform that manages collected data, making it easy for teachers and schools to process. So far, Panorama has worked with more than 5 million students in 6,500 schools across 40 states and 15 countries. The organization also provides open access resources that teachers and school administrators can easily use in their own classrooms and schools. These resources include pre-made surveys, whiteboard videos on the benefits of data-driven research, case studies, and webinars. By educating others on why and how to use data, Panorama Education aims to improve schools and make education better for 21st century students. </p>
