<p>At a time of rapid social and political change in the Middle East and North Africa, women’s rights remain a prominent and contentious issue. Despite recent advances for women in countries such as Saudi Arabia (e.g., voting rights and running for political office), there is still widespread cultural resistance to the advancement of girls and women, especially in education. The Maadi STEM School in Egypt is fighting hard to change that.</p>

<p>Located on the outskirts of Cairo, Maadi is a competitive all girls boarding school with a strong emphasis on science and technology subjects. Many of the students stress that their families were apprehensive about allowing them to enroll and live at the school. Societal norms often mean that girls leave the house only when they are married; however, through sheer determination and persistence, the female students in this video gained admission to Maadi and are thriving in their studies.</p>

 <p>How sustainable is this model in this region? Can the Maadi model be replicated in other parts of the world where there is a cultural resistance to girls’ education? Join the conversation on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30057/">Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:31 Sanda.amani:</b>Gender inequality takes place in many different forms. Allowing female scholars to pursue their dreams in a patriarchal society will eventually break the norm of not allowing women to pursue their dreams.</p>

<p><b>@01:06 saraehardman:</b>The interviews in this video show how difficult it is for so many girls around the world to convince their family and society that they should be educated, and that they are capable of holding tech and engineering jobs. Hopefully schools like this one can make it a little bit easier for girls in countries like Egypt to get the education they deserve.</p>
