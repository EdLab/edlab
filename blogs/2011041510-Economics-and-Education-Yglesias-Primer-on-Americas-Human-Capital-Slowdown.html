            Matt Yglesias has an excellent primer on <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/04/americas-human-capital-slowdown/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+matthewyglesias+%28Matthew+Yglesias%29">America's human capital slowdown</a>

Throughout America's history, there has been a strong trend towards greater human capital investment and America has typically lead in educating its citizens. Yet there has been an obvious slowdown in recent years. The cost of college tuition is only increasing while low-cost for-profit alternatives are riddled with problems. Yglesias points out 4 areas where we could be doing more on education and human capital investment but are not:

1.) Investing in high-quality pre-K education

2.) Attracting skilled migrants

3.) Developing effective job training programs

4.) Better housing policy that leads to less stratification along income lines.

1 & 2 seem like quick fixes honestly. The literature shows how valuable preschool really is; preschool is where the achievement discrepancies begin. On the other hand, it seems like a no-brainer that we ought to attract more skilled workers, regardless of their place of birth.

Where I think Yglesias misses a greater point is on the limits to human capital attainment. Anyone who has studied a little bit on exogenous and endogenous growth theories would be well aware of the differences between human and physical capital. Human capital obviously takes time to acquire and only lasts as long as the person who owns it lives. If we all aimed for 5 PhDs but allotted no time to put those PhDs to productive use, then all of that human capital investment would be for nought.

Going forward, we need to think about how to accelerate human capital acquisition. I think this can be partially achieved through creating more direct pre-professional paths. Undergraduate education inefficiently delivers human capital to young minds in most disciplines (with some notable exceptions in engineering and the hard sciences). But even beyond this one point I grandstand on, we need to start thinking about how to deliver primary and secondary education in less time without sacrificing quality.
