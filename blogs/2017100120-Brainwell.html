<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brainwell-brain-training-games/id909118393?mt=8">Brainwell</a> is a brain training game app. The activities and puzzles focus on six key areas: testing memory, attention, critical thinking, language, visual, and problem solving. The service costs around $9.99 per month, depending on the package. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The app customizes training through a short introductory survey for mental areas that you want to improve, and through a short brain "fitness" test. You can choose various games that focus on improving the key mental areas provided, and the app tracks your progress. The little games and puzzles entertain through fun, timed challenges. After you complete each activity, you can also compare your scores to the world average or to users in various age groups. I enjoyed seeing where I ranked after each game. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>In general, Brainwell’s little games can get boring rather quickly. After a few times playing, I cannot really see myself continuing with this so-called mental workout. Despite being advertised as "exercise" for your brain, these kinds of apps have been under fire for making <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3904/why-we-should-be-skeptical-of-brain-training"> unproven claims</a> of improved mental capacity. Brainwell does not avoid making similar claims. The app actually cites research that supposedly shows the science behind each game design. This is misleading, because the research provided is only tangentially connected to the tasks, and the findings do not support claims of mental improvement through these specific games.</p> 

<p>Additionally, I could only do the very basic version of this app with the few games available in the introduction. The makers claim to have a week-long free trial version, but when I tried to download the "free" trial, I found it actually charges your account $9.99. Other users on iTunes also complain about this same deceit. Deceptive practices from the creators make me wary of using this app. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> The brain training game genre has been heavily criticized. Still, some people might enjoy these types of mini puzzles or challenges. Brainwell’s offerings are probably similar to other peer apps on the market, but with the addition of deceptive practices, I cannot recommend this particular app. Even if you know that brain games are not really making you smarter and you just enjoy playing for fun, this app is still one you should avoid. </p>
