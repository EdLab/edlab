<p><i>"Nomster Chef wants to raise a healthier generation of kids and a happier generation of parents by teaching kids to cook"</i> (<a href="http://www.nomsterchef.com/">About Nomster Chef</a>). </p>
 
<p><b>The Recipe for Nomster</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nomsterchef.com/">Nomster Chef</a> was originally conceived by founder Ashley Moulton as her Masters thesis project at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Education. After graduation, her project received seed funding for development as part of the Education Design Studio incubator at the University of Pennsylvania. Her platform is based on the simple idea that when kids are more involved in the cooking process they are more likely to try new foods, learn skills, and develop lifelong healthy eating habits. </p>

<p><b>Learning in the Kitchen </b></p>
 
<p>Nomster Chef targets parents and children by formatting content for both user groups. The Nomster platform brings kids and parents together to make meal prep a family affair. First parents select a recipe from the Nomster website, they then receive text messages with information about how they can help their kids form healthy eating habits. Next kids can watch a video to help them learn about the food they will be helping to cook, and finally children can cook alongside their parents by using the child-friendly app to follow the recipe. Nomster lists some of the skills children may be learning as they cook such as reading, motor skills, and math skills.</p>
 
<p><b>Developing healthy eating habits </b></p>
 
<p>The platform aims to change how parents teach young children about healthy eating habits by involving young kids in cooking. Many families struggle to provide healthy home-cooked meals that can be made quickly while appeasing picky eaters. Nomster Chef’s website cites research that when children are involved in the cooking process they are more likely to try new foods. Additionally, the team behind Nomster found that children develop lifelong eating habits between the ages of 2 and 5. While Nomster doesn’t provide a solution for the time-consuming cooking process, it positions cooking as a bonding activity that both parents and children can participate in. To help make cooking fun for the whole family, Nomster provides various content pieces that breakdown nutritional and recipe information for both kids and parents.</p>
