<p>Digital platforms are gaining popularity among teachers as a tool for writing instruction. As online writing tools are more readily integrated into classrooms, researchers have noted the importance of determining best teaching practices for digital writing. A recent study in New Zealand examined what practices the most effective teachers adopted when teaching writing using a digital platform in low-income schools serving mainly students of color.</p>
 
<p>The study was conducted through a partnership between researchers and a group of urban schools serving mainly low-income, culturally diverse students. The schools all had digital pedagogy initiatives that gave each student a device and access to wireless internet. Researchers examined the practices of six of the most effective teachers from these schools in order to pinpoint what works best in digital writing instruction and encourage these practices among other teachers and schools.</p>
 
<p>Researchers found that the most effective teachers created supportive environments and facilitated a range of writing activities and discussions focused on critical thinking skills. There were several practices in particular that were highlighted. First, effective teachers were much more likely to encourage students to create digital learning objects (DLOs) to post on their personal blogs in addition to traditional articles. The DLOs incorporated multimedia, such as audio or visual effects, in addition to text. Second, effective teachers facilitated more open-ended activities rather than constrained worksheets or learning games. Finally, effective teachers created ample time in class for extended writing activities.</p>
 
<p>Effective teachers also fostered a community of writers among their students in various ways, including via feedback and co-authorship. Particularly with the latter, students who worked with others had more practice discussing their ideas and developing flexibility with their writing. Another effective strategy was for teachers to devote a good amount of their writing instruction time to discussions that exercised students’ critical thinking skills.</p>
 
<p>These best teaching practices enhance student learning when digital tools are used for writing instruction. It basically boils down to allowing students opportunities for more creativity, discussion, and critical thinking as opposed to focusing on constrained worksheets or other activities. This study could provide a helpful template for any teacher hoping to amp up their writing instruction with digital tools.</p>
