<p><b>Title:</b> Teachers’ Perceptions, Beliefs and Concerns about Cyberbullying (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sigal Eden, Tali Heinman, & Dorit Olenik-Shemesh</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8535">British Journal of Educational Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What do teachers think about cyberbullying? Does a teacher’s professional background influence their perception of cyberbullying?</p>
<p><b>Study Design:</b> The authors distributed questionnaires to a diverse group of 328 teachers in the central Israel area. The teachers were randomly recruited from 50 out of 700 local schools. The content of the questionnaire included teachers’ demographic data, their perceptions of cyberbullying in a global sense, and their personal experiences in relation to cyberbullying. In addition, the questionnaire gathered data on teachers’ concern about cyberbullying, teachers’ confidence in managing cyberbullying, teachers’ belief in school commitment in dealing with cyberbullying, and teachers’ belief in the importance of learning about cyberbullying.</p>
<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors discovered that most teachers were concerned about the increasingly common incidence of cyberbullying in schools, and there was a low level of coping confidence found among teachers. In addition, about half of the teachers reported that their students complained of cyberbullying and some teachers were themselves cyberbullied. In regard to professional background, the findings suggest that the teachers’ educational level and the age of students they taught affected their level of concern and how credible they found the school’s commitment to act on it. For example, the teachers in elementary school were more concerned about cyberbullying than the teachers teaching higher grades, and they had more confidence in managing it and had more belief in the importance of learning about cyberbullying; special education teachers were more concerned than mainstream teachers and they were more likely to believe that cyberbullying must be confronted.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The contemporary internet era has generated an educational dilemma—on one hand, students are encouraged to utilize digital technologies and the internet to express their own voices and develop their creativity and participatory culture online; on the other hand, the risks posed on the internet become a seemingly unmanageable concern for schools and parents who try to limit children’s access to cyberspace. The findings of the study suggest that as cyberbullying often takes place inside schools, schools and higher education institutions need to engage teachers who deal with many forms of adolescent aggression. Thus, there is an urgent need for teacher education programs to provide teachers with appropriate prevention and intervention strategies for cyberbullying. Further, there is a need for educational systems to develop better monitoring and reporting systems for cyberbullying, for the purposes of data collection and for providing assistance in online teaching and learning.</p>
