<p><a href="http://www.wikitude.com/">Wikitude</a> is an augmented reality app and software development kit (SDK) built by Wikitude GmbH, a company that <a href="http://www.wikitude.com/about/">describes itself</a> as "the leading mobile augmented reality (AR) technology provider for smartphones, tablets, and digital eyewear." The Wikitude site contains a list of industry partners including LG, Blackberry, and Adobe that have used thir SDK, which provides the building blocks for programmers to create AR applications. For software developers, it is simply a matter of putting the pieces together to create memorable user experiences. While the demo app can be downloaded for free to explore the toolkit, the SDK has several different pricing options.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The Wikitude SDK provides a set of AR features for experienced developers to leverage when building apps. Wikitude could be used to bring static scenes or images to life by providing an additional layer of contextual information. AR requires users to take the time to open an app and view their surroundings through a device, so it tends to work best when users have ample time to explore a novel experience. Given that much of the value of AR lies in its seamless integration within a particular setting, developers would need to create apps that take advantage of the Wikitude toolset to integrate AR in a meaningful way. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Wikitude provides a toolset that requires software development experience to use and is not intended for the average person. However, the Wikitude demo app does not do a great job at showcasing these features and does not provide much information when it is first opened. For example, while an augmented map view of nearby places showcases the geolocation feature of Wikitude, it isn’t particularly useful. Also, the demo app requires both location services and the camera to be enabled in order to run the app, which could be a deterrent for users who don’t want to edit their privacy settings. </p>
 
<p>The trickiest part about AR-based apps is that they require a device to be used to filter an experience. AR works well when space and time allow for a user to explore the information provided by viewing a scene through an app. While the Wikitude website demos show information being overlaid on a webpage or magazine image, this same information could more or less be communicated within those mediums. A promotional video on the company’s website displays the technology being used outdoors, which is a potentially more useful application of AR technology.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While the Wikitude app itself is not necessarily all that impressive, the SDK could open doors for developers to create applications that leverage AR in interesting ways. The features provided by the SDK are quite robust and could allow for more intentional future applications of AR. </p>
