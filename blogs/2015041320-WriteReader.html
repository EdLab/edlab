<p><a href="http://writereader.com/about/">WriteReader</a> helps children ages 3-10 learn reading and writing skills alone or through collaboration with parents or teachers via digital books. Users can create, design, and publish digital books. Children can create the title page by typing out the title and can choose the cover image and color palette. Within the book, each page has a place for inserting images, a space for the child to write, and a space for the adult to write. WriteReader can read the adult text aloud so the child can hear how to pronounce the words while looking at the correct spelling. As the user (both child and adult) types out words, the app provides an audio pronunciation of each letter.</p>

<p>Once a book is created and saved it can be opened in other ebook apps, downloaded and printed, or added to WriteReader’s Global Library. The Global Library allows users to view and read other digital book creations. Adults can download, email, post to Facebook, Tweet, and upload to Google+ their child's and other children’s digital books (there is a math equation that must be answered to proceed). A <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/write-to-read/id590707197?mt=8">full version of WriteReader</a> can be purchased for $4.99 which allows users to create an unlimited number of books with unlimited pages and share endlessly.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<p>This app caters to the audio-visual learning of reading and writing. While having many children in one room typing may become annoying, having each letter paired with a sound allows the child to pair the verbal and the visual at an early stage of their writing career. The keyboard is outlined in multiple colors; vowels are outlined in red, consonants in blue, and punctuation in gray. The visual color-coding of the keyboard is another way to teach children how to write in this digital age. WriteReader does not provide autocorrect in spelling or punctuation so there is no choice but to learn!</p>

<p>The user has creative power over the design and contents of the digital book, which can play a major role in motivation for writing the book, resulting in reading and writing skills. WriteReader is very hands on. A child can use the app alone, but having an adult involved in the process will create a relationship between the adult, either parent or teacher, and child.</p>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<p>WriteReader does not provide a central space for one adult to access multiple, designated books, which can make it difficult for a teacher to manage in a classroom. Limited access to tablets may also act as an obstacle for WriteReader to reach its potential in a classroom.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>WriteReader makes learning to read and write appealing visually and aurally. This is a hands on app, allowing a teacher or parent to be involved in the learning process while creating a relationship with the child. Giving the user creative control over the layout, images, color scheme, and content will increase the drive to create, and ultimately lead to learning how to write and read.</p>
