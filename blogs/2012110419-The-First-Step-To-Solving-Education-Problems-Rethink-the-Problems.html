<b>@00:34 bhughes:</b> "unbundling." ah, yet another neologism for analysis...
<p>
<b>@2:29 Katezvdp:</b> Energy & enthusiasm is contagious! Pair it with wonder, openness and realistic problem-solving & you have a recipe for potential school reform success!

Based in New Orleans, <a href="http://4pt0.org/">4.0 schools</a> is "a community of curious people committed to solving the toughest problems in education." Its community of problem solvers is wide and varied: educators mix with technicians, designers, engineers, and business leaders to come up with creative solutions to education’s most plaguing problems. 4.0 schools goes beyond imagining a new educational landscape, though; thought leaders are encouraged to put their ideas to paper and develop working prototypes that can be placed in front of a key audience (i.e., teachers, school administrators, and/or students). <p>

4.0 schools aims to equip leaders with a new mindset, a new way of thinking about problems. They attempt to do so through a series of classes they call "essentials." Essentials teach 3 primary skills: empathy, unbundling, and prototyping. The more ambitious of the bunch might be interested in their fellowship program, a 4-week-long program intended for people who have developed an idea and are looking to launch it. <p>

Combining entrepreneurship and education is a clever way to encourage creative problem solving within an industry that can certainly use more outside-the-box thinking.  Curiosity is the driving force behind the world’s most significant innovations. It is this motivation that the team behind 4.0 schools attempts to instill in its students.<p>
