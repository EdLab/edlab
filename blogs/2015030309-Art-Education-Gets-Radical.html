Art ed is not taking up surfing, instead, the field was recently rocked by a future-focused, avant-garde conference held February 20-21st at the Armory as a precursor to the current <a href="http://www.thearmoryshow.com/">NYC Armory Show hosted by MoMA</a>. <a href="http://www.art21.org/creativechemistries/">Conference organizers</a> described the goal and focus of the show as: 
<blockquote>
Inspired by the artists featured in ART21 films and the educators involved in the ART21 Educators program, this event includes a series of exchanges, dialogues, and experiments between artists and educators that explore how we might shift the paradigm of education in and through visual art to better reflect contemporary artistic practices, motivations, and curiosities.
</blockquote> 

Upon exploring <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/186876/teachable-moments-from-a-conference-on-art-and-education/">this recap of the conference from Hyperallergic.com</a> I was struck by how similar the conference was to EdLab's own process of hosting "un-conferences" and design events with various stakeholders from across the college and beyond. Even the quality of the documentation and lighting of the event reminded me of the thoughtful design of our learning theaters and all-day workshops. 

It is interesting that this is more a hands-on conference of ideas and prototyping with less focus on highlighting new technologies. It does seem that the fine arts, while aligned with digital technologies, are still less about "edtech" and more focused on ground-breaking ideas, breaking new thought boundaries and providing fresh avenues for working contemporary artists to interface and influence pedagogy and learner experience. I wonder if the oft-used acronym, "STEAM" was even mentioned? It seems that the art world may be a bastion of hands-on, project based learning that is blissfully oblivious to the contracts and constraints of big edtech business. 

<b>EdLab Takeaways:</b>
One key takeaway from conference coverage may be that the opportunity to create on the spot performance art pieces could have a place in a future design event? Or, take place in the learning theater? I imagine this conference being right at home on the future 4th floor and would argue that these kinds of radical pairings of on-the-spot creation with critical thought experimentation would lend itself well to our open-ended, innovative new space. What are your thoughts? Would you want to attend this conference? Why or why not?
