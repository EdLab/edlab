<p>David Blake is the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href="https://degreed.com/">Degreed</a>, a platform that allows individuals and organizations to discover the world's best learning resources and track their learning experience. Prior to Degreed, he helped launched a competency-based, accredited university and was a founding team member at Zinch, a company that helped students find scholarships and engage in college networking and recruiting. Blake was selected as a Top EdTech Entrepreneur by the Stanford d.School EdTech Lab and has been published in Harvard Technology Review, Business Insider, TechCrunch, and Huffington Post. He has spoken around the world on the topic of the future of learning, including at the Arizona State University Education Innovation Summit, EdTech Europe, and TEDx.</p> 

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Degreed?</b><br>
<p>My passion for education can be traced back to when I took the ACT for my college applications. I was an excellent student and scored well on the test, but I found the experience crazy. This test, taken on a Saturday morning when I was 17 was 50% of the equation for what college I would get into, and what college I would get into was 50% of the equation for what kind of job I would get out of college. It just seemed crazy.</p> 

<p>So I started studying high-stakes testing, namely where it came from and how predictive it was. That started to snowball into other related topics: the skills gap, diminishing relevance of higher education to the workplace, tuition and student debt, etc., At some point, this brought a new realization. This was the first thing I had really studied that a teacher hadn't assigned to me. I figured out while I had been a 4.0 student, I was actually a terrible learner. My curiosity had been snuffed out and I was a test-taking product of the system. It all culminated in my determination to help evolve the systemic problems we face in education and my career has been spent doing that ever since.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Degreed will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>In many ways, it already has. I just came from a meeting with the White House education staff where the future of credentials was being discussed. At this point, university presidents and provosts are all assuming that evolving credentials and major changes will come to diplomas. Currently when you ask someone, "Tell me about your education," they inevitably answer with where they went to university or what degree they have (or that they didn't go to university). But that question is always answered in relation to college and formal degrees. Said another way, you cannot tell me what you learned last year. That is ultimately the change we want to bring; the ability to answer for all of your ongoing education and skills.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think the biggest trend that is at our back is the democratization of learning content. This will persist, those flood gates have already been opened, and it will serve as a linchpin to new huge opportunities. I certainly believe the evolution of credentials is the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>Within credentials we will see several things:</p> 
<ol>
<li>Proliferation of new <i>vertical</i> credentials. By vertical, I mean that they will have context in some vertical either within an industry, professional association, or set of employers. 
<li>Horizontal standards set for these vertical credentials. The power of the degree will be in part that it is standardized. A bachelor's degree is more or less the same degree across all universities around the whole world and it is the same between majors. This means that I don't have to know about microbiology to understand your B.S. in Microbiology. This is in contrast to the <i>vertical</i> credentials (e.g., if I don't know about product management, I don't know how to value your PMI certificate). 
<li>Formal education will align with competency based standards and diplomas to become more transparent of the underlying skills. 
<li>Stackable credentials. Credentials will build on each other and can be added together. 
<li>Convergence of certificates with degrees. They have operated separately, but as credentials become <i>stackable</i> this will enable these worlds to merge. 
<li>This finally will enable more <i>onramps</i> and <i>offramps</i> to formal education. Where we are right now, completion is all-or-nothing, as credentials and certificates merge and are made stackable, people will be able to achieve micro-credentials or certificates within degree programs that make it easier to capture value in chunks. 
<li>As better credentials emerge and are made efficient, they will be used throughout people's careers, not just for entry-level or early in one's career. 
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Degreed, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Reforming tuition reimbursement programs. There is a ton of money available, but it is only made available to formal education, which is one of the lowest ROI ways a professional can upskill themselves. I am interested to see how these programs will be reformed to help unleash funding for more and more people to efficiently upskill.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>Podcasts is where I do a lot of learning, so I will go with that: <a href="http://freakonomics.com/">Stephen Dubner</a>, <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes">Malcolm Gladwell</a>, and <a href="https://themoth.org/storytellers/george-dawes-green">George Dawes Green</a>.</p>
