<p>Carol Barash, PhD, is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.story2.com/">Story2</a>, a web platform that helps students tap into the power of storytelling by using a step-by-step process to transform spoken stories into authentic college admission essays. Story2 wonGoldman Sachsâ€™ 10,000 Small Businesses competition, completed the Kaplan TechStars accelerator, was included in Forbes 10 EdTech Companies You Need to Know About in 2015 and 14 NY Tech Companies to Watch in 2016. Barash has taught at Princeton University, the University of Michigan, and Rutgers University, where she served as faculty advisor to the admissions committee. She graduated summa cum laude from Yale University, completed her M.A. at the University of Virginia, and Ph.D. at Princeton University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Story2?</b><br>
<p>In graduate school I studied women poets and the shift from manuscript to print culture in the late 1600s. We are in a similar moment, shifting from print to digital distribution of texts. I've worked for over 20 years in the trenches of that shift in education, marketing, and community settings, connecting people who build tech with people who use it. Story2 is my second startup. I've also worked in university admissions and published widely in print and online.</p> 

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Story2 will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Imagine a world in which everyone speaks and writes authentically, based on their real lived experience, to solve complex world problems. Story2 storytelling provides a fundamentally different way to approach spoken and written communication. Story2 taps into the brain's love of storytelling, teaching students how to find content, build structure, and connect with their audience through storytelling.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The biggest change will be the shift from tests, transcripts, and diplomas as the one path from high school to college, grad school, and work to a portfolio of courses, credentials, and community engagement. This will set people up for more frequent shifts between education, work, and service.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Story2, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I'm writing a collection of stories about my experiences as a woman innovator. I'm committed to opening up conversations across differences. Before Story2 I created a dialogue program for Israeli, Palestinian, and U.S. high school students. Perhaps something similar would be valuable in our current political climate.</p>
