          <p>
            Kevin Booker and Brian Gill of Mathematica Policy Research, Tim R. Sass of Florida State, and Ron Zimmer of RAND have a working paper out on the <a href="http://mailer.fsu.edu/~tsass/Papers/Beyond%20Test%20Scores%2024%20-%20Journal%20Manuscript.pdf">The Effects of Charter High Schools on Educational Attainment.</a> Education reform experts have been saying for a while now that charter schools appear to have roughly the same effect on student achievement as traditional public schools do. The results of this paper however, appear to demonstrate that students who have just completed the 8th grade at a traditional public school are more likely to complete high school and go on to college if they were to attend a charter school. In observing public and charter schools in Chicago and Florida, the researchers take into account the selection biases that come with determining which students end up going to charter schools. They also control for students' past achievement and distance from charter schools.

They conclude that the improvements in educational attainment from attending a charter school are similar to the amount of improvement you would see if a student chose to go to a Catholic high school instead of a public high school. This finding is particularly striking to me. Catholic high schools are known for being among the most affordable alternatives to public schools but they do come at a slightly higher cost. I would be interested to know whether there still exists a strong positive effect on attainment for charter schools if the amount a school spends per student is controlled for (assuming spending per student varies between public and charter schools).

Another point of inquiry is what role does student behavior play in attainment? Are there simply fewer students who violate school policy at charter schools? And if so, is this related to increased attention for each student at charter schools, so that they do not "fall through the cracks" as they might at public high schools?
