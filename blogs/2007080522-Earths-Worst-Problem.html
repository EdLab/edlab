            Global warming has been recorded for at least ten decades, yet people are still arguing whether or not the situation is a major concern to our lives and of the lives of future generations on earth. I'm sure you have noticed the increasing heat these past years. To simply explain what causes global warming: carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere let in light from the sun, but trap heat from it. Since not much heat is leaving, the earth gradually gets warmer (explained in depth in this <a href="http://green.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/gw-overview-interactive.html">simulation</a> ). The gases that warm the earth come from…us. Emissions from power plants, exhaust from millions of cars, burning of fossil fuels, increasing population, using electricity, and deforestation are the major causes of greenhouse gas emissions. For anyone out there feeling guilty, the blame is not all on us; mother nature adds to the problem as well. Tundra, wetlands, and volcanoes also release gases into the atmosphere. Let's go over what can happen if global warming is not reduced. Increasing heat can cause sea levels to rise, droughts to last longer, flooding, stronger storms, and deaths in humans and animals. Ice sheets and glaciers will melt and there will be more water, which in turn will cover more land and there will be less room to accommodate the increasing population. Crops and fields will suffer through long periods without rain. This increases the chance of wildfires in those places. Scientists also say that hurricanes will be stronger than in the past, so there will be more destruction in the future. Here is an interesting list of <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/top10_global_warming_results-1.html">effects</a> 
 from the heat. 

There are many ways to help slow down the heating of the earth though. You don't have to go to an extreme and get a hybrid car. There are far more simple things that one can do, according to <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/top10_ways_green_home-1.html">Livescience</a>. You can buy objects that last long instead of having to replace that item many times, which lead to more garbage in landfills and release gases. Using Energy-Star appliances is a great way to help the earth and save you a ton of money. When electronic devices are not in use, turn them off. Always look to buy natural and non-toxic items. Planting many flowers and trees are fun ideas for everyone too. If all of these ideas are too much to handle… then the simplest way to participate is to use compact fluorescent light bulbs. The earth has done so much for us, why not do something for it? The live earth concert that happened on July 7th, 2007 was aimed at spreading the word of global warming all around the globe. The more people that know of this concern, the more people that may help slow down this major problem.
