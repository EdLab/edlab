            ** KEEP PRIVATE**
I had the pleasure of meeting Cosmo Fujiyama, who is a graduate student at NYU's School of Public Service.  We met up because Cosmo has led a number of social entrepreneurial learning initiatives and I thought we could springboard off of her many experiences when thinking of LaunchPad. I also thought she could offer Sector and Profile candidates for NLT. She was a fountain of information on both fronts. Here are just a few of the topics we discussed that tickled my EdLab funny bone:

1.The Ashoka Youth Venture Dream It, Do It Challenge - Ashoka Fellows (high-impact social entrepreneurs) mentored aspiring social entrepreneurial undergraduates students and those undergraduates mentored aspiring SE high school students, fostering  a multi-generational  pipeline of social entrepreneurs. I wondered what something like this would look like in the realm of educational entrepreneurship.

2.  As a current graduate fellow at NYU, she gets together with other Fellows all of whom are studying a wide variety of fields. They get together and describe the issues that they are most passionate about- what keeps them up at night that they want to work on. The interesting thing is with such a variety of folks in terms of expertise, it organically  lends itself to a potential "dream team"  of experts that could help out with future initiatives that evolve from the efforts of these aspiring leaders. 

3. There were a whole bunch of individuals and initiatives that Cosmo thought would be awesome to feature in NLT - Scott Sherman of Transformative Learning, Andrew Mangini  and Kany a Balakristina of the Future Project, Beth Novack... the list goes on and on. She is going to pass along names and projects that may be a good fit for NLT 

4. She thought it would be a neat idea to have a posse of EdLabbers go down to NYU and mingle with the Fellows in her program that are focused on transforming education and think about potential collaborations 

5. Cosmo had a ton of experience in the realm of entrepreneurial incubation, too many to cover here, but she  is thinking of ways to catalogue current social entrepreneurial supports 

6. She is going to India in December to interview Ed Tech Start up initiators and get a sense of the lay of the land there. 

The list goes on and on. I walked away feeling incredibly inspired by her and hope to continue to foster this connection. To read more about Cosmo check out her profile. She is intrigued by EdLab and  we both walked away excited at the possibility of bridging the uptown and downtown work in which we are involved...
