<p>What are the effects of internet addiction among students? Emotional intelligence, including behaviors like understanding, empathy, and managing emotions, has frequently been associated in research with increased social skills, educational success, and problem solving. Recent research reveals that frequent internet use and internet dependent behaviors are negatively related to emotional intelligence for students.</p>

<p>The researchers asked 201 randomly selected students to complete a three-part questionnaire which included demographic questions, information about internet use and dependence, and questions meant to gauge emotional intelligence. The researchers found that about half of the students were at least mildly internet dependent, with computer games responsible for the highest levels of digital addiction. Moreover, internet addiction was negatively related to emotional intelligence. </p>

<p>According to the researchers, prevention rather than rehabilitation is the most promising strategy for growing digital natives. They suggest working with family centers and teacher education programs to prepare parents and teachers to guide the next generation to appropriate internet use. Though the researchers suggest it is "too late" for some students, teaching self-reflection and self-assessment of digital behaviors could increase studentsâ€™ ability to manage their own use of the internet. In addition, education technology companies could explore ways to ensure they are helping to build healthy internet habits in their users. Built in timers and reflective pauses might be promising strategies to teach self-regulation.</p>

<p>Because this study was conducted on adult graduate students, it would be worthwhile to expand the investigation to include students ages 12-18. The study also did not allow for much nuance in digital behaviors, which we know are significantly impacted by <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1311">gender</a> and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1737">class differences</a>. It's possible that students who showed decreased emotional intelligence, especially considering the highest risk group were online gamers, were demographically similar in more ways than just their web habits.</p>
