<a href="http://crl.acrl.org/content/73/2/115.full.pdf+html">Leeder, C., Markey, K., & Yakel, E. (2012). A faceted taxonomy for rating student bibliographies in an online information literacy game. <i>College & Research Libraries, 73</i>(2), 115-133.</a> 

<b>Description:</b>
The article describes the evaluation of student-created bibliographies and the teaching effectiveness of the social citation game, BiblioBouts. The game was created in 2011 by the School of Information at the University of Michigan and the Center for History and New Media at George Mason. For the study, an assessment measure was created that allowed for the diversity in formats cited by modern students. Evaluation criteria used in previous studies, like scholarly/nonscholarly, were not considered applicable to student research in a flatter, online environment. 

The evaluation shook out some surprising and not so surprising facts. Students are using professional-level resources like blogs and commercial newspapers over traditionally published academic journals. The study also found that students, at least University of Michigan students, were more likely to use content provided by Proquest over other databases, whether or not they played the game. It's surprising as Proquest doesn't have particularly good databases, but it may be differentiated on library websites because it includes a dissertation database. This could be an issue of librarian blindness to database arrangements and presentations that make visual sense to uninitiated researchers. The results from the study were not significant, but the BiblioBouts team plans to do more conclusive research in the future. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
To produce this sort of pokey taxonomy and carefully conduct a study with actual value is sort of the anti-startup. Uniting the rush-to-press and the peer-reviewed toward common goals using a system like Research Broker is a pretty awesome concept. We can't say much about the feasibility of a game for teaching citation skills and information literacy from this particular study, but it seems like the evaluation process was beneficial for both researchers and game-creators.
