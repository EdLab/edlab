<p>Blended learning courses, a combination of traditional classroom instruction combined with online components, are becoming more popular with universities. But what is the optimal proportion of in-classroom time compared to online learning? Researchers explored this question through a study on various blend levels and student outcomes. They predicted that students would perceive additional online time and less in-class instruction more positively. Additionally, they believed that courses with the highest rates of online learning would yield the greatest educational outcomes.</p>
 
<p>This study was carried out in a large university located in an urban Canadian city. The sample had over 1,000 students in 20 different undergraduate courses related to fine arts, professional studies, and liberal arts. All of these courses had been recently redesigned as blended, with reduced number of in-class sessions and face-to-face meetings. Professors were able to decide the in-class versus online instruction allotment, giving the researchers a natural experiment with four different blend levels: </p> 
<ul>
 <li>High blend (50% online)</li>
 <li>Medium blend (36% to 40% online)</li>
<li>Low blend (27% to 30% online)</li>
<li>Supplemental blend (only additional online tutoring sessions)</li>  
</ul>

<p>All of the courses were taught in massive lecture halls with 300 students each. Teams of TAs with no online teaching experience managed small online groups. Participants completed questionnaires related to their perceptions of their blended courses. Grades and GPAs were also collected to measure learning outcomes. </p> 

<p>The results showed that students were generally more satisfied with their blended courses compared to traditional classroom instruction. Convenience was a large factor in these positive perceptions. However, the students also reported some lost sense of community due to the disconnected nature of online learning.</p> 

<p>Comparing the different blend levels, students in the medium- and high- blended classes, with 33% to 50% of content online, perceived their experiences as most beneficial and also had the highest GPA learning outcomes compared to the lower blends. Students in the supplemental blend reported the lowest levels of benefit and also had the worst grade performance. </p> 

<p>While all of the hypotheses were not confirmed in this study, the researchers found evidence that the medium and higher blends were optimal designs. They believe that professors in these sections may have felt compelled to promote interactive online activities, providing more gains to their students. However, the team cautioned that optimal blend levels could vary depending on the subject. As these types of courses become more common in higher education, studies of their effectiveness will only become more prevalent as well.</p>
