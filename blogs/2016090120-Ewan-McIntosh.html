<p>Ewan McIntosh is the founder and managing director of <a href="http://notosh.com/">NoTosh</a>. A highly-regarded keynote speaker at events around the world, he’s also the author of <i>How To Come Up With Great Ideas and Actually Make Them Happen</i> and regularly writes about learning on his <a href="www.edu.blogs.com">blog</a>. McIntosh previously served as Scotland’s first National Advisor on Learning and Technology Futures and launched the world’s first iPad investment fund in 2010.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role at NoTosh?</b><br>
<p>I started NoTosh out of a frustration from two parts of my professional experience. On one hand, there were a lot of grey-haired wise old men telling us as teachers that schools were killing creativity and that all we had to do was buy their book, hire them, attend their keynote, and all would be well. But all they did was say stuff had to change and not how it might change. As a classroom teacher in Scotland, I was part of a growing number of educators who were leading the way in student engagement with and without technology. When we got together for a pint after these kinds of well-meaning but off-the-mark keynote speeches, TED talks, or masterclasses, we wanted to seek out ways to share the <i>how</i> we saw working every day in the classroom.</p>
 
<p>I am not just a classroom teacher. I spent a few years in a different line of work as a television executive. I invested in websites, video games, and mobile apps for a large British broadcaster called Channel 4. Through this work, I had been collaborating with some of the most creative people in the world. I saw that they had a very different <i>how</i> to most classroom teachers when it came to executing creative work. Unfortunately, this creativity was locked away in their studios far from your typical classroom.</p>
 
<p>Their way of designing their thinking as much as the end project is what kick-started NoTosh: could we help teachers and students design their thinking too and show the world how to get to the creative objective promised by all those education conference keynotes we have to put up with? The name is shaped by this frustrating, but ultimately joyful, experience: <i>no tosh</i> is Scots for <i>no nonsense</i>.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at NoTosh will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>We see a world in which people have the creative confidence to find their place in a team and achieve something bigger than they are. We help people to think differently and change the way they choose to work as individuals as part of a team and an organization by:
<ul>
<li>guiding them from passive thinking to dynamic activity,
<li>equipping them to work out problems for themselves and become self-sufficient,
<li>creating a climate in which it’s safe to be experimental, and
<li>developing a shared language.
</ul>
<p>We do this through consultation, workshops, events, and design thinking tools.</p>
 
<p><b>We’re already changing the learning landscape, in schools and in the workplace.</b></p> 
<p>We have helped a 155,000 person corporation adopt a process and way of thinking that is already leading to regular breakthroughs in engineering and learning to think about thinking is at its core. At the same time we work alongside countless elementary schools, one-on-one with teachers, and school leaders to help them prioritise their efforts, and work on the stuff that makes an impact on kids’ outcomes. Feedback cycles, great questioning, and clarity in leadership are the totally unsurprising top three strategies we often go back to.</p>
 
<p>We have no ambitions to be a huge company: we have a tight, incredibly talented team but legions of supporters and practitioners who take much of what we give away for free and take it further in their own communities. We need them to achieve our vision of a world where everyone finds their place in a team and achieves something bigger than they are.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Research-informed practice is the most promising direction we can go in. I am not alone in being fed up with the research-led crowd who don’t want to see any practice in a classroom unless it’s been subject to PhD levels of research by the teacher involved. However, I want every teacher to be aware of the key half dozen pillars of teaching and learning and get really good at them. That means reading the odd research piece on a regular basis, and trying things out in class. But vitally, we need teachers to create space for innovation too. If we just go with what researchers have said is important then we cut off the potential for creative growth in the teaching profession. That would be disastrous.</p>
 
<p>I also think that we will stop talking about data being quite so big. It’s the small data that kids can use right now to inform their next learning step that is most interesting to us all. From data we can derive joy: just look at the joy every winning athlete is bathed in when they win Olympic gold medals. But the journey to that gold is seeded entirely in data: every run, jump, or sprint informs a tweak or drastic change in approach. Over time, those tweaks based on the athlete owning and understanding their own data lead to gold. Of course, the dialogue with their coach/teacher is core to making the most of the data. Small data for big learning, not big data.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at NoTosh, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>If I am doing something different than traveling with my children and wife or cooking while singing terribly to whatever is on the iPod, then it’s in my role at NoTosh. A big task ahead is collating a new book of stories to celebrate 10 years of TeachMeet, the unconference that I started 10 years ago. It predates EdCamp and has thousands of teachers every month learning in hugely social, fun environments: pubs, cafes, and even boats!</p>
 
<p>I am desperate to write a new book for myself on learning space design and add some fresh new stories to my first sellout book, <i>How To Come Up With Great Ideas and Actually Make Them Happen</i>.</p>
 
<p>Writing a book is a mammoth and sometimes lonely task so I will counter that with the continuation of our amazing partnership with <a href="https://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/">thyssenkrupp</a>, the engineering company with whom we have created the <i>Innovation Garage</i>. This year we saw our programme lead to several new investments for the company in the area of mobility. Next year we’re hoping to create several more crazy new ideas in other business areas. It’s all-consuming work and more than <i>just another project</i> at work. Nothing beats creating products that my children will benefit from one day.</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter? </b><br>
<p>I rarely follow folk on Twitter any more, I sometimes see the latest posts when I go in because I am otherwise using it as a search tool on a specific topic. My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/hamishcurry">Hamish Curry</a> tweets about some fascinating research on play, libraries, and innovation in general and he has always got a critique of a fine single malt at some point in the week. Tony Blair’s former strategist <a href="https://twitter.com/campbellclaret">Alastair Campbell</a> is both a superb strategy person from whom you can learn so much and also a sports fan. Over the summer he will help you draw connections between what you are seeing on sports TV and how it might inform your next big objective.</p>

<p>Finally, I search a tag on Twitter to meet scores of talented teachers doing great things. My favorite? #teachmeet, the unconference for teachers and by teachers that I started with some friends ten years ago.</p>
