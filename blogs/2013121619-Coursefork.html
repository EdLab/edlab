<p><a href="http://coursefork.org/">Coursefork</a> is an open access collaboration platform for educational materials. Taking inspiration from the open-source software movement with an aim to become the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> of course creation, Coursefolk features easy duplication or revision of any courses on its platform and encourages cooperation on course development. The vision of Coursefork is to open up the closed systems in the world of education and to provide better course materials that will benefit not only educators but ultimately every learner.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The interface of Coursefork is simple and easy to use. Educators can browse courses from various categories (such as computer science, the humanities, and business), choose those that interest them, and fork and revise the selected courses in useful ways. Each course is comprised of small units called components, and educators can import any components from other courses into their own courses easily with one single click. The system keeps track of course copies and revisions, and creators of original course materials get credits for modifications or re-use of their courses.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Coursefork is in its alpha phase and there are not many courses available right now. The limited course materials on the site may discourage potential users if they cannot find courses that meet their needs. Further content creation efforts will be needed to attract new educators. The platform currently only supports slide mode for course components; video mode and other formats are still under construction. More options for course components will be required to enable engaging and dynamic course design.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The open education movement promotes the idea that knowledge should be free and open to re-use and collaboration among educators and that this cooperation will contribute to better course materials. One of the challenges facing this movement is creating a culture of openness for educators. Coursefork helps remove one barrier to open culture by providing an effective course sharing and remixing platform for educators.</p>


<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Coursefork lets educators find interesting courses and copy, customize, and teach them as they like.</p>
