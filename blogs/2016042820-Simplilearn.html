<p><i>"Simplilearn is the world’s largest professional certifications company. We work with companies and working professionals to address their unique learning needs."</i> (<a href="http://www.simplilearn.com/about-us">About Simplilearn</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Quality Qualifications</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.simplilearn.com">Simplilearn</a> is a company that helps professionals become better qualified in their field—regardless of industry. To reach this ambitious goal, Simplilearn offers courses delivered by an accomplished panel of industry experts and thought leaders who guide learning. Whether your dream job is becoming a big data architect, project manager, or full-stack engineer, this company covers all the bases, and some you may not have known existed.</p>

<p><b>Humble Beginnings</b></p>

<p>Simplilearn is a mom-and-pop shop that made it to the top—founder Krishna Kumar started a blog in 2009 with a few video lessons and a practice test. Simplilearn has subsequently grown exponentially and now offers a full slate of online learning opportunities including partnerships with Fortune 500 companies. Simplilearn has become dominant in training programs and <a href="http://www.simplilearn.com/reviews">students are highly appreciative</a> of course quality.  </p>

<p><b>Over 400 Courses and Growing</b></p>
 
<p>Simplilearn has made its mark on professional learning. Over 2,000 qualified trainers offer over 400 courses and have already certified 500,000 professionals—and counting. LinkedIn recently named Simplilearn the 8th most influential education brand in the world. One reason for its reputation is that it goes beyond one-on-one learning. For example, in its Technology Course stream, Simplilearn offers Design and Multimedia Certification Training with all of the major players like Adobe, Apple, Avid, Autodesk, and Microsoft. But instead of just allowing individual certification, Simplilearn provides training for an entire team so everyone can get up to speed at the same time, improving overall group performance. </p>

<p>Simplilearn will need to compete with other major companies that offer training. The competition includes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/530/linkedin-learning-webinars?lang=en">LinkedIn Learning Webinars</a> and <a href="https://www.lynda.com/LinkedIn-training-tutorials/473-0.html">LinkedIn Tutorials Learning</a>  courtesy of its recent acquisition of Lynda.com, the online learning powerhouse. Given the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2014/08/27/online-learning-industry-poised-for-107-billion-in-2015/#7ad9f1ba66bc">$107 billion market in online learning</a>, the competition to remain at the head of the certification pack will become fierce. </p>
