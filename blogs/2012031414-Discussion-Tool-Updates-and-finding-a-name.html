Hey Guys,

Alex and I have been working on revising our ideas around the discussion board tool proposal. After the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7340">D&R</a>, we have spent some time thinking about the differentiating factor for our tool when compared with the other similarly existing services like Disqus, Piazza, Askbot etc. So our revised idea is as follows:

While on the one hand our tool would offer the many innovative analytics for instructors and students to understand their contribution and participation in a discussion, our tool would be a pluggable discussion platform that could be plugged into any website.  So, a user would first create a forum on the central site (lets say a forum could be a course, "Introduction to Computers"), then this user could just plugin this forum on his website. Every forum could have multiple discussions. All user activity such as commenting, voting up, replying would be available through the plug-in except for analytics , which would be available on the central site. 

We feel that this service model coupled with the intelligent analytics should add a lot of value and purpose to our tool. Of-course, the plugin model would bring in a lot of challenges primarily from a design and look and feel perspective, but we are excited to explore it all. 

As we march into the next steps for this project, we are looking for a suitable (or unsuitable) name for this tool. Remember, we started calling it EdDais initially (where Dais means a platform or scaffold), and had one <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7311">previous</a> brainstorm session on finding a name. But our vision for the tool has changed since then, and so we want to give you another opportunity to help us in coming up with a name (keep in mind the tool's flexible, plugin model). You may re-suggest any names you suggested earlier, but you can get as fresh and creative as you make like.  

So, what would you want to call it?
