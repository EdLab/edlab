Shivani Lamba has a background in neuroscience, graduated from University College London, and is currently studying computer science. She is the founder of <a href="http://brightlobe.com/">Brightlobe</a>, an initiative that aims to advance research in child development and early childhood education. The project counts child health and education specialists from Cambridge University and UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health among its advisors. We asked Shivani about her inspiration and her thoughts about the future of science education. </p>

<p><b>How have your past professional experiences shaped your current work?</b><br>
<p>My initial interest involved pursuing neuroscientific research or clinical medicine.</p>
 
<p>This trajectory started with an internship at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institute of Health (NIH), in a laboratory that focused on molecular neuroscience—a post that, after working with them over the years, evolved into a post-baccalaureate intramural research training award before I had graduated from University College London in England.</p>
 
<p>The environment in the laboratory was a formative one: it was tremendously nurturing in its treatment of new ideas and attitude to innovation; and it certainly shaped the somewhat experimental approach I have to my current work.</p>
 
<p>I studied neuroscience and completed my final-year project at the Institute of Child Health, which is situated right above Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. Here I became interested in the unique educational requirements of children from observing patients in the clinical areas of the building.</p>
 
<p>For several reasons, it became clear through my experience at university that generally speaking, education isn’t as accessible as it ought to be (e.g., children and older students alike are limited by socioeconomic circumstances or chronic illnesses, for instance)—and that we’re at a transitional moment where these paradigms can shift quite radically (e.g., through policy, education technology).</p>
 
<p>This was the primary reason that I became committed to this work—currently I’m involved in science-focused public engagement, but I have several additional projects in the pipeline. These projects also make use of graduate qualifications I’m pursuing through Stanford University in computer science.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will impact science education and engagement programs?</b><br>
<p>My work is focused on integrating play and learning—specifically to engage underserved or overlooked populations.</p>
 
<p>Edluminary and Forensic Outreach—which has a focus on forensic, crime and security science—are already changing the learning landscape. In London, there’s a good chance that we’ve influenced the event programming—or at the very least, liaised with the learning or education officers—of most museums or learning-focused attractions in the city.</p>
 
<p>These are organizations that aim to improve public understanding of science through events and other creative media (e.g., interactive apps or digital content). Through workshop delivery—for schools, charitable organizations, businesses and the general public—and public engagement consulting activities, the intent is to introduce playful learning as an approach to science education.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>

<p>As a team, and perhaps unsurprisingly given the nature of our work, we’re particularly fascinated by developments in the gamification of learning. In terms of a broader trend, the uptake and novel applications of these approaches have tremendous potential in the education space—especially in terms of driving engagement among cohorts with varying levels of ability and interest.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>We’re working with our clients to develop immersive, educational experiences for students and the public. One project for the Museum of London, involves creating a torched installation as part of a three-hour interactive event that invites visitors to train as arson investigators. It’s designed to complement a new exhibition on the Great Fire of London.</p>
 
<p>There are a few big projects on the horizon. To start, we’re holding our first student conference in October at London’s Imperial War Museum. This is being held in partnership with the UCL Jill Dando Institute.</p>
 
<p>In February 2017, we’ll be holding our inaugural Wonder Conference for students and the general public. This is a two-day event that aims to bring our audience closer to the cutting-edge work of leading lights in science and technology. We’ve confirmed roboticist Ayanna Howard and biomedical engineer Ted Berger as speakers—among several others.</p>
 
<p>A personal project of mine involves looking at improving educational attainment within a clinical context. This is in conjunction with researchers at the Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital; the Faculty of Education, Cambridge University; and Harvard Medical School.</p>
