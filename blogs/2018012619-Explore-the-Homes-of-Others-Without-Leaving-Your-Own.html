<p><a href="https://tinybop.com/apps/homes">Homes</a> is the third app in Tinybop’s <a href="<a href="https://tinybop.com/apps/homes">Explorer’s Library</a> series, which aims to develop young children’s foundational science literacy. For $2.99, this app allows children to travel around the world observing and interacting with different animated living spaces. Through playing in far away places and learning how different people live, children are exposed to different cultural lifestyles and languages as well as the inner workings of different buildings.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app presents four vastly different homes regarding structure and location: an adobe house in the highlands of Guatemala, a tower house in a desert city in Yemen, a yurt in the Mongolian countryside, and brownstone row house in Brooklyn. The app’s presentation of a variety of living spaces and lifestyles makes for an inclusive experience without the Eurocentrism or exoticism that can emanate from some learning materials. </p>

<p>The ability to explore both the external and internal structure and functions of each home is one of the best features of Homes. An adjustable split-screen feature allows children to switch between viewing the normal outside appearance of a home and investigating the inner workings of electricity and utilities through an x-ray perspective. Homes encourages children to think about the interconnectedness of available resources, architecture, weather, and climate through manipulating these variables and exploring the surrounding environment.</p>

<p>I loved engaging in interactive outdoor activities around the house, such as sheep shearing in Mongolia and holiday window decorating in Brooklyn, as well as those inside different rooms, like cooking local food and reading picture books in local languages. Additionally, I found the detailed handbook that comes with Homes to be a fantastic resource for parents and teachers, filled with app tips, discussion questions, and additional fact sheets on countries and homes. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While I love the ability to rearrange the homes, I think the design could be improved to make movable elements less frustrating. There are lots of small objects, like silverware and toys, that accidentally get moved when clumsy fingers brush against them. When I purposefully moved these objects, the lack of precision in placing them, especially in sections of the room I couldn’t zoom in on, irritated me.</p>
 
<p>I also would have liked to see more homes featured. While the four options provided me with plenty to do, and are well-bolstered by the handbook if utilized with adult guidance, an expansion of what this app has already built would provide more opportunities for learning.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>With a focus on the functionality and decorative features of homes across the globe, Homes provides children with a unique virtual travel opportunity. Filled with fun and educational interactive opportunities, this app successfully allows users to explore different ways of life through the lens of the living space. </p>
