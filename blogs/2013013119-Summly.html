<p><a href="http://summly.com/">Summly</a> is a news aggregator that claims to produce news summaries that are meaningful to human readers. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/12/04/teen-developers-summly-app-hits-half-a-million-downloads-publishers-come-knocking/">17-year-old wunderkind founder</a> Nick D’Aloisio 
says that he has built the app for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/02/summly-nick-daloisio_n_2065796.html">his generation</a>, young people coming of age in an information-heavy world. Interested in making reading more meaningful for his peers, D’Aloisio began tinkering with an <a href="http://summly.com/technology.html">algorithm</a> to extract the essential parts of news stories. He partnered with <a href="http://www.sri.com/">SRI International</a> to develop the final product. The summaries created by the site are meant to fit nicely within the boundaries of the iPhone’s screen and give readers a better idea of content before they commit to a site view.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The intersection of mobile reading and born-digital writing is a competitive place. Our screens are smaller, but the flood of information continues to grow. Summly doesn’t say outright that it’s meant to replace traditional journalism, but rather that it can help readers make informed decisions about their online reading. Though Summly is new, it attracted and partnered with major media firm <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/">News Corp</a>, which is largely responsible for the top-tier content on the app. At this point the site is free, but Summly is <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Summly-News-App-Apple-Store,news-16259.html">considering</a> micropayments, which certainly seem more future-oriented than a traditional paywall. The app is also quite attractive; of particular note is the "summflower" animation which makes it easy to share from summaries and articles.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Though Summly claims not to threaten traditional journalism, Forbes’ Karsten Strauss <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2012/11/01/17-year-old-search-wizs-news-app-may-not-work-out-in-the-long-run/">suggests that</a> if summaries prove valuable to readers, journalists and news firms will begin producing their own rather than relying on an external algorithm. If the summary is good enough, perhaps it could even begin to exclude long-form pieces. Luckily for journalists, the app is currently only available for the iPhone.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Summly has a lot of potential. Applying a well-wrought summary algorithm to academic writing seems like it could shake up discovery and even revolutionize the standards for research abstracts. The same principle applied to textbooks and monographs might help students and researchers identify the best sources. Unrelated to the function of the app but equally interesting is the <a href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/">Thielistic</a> argument surrounding founder Nick D’Aloisio’s schooling. Currently on a leave of absence from high school, D’Aloisio seems to have made good. He is at present the <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/world-s-youngest-vc-funded-entrepreneur-.html">youngest person</a> to ever receive VC funding. Recent interviews with the young founder suggest that he is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/12/04/teen-developers-summly-app-hits-half-a-million-downloads-publishers-come-knocking/">reluctant</a> to return to formal education. Too bad they can’t just give him the summary.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Summly is the short answer to the information overload.</p>
