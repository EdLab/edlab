          <p>
            After our stellar <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6276">Vialogues workshop and presentation at Mott Haven HS</a> in the Bronx, listed below is some of my learning from the experience.  Many thanks to Joann, Coach George & the EdLab video crew for their leadership and insight leading-up-to & during this event!  

<b>Here are some of my Mott Haven A-HA! moments...</b>
1) Thanks to Pranav you can relatively easily download videos from YouTube in a format that is playable on school computers that ban YouTube.  

2) Vialogues is a great tool for learning procedural steps from how-to videos.  For example, Jo annotated our "Lazy Song" <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/961">The Lazy Song</a> dance video to teach the group how to "Dougie" (apparently there are many styles of this dance thanks to HSC's insight) and we found the time-stamped annotation feature amazingly helpful as we needed to go back to quickly review certain steps with the class.  To experience this magic first-hand, go to <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/961">The Lazy Song</a> & click "00:15" to watch the "wiggle up." Brilliant.  

3) Vialogues is a valuable tool for both in-class AND out-of-class discussions.  It is a great controlled environment for teachers to create embedded content ahead of time, add moderated comments and let the class engage both in real-time (almost) and asynchronously on their own.  The idea of seeing peer comments and having the opportunity to reply to peer & moderator questions really seemed to genuinely intrigue & excited the group.  

4) Learners were excited by the format, so much so, that the platform's functionality seemed to override potential boredom with video content.  Case in-point, almost the whole group of 19 got into  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/959">Bach's Cello Song</a> and made comments like, "I'm liking the beat" & "he nasty with it." 

This is music that many of these students would probably never give a second thought in any other context, but because they could gauge peer reaction, it seemed to give the class permission to enjoy.  This can backfire, if a student is afraid to differ from group comment consensus.   However, in this case, the diversity of comments, both for an against the song, dispelled fear that the group was getting into the music simply because their friends were.   

5) After informally polling the group almost everyone wanted their teachers to use this platform both for in-class & out-of-class discussions as homework.  Some even made specific recommendations, for teachers they wanted to introduce Vialogues to. 

6) As an aside, & perhaps relevant to our recent <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6288">mobile learning mob</a>, I found a poster in the computer lab particularly interesting, it stated, "Call or text your mentors."  Interesting.  Cell phones are such a point of contention in many schools, <a href="http://teacherleaders.typepad.com/the_tempered_radical/2011/03/using-cell-phones-in-schools.html">here</a> is an article making a case for them & it seems that at Mott Haven they are allowed in certain instances.  This could be interesting to note for future mobile applications and mobile app versions of vialogues. 

Overall, it was a great learning experience and opportunity to test Vialogues with a new population & gain first-hand insight.  I can't wait to see the video!
