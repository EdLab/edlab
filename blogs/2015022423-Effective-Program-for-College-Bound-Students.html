            It is a quite evident that many children of low-income families do no breeze through their education. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/upshot/helping-the-poor-in-higher-education-the-power-of-a-simple-nudge.html?ref=education&abt=0002&abg=1&_r=1">Many researchers point to socio economic status</a> as one of the most important factors in student achievement. Students from low-income families are often hindered by their misfortune and those from high-income families often have a head start in their education. This piece highlights the efforts of two Harvard researchers to buck this trend. They did a pilot program where they sent text messages to high school seniors from low income neighborhoods to remind them about college requirements such as filling out FAFSA, deposit deadlines, etc., They focused especially on the summer months when students tend to lose interest in college and forget to register for classes and take care of other requirements.
 
The researchers saw a drastic change in the number of students applying for college. The researchers found that students who were randomly chosen to receive the text messages were more successful in their education than those who were not. This seems a very effective way to help low-income students stay in the loop about college requirements.  Though the program comes with its share of costs, it would be great if school districts across the country can replicate it in some form. It will certainly help.
