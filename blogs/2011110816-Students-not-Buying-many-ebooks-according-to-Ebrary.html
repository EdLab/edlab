          <p>
            According to <a href ="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/why-arent-students-using-e-books/"> this article</a>, students are buying many ebooks for their courses. Although ebooks sales have gone up in general, this does not reflect student's buying habits when it comes to ebooks. There could be a couple of good reasons we can come up with off the bat, like how not all textbooks are available on ebooks, or that students usually buy all their books at the same time at a bookstore. Some interesting reasons that were expressed in the article was that students prefer to have text they would be able to write notes in, or from personal experience, highlight important sections of text with a  <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlighter"> old highlighter</a>.

To remedy this note taking problem ebray should try to come up with software that can allow students to highlight and take notes easier in these ebooks. Also a  collaboration tool, that would let students share their notes on the text, would interest more students into choosing ebooks over a paper textbook. There's also a price issue as these e-textbooks are as expensive as traditional textbooks which would give students more incentive to stick with textbooks and share it among some classmates. Until ebooks can fully meet the needs of students, by taking their software to the next level, students will keep choosing the traditional textbook.
