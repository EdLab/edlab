<p><b>Title:</b> Formative Evaluation of Students at Quest to Learn (2012)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Valarie Shute, Matthew Ventura, & Robert Torres</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://ijlm.net/"> International Journal of Learning and Media</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do middle school students who learn from a game-based curriculum gain new understanding or skills in systems thinking, team work and time management?</p> 

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
As the world becomes more interconnected, children growing up in this century need to be equipped with thinking skills that will help them navigate complex social, natural, and digital systems. Most current schools are not able to meet these needs. <a href=" http://q2l.org/">Quest to Learn (Q2L)</a>, a public school in New York City, wants to tackle this challenge through innovative curriculum design and learning activities that employ game-based pedagogy, systems thinking frameworks, and knowledge domains that reflect the epistemology of real world professionals.</p>

<p>This study evaluated how Q2L middle school students, 40% of whom received free or reduced lunch, learned from its innovative curriculum. Evaluations and surveys on three major competencies-- systems thinking, team work, and time management-- were administered four times between 2009 and 2010 to students who enrolled in 2009.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Overall, there were significant improvements on systems thinking skills, but no significant improvements were found on team work and time management skills. A closer look at systems thinking subcategories revealed that students made gains in dynamic thinking (i.e., understanding of the behaviors and characteristics of elements within a system) and transfer model thinking (i.e., understanding the similarities and differences between natural, technological or social systems), but not in closed-loop thinking (i.e., finding feedback loops of causal relationships). The authors acknowledged the limitations of self-reported data to understand team work and time management skills, and suggested that more performance-based data collection approaches, such as classroom observation, could help determine students' learning in these categories.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
New pedagogies and curriculum designs have been proposed by educators, scholars, and policy makers to prepare students to work and live in the 21st century. Findings from this study support game-based pedagogy as a promising approach to prepare children for the future. Furthermore, it is encouraging that this innovative approach works in a public school system with students from diverse and disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Although Q2L is unique in the support it has received from other institutions, it nevertheless represents new possibilities for public school reforms.</p>
