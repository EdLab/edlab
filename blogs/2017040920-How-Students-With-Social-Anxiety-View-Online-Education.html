<p>Statistically, undergrads are an anxious bunch. In particular, many students face social anxiety, which can be debilitating enough to affect their educational experiences and learning outcomes. The <i>social compensation hypothesis of internet use</i> posits that people with high levels of social anxiety feel more comfortable with online interactions than with face-to-face interactions, but this effect had yet to be tested regarding education.</p>
 
<p>A new study examined how this hypothesis played out in online and offline higher education. To bring another dimension to the hypothesis, the study looked at how not only levels of social anxiety, but also those of extroversion affected students' attitudes toward both online and offline classes. To do this, the researchers administered questionnaires to over 700 undergrads, 39% of whom experienced medium to high levels of social anxiety.</p>
 
<p>The researchers predicted that their results would follow those set out in the social compensation hypothesis: students with higher levels of extroversion and lower levels of social anxiety would prefer face-to-face education and students with low levels of extraversion and high levels of social anxiety would prefer online education. Yet while they found the former to be true, the latter was incorrect. In fact, students with high levels of social anxiety did not have favorable attitudes toward online learning.</p>
 
<p>This finding is unexpected; online learning is often thought to create a space that socially anxious students will enjoy more because they have extra time to think of responses and do not have to interact face-to-face with others. Yet as online education becomes more interactive and integrates more social media components, it could present an increasing number of challenges to students with anxiety. Studies that help us understand how anxiety impacts student attitudes toward different learning environments become vital as higher education increasingly focuses on student enjoyment and engagement in class.</p>
