<p>If you’ve ever gone to a museum that had an accompanying mobile app to enhance your visiting experience, you were probably using a location-based augmented reality app. Location-based apps are not just growing more popular in museums though; they have been developed to help with storytelling at historical landmarks, and to provide trivia games and quizzes about content at popular tourist attractions.</p>
 
<p>This study, conducted in Montreal at the historic Roddick Gates, compared the use of mobile location-based apps in a lab-based setting and in an outdoor setting. The two apps used were MetaGuide, used by tour guides to help orient them throughout the tour, and MTL Urban Museum, used by learners to provide them with information during the tour. In the lab-based one, the participants used the apps alongside Google Earth, which was projected onto a SMARTboard. In the outdoors setting, the participants were actually located at Roddick Gates. The researchers chose to focus on whether learners were able to identify historical differences of the site between the past and present, as well as whether learners enjoyed their learning session.</p>
 
<p>The apps in this study included key elements to enhance learning at a historical site. For example, the apps posed historical questions to deepen learners’ thinking. They also provided text and images to provide information about the location, and prompted learners to identify differences between the past and present as it related to the site. The authors found that in the first study, 85% of the learners identified at least one historical difference and overall had positive experiences working with the apps in the lab-based setting. In the second study, 94% of students identified at least one historical difference and also enjoyed working with the apps outside. Moreover, learners enjoyed interacting with the guide in the outdoor study significantly more than those in the lab.</p>
 
<p>Although the studies showed that learners were able to have positive learning outcomes in both a lab-based setting and an outdoor location-based setting, it seemed as though the learners on-site needed less scaffolding to identify historical differences. Learners seemed to report more enjoyment in post-session surveys during the outdoor study. The authors pointed to the fact that the tour guides changed, which may have had an effect on the learners’ enjoyment of the tour. However, they ultimately concluded that the two apps can be used together to support history learning in an enjoyable way.</p>
