<p><a href="http://www.efaqt.com/en/">eFaqt</a> makes a game of studying for tests. Many apps promise to make studying more <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/90">social</a> and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/893">efficient</a> or promote <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/438">digital versions</a> of classic study methods, but eFaqt combines these popular features into a single interface. The website helps users organize notes, crowdsource content from other users, summarize study points with flash cards and notes, and visualize concepts with a mind mapping game.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>eFaqt is a well-designed and highly structured tool for new researchers and seems like it could help facilitate the planning of intensive assignments like reading and thinking critically about a book or remembering many facts over an entire semester. The site seems best for high school and early higher education, especially in courses that focus around a common text to take advantage of the crowdsourcing and social features. eFaqt is currently free but does offer a pro upgrade that allows students to print their notes and summaries.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site works less well for open ended research. Students gathering and interpreting their own resources and developing more complex theses may do better work with a less structured system that can help them keep track of citations without pressing them to record many facts. The system is also rather new and some of the fields for adding new research works do not function properly. There are few research materials in the library at present and adding a new research work requires students to input a lot of information manually. Perhaps linking the system to an external database that could autocomplete entries would be a way to save students time and standardize content.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>eFaqt is a hearty combination of social studying and digital facsimiles of old cramming standbys like flashcards and summary notes. We know that these methods work for students and corralling these functions into a single web app is attractive. A bigger community on the site will help improve crowdsourcing and user experience on the system, but eFaqt seems ready to grow into an active place for test preparation.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>eFaqt is a cheerful site for serious study.</p>
