            Hello everyone,  

I have been here for a while and still have not blogged yet so I think this will be a great chance for me to introduce myself and my current work to all of you. 

It feels just great to finally join you guys. Working as a software developer, it is awesome to develop real life application and be a part of the brilliant developing team. I will be the guy surrounded by Hui Soo, Faisal and Chandler. You will find a very short bio of me on people@edla and i have a biting, snoring cat at home who I spent most of my free time with. 

The project I am currently working on is called "EdLab Data Dashboard".

The data dashboard is a central place for each application team to download the statistic data to write their respective reports. We are now aiming to provide data of the library website, PocketKnowledge, Teachers College Record, and Library Patron Traffic. Instead of going to different places to download the data needed to write the report, or asking someone to help you dump the data from the database, you can visit the dashboard and get the data you need.

Since the Dashboard is still under construction, you cannot test it right now. The attachment is a snapshot of the dashboard's UI. It is just a simple page, where you can select the application from the drop down menu and either type a date, or select a date from a pop-up calendar. And if you submit valid dates, the data will be output to a .csv file that you can download through a link. Currently, the data provided by the dashboard is raw data from each database, such as the number of on-campus searches on the library website during a certain period of time. As the project moves on, we are thinking of providing data analysis as well.

What do you think about it? What other features do you want the dashboard to have? How  to improve UI? Please feel free to comment if you have any question or ideas about the Data Dashboard.
