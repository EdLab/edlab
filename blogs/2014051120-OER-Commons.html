<p><i>OER Commons helps organizations reduce costs and be more effective
by using existing content and tools for teaching and learning.</i> (Quote from <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/products/">OER Commons</a> site)</p>

<p><b>Join the Open Educational Resource Movement!</b><br>
The Open Education Resource (OER) movement strives to be a boon for educators around the world. One of the initiatives to help this movement is the <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/">OER Commons</a>, a digital open educational resource library that provides free teaching, learning, and research resources to teachers all over the world. Created by <a href="http://www.iskme.org/">The Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education</a> with the noble purpose of providing all educators access to open learning resources to augment their curriculua, the digital library of open resources was successfully launched to the public with a grant from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_and_Flora_Hewlett_Foundation">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> in 2007.</p>

<p><b>Step into the Digital Library</b><br>
The OER Commons has one of the largest digital learning resource libraries available. The learning resources are free to use because they are either <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> or <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU</a> licensed. The types of free resources in the platform include full university courses complete with readings, videos of lectures at all levels, homework assignments, lecture notes, interactive mini-lessons, and simulations. Each resource has its own profile page that includes a very descriptive abstract. It also provides information on the resource’s author, subject, institution, collection, level, abstract, language, material type, media format, and tags. An interesting functionality of the open resource library is that educators are able to give a quick review of each resource by rating it on a five-star scale. Though all learning resources are free to use, some are licensed with limitations that require particular attribution, prevent adaptations, or limit commercial use. Every resource comes with conditions of use guidelines that are easy to understand. These guidelines inform users of the limits of each particular license.</p>

<p><b>A Mission to Level the Learning Playing Field</b><br>
This digital library could become a one-stop shop for all open educational resources. OER Commons seeks to level the learning playing field by providing free quality learning resources that any teacher can use, including teachers from schools with limited resources. The platform’s mission is not only to curate open learning resources but also to encourage educators to share their own open resources with the online community. Educators have access to this large database of learning resources and they can change or build upon the open content to fit their teaching needs.</p>
