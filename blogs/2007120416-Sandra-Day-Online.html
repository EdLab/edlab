          <p>
            One of the interesting things about going to the <a href="http://www.ncss.org/">NCSS conference</a> in San Diego is that I got to attend the keynote by Sandra Day O'Connor, former Supreme Court Justice.  What I found interesting about her keynote is when she talked about her new, post-retirement projects, one of which was <a href="http://www.ourcourts.org">OurCourts.org</a>, a collaboration between <a href="http://www.asu.edu">ASU</a> and <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu">Georgetown</a>.  What I found interesting about this project is that it is quite similar to the grant-funded projects that the EdLab has undertaken (such as the <a href="http://www.teachingthelevees.org">Levees project</a> or the <a href="http://finance.tc-library.org">NYS Finance Archive</a>), in that all have great ambitions for the creation of an interactive, web-based environment.  For example, the following passage about the project's <a href="https://www.ourcourts.org/node/5">mission</a> illustrates my point:

<blockquote>
As essential as the development and content creation, the Delivery phase of the Project ensures a dynamic, vibrant, and effective experience for teachers and students.  Our Courts provides educators with a set of resources at-their-fingertips (enabling them to assemble an engaging experience for their students) a set of tools to help teachers and students integrate new resources into their classroom experience as well as access online from school, home, or the community. 
</blockquote>

However, the problem with these and other web-based educational programs is that their mission statements are usually so ambitious that it seems unlikely that anyone will involved will ever say (or think) "Mission Accomplished" (not all things can be as clear-cut and  unambiguous as the Iraq War!).  Despite these limitations, it is reassuring to see that even those with power (or at least used to have power !?!) are undertaking roughly the same projects as those with less visibility and stature.  It is also somewhat amusing to see that the project homepage is an out-of-the-box distribution of <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, the content management system that runs <a href="http://www.aftered.tv">AfterEd</a> and the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu">EdLab</a> websites.  So in a sense, even if you are a former supreme court judge (or a project working with one), you are still stuck (or privileged?) to use the same ideas and tool sets.
