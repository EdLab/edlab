            There is never a shortage of good New Orleans music available for purchase, but three remarkable new CD releases are making this summer a particularly fruitful time for fans of the Big Easy sound.  Though each represents a distinctly different musical genre, all three bear the imprint of Katrina and are impressive reminders of the city's extraordinary ability to respond creatively to tragedy.

Trumpeter and composer <a href=http://www.terenceblanchard.com>Terence Blanchard</a>, a longtime collaborator of Spike Lee who helped score <i>When the Levees Broke</i> and is interviewed extensively in the film, has composed <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Tale-Gods-Will-Terence-Blanchard/dp/B000SUKPNY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-1847293-0853209?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1187027953&sr=8-1>A Tale of God's Will (A Requiem for Katrina)</a>, along with members of his band.  The 13-movement recording features four tracks based on music from <i>When the Levees Broke</i> and additional compositions, including “Ghost of Congo Square,” “In Time of Need,” and “Ghost of 1927.”   Writing in <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080900359_pf.html>The Washington Post</a> Geoffrey Himes calls <i>A Tale of God's Will</i> “a triumph, an extended jazz suite that maintains continuity from section to section, evokes a tragedy without words and inspires emotions worthy of its subject.”  Nate Chinen in <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/arts/music/12chin.html?_r=1&ref=music&oref=slogin>The New York Times</a> calls the album "a melancholy suite that fees both intensely personal and broadly cinematic."  (Chinen notes, by the way, that the cover picture of Blanchard playing his trumpet was photographed on the roof of his mother's newly rebuilt New Orleans home, the same home that provided one of the most touching moments in <i>When the Levees Broke</i> as Wilhelmina Blanchard first saw the ruins of the house after Katrina.)

<a href=http://www.marvawright.com/>Marva Wright</a>, the “Blues Queen of New Orleans,” lost everything in her New Orleans East home to Katrina.  Shortly after the levees broke, Wright sang at <a href=http://www.bluesartstudio.at/NeueSeiten/Marva%20Wright.html>her own benefit concert</a> in Baltimore, borrowing clothes for the occasion because her performance outfits were all lost in the flood.  Almost two years later, Wright is out with a new recording, <a href=http://www.amazon.com/After-Levees-Broke-Marva-Wright/dp/B000O77L5Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-1847293-0853209?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1187028969&sr=8-1>After the Levees Broke</a>, which features two tracks, “The Levee is Breaking Down” and “Katrina Blues” written by her bass player, Benny Turner.  “When I say ‘I lost everything,' I mean everything,” Wright said in a <a href=http://worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/20070726194947362>recent interview</a>.  “Every stick of furniture, every piece of clothing.  I don't even have a photograph of my mother and father anymore.  The reason <i>After the Levees Broke</i> is so important is first of all to show people that I'm back and still singing.  Secondly, I want to draw attention to New Orleans and what happened here.  Nobody can fully appreciate the devastation until they come here and see it for themselves.”

<a href=http://www.fatsdominoonline.com>Fats Domino</a> stayed in his Lower Ninth Ward home during Katrina and was widely presumed to have died in the floodwaters.  Though he and his family were rescued by the Coast Guard, much of his personal musical memorabilia was lost.  The Recording Industry Association of America and Capitol/EMI Records have decided to present Domino with <a href=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-09-2007/0004643142&EDATE=>reproductions of twenty sales awards</a> originally won for such megahits as “Ain't That a Shame” and “Blueberry Hill.”  Capitol is also releasing a new retrospective, <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Hits-Walking-New-Orleans/dp/B000S868Y6/ref=sr_1_3/105-1847293-0853209?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1187029810&sr=8-3>Greatest Hits: Walking to New Orleans</a> (yes, that's Fats singing the song of the same name on the closing credits of <i>When the Levees Broke</i>).  The album features 30 tracks, including all of Domino's biggest hits from the 1950s and ‘60s.  A benefit album featuring performances from a wide variety of artists (Paul McCartney, Elton John, B.B. King, Norah Jones, Neil Young, and Willie Nelson, among others,), entitled <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Goin-Home-Tribute-Fats-Domino/dp/B000SUKPH0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-1847293-0853209?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1187030073&sr=1-1>Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino,</a> is scheduled for release September 25, and will help fund the rebuilding of Fats Domino's home and local community programs.
