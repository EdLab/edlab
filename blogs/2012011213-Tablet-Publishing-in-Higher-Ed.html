          <p>
            In a land where paper was once king, digital has usurped the throne. And now, amidst changing media dynamics, it would seem that mobile is the heir apparent.  

Tablet usage is on the rise (worldwide tablet shipments are projected to be around the 70 million mark for 2012, up from 17 million in 2010).  Adding to that, the perception of tablet usage as helpful to the learning experience is high-- 86% of college students who own a tablet device have attested to this, according to a <a href="http://www.pearsonfoundation.org/downloads/PF_Tablet_Survey_Summary.pdf">Pearson Foundation survey</a>.  

A recent <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/06/tablet-publishing-education/">Mashable</a> article explains why publishing to tablets is fast becoming a popular trend for individuals and campuses nationwide.  These benefits are summarized below.

The benefits for...

Students:
- Back-breaking books be gone!
- Interactivity can be built in, making the experience more engaging

Educators:
- Can self-publish learning materials/research and distribute among tablet devices
- Can edit and publish content instantly
- Can use interactive technologies in class to support lessons of the day
- Can measure student usage through built in analytics and adapt lesson plans based on these stats

On campus publishing outlets
- Cost to publish is reduced as the same content can be delivered across multiple platforms
- Several schools are reimagining their own school newspapers for the tablet environment (e.g. Clemson University and University of Oregon), often without the need to rely on outside publishers or vendors
- Disseminating info is FAST

The fact that so many campuses (EdLab included) are dabbling in the unchartered territory of tablet publishing speaks to the heightened interest and possibly even the sustainability of this platform as it relates to education.  Long live King Digital... and longer live the prince!
