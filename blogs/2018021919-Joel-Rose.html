Joel Rose is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.newclassrooms.org/">New Classrooms</a>, a national non-profit aiming to personalize education by redesigning how classrooms work. Rose began his career in education as a fifth grade teacher. He has served in a variety of leadership roles in education, including as Chief Executive for Human Capital at the New York City Department of Education. Rose has published articles in <i>The Atlantic, Education Nation</i>, and <i>EdTech Magazine</i>. He has spoken at numerous conventions, including the Aspen Institute’s Ideas Festival, NBC’s Education Nation, the American Federation of Teachers, National School Boards Association, and National Association of Independent Schools. Rose earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Tufts University and a law degree from the University of Miami School of Law. He is a Pahara-Aspen Education Fellow at the Aspen Institute.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at New Classrooms?</b><br>
<p>I'm a former fifth grade teacher. I remember distinctly when I first began my career and looked at the data from my incoming students. Some were performing at a second grade level, others at an eighth grade level, and there was everything in between. I was given a set of fifth grade math textbooks and was told good luck.</p>
 
<p>I worked hard and cared quite a bit about the students in my classroom. But there was only so much I could do to meet the needs of those who had previously struggled while also challenging those at the top.  I thought there had to be a better way.</p>
 
<p>Later in my career, I was working with the Human Resources team at the New York City Department of Education. We were focused on how to best recruit, retain, and develop teachers and leaders from across the system. But at one point in that journey, we stopped to recognize that simply asking that question enables the same one-teacher-28-students-in-a-box model that's been in place for more than 100 years. Within that context, it's nearly impossible for any teacher to meet the unique needs of each student in their class.</p> 
 
<p>That's what put me on the path of developing new learning models that leverage the best of what teachers and technology can do.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at New Classrooms will change students’ approach to learning?</b><br>
<p>Schools today are largely organized around a standardized model that's oriented around teaching large groups of age-based cohorts. Students are expected to develop a set of skills and competencies based on their age; some do, but many don't.</p>
 
<p>We hope our work helps to catalyze a shift from a standardized approach to a personalized one, where students' instructional experiences are grounded in where they are academically and tailored to how they learn best. When this happens, students take more ownership over their learning because they are working in an environment that's oriented around their individual success.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think there are three. First, I think we are likely to see holistic learning models (like ours and others) begin to replace textbooks as the predominant classroom resource. These models integrate an academic component (with features such as learning progressions, skill maps, content, and assessment) with an operational component (with features such as student regrouping, planning for substitute teachers, and room acoustics) so that personalized learning can become a reality.</p>
 
<p>Second, we're going to see states begin to explore new assessment and accountability systems that are oriented around personalized learning. The current system is oriented around grade level standards. But what happens if a student walks into school three years behind? Or two years ahead? In both cases, this system signals to teachers they need to focus on grade level content regardless. It's a terrible waste of instructional time and has real social and emotional implications for students.</p>
 
<p>Finally, I think we will begin to see big data begin to help crack the code on the learning experiences that are most impactful for different students. Technology will never replace teachers. Learning is fundamentally a social and emotional process, and the teacher is the most critical ingredient in that process. But I do think big data will help students to access a more impactful instructional experience, while also helping to make the role of the teacher far more sustainable.</p>

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to New Classrooms?</b><br>
<p>I try to be a good husband and a good father to my son (12) and daughter (10).  Beyond that, there isn't time for much else.</p>
