<p>
<a href="http://www.edmodo.com/">Edmodo</a> combines a secure social network platform with the functionalities of a learning management system (LMS). The site, founded by <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/308">Nic Borg</a> and Jeff O'Hara, allows teachers and students to collaborate on assignments, share resources, and start discussions. Teachers can also privately share their learning resources with colleagues in their internal network. An interesting feature called <i>insights</i> measures the mood of the classroom based on positive or negative reaction responses by students working in Edmodo. Teachers also have access to a library that includes learning apps such as <a href="http://learnzillion.com/">LearnZillion</a> and <a href="http://www.subtext.com/">Subtext</a> which can be used within the platform.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Edmodo allows teachers to fully customize their online learning spaces. For example, instructors can personalize <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/44">badges</a> to recognize a student’s learned skills or knowledge. Teachers are able to directly connect with other teachers to share online resources with one another and form online discussions in subject-specific communities. The Insights feature integrates seamlessly with class activity; students are encouraged to select an emoticon with every post or assignment they complete to show how they felt about the task. Compiling these feelings gives teachers an overview of the classroom’s mood and the ability to respond quickly to student confusion or frustration.</p> 

<p>Edmodo provides a secure work space with private access for students and teachers. When teachers create an account they are given a unique code for student access. This facilitates the sign-up process for students. The code acts as a credential for minor students so they do not need to enter an email address. Student accounts are created after students are asked to answer a few questions about themselves.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Teachers using Edmodo are able to create very simple assignments and quizzes. The system would be more valuable if teachers were able to customize their content and add more visual and engaging elements. More options for creating assignments would give teachers the ability to create the best possible lessons for their students.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>The main draw of Edmodo is that it provides most of the functionalities of the usual LMS but in a social network package. The platform has a similar look and feel to one of the most popular social networks, so students will be able to navigate the site easily and spend less time learning how to use the technology and more time learning in class. The ability to discover new learning resources from other educators could be a great asset for teachers. The next step for this function would be for Edmodo to automatically recommend learning resources that help teachers teach a specific topic similar to the way Edmodo currently uses the information on a teacher’s profile to suggest connections with other teachers. Edmodo seems to focus more on its social functionalities and the insight feature is one of its most compelling. The ability to analyze immediate feedback from students and adjust lessons accordingly is one of the great strengths of this kind of technology.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Edmodo is the super social LMS.</p>
