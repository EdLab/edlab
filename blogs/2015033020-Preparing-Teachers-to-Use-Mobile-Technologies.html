<p>With the rapid spread of cell phone ownership among students and growing interest in making better use of mobile devices in classrooms, this study examined how teacher education programs were preparing teachers to make pedagogical use of mobile learning technologies.  Mobile technologies are a current trend in education with the potential to become pillars of teaching and learning in the future.  Many school administrators are specifically looking for teachers who can use mobile technologies with their students.</p>

<p>The authors drew on questionnaire data from 79 faculty members at colleges and universities across the United States to assemble information on how technology was used in selected programs.  They found that teachers at fifteen institutions reported that they were beginning to explore mobile technology and those at eight institutions said they were in the planning phases for purposefully integrating mobile technologies into their teacher education curriculums. Only six institutions had a full curriculum for integrating mobile technology into teacher education.</p>

<p>The researchers sought to understand the pedagogies and practices of teacher education programs for integrating mobile technologies. They found that while some teacher education programs were using mobile technologies, they failed to integrate them in intentional or global ways. As a result, early career teachers were not well prepared to understand the pedagogy of mobile technologies in the classroom or how to integrate such technologies into their curriculum. </p>

<p>The authors determined that more research and a better understanding of best practices must be generated and shared with the teacher education community. The implication for teacher educators is pressure to develop a more robust integration of technology into their curriculum. Developing best practices and building skills will also require creating teaching communities that share what works and what doesnâ€™t so that teachers can build on the experiences of others.</p>
