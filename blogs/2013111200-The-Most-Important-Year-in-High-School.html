            There is a popular notion that 11th grade is the most important high school year. Educators, counselors, parents and even students often cite 11th grade as the final year to impress colleges as it is would be the most recent indicator of one's academic performance when applying for college. However, there has been a recent focus on the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/ninth-grade-the-most-important-year-in-high-school/281056/">ninth grade as the make or break year for students</a>, especially those in urban public schools. Recent research on ninth grade makes for grim reading. Ninth graders have the lowest GPA, most missed classes, and more misbehavior referrals than any other high-school grade level. There is a lot of contributing natural and social factors that make freshman year in high school so important to student's long-term success. There is the natural element of physical growth (“raging hormones” as noted in the hyperlinked piece) mixed with the usual pressures of a new school surrounding such as finding friends and peer pressure.

In an effort to buck the ninth grade trend aforementioned, educators and policy makers are focusing their efforts on three key components: attendance, grades and behavior. Some high schools, such as Flushing High School in Queens, are also deploying different tactics and programs to keep students engaged enough to return for 10th grade. In my Education and Public Policy class, my group is currently conducting a case study on New York City public schools (demographics, financing, educational outcomes, etc.,). In our research, we found that there was a huge drop-off in enrollment from 10th to 11th grade (data is a few years old). We concluded (along with the other NYC case study group) that 10th grade, at least in New York City, is where most students drop out of high school.

I wonder what policies and programs mayor-elect and his new education commissioner will implement to engage and keep students in school beyond the first few years of high school.
