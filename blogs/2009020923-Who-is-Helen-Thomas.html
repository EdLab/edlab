          <p>
            As President Barack Obama gave his inaugural news conference tonight, I noticed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Thomas">Helen Thomas</a> was once again among the host of reporters gathered at the White Thomas. Thomas is a decorated White House reporter who has covered every sitting president starting with John F. Kennedy.

As one of the first female journalists to cover presidential politics, Thomas has seen her share of historic moments during her nearly 50 years of reporting at the White House. She has also had her share of run-ins with presidents as well. During presidential press conferences and daily White House press briefings, Thomas can usually be seen sitting in the front row, but that changed during George W. Bush's tenure as President. Thomas publicly expressed her dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, especially the Iraqi War, and as such she was banished to the back row for most of Bush's presidency. She has however regained her traditional front row seat as she sat in the front row during Obama's conference. 

So how is Helen Thomas relevant to the EdLab? Last term, the Development & Research team created classroom materials based on the HBO documentary, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/docs/docuseries/helenthomas/index.html">Thank You Mr. President: Helen Thomas at the White House</a>. The film, which is about forty minutes long, features footage of Thomas with all the presidents she has covered as well as Thomas' own reflection on her illustrious career at the White House. At 89 years old, Thomas' combative nature is as strong as ever judging by her questioning of Obama about terrorist havens in Pakistan and nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. It is also worth noting that Thomas created the now signature saying “Thank You Mr. President” at the end of presidential press conferences.
