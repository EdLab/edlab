<p><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> is an online tool to 3D design and 3D print your own creations. From students to teachers to professional designers, Tinkercad supplies a platform designed to be accessible, educational, and useful.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Open Tinkercad, and you see a 3D work plane built on graph paper. On the right is a toolbar with 18 basic shapes, letters and numbers, symbols, connectors, and circuit assemblies. The latter comes with wires, lights, and batteries you can play with to make electronic creations. After dragging figures onto the work plane, Tinkercad gives you an incredible amount of control over the shape’s dimensions. You can decide the basic dimensions, rotate objects, combine them with others, or use them to cut holes into other objects. You can also easily rotate the workplane to get different angles on your creations. While my creations were simple and not quite worth bragging about, other users have shared amazing 3D designs they’ve created, which you can 3D print as well.</p>
 
<p>Amazingly, you don’t need design experience to use Tinkercad because it comes with built-in lessons to guide you through the foundations of the platform. These lessons are incredibly helpful, especially since Tinkercad is pretty complex, but only because it packs in loads of tools and tons of flexibility. It reminds me of Photoshop in this sense, but for 3D design. This educational aspect of Tinkercad makes it accessible for even young students, although it will definitely challenge them too! Students will particularly like the Minecraft blocks and Legos building options.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While the lessons are a fantastic, and necessary, component of Tinkercad, I was disappointed they did not offer more feedback when I made mistakes. For instance, the lessons would let me pass even when I intentionally slipped up the instructions. For young kids, this extra guidance and feedback would be particularly useful.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Tinkercad is a perfect tool for students working with 3D design, especially if they have access to a 3D printer to see their creations come to fruition. I could especially see Tinkercad in makerspaces or afterschool clubs. Because it offers an incredible amount of complexity and flexibility, Tinkercad is also an ideal tool for adult designers.</p>
