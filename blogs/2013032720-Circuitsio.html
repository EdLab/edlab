<p>
<a href="http://www.circuits.io/">Circuits.io</a> helps users create and share digital circuit designs with a large open hardware community for support. The site provides a free circuit design tool that allows users to construct a digital schematic or a <a href="http://www.thegadgetsblog.com/what-pcb-what-every-gadget-electronics-enthusiast-should-know/">printed circuit board (PCB)</a> to visualize their circuit ideas before implementing them on actual hardware. Users can browse through a database of different circuit designs created by other users. If a user selects a circuit design created by another user that piques their interest, they have the option to copy the design (referred to as "forking") and make their own edits. The option is available to purchase circuit boards from the site based on user designs. Circuits.io also provides a few video lessons on how to design a circuit. Though the platform was designed to help advance the <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-11/ff_openmanufacturing?currentPage=all">open hardware movement</a> there is potential for it to become a valuable learning tool in circuit design.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The online community on Circuits.io is very open to sharing their work. Other users may provide feedback on a specific circuit design through the discussion function that is available on the circuit design page. This is a great example of an open community voluntarily helping one another, a pattern that has been <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/302">shown to</a> encourage innovation. On the same page users can view the statistics of the circuit design: how many views it has received and its download and order count. This gives users a good idea of how popular the circuit design is within the Circuits.io community.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The platform provides some lesson videos on creating and designing circuits, but they are few in number. If Circuits.io allowed users to upload their own video lessons it would increase their video lesson library and increase the social learning factor of the platform.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Circuits.io provides a space for users to create, share, discuss, and purchase circuit designs. The online community is very open to sharing their designs and helping other users to improve their designs. The platform allows users with considerable knowledge in circuit design to practice and learn through the community. This aspect of the system makes it seem like the platform is geared toward experts in the field. Hopefully the platform will grow to include more learning content for beginners in circuit design to encourage them to improve their skills and make a smooth transition to becoming experts in the field.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Circuits.io helps users create and discover better circuits.</p>
