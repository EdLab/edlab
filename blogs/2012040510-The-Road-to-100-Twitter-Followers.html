I know 100 isn't necessarily <a href="http://klout.com/home">"Kloutworthy,"</a> but growing the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/TCRecord">@TCRecord</a> follower base from 50-odd to 100+ in just under 2 months feels like a minor accomplishment.  

The following are my thoughts on Twitter "best-practices" and it would be great if you could add your own Twitter tips and wisdom in the comments below. 

<b>Twitter Tips for Institutional and App-based Accounts:</b>

<b>Editorial...</b>
-Try to never repeat content! 

-Work-out a framework and rotation for content before starting to Tweet - for example... feature only original content from, about or by your institution and peers.  

-Test new ideas... the framework listed above is important... but don't be afraid to try new strategies! 

<b>Using Google Analytics...</b>
-Remember that people are constantly checking their Twitter feeds... but most likely this corresponds to meal-times: morning, afternoon and evening.  

-Also, best not to only Tweet at one time of day.  Check-out your site's analytics diplayed by hour to see when spikes in site visits occur.    

-Try tweeting based on most popular search terms on your listed in your analytics account.  

<b>Opinion...</b>
-Try to stay-away from opinion if you are Tweeting for an institution or app, try to deliver unbiased tasty facts linked to content.  

For example: “Read the Review:" instead of, “Read the Amazing Review:...”  

<b>Re-tweets, "follows" and @'s...</b>
-Only re-tweet people and institutions you want as followers and be sure what you are re-tweeting is furthering your mission and adding to your work. 

-Also, only follow accounts you would want as followers and do so selectively... that being said, nothing re-starts a stalled Twitter following like strategically following a few like-minded accounts who might be interested in your content. 

-To be efficient only Tweet @handles with over 1K followers. 

-When you feature a company's site, product or even a publisher's book review tweet it @ the group most invested in its success... the co. or publisher.  That way, they can re-tweet for you.   

<b>###'s...</b>
-Search for ALL #hashtags on Twitter to “vet” before using... could have a majorly negative association you are unaware of!  

-Finally, be prepared that your hashtag could get “hijacked” as McDonald's  <a href="http://www.marchpr.com/blog/2012/01/mcdonalds-hashtag-horror-story/">learned the hard way</a>... 

<b>I am excited to share thoughts and additions to this "best-practice" list!</b>
