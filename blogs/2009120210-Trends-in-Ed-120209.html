            A few stories have come to light recently concerning technology and privacy. Brief summaries, and how they may impact the education sector, are available below. <br>
<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=190423927130">Facebook Changes Network Privacy Settings</a>
Facebook has recently changed its privacy model. Concerned about the sheer size of many networks in Facebook, and how information is being shared in networks, the Facebook team has decided to restrict content settings to:
<li>friends.
<li>friends of your friends.
<li>everyone.</li>
You can no longer include an entire network in your privacy settings. While these simple settings are great for the user, it does cause some potential problems for the networks. School networks, for example, may have trouble gaining information from users because a user can only share with everyone in that network by adding each user individually or opening his/her account to everyone on Facebook. Do you believe the new settings will hinder a university's attempt to build networks in Facebook?<br>
<a href="http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2009/12/8-million-reasons-for-real-surveillance.html">Sprint Has Released GPS  Data Over 8 Million Times</a>
Sprint has a Web portal that allows law enforcement officials, with no court order or probable cause, to locate a Sprint customer using the cell phone grid. Also available is all of your cell phone "metadata":URLs of sites visited, e-mail message headers, numbers dialed, GPS locations, etc. This is completely legal according <a href+'http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/5823.ars">a 2005 court ruling</a>. While the majority of us are not concerned with the criminal content of our metadata, we should be concerned about the intellectual property we access and create using our cell phones. It is hard to imagine that all 8 million requests were generated as a result of a criminal investigation. If law enforcement officials do not need a legitimate reason  to access your information on the Sprint network, do you believe companies will start restricting an employee's ability to access company IP via a cell phone? Keep in mind that the definition of a law enforcement officer is very broad and this includes any local authorities as well as federal authorities.<br>
<a href="http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/social_network/social_networking_FOIA_complaint_final.pdf">EEF Sues the Federal Government</a>
The CIA and other federal agencies have used social networks to track criminals, locate sex offenders, investigate terrorist threats, etc. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit Internet rights watchdog group, as filed a lawsuit in California asking the federal government to reveal the guidelines they use for social network investigations or data collection. According to the EEF, there are no publicly available documents that outline what the federal government is or is not allowed to collect through social networks. Your Facebook privacy settings are irrelevant when it comes to the Feds.
