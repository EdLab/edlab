So much software, so little time. <p><a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lynda.com/id356169777?mt=8">Lynda.com</a> is a world-leader in online training. Course videos are led by content experts who help you master the software you need to know. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Courses cover broad areas like business skills, creative design, as well as technology—including practically any popular software you can think of within these fields. Software is taught through a diverse selection of videos from the expansive Lynda library. Videos are normally available across skill levels, appealing not only to the raw newbie but also the savvy expert looking for the latest trick or shortcut. Also, video offerings are often led by content experts, many of whom literally wrote the book on your software. </p>

<p>Lynda.com is available to students enrolled in most post-secondary institutions. As such, if you are currently enrolled as a student, there is literally no price of admission. Just log in, watch, and learn—it’s that simple. </p>

<p>Given its maturity as a service, Lynda.com provides the smooth learning experience you would expect as well as the little touches that aren’t essential, but helpful. Your course history can be synced across devices—you can seamlessly pick up lessons where you left off no matter if you’re on your laptop or tablet. Airplay enables you to stream course videos to your TV to maximize ease of use, allowing you to learn in the comfort of your living room. You can even "binge learn" using autoplay if desperation kicks in. Courses can be shared across social media to promote collaborative learning with colleagues. For those with intermittent connectivity, full courses can be downloaded for offline viewing. This can be incredibly useful for rural folk or urban dwellers at the mercy of spotty home WiFi as they face strict deadlines to master a piece of software. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Probably the biggest limitation with this service is its focus on video. If you learn well by screening videos online, fantastic, Lynda is the answer. However, it may not be as useful for those who learn best through personal interaction, textbooks, or other modalities. The associated video transcripts can help fill-in-the-gap for those learners who are more text-centric. However, such transcripts can be less well organized than well prepared text.</p>
 
<p> Although it is offered freely through institutional accounts, purchasing individual Lynda licenses can become pricey. The Monthly Premium account is currently $34.99, while the Annual Premium Account goes for $399.99—relatively steep for a strapped student living in a freeware world. Due to the reliance on individual instructors, quality can be hit-or-miss. Some teachers are best-in-class, while others induce coma. Further, there is no licensed accreditation system for completing a course. As such, although you could learn a great deal from a Lynda course, it may not improve your career prospects. Finally, although its offerings are wide-ranging, they are not fully comprehensive. Lesser-known, under-subscribed software is not included, which can be problematic for those who need to rely on freeware. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Lynda.com is a highly-regarded industry leader with a well-deserved reputation for excellence in online video training. Its market dominance allows it to host a roster of the very best teachers—those who already have a successful career in online learning. However, in the face of a hot MOOC market, Lynda may eventually be challenged for its top position. Until that point, if you enjoy learning with video, are a little apprehensive about technology, feel lonely working on computers, and want to learn almost any industry leading piece of software, go visit Lynda. And if you are a post-secondary student with an institutional account, you have nothing to lose by giving it a try. </p>
