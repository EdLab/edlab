          <p>
            It's fascinating to know that even though our parents know how the media (television and the internet) is very influential today, they still want to be stewards as to how their kids use digital technologies. According to this article, <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/kids-technology-home-young-children-douglas-rushkoff">Young Kids and Technology at Home</a>, parents who grew up in the 70's and 80's have a variety of concerns as to why they want to limit their children's exposure to technology among them concern about the rays that may harm their eye, which my parents so all the time and other censored stuff. There is no doubt children tend to know more about technology than their parents due to the advances that have been made over the two generations. As more and more technology continues to be turned out, parents have had a hard time knowing what exactly their children do with technology on daily basis.

Exposure to technology may also lead some children to adopt online personalities that they may eventually bring into their lives, often to their detriment. The article also states children under the age of two shouldn't watch TV because it is around this age where they start developing their sense of a 3D world, among others and may inhibit some of their 3D spatial awareness. Though they can't control their children's overall use of technologies, parents can oversee their children's activities and manage their digital media use in accordance with their age.
