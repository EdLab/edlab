          <p>
            On Wednesday evening I ventured down to the 335 Madison Ave, the area around Grand Central Station to attend an edtech event hosted by Harvard University and held in the spacious former offices of Facebook. Now the space is part of co-worker/incubator space run by <a href="http://www.grandcentraltech.com/">Grand Central Tech</a>.

The evening began with networking, and as it was also an alumni event, I found many peers I hadn't seen for awhile doing interest work in edtech. One person in particular was trying to created a gamified language learning program that I found particularly exciting. 

The dynamic panel was chaired by Perry Hewitt who is the Chief Digital Officer at Harvard University. Witty and exceptionally knowledgeable of the edtech space, she made an excellent moderator. She effortlessly moved equally between the three panelists, asking them to respond to each other, and pushing them on hard questions in edtech.

The panel featured Mercedes Bent (<a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>, Head of New Ventures), Kelly Peeler (<a href="https://www.nextgenvest.com/">NextGenVest</a>, Founder & CEO), and Tom Segal (<a href="http://rteducation.com/">Rethink Education</a>, Investor).

Interesting themes that emerged in the discussion included accredation (and will it replace the college degree or at least offer a competative edge) and consumerism (how do we distinguish between companies looking to make a buck and ones with the interest of education in mind).

Tom Segal discussed the kind of work he does and the kinds of things his company likes to invest in. He said Rethink sees a lot of edtech focused on consumerism. Their company, however, is interested in sustainable educational companies selling directly to institutions. Their company only invests in edtech.

NextGenVest held the student as the most important. According to Kelly, all content is developed in conjunction with students. One of their central foci is financial advisement for students and developing ways to encourage student entrepreneurism. All of their lessons range from 1-3 minutes, so that any kind of student can take them in any kind of situation. They are also an incubator for startups.

General Assembly garnered the most interest and was the subject to the most questions. They started as an in-person, grass root co-worker space. They continue to focus on an in-person community-centered approach and still only 5% online is online which they see as setting themselves apart from the MOOC hype. They have recently partnered with the New School and are looking for more ways to partner with institutions of higher Ed. Their average student is 30, and their students range from 18-70.

After the panel, the networking continued. A hot topic for the even was AltSchool's recent $100 Million gift (see here for more: https://www.altschool.com/press-release-5-4-15)

Please feel free to ask me any questions!
