<a href="https://twitter.com/Connie_Chow">Dr. Connie Chow</a>, is an advocate for not only the advancement of young women in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) fields, but also for disadvantaged women across a wide spectrum of ages and backgrounds.  Chow, who describes herself as a "humanistic science educator" is also the first Executive Director of <a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/">Science Club for Girls</a> (look for the NewLearningTimes.com coverage of Science Club for Girls soon).  Chow has led the group since 2006 in creating meaningful opportunities for girls to interact with scientists and engineers.  Many of the Science Club for Girls participants are from under-resourced communities, and engaging them in hands-on STEM explorations and careers is crucial to helping the US address the growing STEM gender divide.   Chow also co-founded the <a href="http://www.bostongirlsstem.org/">Boston Area Girls STEM Collaborative</a> to help further fill in the gaps in STEM outreach.  Chow is a member of the Massachusetts Academy of Sciences and was included in <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2012/02/mass-high-tech-names-20-women-to-watch.html">Mass High Tech’s 2012 Women to Watch</a>.  Chow is also a member of the steering committee for the Women’s Human Rights program for AIUSA and served on the Board of Directors of low-income women’s advocacy group, <a href="http://survivorsinc.org/">Survivors, Inc.</a>.  Additionally, Chow has worked as an assistant professor in Biology at Simmons College, where she was the co-PI on an NSF-funded summer program for Boston public middle school youth and teachers.  Chow received her Ph.D. in virology from Harvard University and completed postdoctoral training at the Harvard School of Public Health.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I attended an all-girls, English language private school from 1st to 12th grade in Hong Kong. The British system obligated 7th graders to choose either a science- or social studies-focused track. Even so, I still took music, physical education, and yes domestic science, and had to sit for public exams in Chinese language, history, literature etc.  This opportunity taught me the personal value of a well-rounded education, and also the immense power of a well-rounded education to level class difference.
<p> 
I attended a university in the US where the majority of people held conservative, stereotyped views of gender roles. Fortunately, I had a wonderful mentor and professor, Bill Bradshaw, who not only invested in my intellectual development, but also shared my outrage at the limitations that society and culture place on women and girls.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I inherited an NSF project while an assistant professor at Simmons College. Over the course of 6 months I worked with Boston Public School teachers and my colleagues to develop a program for their middle school students. During those 6 weeks in the summer, I was impressed by their motivation and capacity to learn when difficult (read college level) materials and challenges were placed in context for them. I realized the power of out-of-school-time learning and the importance of making STEM relevant, and how important the element of fun is! 
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> One of the best compliments we received from a parent was that her daughter didn't realize she was learning science because she was having so much fun. The second best compliment was when an alumna said the sisterhood she developed at Science Club for Girls was essential for supporting her academically. By this she, and others, meant being and feeling accountable to each other in their academic and personal lives, the sense of team and collaboration, and the emotional connection with like-minded individuals. As the after school field sheds its image of being the bastard child of education, I hope we can model for schools how to effectively blur the lines between play and learning, and marry affect and rigor.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?
<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We should heed the saying that "all I needed to know I learned in kindergarten." In this case, interdisciplinary, project- or theme-based learning.  Universities spent the last 300 years separating the disciplines. Similarly, science found it necessary to take a reductionist approach, creating the various branches. High schools have followed suit. Now that the academy has been embracing multidisciplinary, integrative approaches for more than a decade, I hope translating these trends to middle and high school curricula will take place speedily, riding the wave of the Common Core. As the cost of terabytes continues to drop and digital natives become a significant portion of the population, the kindergarten trend also includes the diminishing privilege of the written word in communicating learning, and the continuing rise of image and spoken word as valid representations.
<p>
There is now a convergence between educators and corporate executives that we have sacrificed critical thinking and creativity at the altar of teaching to high stakes tests. We've already seen the ability of education technology to customize individual student learning to master basic skills. There’s much excitement around STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts & design, and mathematics). Meaningful collaboration between school-day teachers, after school and extended learning time programs can provide space, time and motivation for richer, more satisfying learning experiences for our curious children.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We are catching up and creating online modules to complement in-person training of our volunteers and teen mentors. This will help set the stage up for other organizations to adopt our model. Not only do we want to create a national movement to engage girls in STEM, the next big project is to do so around the world with a focus on lower-income countries!
