            <i>Once upon a time, there lived a sad king.  He saw himself as a visionary but throughout the land, he was seen as a trouble-making loon. But, this is not why he was unhappy.  For, you see, the king noticed something upsetting happening in his kingdom: The brightest young citizens in the land could not go to the “best” schools but yet, the students at said schools were seen as the smartest and most talented, regardless of actual faculties.  “Ah,” said the king, “So, it is not the student who brings value to the school, but the school who gives the student value.  Should not it be the other way around?” </i>
 
Hear ye hear ye, meet thy king: <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel">Peter Thiel</a>, co-founder of PayPal.  Thiel has a penchant for starting controversy but this one has got to be up there.  Thiel and Founders Fund managing partner, Luke Nosek, developed the “20 under 20” program in the fall of 2010 in which they will select the best 20 young people under 20 and pay them $100,000 over the course of 2 years to drop out of college and start a business instead.  Thiel, a serial entrepreneur himself,  believes that the experience of creating and launching one's own business is invaluable and cannot be taught in schools.  Moreover, he wants to prove that the college you attend should not determine what someone can and cannot do with their lives.  

The final 20 participants will be decided within the coming weeks.  

But, will this experiment end happily ever after? 

To be continued...
