<a href="http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/GearyEvoEd.pdf">Geary, David C. (2002) Principles of Evolutionary Educational Psychology.  Learning and Individual Differences.  12 (317-345).</a>

One of my guilty pleasures is reading evolutionary psychology, and looking to see if the controversial discipline has anything to say about education, I found this paper by David C. Geary, author of the excellent “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Origin-Mind-Evolution-Cognition-Intelligence/dp/1591471818">Origin of Mind</a>.”  The question going in (as it always is in evolutionary psychology) is: can we glean some useful (and usable) information from the theories put forth, or is it all just circular reasoning?  
<!--break-->
Review:
Our evolutionary history has endowed us, claims Geary with a few (domain-specific) conceptual systems for understanding our environment, which Geary labels “folk” systems.  These include folk psychology, folk physics, and folk biology.  Our natural tendency as children will therefore be a motivation to learn about the world under the paradigm of these folk systems, thereby attaining a specifically circumscribed kind of knowledge.

The more our communal and cultural knowledge changes, the less we can rely on these innate systems to naturally educate our children.  As Geary puts it: 

“The gap between folk knowledge and the forms of competency needed for successful living in modern society is predicted to result in an accompanying mismatch between the inherent and preferred motivational and activity biases of children and the forms of activity needed for secondary learning.”

What Geary offers in this paper is a basic heuristic to aid in determining for which subjects students will require motivational encouragement and specific instruction, and for which they can be granted a fair amount of autonomy to learn on their own.  This image from the paper illustrates how different subjects compare:

This may sound a lot like simple common sense (and maybe it is), but it also cuts across the progressive learn by doing vs. traditional rote memorization debate in education by arguing that the proper technique will depend on the subjects relationship to our cognitive architecture.  Unfortunately Geary confines himself to simply laying out the theoretical outlines of the issue, relying on future scholars for the spadework, so I'm not sure how much practical help this approach has been, at least so far.

Edlab Relevance:
Although Geary confines his argument to the subject of learning, I think his theory has some implications for the environment of learning as well, although by even thinking in these terms I become vulnerable to the usual charges about EP's “just-so stories.”   My guess, to continue a theme I suddenly realize I've been pushing for a while, is that by removing children from the traditional environment of learning, which usually involves emulation of adult activities through direct observation in a social context, online learning is going to have a harder job motivating and instructing, and a partial solution might be in developing (possibly clunky) emulations of traditional learning environments.
