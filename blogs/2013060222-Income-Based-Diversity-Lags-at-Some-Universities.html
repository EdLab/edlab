          <p>
            Before I came to this country, I always thought that everything was easy to obtain and that everyone was treated fairly. However, I've come to realize that everything was not what I thought to be. I learned that you really have to work hard if you want to achieve great things, but your status in society can become a blockade to your pursue for success. In terms of going to college, I never imagined that choosing a school was based on a lot of factors such as: the SAT, ACT, GPA, and socioeconomic background. Race and ethnicity are two factors that are bias and shouldn't be use for admission process, but this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/education/college-slots-for-poorer-students-still-limited.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0">article</a> partially reflects on how some elite public and private schools still consider race and ethnicity as a factor for admission. Nonetheless, opponents of race-based affirmative action in college admission encourage colleges to find other ways to promote diversity and enroll more socioeconomic disadvantaged students.

Pell Grants are a factor that benefits every student but is highly beneficial for low and moderate-income students. As a result, the number of poor students enrolled in selective schools is lower.  For instance, University of California's system has more than 40 percent of its students who receive Pell Grant, while the University of Michigan, which is similar in selectivity and prestige has only 16 percent of undergraduates who receives Pell Grants. Some of the factors that explains the difference in the number of socioeconomic disadvantaged students enrolled in these two similar elite public schools are: state budget support, the intensity of recruitment efforts, and legacy admission.  In terms of recruitment, the University of California has created an outreach program that searches for and prepares low-income students for college. These programs are really helpful because there might be some low-income students who are really good candidates for prestigious schools and might just need that little push to keep moving on. On the other hand, the University of Michigan has made an effort to create outreach programs for low-income students but those programs are small.

The next factor is the Legacy admission; it really shows why a disadvantaged student has a small chance of being enrolled in college when he is competing for admission with a student who has a family member as an alumni at the particular university or parents are donors of the university. Many universities have terminated this factor in their admission process but the University of Michigan is still one of the other universities that work with the legacy admission. I believe that this will be a good topic for a debate. Some people may agree with Michigan for continuing the legacy admission, while others will rebuff this decision. I really feel that it is unfair because why should a student lose the chance of attending a school he/she has dreamt about (surpassing all qualification purpose) to someone who has earn an admission to the school just because of legacy. Universities should find ways to enroll more low-income students and eliminate any bias decision making policy.
