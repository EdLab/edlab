          <p>
            There is a brilliant interview floating around the internets in which <a href="http://oreilly.com/oreilly/tim_bio.html">Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly Media </a> discusses the future of Web 3.0.  However, I can't for the life of me, find this video anywhere.  Trust me, it exists & if you find it, please post the url as a comment to this blog post.  In the meantime, let me quickly summarize this video-based interview in one word... SENSORS. 

O'Reilly mentions sensors and the subsequent automated analysis of sensor data as the most important element of the next big technology and web-based movement.  While not new to the world, the far-reaching and wide-spread adoption of sensors for data retrieval, dispersal and computation is genuinely poised to be game-changing.   

For the past few years I have earnestly tracked the launch and subsequent success of sensor based companies, services and research initiatives.   From <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">FitBit</a>, <a href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings</a>, and <a href="http://www.neurovigil.com/">NeuroVigil</a> to <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/">MIT's Senseable Cities lab</a>, sensors are the driving force behind these winning companies.  Connectivity between multiple devices, seamless, streamlined human interfaces that allow ease of use, rapid automated analysis and graphing of data, seem to be the magic ticket to sensor-based success.  It is not enough to have a sensor simply collect & spit-out data, the cornerstone of a consumer hit is a product's rapid synthesis, analysis and visualization of these results.    

Interestingly, sensors for sensor's sake seem to almost never exist.  For a sensor to be present, it must serve a human or machine-based need and provide data of some sort.  It may seem obvious, but can you think of a superfluous sensor?    

<b>If O'Reilly and others are right, and data collection and analysis via sensors and their interfaces are the way of the future, what role will sensors play in our schools?  What are potential uses for sensors beyond the classic pedometer or physics lab impact monitor?</b>  

Sensor data could be grabbed from the physical structure of the school.  For example, a sensor could check-in students as they cross a threshold or track the movement of vehicles in and out of the school property, thus eliminating the need to divert instructional time to attendance taking.  

Students with special needs could make use of haptic sonar and sensor-enabled instructional devices and materials.  The <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1007">proximity sensor cane</a> for the blind is a great example of sensor-based adaptive technology.   

In addition, the science classroom could add sensor integration to beakers, flasks and measurement apparatus and could then synch to programs like <a href="http://www.latenitelabs.com/">Late Night Labs</a> virtual wet lab or even just an instructor's computer.  <a href="http://www.materialsworldmodules.org/modules/smart_sensors.shtml">Here</a> is a module-based science lesson that incorporates sensors. 

Physical fitness and nutrition educators could integrate tools like <a href="http://nikerunning.nike.com/nikeos/p/nikeplus/en_US/plus/#//dashboard/">Nike+</a> or <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">FitBit</a> data into class instruction.  And to take biometric data even further, schools could monitor student biorhythms to select the best time to deliver optimal instruction, testing and activity to <a href="http://www.aea11.k12.ia.us/prodev/MSPN/minutes/planning.pdf">better work with student's natural rhythms instead of against them</a>.  

<b>Now for the pitfalls...</b>
With great power, comes great responsibility.  Plainly, big companies will now have even more opportunity to turn our devices against us, by gaining access to sensitive personal information with very little existent oversight and regulation.  Imagine the ramifications if health insurance companies were able to access your FitBit data and make coverage decisions based on their findings?  

This is a potential Orwellian dilemma, with rich data and easy integration with your existent devices on one side, and big companies with vested interests ready to exploit your data on the other.  

As proven by Apple's recent criticism for <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1008">tracking and storing users location data</a> (fittingly this is an O'Reilly media-produced video), sensor-based devices may at first appeal to consumers for their functionality and ease of data collection, and later provide a source of controversy as it is revealed that "Big Company's" use of this data is not in-line with user expectations or the device's stated purpose.
