<p><i>"InnovateEDU convenes students, teachers, entrepreneurs, and designers to re-imagine and reinvent education by putting students’ and teachers’ needs at the heart of design." </i> (<a href="https://www.innovateedunyc.org">InnovateEDU</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Eliminating the Achievement Gap with Modern Learning Tools</b></p>

<p>Educators, policy-makers, and families alike are concerned about achievement gaps among students across the country, but one organization, InnovateEDU, is hoping to address this problem with practical, intuitive learning tools. The Brooklyn-based non-profit collaborates with leaders in education, design, and technology to develop learning models and tools that serve, inform, and enhance teaching and learning. InnovateEDU hopes that by aligning their tools with Common Core standards, they will be easy to integrate into the classroom, while their creativity will be compelling and engaging, encouraging continued student use while effectively increasing student learning in literacy and math. </p>

<p>One of these tools is Catalyst Literacy, an online game-based platform focused on developing the writing skills of high-needs students in urban schools. Catalyst pays special attention to language learners and students with disabilities by allowing students to move at their own pace while still engaging in rigorous, relevant academic content. In creating programs like Catalyst, InnovateEDU hopes to ensure that more students graduate from high school and are set up for success in college and their chosen career paths.</p>

<p><b>Partnerships with Local Schools</b></p>

<p>InnovateEDU also partners with organizations to educate students, provide tutoring, and offer professional development to teachers. Much of their work with students has occurred at the Brooklyn Laboratory Charter School, where alternatives to a traditional schooling model are provided through tools like Cortex, an online personal learning platform developed by InnovateEDU. Additionally, InnovateEDU is currently in the process of starting an edtech accelerator that will be located within the school.</p>

<p>By training educators to improve the sustainability of academic achievement and incorporate these technologies in the classroom, InnovateEDU aims to develop learning environments that can foster the success of all students, no matter their background.</p>
