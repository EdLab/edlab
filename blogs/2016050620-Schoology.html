<p>Notebook planners are a thing of the past with <a href="https://www.schoology.com/">Schoology,</a>  a learning management system for everyone from middle school aged students to collegiates. It collects the aspects of the school community and schedule by hosting all school activities (courses, homework, assemblies, games) in a centralized place. Notifications from your social and educational lives can easily be synced to mobile devices, so that all of the players in the academic network are integrated for improved communications and events. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Schoology is a system that my high school and middle school students were using. Instructor assignments and course schedules were clearly organized in the platform. My students took to the systems just like any other technology—with natural ease. My sixth grade student navigated his coursework and assignments with the comfort and grace he did with Minecraft. My sophomore student was never unclear about her scheduled tasks and weekly expectations. If an assignment wasn’t in a folder, it simply didn’t exist. Any confusion about due dates and outlines were completely avoided here. If there were murky instructions or an unclear requirement, students could post to the discussion board, which was regularly monitored.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Even though the interface has successfully integrated most necessary tools for student classes, like schedules, assignments, and cohort lists, the only feature of Schoology that may be nonessential is the communication forum. The forum is designed to sync with school events, activities, and general teacher and student inquiries; however, my students personally never used the feature. Moreover, my younger student even mentioned how rarely he saw posts. Any efforts made to stimulate discussion in this space usually fell on deaf ears. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Schoology has made classroom content and interactions simple and easy through a collaborative space. It’s probably no loss to the program that the discussion forums aren’t heavily used by the school community; they are there when and if needed. Since communication tools have been integrated into so many other systems that students use daily, it probably won't affect their attitudes toward the platform. Overall, the days of copying assignments into a school planner are over; students are less likely to make excuses about assignment requirements, and you can save the paperweight. </p>
