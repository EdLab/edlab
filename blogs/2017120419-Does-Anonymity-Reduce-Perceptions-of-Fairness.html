<p>It is well known that students see fairness as a fundamental issue in classroom assessment. However, little is known about how learners regard online peer assessment. Some studies describe it as a positive experience, and others show that perceptions of unfairness prompt conflict and friendship marking (over-marking friends or social groups). But, until now, no study has explored how anonymous online peer assessment impacts learners' perceptions of fairness.<p>
 
<p>This study explored the question of fairness with 32 Taiwanese undergraduate teacher-training students and looked at how much students felt they had learned from peer assessment. The participants were randomly assigned to either an anonymous condition, in which assessors' identities remained hidden throughout the peer-assessment process, or an identifiable condition, in which assessors’ full real names could be seen by those being assessed. Researchers then examined the effects of anonymous online peer assessment within a Facebook-based learning application based on two factors: the distributions of cognitive, affective, and metacognitive peer feedback and the participants' perceived learning, perceived fairness, and attitude toward the system.</p>
 
<p>The anonymous group provided significantly more cognitive feedback (vague and/or explicit suggestions for improvement), whereas the identifiable group offered more affective (supporting, opposing) and metacogntive (reflective) feedback. The anonymous group also perceived peer comments to be less fair than the identifiable group did, despite learning more from peer assessment and having more positive attitudes toward the system.</p>
 
<p>The findings offer both insights and concrete suggestions for designing, developing, and implementing instructional strategies and online learning systems that facilitate effective peer-assessments. The author acknowledges that using a small number of participants and a convenience-sampling strategy may make the results less generalizable and recommends using qualitative and/or longitudinal data to acquire a deeper understanding of how and why anonymous online peer assessment positively influences teacher learning.</p>
