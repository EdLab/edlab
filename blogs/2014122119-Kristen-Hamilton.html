<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> As I look back on my education, training and experience, I notice that the most important things I’ve learned, those things that have really helped me have an impact, have been experiential and most have been learned through a lot of trial and failure. I took a year off school between high school and college and lived in Germany and Cyprus; this taught me grit and adaptability (and a third language). I studied business using the case method with professors who were practitioners; this taught me that you never have full information in the real world, that the workplace is ambiguous, to make assumptions and move forward. I worked in consulting for fast-growing tech companies; this taught me the value of hard work (and how to operate with very little sleep while balancing work and play). I co-founded an e-commerce business that we took public in 2000; this taught me that something that seems too good to be true, is. I worked at a Fortune 100 company; this taught me how to collaborate, build complex public-private partnerships and that big companies require more patience than I have. I took a leap into global education and non-profit; this taught me that I can never do a job that is not driven first and foremost by the mission to have an impact on something worthwhile and meaningful… and awakened me to the truth that at my core, I’m an entrepreneur. 
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> In two ways.
First we want higher education to embrace and encourage failure.  In college, we’re conditioned to avoid failure at all costs. Yet in the workplaces of the innovation economy, failure is a necessary condition to success. Fast-growing workplaces are data-driven environments, so you are expected to get a solution to say 60% right, put it out there for a cheap failure, and quickly iterate your way to better on an ongoing basis.  At <a href="http://www.joinkoru.com/">Koru</a>, we want to change the mindset of higher education learning to embrace the notion of failing to succeed. 
<p>
Second we would like to catalyze a better way for employers to select the best entry-level talent—a new standard that will be a better signal to complement traditional measures like GPA and major. We’ll help with this by continuing to listen to successful high-growth organizations, as well as our forward thinking college and university partners.  We’re working on defining the standard with these partners. 
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> Employers will demand job-readiness and an ecosystem will open up between education and employment to fill the gaps. The gaps between college and careers include relevant skills, real world experience and networks. There will be multiple innovations that spring from these problems, which in turn are opportunities. 
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> Now I’m the CEO and co-founder of Koru. We’re working hard to land gritty, talented college graduates in jobs in fast-growing, innovative tech companies. We partner collaboratively with leading colleges and the fastest growing companies. Most importantly, we support young people to find their own meaningful paths, as I found mine, by failing fast and cheap, to be their best selves.  I think this will be enough to keep me busy for the foreseeable future.
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTonyWagner">Tony Wagner</a> (Expert in Residence at Harvard and author), <a href="https://twitter.com/carolynsave">Carolyn Miles</a> (CEO of Save the Children), <a href="https://twitter.com/kbcarol">Carol Bellamy</a> (former head of UNICEF, the Peace Corps, World Learning, and Chair of the Board of IB Program), <a href="https://twitter.com/Nas">Nas</a> (hip hop artist), <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_jarrett">Josh Jarrett</a> (co-founder of Gates Foundation higher ed practice and Koru), <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaytonAtBates">Clayton Spencer</a> (President of Bates College), <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamAtDenison">Adam Weinberg</a> (President of Denison), <a href="https://twitter.com/linkedincareers">Brendan Browne</a>, head of recruiting for LinkedIn.
