          <p>
            <a href="http://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/2012/08/mooc-pedagogy-the-challenges-of-developing-for-coursera/">Here</a> is a fascinating article on the creation of a new Coursera course. The topic? MOOC pedagogy and e-learning.

Professors and researchers at the University of Edinburgh's e-learning department see Coursera as a unique opportunity to experiment with the MOOC format while utilizing their own theories and insights into e-learning.

According to the article, the current trend in MOOCs is to replicate the curricula of traditional campus-based courses.  But as the article states, "some of the most interesting and innovative practices in online education have emerged by challenging these very ideas - loosening institutional control of learning outcomes and assessment criteria, shifting from a focus on content delivery to a foregrounding of process, community and learning networks, and working with more exploratory assessment methods â€” digital and multimodal assignments, peer assessment and group assignments, for example."

This notion presents an interesting dichotomy in the current statutes of MOOCs - they are popular because they make name brand professors and courses from name brand institutions available to a larger audience.  However, if the researchers are correct, more effective models of e-learning would challenge this model and delivery system.  Online courses would not be "equivalent" to on-campus courses.  Rather, they would be either variations on campus-based courses or entirely new courses specifically designed for online students.

In that scenario, would these courses still attract large numbers of students?  Would Michael Sandel's "Justice" course at Harvard still be popular in an online-specifc form?  In such a scenario, the presence of the celebrity professor would presumably be reduced.

I have just enrolled in "E-Learning and Digital Cultures". I will update my blog with new insights as the course progresses.
