          <p>
            According to this <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2014/02/12/wb-jamaica-children-early-development-services">article</a>, "there is growing scientific evidence that what happens — or doesn't happen — to a child in the first 1,000 days of life has immediate effects on his or her well-being and future." There is no doubt that the first few years of a child's life can determine their future. If a child doesn't receive or understand basic learning skills at a young age, they will struggle to grasp those skills when thye become adults. This will affect their educational life. To avoid this kind of catastrophe, the Jamaican government has set its sights on improving Early Childhood Development Programs (ECD) in Jamaica. For this reason, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors has approved an additional funding of $12 million to help these programs in the Caribbean nation. It has been estimated that about 300,000 children will benefit from the ECD Programs.

The ECD programs are mostly centered on preparing children before they enroll in primary school. One important facet of this program is that it is free. Thus, I am hoping that every parent will take advantage and enroll their children. The end result could be great for the individual and the entire country. I believe this tremendous plan will help a lot of children in Jamaica. It would be interesting to see the outcomes this plan ultimately produces.
