<p>Reflection has long been considered a constructive way to reinforce learning, but does this same benefit extend to other forms of explanations? Explanations have been proven to enhance learning by connecting and integrating new information and existing knowledge. Collaborative explanations especially allow students to stretch their knowledge and bounce ideas off of peers or teachers.</p>
 
<p>Recent research examines whether blogging can help students develop mathematical discourse and improve learning. While learning fractions, students collaborated either face-to-face or through collaborative blogging. The researchers hypothesized that blogging would provide a record of explanations that allowed students to clarify their understandings and misconceptions.</p>
 
<p>134 fifth grade math students were split among a blogging group, a face-to-face explanation group, and a no-treatment control group. Each group completed fractions problems independently. The blog group then wrote posts that described their answers and explained their mathematical reasoning, and they commented on three other students' blog posts. The face-to-face group completed the problems and then broke off into groups of three to four students and shared justifications of their answers with their peers.</p>
 
<p>Though all groups saw gains that can be attributed to the normal course of classroom instruction, the blog group showed higher gains in conceptual understanding and maintained understanding on a delayed post-test. However, there was no difference between groups in procedural knowledge. While blogging may seem more aligned with language-based subjects like English, these findings show that by explaining and justifying their thinking through blogging, students can construct lasting conceptual understanding.</p>
