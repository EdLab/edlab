<p>Mark Oronzio co-founded <a href="http://www.ideaphora.com/">Ideaphora</a> to help companies and schools more effectively use online content to accelerate student learning. Prior to Ideaphora, Oronzio served as senior vice president of Inspiration Software, Inc., a global leader in concept-mapping technology for education. He was instrumental in the company’s proliferation into 65% of U.S. school districts. Oronzio has also consulted with numerous education market leaders and startups.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Ideaphora?</b><br>
<p>I started with a small company called Inspiration software over 20 years ago at a time when there were very few education technology products available for teachers and students to use while learning. Back then, presentation software prevailed and there were no tools focused on the point where learning takes place, where students make the conceptual connections that could be defined as learning.</p>

<p>Since educators found us first, I put thousands of hours of conversations with educators and working with researchers to find out the many ways teachers were experimenting with our software. Through my work. I learned that concept mapping (or <i>graphical organizing</i>) can serve as a valuable <i>front end process</i> to many other learning activities. If you are writing a paper, drafting a speech, creating a presentation, or drawing up a plan, mapping out your thoughts in advance facilitates the process, resulting in a more sound finished product. It’s like drawing the blueprints before building the house.</p>

<p>Before our software came along, all learners had at their disposal to use for this critical phase were 3 x 5" cards or pencil and paper. So in most cases, before the aid of software like Inspiration, good planning was just not getting done. Over time, I realized these graphical organizing methodologies were more than just a convenience or a means to an end in a project. The mapping and planning phase of a project is where the actual research, discovery, and learning occurs. Also, this phase is much more valuable to the learner than the presentation itself. I worked with the state of Texas to add <i>graphical organizing</i> to their state standards for these uses. That terminology has made its way into all other state standards, the Common Core, and still remains today. My former company’s software ended up on 65% of the instructional computers in U.S. schools, filling a critical need for this sort of learning tool in the classroom.</p>

<p>However, since that time educators and students have increasingly relied on digital content for teaching and learning. Concurrently, the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in college and future careers have changed.</p>

<p>After leaving Inspiration in 2010, I formed a consultancy that worked with over 25 education technology companies, bringing their solutions to global education markets. Closely watching emerging education trends, I realized that students were having difficulty deriving meaning from the abundance of digital resources available to them. This is particularly true since teachers are now using different media from different sources. When I met Anil Arvindam, Ideaphora’s co-founder and CTO, I realized he was on to something when he showed me an early prototype of his semantic analysis engines that deconstructed digital content into meaningful concepts. His technological experience and creativity, combined with my expertise in concept mapping and edtech markets, led us to devise an online environment that allowed learners to <i>drag and drop</i> these concepts into a concept mapping canvas to link them. This helps them make learning connections and arrange information in a way that makes sense to them. As we now see, this catapulted concept mapping into the digital content age.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Ideaphora will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>We feel the timing is perfect for a learning tool like ours. Graphical organizing and concept mapping are proven instructional strategies that facilitate exploring, discovering, learning, and even formative assessment. The Common Core standards are still relatively new and educators need better tools for addressing them. Combine these developments with the increasing availability of quality digital learning content and the lack of tools that enable students to assimilate information from those materials in a quick and intelligent way also makes our technology more useful. Teachers are now assigning a YouTube video, Wikipedia page, PDF, and an ebook chapter for students to learn from. We created an environment where students can bring those sources together, graphically arrange the information in a way that makes sense to them, and construct real and lasting personalized knowledge. Educators and students have picked up our unique idea. The tool is fun and easy to use so it is sticking. In our work with content partners and our own classroom pilots, we now find students spend five times more on creating and organizing their maps compared to simply watching a video. There are also now over 700,000 concept maps created in our environment. It's a wonderful thing when we see kids truly enjoying what we created and their teachers see the learning results.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I’m amazed at the quality of open education resources that are available for teachers and students to use to meet their learning goals. Tools like ours will help them get the most value out of this free and readily available content. I also see the need for better formative assessment tools. We need to help the world go beyond the multiple-choice quiz or essay questions, where a learner puts their own learning on hold to prove their understanding. We are working on the automatic, real-time, formative assessment of concept maps. This way a student is creating a concept map for their own learning goals and does not have to stop and take a discrete <i>test</i>.  Our technology will be able to assess connections and provide a quick logic check to assure that the student is on the right track and that their connections match reality and the lesson being taught.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Ideaphora, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Because Ideaphora is still in the startup stage, it takes up much of my time. My co-founder and I are obsessed with making this work as effectively as possible for teachers and students. We are certainly <i>living it</i>. However, I do find time to volunteer at a prison every week. I advise inmates on digital storytelling projects for a dog training and adoption program run out of the prison. The idea is that the program runs like a business and there are many business functions that must be undertaken for the program to succeed. Digital marketing plays a big part in the success of the program and the guys take all this knowledge with them when they get out. Many former inmates now have movies and photo essays they have produced as part of their resumes. Some of the guys have worked for me on the outside and I’m proud to have them. In my (other) spare time, I’m an avid underwater photographer specializing in large aquatic creatures such as sharks, whales, dolphins, and most recently alligators. Some of my work has been featured in documentaries, on environmental sites, and on gallery walls. My hope is to promote respect for these animals rather than perpetuate the prevailing climate of fear. I also donate all proceeds to like-minded organizations.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I have learned more from teachers on social media than I ever imagined I could. Rather than following a small group, I use tools for tracking hashtags, like #STEMed, #teachers, #OER, #Conceptmapping, and other mentions of trends I’m watching. I’m more concerned with what is said and what gets retweets and replies versus who says it. I also manage (with some help) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ideaphora">@ideaphora</a> and have my own <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkOronzio">@markoronzio</a> account. I’m on these accounts daily engaging in conversations about improving education practices and technologies.</p>
