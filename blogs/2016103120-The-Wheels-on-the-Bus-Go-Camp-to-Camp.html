<p><i>"Education is a right, not a privilege. Education saves lives. Education changes the world."</i> (<a href="http://www.schoolbusproject.org/about_us">About School Bus Project</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>A School With No Walls</b></p>
 
<p>Some people might not identify the most important thing they learned as something they picked up within the four walls of a classroom, so why limit education to what we can learn within those confines? This is the inspiration behind the School Bus Project, a nonprofit organization that serves as a traveling school for refugee students.</p>
 
<p><b>Educating from Camp to Camp</b></p>
 
<p> The School Bus Project is a combination of teachers, education consultants, and doctors who travel from camp to camp teaching students. They provide a pop-up school from their bus that teaches 40-hour courses on topics like foreign language teaching, numeracy, cookery, health and safety, budgeting, planning, fire skills, nutrition, hygiene, and cultural diversity. In addition, they provide food to the families they teach, in an effort to provide a fully encompassing curriculum. Their work stems from the idea that education is a right for all people. </p>
 
<p> This efficiency-focused project attempts to do a lot with a little to give educational opportunities to those who might have been out of school for years. Finding new low-cost methods to educate low-income populations is particularly relevant given the large influx of refugees around the world today. Perhaps the School Bus Project could serve as an inspiration for other initiatives to help extremely vulnerable populations. </p>
