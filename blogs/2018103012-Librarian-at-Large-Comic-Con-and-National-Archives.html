            Librarians do more than just sit at the circulation desk and check out books to patrons, or even carefully instruct patrons as they navigate overwhelming seas of information. While we do our best to bring our all to the TC community here at the Gottesman Libraries, we do like to branch out from time to time. The library world is bustling with all kinds of great things to do! I challenged myself to say yes to opportunities in my field; some presented by my colleagues here, others by my own Library and Information Sciences (MLIS) program, but all enriching, rewarding, and very, very cool.

I attended New York Comic Con (NYCC) as a volunteer with the American Library Association (ALA) at their <a href="https://twitter.com/libcomix?lang=en" target="_blank">Graphic Novels and Comics Round Table</a>. We hosted a pop-up library with a browsable collection on loan from the Bayonne Public Library, arts and crafts sessions, story times, and free book signings by authors and live drawings by illustrators (link to later in post). We provided reader's advisory sheets for visitors who wanted book recommendations. We offered space for people to sit, relax, and read graphic novels and comics they may never have seen before. We operated just like any other library might, offering services free of charge and judgement. Many con-goers stumbled across our booth by accident. They weren't sure why a library organization might be present at the convention, but when they realized that we could help them find their way to Artists' Alley and to their new favorite book, they loved the concept. We also had <a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/classics" target="_blank">Banned Books Week reading lists</a>, stickers, and temporary tattoos, all of which drew a lot of action. I even got to attend panels while I was off duty - some at the Javits Center, some hosted by the New York Public Library at the Stephen A. Schwartzman Building for <a href="http://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/Explore/Panels/NYPL/?d=102026%7C0H,101734%7C0NYPLx$sp$x476x$sp$x5thx$sp$xAvex$sp$x%E2%80%93x$sp$xTrusteesx$sp$xRoom,101732%7C152_386097,104396%7C152_383602&amp;so=3&amp;rpp=24#" target="_blank">Professional Day</a>.

With just enough down-time to get started on my midterm assignment on databases and controlled vocabularies, my next stop was the K-12 Archives Education Institute hosted by the <a href="https://www.nycarchivists.org/event-3067242?CalendarViewType=1&amp;SelectedDate=10/29/2018" target="_blank">Archivists Round Table</a>. The event was held at the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/nyc" target="_blank">National Archives at New York City</a> as a part of New York Archives Week. Educators and archivists from around the Metropolitan area met over coffee, tea, and artifacts to discuss the use of primary sources in teaching, and how archives can bring those discussions to life. Presentations and discussions focused mainly on sports archiving, and how much we can learn about our city, state, and nation as a whole through diving into just one topic.
