            I spent the morning in a session called <b>DiverseZineties; Promoting Diversity and Self-discovery Through Making Zines with Teens</b>, a talk about encouraging educators and students to collaborate, create, discuss, and share their own diverse stories. Cathy Camper's talk focused on workshops created to help teens explore their own backgrounds, practice self-expression, and even learn mainstream job skills. It seems like something that could fit into our own library space quite easily if we want to give our own students (especially future teachers) opportunities to teach hands-on workshops to gain practical teaching experience!

Next up on the docket was an hour or so of morning poster sessions, where I was able to talk to the authors of several posters.

<b>Preservation in Practice: A Survey of NYC Academics Engaged in Digital Humanities</b> offered a practical survey of the state of digital preservation using cutting-edge tools and frameworks.

Texas A&M University Libraries presented <b>Course Readings: How Libraries Provide Value</b>, an assessment of faculty and student use of library resources for course materials. While they haven’t moved fully towards a PDA model, their methodology and findings suggest that a tool like Docdel would be a valuable solution for their library. We talked a little about document delivery platforms in general, and Docdel specifically, and they expressed a real interest in it if we ever decide to open-source it. (They were definitely not the first or last group of librarians with the same interest in Docdel, but it aligned particularly well with their own research interests.)

The <b>Nine Campus Libraries Transforming Circulation to Reflect Shifting Library Use Behaviors</b> poster was a comprehensive look at Berkeley College’s reformed circulation and borrowing policies and how their new policy—in which fines are eliminated—increases user satisfaction.

The University of Arizona Libraries presented <b>Patron Driven Acquisition: Has it Changed Our Collections?</b>, which was a detailed look at what patron-driven acquisitions (the same thing we have!) looks like at a major research library with 40,000+ patrons.

Later in the day, I attended a few Ignite sessions, and one in particular stood out. Jesse Henning, a youth librarian at a public library in Ohio, presented <b>Here It Is, Your Moment of Zen</b> at the Saturday Ignite session. You might think a lightning talk on book displays sounds boring, but it was an extremely engaging take on how and why we create book or newsstand displays, with plenty of takeaways for our very own café collection. Henning cited the Daily Show with Jon Stewart as his inspiration, and he strives to create book displays that are timely, funny, and interesting. He affirmed my thought that simplicity is best: what you really want in a book display is a set of 10-15 loosely related books and a simple sign, because the point is to engage patrons to start a conversation, whether with each other or with library staff, about a specific topic or even just the library in general. He also pointed out that short display cycles are key—maybe we can think about updating the news display and café book collection in more frequent bursts to keep it looking fresh and engaging.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZQHx9Rg.jpg"> The Great and Powerful Dr. Oz is definitely a conversation starter!

My last session of the day—an early evening panel for the Faceted Subject Access Interest Group—was comprised of lightning talks showcasing innovative uses of and interesting issues with FAST headings in archival, repository, and library catalog settings. Several of the talks were focused on speeding up and improving the process of archival description. The metadata librarian from Washington and Lee University, in <i>Speeding up Archival Description with FAST</i>, outlined their technical implementations and staff training strategies for cataloging digital archival collections in ArchivesSpace. Northern Michigan University also uses the ArchivesSpace archival-management system, and Catherine Oliver talked about their shift towards using FAST subject headings. Most interestingly, NMU planning a survey of their archives users for Fall 2015 to investigate how users are engaging with their digital archives. Moving closer to home, Brian Luna Lucero & Melanie Wacker from Columbia presented how they’re using FAST in the Academic Commons, and also how they are continually updating the way they train student workers. They do use a lot of student workers for inputting metadata, but they’re always assessing their work and refining training strategies so that items in the digital repository are described accurately and usefully and are easily accessible to patrons.

As always, watch this space for future updates!
