<b>Freemind is a mind mapping application with which users can visualize their ideas.</b>

http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page <br>

Download software: http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download <br>
 
Freemind is a mind visualizing tool with which users can conceptualize ideas, take notes, and brainstorm. It can be used for keeping track of projects, including subtasks, state of subtasks, and keeping a collection of small or middle sized notes with links on certain areas which expand as needed. Users also learn about knowledge structure from the additional data items they enter. For example, different medical records use different structures and users do not have to analyze all the possible structures before they enter the first record.

<b>Price:</b>
FreeMind is a free software, licensed under GPL - GNU General Public License and is also an open source software.<br> 

<b>How it works:</b>
Once you install the software, and open it and choose “new” from a dropdown menu on the top, you see a default bubble in the center of the screen, which is a mother node, and when you click the bubble, you can edit or change the title of the bubble. Leaving the main node activated (you can activate a specific node simply by placing your mouse icon over the node), you click “insert” key in your keyboard and can add child nodes which are branches of the mother node. Also, if you want to add nodes which have same hierarchy level to a node, you activate the node and hit the “enter” key. By doing this, you can expand your idea on the map. For a meaningful node, users can add various icons which represent or relate to a title or feature of the node. After creating a mind map, you can export it with various file types and share with others. <br>

<b>Prop points:</b>
Freemind makes abstract concepts or ideas concrete with visualized maps. Therefore, it is a good tool for visual learners. A visualized mind map helps systematic and analytic thinking. Also, it is a free ware so anybody can easily access it and share ideas. After completing your mind map, you can export it as html, pdf, jpeg, xhtml (java script based), or png file. <br>

<b>Drop points:</b>
Even if it is a good tool for systematic thinking, knowledge construction and sharing, it is not that all types of knowledge can be applicable with Freemind. For example, when two nodes are interacting and work flows are interchangeable, users need a two way arrow or line to represent that concept, but it seems that Freemind does not support the case. Small icons placed on the left are called visual cues and are not intuitive and therefore, it is not good for communicative purposes. Finally, the main disadvantage of such an approach when compared to traditional database applications are the poor query possibilities. <br>

<b>Final score: </b>
Freemind is a good tool for mind mapping and its benefit can be extended far more depending on how users use its functions. However, user interface is not intuitive. It is not possible for user to create layered mind maps which has multiple structures.</br>
