            Panelists:
Philip Porter (Moderator) - Hogan Lovells
Peter Davis - McGraw Hill
David Goddy - Scholastic
Josh Koppel - ScrollMotion
Andrew Savikas - O'Reilly

Porter: Where is the textbook and where is it going? Should it be the primary medium of learning, should it be supplemented, or done away with? 

Savikas: Book is a technology/device for learning and we should see it that way. It will evolve over time. Much of the reading people did on paper/print will be superseded. 

Davis: Textbook provides a curriculum and tool for teachers who don't have a curriculum to build from scratch. 

Koppell: Textbook is here to stay because it provides a baseline and guide for teaching, but our job is to figure out how to enhance what is already there and imagine how the textbook evolves. 

Porter: Do people learn the same way they used to and does the textbook have the same value?

Goddy: Textbook represents core curriculum for a particular class/body of knowledge. Technology to deliver and outline that core curriculum can change, but textbooks are fundamentally a tool to identify what constitutes a particular body of knowledge. As educational institutions figure out how to fund technology-based products, this will catalyze shifts in how textbooks are used and developed in the educational sector. 

Davis: technology can make textbook content flexible and dynamic: responsive to student learning patterns, customized to needs of students, etc. 

Porter: If interactivity is a good thing, what do we interact with and who do we interact with in textbook context. 

Savikas & Davis: Interaction with others across the world is important ... allowing people to talk to each other who are separated geographically. Also, adapting what you deliver in the next day. Interactivity should refer to interaction with other people, not necessarily interaction with the application itself. 

Koppel: Allow kids to mark up and make notes inside their books and allow teacher to monitor students' use of the book.
