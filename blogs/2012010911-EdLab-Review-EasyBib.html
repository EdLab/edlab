<a href="http://easybib.com/">EasyBib</a> is a free, automatic bibliography and citation generator.  With both school- and library-based versions, as well as a premium, paid "pro" service, which includes additional services like, Cornell-style flashcard generators and  additional auto-formats for citations including, APA & Chicago-styles.  Registered users also have the option to store multiple projects and share projects.

Finally, EasyBib just launched in Beta a new <a href="http://www.easybib.com/research">Research</a> platform that allows users to topically search a database of citations cited by users.  These citations are ranked by both how many times they were cited as well as whether or not they were deemed "credible" sources by users.  This new platform "flips" the site's initial purpose on-its-head, from a citation generator to a citation repository/tool for finding valuable research sources.  

<b>Pros:</b>
EasyBib provides a streamlined, easy-to-use interface both for automatically generating citations and now, for researching credible, potentially useful sources.  It is truly innovative that that EasyBib has turned their tool on its head, and harnessed the back-end of data collection to allow researchers to find more credible, peer-vetted resources.   

<b>Cons:</b>
It was unclear to me at-first what the added value of the premium services would be.  There could be more "carrots" planted throughout the site to entice users to sign-up for these additional services.  Currently there is only a small checklist of free vs "pro" services listed when you select a discreet hyperlink at the bottom of the "Notebook" page.  This link then takes you to a page that is filled with both reviews and breakdowns of these additional services.   

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we move-forward with new tools and update existent ones it is helpful to remember that we could harness the data generated by a tool or platform to create a whole new tool, add a facet or offering for users as an extension to the existent platform.  Re-purposing and re- engineering/imagining the use of data (responsibly and with respect to user privacy of course!) is an often-overlooked option for development.    

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
Perhaps ResearchBroker could harness this power of "credible" peer vetted sources to offer a rating system for researchers to let each other know about their experience working with a company or group?  At the very least the screenshot below, that depicts the Research view and correspondent numbers of times a resource is cited, is an important reminder to revisit displaying the number of "likes" a course has.
