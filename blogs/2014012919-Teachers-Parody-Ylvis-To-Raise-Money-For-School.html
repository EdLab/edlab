It’s hard to distinguish the video above from the original: both feature talented singers, wacky costumes, and surreal settings. But only one is dedicated to the students at the International School at Thornton Middle in Colorado. 

The parody is actually a cleverly-veiled fundraising campaign set forth by the teachers in the video. Their mission was to raise enough money to equip their classrooms with much-needed technology. That they seized the opportunity to create a potentially viral video says a lot about their awareness of the current tech/media space and their audience. Gone are the days of forcing relatives to buy cheap, off-brand chocolate bars; if your eye is on a big prize, aim for the crowd to fund your idea. The "What does the kid say" video was part of <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/infectious-education?show_todos=true">an Indiegogo campaign</a> that ended (unfortunately, unsuccessfully) on January 20th. <p>

A parody of this quality relies on strong collaborative efforts from both the teachers and the students involved in the project. Even though they were unable to reach their fundraising goal, they succeeded in casting a warm light around Thornton Middle. <p>

Still, one can’t help but wonder why didn’t they reach their goal despite a valiant showing. What do you think would have helped them? What was your most successful fundraising undertaking?

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:00 welmer:</b> Sometimes it really is a mystery trying to figure out what the kids say.<p>

<b>@03:48 MartinPaper:</b> I wonder if they would've made a stronger case for the need for the new tech if they mentioned it in the song. Right now, while extremely entertaining, I don't see relevance of the vid to what they're asking for.
