<p> <a href="http://triplingo.com/index">Triplingo</a> is a mobile app that helps users learn a new language and equips them with the knowledge a world traveler would need on their trips abroad. Some of this knowledge includes information on a countryâ€™s culture, different ways of saying a phrase including slang and formal, travel tips and more. The app informs the users of which phrases are appropriate to say according to the culture of a country and helps them properly pronounce these phrases. The learning tools provided are flashcards, a translator, a dictionary and the word bank. TripLingo can also provide audio translations of what a user says in English to other languages through a functionality known as Talk Live. In this setting, users speak to a live translator who repeats the phrase with the correct pronunciation of the new language.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app addresses one aspect of language learning that many other similar apps do not: teaching the user the proper pronunciation of new words. The mobile app is also a great reference for language learning. Users can quickly refer to it if they need a reminder of what a word or phrase means and how to pronounce it.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some of the more interesting functionalities, like the travel situations guide, are not available unless the user pays for an upgraded version of the app. The live translator option is not available for most of the languages but this may change as the app develops further. Though it includes unique functionalities for language learning, TripLingo does not teach users how to fully learn a new language. It teaches users enough of the language to be able to easily travel in a foreign country. For international traveling purposes TripLingo is top notch but users will need to look elsewhere for a more in-depth language learning experience.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>TripLingo is a language and culture learning app with unique functionalities. Though the app may not fully teach a new language, it does teach the basics of a language very well and is a handy language reference. Hearing how words are pronounced can give users a better idea of how to say the words themselves. This functionality is essential for language learning, but most similar learning tools and apps do not include or focus on pronunciation. Another unique aspect of the app is the way it teaches users about the cultures and customs of another country, giving a user a more immersive language learning experience. There is plenty of room for TripLingo to grow and become an app that encompasses a more in-depth language learning experience.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>TripLingo gives you language and culture learning on the go.</p>
