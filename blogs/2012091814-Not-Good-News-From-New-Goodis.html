          <p>
            One of my favorite education news sources has gotten a makeover and, I hate to be the one who says this, I thought it was beautiful the way it was. 

With the new look, <a href="http://good.is">Good</a> feels more like Pinterest (requesting that readers follow certain streams and people) and less like the news site I have grown to love. In fact, I don't even know who it is any more: it's a struggle for me to find relevant info on the site. Before, however, a simple browse would deliver a wealth of knowledge. 
<!--break-->

I will say, though, one improvement I saw was in its drastic cut in length of [user-submitted] articles.  As it stands, many articles feature an intriguing headline coupled with just 2-3 sentences summing up the story while giving readers a link to the source to learn more about it. This is the perfect amount of need-to-know info. 

Perhaps I'm being a fuddy duddy, but, overall, this new layout is just not doing anything for me. Can't one thing I do on the internet NOT be a social activity? I don't really care who likes an article I've read or who follows a publication I like (and that's "like" in the old-fashioned, "my, I enjoy that but I'm happy keeping that opinion to myself" sense, not the new-age "click this if you agree" sense). 

But, I don't want it to seem like I'm spewing hate. I'm not! I get it. Good.is pivoted. They've changed their concept from being a source from which people receive their news to one in which people share and make news. It's a platform for the people, by the people. Good has always been committed to making a difference, and engaging its community of do-gooders (do they use that phrase? They should totally use that phrase) seems like the best place to start. 

So, I'll give it some time and try to appreciate the dramatic 180 and <i>try</i> not to fixate on the beautiful thing we once had. The future appears to be invasively social and I'm not ready for that kind of relationship... but it looks like I better get used to it.
