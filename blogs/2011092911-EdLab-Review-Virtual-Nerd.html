<a href ="http://www.virtualnerd.com/">Virtual Nerd</a> is a website that help students with math and science. The way they go about doing this is very unique. If you look around the website, you will find tutorial videos on certain aspects of math and science, but if you sign up for a subscription to this website, you can have access to their unique learning tool called the Dynamic Whiteboard. Virtual Nerd also has a video on their homepage that fully explains how the site works and I highly recommend checking it out.

The Dynamic Whiteboard is a window screen that has three main sections: the biggest section is the video tutorial located on the left, on the top right is the diagram section where you have a visual summary of what's being taught in the video, and finally on the bottom right section is step by step notes of what's happening in the video. The main idea is to have a video tutorial that can be customized to meet every student's needs. So if a student doesn't understand a step in the video tutorial, they can click on it in the steps section and then they will be taken to another video tutorial with a more detail explanation on how to do the step. For students that want to skip ahead, they can do that through the step by step section as well by clicking ahead on the step they want to see.

<b>Pros:</b>  I really like the Dynamic Whiteboard and how it keeps the user more involved than just watching a normal tutorial video. The explanations in the video tutorials are very thorough, which is good for users who need the extra explanation of a math or science topic. The Dynamic Whiteboard also caters to students who have a better understanding of the subject, because they can skip through steps to the ones they are interested in watching. Although you would need to sign up for a subscription to have full access to the website and the Dynamic Whiteboard, it is free for teachers to subscribe, which is awesome because teachers always need all the resources they can get their hands on when it comes to teaching math and sciences. The design of the website is very easy on the eyes, and it's easy to navigate to the different subjects or other parts of the website.

<b>Cons:</b> I wish this website has more science topics as it currently only has intro to physics, which is good because most students have trouble with physics, but they should include more topics like biology, and chemistry. According the the FAQ section, more topics will be included and I hope that they will be coming soon.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> Virtual Nerd found a way to take video tutorials to the next step in keeping students more engaged when watching videos. We also do this type of thing too with Vialogues, where most people who watch a Vialogue are more involved in watching the video by having meaningful discussion with friends about the video. Maybe we can find ways for users to be more involved with watching videos, something that is unique and that will make Vialogues stand out from other video sites.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> This website came up with a completely new way to have a video tutorial, but you need to have a subscription to access it. I think people would be willing to pay for this type of thing especially after reading testimonials on how helpful it is. Normally I'm not a fan of paying a subscription to any educational website, but Virtual Nerd won me over when they said that subscriptions would be free for teachers. This shows that they are genuinely interested in helping teachers and students with math and science, and not just all about making a buck.
