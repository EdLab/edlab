<p>Finland has long had one of the highest-ranking school systems in the world, yet within the past decade it has completely changed its educational philosophy. Instead of sticking with traditional, subject-based school learning, the country has adopted a topic-based learning system; students don’t take classes separated by subject (e.g., math, science, reading), but rather learn a combination of skills as they tackle real-life world problems. For instance, students might be tasked to critically think about climate change, and in so doing practice reading, math, and science to better understand the topic.</p>

<p>Project-based learning is not a new idea; American philosopher John Dewey proposed this type of pedagogy in his 1916 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Education-John-Dewey/dp/0684836319"><i>Democracy and Education</i></a>. Yet in most places, it has remained active only in alternative school environments rather than traditional public schools. While Finnish students seem to enjoy school under this model, testing results have decreased over the past decade in the country <a href="http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/country/fin?lg=en">according to PISA</a>, the Programme for International Student Assessment. Of course, it’s likely that topic-based learning gives students essential skills that are simply not assessed on typical standardized testing. Either way, it will be interesting to watch Finland’s education system continue to experiment with this progressive pedagogy.</p>

<p>How do you think topic-based learning compares to traditional education? Do you think that topic-based education can prepare students better for the digital age than traditional education can? Ponder these philosophical questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/38927/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:24 Claude.Bosse:</b> I think it prepares students to learn beyond school which is was K–12 schooling should do best. I especially liked the quote from the one student, "It's not so boring and it's more interesting so I don't get tired of learning new stuff."</p>

<p><b>@01:24 CaitlinDavey:</b> I think that this approach teaches students how to apply knowledge and technology to a problem or subject. The emphasis on digital skills could be a way to leverage media to learn topics.</p>
