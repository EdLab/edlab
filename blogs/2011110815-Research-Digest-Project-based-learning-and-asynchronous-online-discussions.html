<b>Description:</b> This paper describes how project based learning and asynchronous discussions can promote deeper learning. The authors explore how graduate students' engagement in project based learning was related to their demonstration of advance knowledge construction during online asynchronous discussions.  

<b>Method:</b> The subjects used for this study were 17 graduate students who were enrolled in an online graduate course over the summer. The course was on the design of e-learning courseware. The online asynchronous discussion tool that was used for this course was a forum hosted on Google Groups. This course was selected for the study because it included both non-project based learning (first four weeks) and project based learning (last eight weeks). The authors would look for different types of learning actions that took place, and tally up the amount that was shown during discussions. The following chart lists and describes these learning actions:

<b>Results:</b> A total of 680 of these learning actions were noted with about 71% of them student based and the rest from the instructor. There was a larger percent of the knowledge construction actions that occurred during the project based learning portion of the semester, while the Teaching, Social, and Logistics actions stayed relatively the same throughout the semester. So from these results, we can conclude that online project based learning can advance deep learning during online asynchronous discussions, provided that the project is properly structured.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>  As with last week's Research Digest, I am trying to gather up studies that relates how students learn through video and online discussion, to sort of build up a strong case for why educators and students would benefit greatly from using Vialogues. This paper also discusses the importance of structure when doing project based learning, which got me thinking that maybe we can create a few example Vialogues “templates” that show educators the different ways they can structure their descriptions and comment questions to fit how they would plan to use Vialogues. If they want to post videos of which they want feedback from other users, we can show them an example Vialogue with mostly poll question comments. The purpose of this is to help new users get a better handle on how they can take advantage of everything Vialogues has to offer.
