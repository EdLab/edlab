          <p>
            As a follow-up to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8427">this blog post by Gary</a>, I thought I would share some (relatively) recent research on best practices for sending newsletters and email-based marketing campaigns. I will continue to share research as I dig-it-up for the team to explore. This is by no means a definitive word on newsletter or email marketing behavior and instead, a way to collect and collectively think about prevailing thoughts on best practices as we refine our own approach. 

<b>Just Say NO to Personalization</b>
For example, apparently, personalization is less cool and more creepy (<a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/8-effective-email-strategies-backed-by-research">original post</a>): 
<blockquote>
A significant element of email marketing is relationship. Does a recipient trust you? Does a recipient even know who you are? When an email jumps the gun by forcing familiarity too soon, the personalization comes across as skeevy. Intimacy is earned in real life, and it would appear to be the same way with email. 
</blockquote>

Also, mentioned by the author of the above post, Kevan Lee, is <a href="http://www.fox.temple.edu/posts/2012/06/dear-insert-company-name-personalized-emails-dont-impress-customers/">this research</a> done by Temple's Fox School on Business on email personalization. 

<b>The Long & Short of It</b>
Additionally, the blogger listed above quotes research that points to short subject lines to increase the "open" rate of the newsletter and long to boost click-throughs of content featured in the newsletter. Confused? It is definitely an inexact science. 

<b>Night Train?</b>
Apparently, late night MAY be better, as Lee points-out, "Inbox crowding and the deployment times of other marketers go hand-in-hand...so quick, start sending between 8:00 and midnight before everyone else catches on." However, he adds,"Optimal mailing for your customers' needs will be up to you. Test, test, and test some more to find out how your customer ticks and when he/she opens email." Again, potentially more questions than answers here, but I will keep digging for research on optimal timing and know that our own internal tests (with TCRecord) have not determined an appreciable bump from an evening send. (<a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/when-is-the-best-time-to-send-emails/">Here</a> is some newsletter volume data from MailChimp - see additional resources below)

<b>iNewsletter</b>
I also want to share this screen-capture of <a href="http://i-lab.harvard.edu/">Harvard i-Lab's</a> newsletter... what are your thoughts? Tempted to consider an EdLab newsletter?
