<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> If I reflect on my background after a 20-plus-year career in science journalism, the trajectory and the way it shaped my current work are clear—but that was not at all the case when I was young. I’ve always been a highly curious person. I was the kid who had to have a chemistry set and a microscope for my birthday. But I also was the kid who stapled sheets of paper together with my own stories and drawings on them. By eighth grade, I had a 100 average in science (never mind the extra credit from doing additional work) and I was a member of an after-school group called the Alchemists, just for the joy of hanging around the school lab a little longer each day. I was definitely going to be a scientist.
<p>
But by tenth grade, I had come to believe (right or wrong) that becoming a scientist would mean that I would have to pick a particular discipline and stick to it. I liked everything much too much to abandon the rest of knowledge for one topic. It took me a few more years, though, to figure out how I could be a student of everything. Somehow, I landed at Boston University as an undergraduate and took an introductory journalism course. The professor was stern and made us crank out stories on hard deadlines. For some reason, I found that really, really fun. One day, he called me up after class. I figured I must be failing—because how could I be doing well at something so fun? Instead, he demanded to know what I was majoring in. I didn’t know—maybe PR (public relations)? "PR!" he yelled. "The best people are in journalism. You should be in journalism. You can do this"
<p> 
As an undergraduate senior, I saw that the university was launching a graduate program in science writing. I talked my way into the introductory science-writing course, from which I sold some freelance articles (and got an A). Finally, it all came together for me: I had a way to combine my love of science plus writing plus art (sketching informational graphics to accompany my stories). My current work uses all that as a foundation for managing a skilled editorial team and helping to shape the business that supports it.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’m currently the editor in chief and senior vice president of Scientific American, and I feel that I needed all of my previous professional experiences to do the job I do today. You have to be good at reporting (or at least at finding out facts) to be a good nonfiction writer—although being a good reporter doesn’t mean you are a good writer. Good editing depends on an understanding of writing although, again, being good at writing does not make you a good editor. And managing an editorial team requires an understanding of all of it—but many journalists do not make good managers.
<p> 
I could write a book about what so many mentors have taught me! But here’s the one experience that I think had the most effect. The company that used to own Popular Science when I was its executive editor, Times Mirror Magazines, had an intensive weeklong program for new managers. Experts spoke to us about such aspects as reading financial statements, handling poor performers in job reviews, giving effective presentations, and being aware of the benefits of diversity. But what changed my way of thinking was a "360 degree" performance review—one that not only included comments from my supervisor but also from my peers and my "internal customers," or colleagues who relied on me to do something to get their own jobs done. I learned things that I am convinced I could never learn otherwise. It also taught me that one of the most effective traits is that my team can tell that I care about their individual wellbeing as well as our collective success—and that my being supportive sets the tone for them to support each other.
<p> 

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Kids are born scientists. You don’t have to believe me—research backs this up. What I mean by that is they naturally ask questions and set about through "experiments" to understanding the world around them. So the secret is to keep that spark of interest kindled through inquiry-based learning. We offer several ways to do that at <i>Scientific American</i>. Bring Science Home, for instance, is our free series of weekly science activities for parents to do with their kids ages 6-12. 1,000 Scientists in 1,000 Days is our program that matches (by location and discipline) teachers with volunteer scientists who can visit classrooms. We add a new Citizen Science project, which anyone can do to help make science happen, to the site each week. And we funded one of our own citizen-science projects, called Whale.FM, which lets you help scientists to "speak whale" simply by spending a few minutes whenever convenient listening to snippets of whale songs and matching them up. Last, <i>Scientific American</i> is a founding partner of the Google Science Fair, a global online competition for kids ages 13-18.
<p>
Increasingly, a working knowledge of how to navigate modern society successfully requires a good basic understanding of scientific concepts. I sincerely hope that <i>Scientific American’s</i> authoritative coverage is helping to both foster and satisfy curiosity, to do our part in the creation of lifelong learners. My fondest hope is that, through our digital platforms, we can bring those curious minds together to accomplish great things, helping to shape a better world.
<p> 
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> It’s clear that we’ll continue to see the digital revolution sweeping through learning systems. I see two main trends. First, digital delivery: We are delivering content in various digital forms to students who never had access to such information before—and on a scale that would have been inconceivable even just a few short years ago. We also are using such delivery systems to make much more types of educational material or experiences available to students who already have had good access to information. For instance, even affluent schools can benefit from materials-saving technologies such as virtual labs, which let you practice experiments without wasting chemicals or lab specimens. Second, so-called Big Data analysis of student performance: We can track and manage the results of this digital delivery to ensure better learning outcomes for our children, using systems that can tailor lessons for individual students, depending on their performance, or that can even tell whether a student is at risk of failure. These technologies offer potential benefits—but also have drawbacks, such as privacy concerns, if we’re not careful about how we use them. Scientific American recently explored these trends in a special report, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/editorial/digital-education/">"Learning in the Digital Age,"</a> which is all available for free <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/editorial/digital-education/?id=learning-digital-age"></a>here.<p>  Although the tools for teachers are evolving, too, their skill and passion remain absolutely critical to fostering a love of lifelong learning in our next generation. As always, it’s the teachers who inspire us.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’m passionate about fostering collaboration and inspiring people about science using <i>Scientific American’s</i> digital platforms. In addition to our educational offerings mentioned above, for instance, we have a lively <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/"> blog network</a> and community on our Web site. Next, I want to take that collaboration forward by adding the capability for our audience to share their ideas and thoughts more comprehensively, through a user-generated-content platform that can host their text, audio, pictures, images—anything they want to share. Imagine if we gathered everybody’s ideas for lessons around scientist visits to the classroom, for instance? Or great projects to do with youngsters? Or a collaborative study around a special event, like a comet passing by? We will start soon with a widget on our site but plan to expand functionality in 2014.
