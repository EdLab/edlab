<b>Title:</b> Expertise Differences in the Comprehension of Visualizations: A Meta-Analysis of Eye-Tracking Research in Professional Domains (2011)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Andreas Gegenfurtner, Erno Lehtinen & Roger Säljö</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> We can learn many things from watching humans look at information. The process of information visualization is tightly bound to the way we learn and there is some evidence that becoming proficient at something changes the way we visually take in and process new information in that field. Unfortunately studies that track eye movement using special equipment and software are often inconclusive. The method is involved and time-consuming which, coupled with a limited research budget, often makes for a small sample size. The authors of this study attempted to conduct a meta-analysis and combine data from several similar eye-tracking studies to test theories of visualization strategy adaptations in expert information seekers. </p>

<p>
The authors were specifically looking for evidence that experts spent less time looking at information, were better able to filter out redundant information, and were able to identify and focus on key information more quickly than novices. To study this, the research focused on fixations (the process of training the eye to look at a piece of information) and saccades (the distance of eye movements between fixations.) In the world of visualization studies fixations and saccades are important because they help researchers identify how looking at information translates into learning. The authors used a meta-analysis technique and studied results from 819 experts, 187 intermediates, and 893 novices in total. Data was collected from a variety of tasks and subjects of expertise. Criteria for inclusion in expertise groups were determined by the original study and some qualifiers for expertise included performance efficiency, group membership, and years of experience.  
</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors found that experts had shorter fixation durations, more fixations on task relevant areas, and fewer fixations on task-redundant areas than intermediates or novices. Experts also had longer saccades and shorter times to first fixate relevant information. The authors found that this was true across subjects of expertise and despite the differing conceptions of expert across the studies. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> It is clear from the results of this study that experts have a distinct advantage in viewing and processing information. This is an important finding for educators who may be designing or using learning objects. Considering that novices might not always look at task relevant areas, and may be more prone to look at task redundant areas compared to experts, educators should take such issues into consideration when designing learning objects. It may be possible to design an expert-like viewing experience for novices. For instance, a <a href="http://ir.mathcs.emory.edu/">group</a> at Emory University has <a href="http://ir-ub.mathcs.emory.edu/viewser/sigir636-lagun.pdf">investigated this possibility</a> using restricted visualization to focus on interesting results. Perhaps, novice learners could adopt such technology and stop straying. Future understanding in this area could lead to more efficient learning and a more rapid ascent from novice to expert.
