<p><i>"VoteRunLead supports the aspirations of women who want to transform our country and democracy through their participation as leaders."</i> (<a href="https://voterunlead.org/">VoteRunLead</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>15,000 Women and Counting</b></p>

<p>VoteRunLead has a threefold approach to engaging women in democracy. As the name implies, VoteRunLead aims to encourage women to develop an awareness of their voting power, encourage women’s aspirations to run for elective office, and share leadership stories. VoteRunLead was established by Erin Vilardi as the "largest national political training program readying women for public office and civic life, training over 15,000 women" <a href="https://voterunlead.org/who-we-are/team/">(VoteRunLead Meet the Team)</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Future is Female</b></p>
 
<p>VoteRunLead explains that women are a powerful voting block in deciding election outcomes. To further engage women in the voting process, VoteRunLead provides voter registration resources, highlights ways to mobilize voters, and features information on how voting systems affect who runs and who gets elected. VoteRunLead hopes that as women continue to make a difference in election outcomes policies important to women, such as pay equity, will make their way to the top of the policy agenda. </p>
 
<p>Beyond Women’s role in deciding election outcomes, VoteRunLead encourages women to pursue their aspirations in political life. The website provides online resources on women’s leadership, civic action, fundraising, and other topics centered around information for women interested in politics. In addition to web-based resources, VoteRunLead provides in-person clinics and events to connect women with information on how they can run for public office. Past workshops have focused on honing leadership skills, what positions to run for, and the importance of civility in politics. VoteRunLead has a wealth of resources to help women discover and pursue their political aspirations.</p>
