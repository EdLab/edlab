            <b>Admit It: Your Computer is What You Open and Close Your Eyes To</b>

I'm sorry, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/technology/10morning.html?bl&ex=1250049600&en=7d16ba3057e2733a&ei=5087%0A">this article</a> I could not resist presenting this to the EdLab.  While the majority of us spend our days online with eyes focused on a computer screen, why is it that we feel the need to continue that habit at home?  I've asked myself multiple times why I come home each day and hop right back on.  Better yet, why do I enjoy my Cheerios in the morning while checking email?   I'll be here at the EdLab in an hour, anyway.  

"Network deprivation" (aka "sleep") is a re-occurring problem for online update enthusiasts.  It's becoming faux-pas to reply to emails or post back on someone's wall in an untimely fashion (>1 hour).  

<blockquote>Arbor Networks, a Boston company that analyzes Internet use, says that Web traffic in the United States gradually declines from midnight to around 6 a.m. on the East Coast and then gets a huge morning caffeine jolt. “It's a rocket ship that takes off at 7 a.m,” said Craig Labovitz, Arbor's chief scientist.</blockquote> 

The Gudes, as described in the article, use texting as a pseudo intercom system in their home (used for waking each other up and getting each other's attention when is separate rooms).  

Families are also finding that ground rules need to be set for computer and cell phone usage, simply because due to their portability, they are capable of being used anywhere and anytime at home.

And finally, posted in <a href="http://community.nytimes.com/comments/www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/technology/10morning.html">the article's comments</a>:
<blockquote>Going into the office quietly in the morning and logging on my computer connects me to the world and prevents me from disturbing my sleeping wife. She is a night person and I am a morning one. By 5:30 am she is ready to wake up and start the day and I am ready to join her after spending 1-2 hours on our computer. I couldn't have it any other way. It keeps our marriage going.</blockquote>
