<p><b>Title:</b> How Young Children Learn to Program With Sensor, Action, and Logic Blocks (2008)</p>
<p><b>Author:</b>Peta Wyeth</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802395069#.U2zps61dWb8">Journal of the Learning Sciences</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What programming skills can children learn from and with programmable electronic blocks?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Teaching children coding skills is one of the most popular educational topics today, but it is not a brand new idea. In the early 1980s, <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~papert/">Seymour Papert</a> recognized the potential of computer programs for teaching problem solving and reflective thinking skills. However, the relatively abstract input and output formats in earlier educational tools made it difficult to engage more children and youth in this field. The development of programmable blocks and objects (like <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/31">littleBits</a>) seems to provide a more tangible environment for learning programming, and the author of this paper wanted to find empirical evidence to support this idea.</p> 

<p>In this study, twelve third-grade students participated in seven activity sessions using electronic blocks designed by the author. The blocks had three categories based on their functions: sensor, action, and logic. Learners combined various blocks to program. The author evaluated students' learning from lower-level understanding of syntax knowledge and coding simple structures to higher-order skills such as debugging, complex planning and evaluation of alternative coding strategies.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
In these sessions, students demonstrated their understanding of the syntax and functionality of the blocks. They did well on tasks involving sensor and action blocks but had some difficulties in activities that used logic blocks. In addition, students did not seem to reuse codes regularly. Students used debugging and planning skills in more complicated tasks. Overall, the tangible programming activities with electronic blocks facilitated studentsâ€™ understanding of simple abstract computational concepts.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> There is a renewed interest in teaching children programming and a variety of new apps and online platforms aim to make the learning experience fun and less intimidating. Popular programming platforms such as <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/868">Scratch</a> and <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a> use graphical blocks to bring the same physical logic to digital apps aimed at younger students. Programmable electronic objects such as <a href="http://littlebits.cc/">littleBits</a> provide some exciting new teaching possibilities. This paper provides encouraging findings towards making programming tangible.</p>
