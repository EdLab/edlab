<p><a href="https://tinybop.com/apps/mammals">Mammals</a> is the most recent app produced by Tinybop as part of its <a href="https://tinybop.com/apps">Explorer’s Library</a>collection. Priced at $2.99, the app allows kids ages four and up to interact with five different types of mammals and discover how they live, how their bodies function, and what makes each species unique.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Mammals gives curious, animal-loving kids the opportunity to explore every aspect of animal bodies and experiences. The user can focus on each species separately, or compare different features of them side by side. Comparative functions include "locomotion," where you can race two different animals at once, "vision," where your device’s camera is accessed and manipulated to allow you to see the world as each animal would during daytime and at night, and "fur," where you can view and "touch" a swatch of each animal’s coat to understand its texture and reaction to stimulation. These functions allow children both to embody the animal and to observe it up-close as an outsider without requiring a physical animal to be present.</p>

 <p>Mammals lets users see animated renderings of the muscular, skeletal, cardiovascular, urogenital, nervous, and digestive systems of each animal featured. Interactive elements that demonstrate the effects of different stimuli like movement, touch, and intake of food make the app particularly engaging. I also enjoyed the gamified exploration of animal-specific functions, such as using tigers’ retractable claws to scratch wood and catch mice and bats’ use of echolocation to locate insects to eat.</p>

<p>An adult dashboard and extensive handbook available in eight different languages makes Tinybop games easy to integrate into formal education practices. The handbook gives background information, further resources for a detailed study of the mammals featured in this app, and discussion questions. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Limited instructions leave the user to figure out all of the interactive elements of the app. This is a feature that works most of the time, but can lead to frustration. For instance, I wanted to make animals move faster when observing their cardiovascular system to watch and hear their heartbeats speed up, but I couldn’t figure out how. Additionally, I loved that you could take an animal’s entire skeletal system apart to reveal a fleshy blob, but there didn’t seem to be a way to put the animal back together, which left me aimlessly trying and, ultimately, disappointed. I think specific instructions within the Mammals handbook could be very helpful for times like these when users feel stuck.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>It’s important to note that Mammals isn’t a game, but an extremely fun interactive educational tool. I can see its merits both in classrooms and at home for young kids to understand what it means to be a mammal. For children interested in animal anatomy, Mammals can provide hours of both learning and entertainment.</p>
