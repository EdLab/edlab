<p>Antennas, a fictional character from Antennopoulous, convinces children to open up about their problems by putting their minds at ease. The gender-neutral alien is being used in Mexican hospitals in real-time psychological interventions both to build trust with children and to facilitate an accelerated consultation process. Psychologists and health professionals are embracing the technology because it helps them to build a picture of a child’s life at home, and serve a larger number of vulnerable children. </p>

<p>Antennas’ creator and child psychologist Julia Borbolla has invented other gender-neutral "special agents" to work with traumatized children. Dulas is red and wears bunny slippers so children in burn units understand Dulas is a patient in the hospital too. Botsy, another puppet, helps figure out how best to approach individual children about court cases.</p>

<p>The Antennas initiative has faced criticism from some medical experts, who question the appropriateness of teaching children to trust fictional characters, and the intervention has yet to undergo the rigor of peer review. But Dr. Borbolla, who has worked with children for over 35 years, wants to see the technology more widely used as a tool to encourage children to speak up and disclose what makes them sad in the hope of helping them move forward. Let us know what you think of Antennas in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/39584">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:30 George Nantwi:</b>If a study on the effectiveness of antennas is conducted, I would be interesting in 1) which students are being selected? 2) what are their psychological or emotional problems? 3) are the voice actors aware of each child's specific problem beforehand?, among other questions. </p>

<p><b>@03:44 RuthS:</b>Do the children speaking to Antennas ever find out that there is a real person behind it? If they do, I wonder if they ever feel betrayed by this tactic and find it more difficult to trust them after.</p>
