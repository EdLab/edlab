          <p>
            While searching for interesting professional development videos I came across a few good and not so good examples of instructional videos.

Annenberg Media's <a href="http://www.learner.org/">Learner.org</a> has a vast amount of information and video content. Their website is easy to navigate and their material is intuitively organized.  The one drawback is that the video opens in a pop up window.  In general, I tend to watch videos that play embedded in the website.  I don't like to click back and forth between the video and the other information on the website.  

In terms of the video content, Annenberg's production values are pretty high but stylistically they seem somewhat dated.

Annenberg's video <a href="http://www.learner.org/resources/series172.html#">Session One: How People Learn</a> is a good example of how to film in a classroom.  It looks like they used at least two cameras to get the teacher and cutaways on students reacting and engaging in the lesson. 

On the <a href="http://www.mtpsecondary.net/welcome.php">My Teaching Partner</a> website there is a great example of how not to film a classroom discussion.  The audio is poor and there are no cutaways.  They also do nothing to establish what is happening in the video and rely on text on the website to fill in the missing information.  I think if you are going to have video it needs to function on its own and tells you more than what you can simply read on the website.

On <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/">Edutopia,</a> a professional development website funded by the George Lucas Educational Foundation, there are numerous instructional videos.  http://www.edutopia.org/digitaldivide
The quality of the content here is somewhere in between the Teaching Partner and Annenberg's Learner.org. It is more professional than Teaching Partner and less rigid than Annenberg.  

I think the challenge in creating instructional videos for the web is doing it in a way that is fun and creative but also informative and functional.  Check out Slate's take on explaining<a href="http://slatev.com/player.html?id=1243561511">copyright laws.</a>  They do a great job of using the Internet to explore how users are sharing and adapting copyrighted material.
