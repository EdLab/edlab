          <p>
            There is a big movement towards making education affordable and available to underprivileged people in developing nations. International development organizations and non-government organizations (NGOs) are doing so through a grassroots school system. These systems are design to provide quality education in an informal way which will help students in struggling and impoverished places. This <a href="http://www.futurity.org/society-culture/grassroots-schools-educate-hard-to-reach-kids/">article</a>, shows a study that found that about two million children in Bangladesh lack formal classrooms, which make this idea of grassroots education very effective in places facing difficult social and financial problems. 

The structure of these grassroots programs is to provide an educational opportunity for hard to reach and marginalized children. This is done in a process where parents and individuals in the community play big roles in the establishment of a school. This program has started in San Francisco but many countries such as Bangladesh, Mali, Mexico and Tanzania used similar programs to educate children. The Shikon Program in Bangladesh has educated over 155,000 children between ages 7-14. The program uses the same curriculum provided in the schools throughout Bangladesh to educate children that would otherwise have no chance of receiving an education. This proves that the power of education is very strong and the opportunity to receive an education is growing even in areas where it would have been an afterthought.
