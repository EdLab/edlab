<p>When someone mentions "study abroad programs" most people think about a college semester spent in a foreign country, usually with the hopes of experiencing a different culture and lifestyle. However, the <a href="http://www.iie.org/">Institute of International Education</a> is trying to expand that view. </p>

<p>The Institute argues that because of the expanding globalization of communities and networks, it is more necessary than ever before for learners to connect on an international level. Careers and companies often have international ties, and to keep up with this, students should experience as much as they can on global scale.</p>

<p>But what about the financial burden? Many students cannot afford to travel to another country for a semester. That’s where the Institute of International Education’s "Generation Study Abroad" program comes in. This initiative is a five-year plan to double the number of students studying abroad by 2020 by providing scholarships, study abroad advisors, and other forms of support at various universities across the U.S.</p>

<p>Is this worthwhile initiative enough to help students take a semester in Italy? Croatia? New Zealand? What is the value of studying abroad, and is it enough to invest resources into programs like Generation Study Abroad? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25053/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:29 sarahvandenberg:</b> Are there certain majors that are optimal for study abroad, in terms of the economic benefits? Are those majors reflected proportionally in the 10% of students who currently study abroad? Similarly, does IIE have a set of countries it prioritizes and are those countries proportionally represented in current study abroad patterns?</p>

<p><b>@01:48 dinosossi2:</b> My experience studying abroad has enriched me beyond description. When you are among "your own people," there is little cause to discuss the essence of your shared national identity. However, when you are away from your "home and native land" and find yourself immersed among different people, where people have competing, deeply-held values, it can force you to find out what beliefs are truly important to you.</p>
