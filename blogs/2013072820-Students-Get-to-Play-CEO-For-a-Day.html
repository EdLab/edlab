Having business and marketing skills is important for any person, regardless of your position within an organization. But when can you start building these skills? Most people don’t have the opportunity until they are in college or even later.  This is where <a href="http://www.facebook.com/proempowerorg">Project Empower</a> comes in.  As an after-school program designed to teach business concepts to elementary school students, Project Empower allows kids to learn marketing, sales, and entrepreneurship at an early age.  This video highlights students of the After-School All-Stars at St. John’s University working in groups to pitch their business plans for a chocolate product to a panel of judges, or "investors." Throughout the learning process, the students were able to work with CEOs, professors, and university students.  At the end, a winning group was announced, and the students were able to meet the chocolatier, <a href="http://www.timothymaguire.com/">Timothy Maguire</a>, himself.  <p>

Not only did the students get to "play CEO" for a day and participate in a real-world situation, they also learned vital communication and collaboration skills.  What other real-world skills can organizations like Project Empower help teach younger students in after-school programs?  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9811">Add your thoughts</a> to the on-going discussion on Vialogues. <p>


<b>@00:27 sjohnson:</b> Giving students experiences they do not usually get until they are in college or after college! They get to be in the CEO’s shoes. <p>

<b>@01:17 mabel.zhuang:</b> It’s amazing how young students are now given opportunities to gain real-world experience. <p>

<b>@01:47 dani100:</b> Not only do they learn skills useful in business and marketing, they also build other interactive skills.
