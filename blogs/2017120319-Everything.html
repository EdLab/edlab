<p><a href="http://www.everything-game.com">Everything</a> is a video game for PS4 or PC that allows for a unique exploration of a simulated reality through the perspectives of a range of living and nonliving things. The game functions as a guide through different philosophy concepts without the player’s direct awareness. Utilizing recordings of philosopher Alan Watts as narration, this game aims to introduce old ideas to players in a new context. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Throughout Everything, you have the opportunity to view the game from perspectives ranging from the atomic level (you can be "carbon") to the interstellar (you can be "Earth") along with everything in between. Whether a bear or a snowball, blade of grass or police car, the player is taught to value a different view of the world and the speed at which changes occur in different perspectives. Only in such a format can the player actually get close to understanding another’s perspective. This made me really appreciate this game’s attempt to capture this advantage of modern gaming. Additionally, I loved that the rules guiding the game were also philosophical rules of life: players are taught they are part of something greater, not to hold on to things they don’t need, and to absorb ideas around them and use them to form their own understanding of the world. </p>

<p>Additionally, the game allows for the optional use of "audio logs," or narrative segments by Alan Watts, which are meditative and thought-provoking. The game never feels like it takes itself too seriously, yet I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a game that has caused me to consider the nature of being and unbeing so seriously and creatively. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, though I reached out to the game creators, I was unable to play a full version of Everything, so I can’t speak about its technical aspects. From watching a significant amount of gameplay videos, however, I can see some potential for frustration. This is a game that runs at its own pace, regardless of how fast you’d like to be moving. If there is a specific function or part of the game’s world you’d like to explore, you won’t be able to unless the opportunity presents itself. The lack of control is crucial to the game’s imitation of reality, but I imagine it can get annoying. </p>

<p>There is no antagonist in this game; the purpose is to explore the world and learn from it. For some, this lack of action and direction might translate into boredom or pointlessness, so if you are not the artistic type, this game isn’t for you. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I was enthralled by Everything’s narration, soundtrack, design, and conceptual base; I was hooked, which I think really speaks to the game’s effectiveness. While admittedly it’s not for everyone, I thoroughly recommend Everything based on its thoughtful design and successful execution.</p>
