<p><a href="https://squadedit.com/">Squad</a> is a collaborative coding platform that allows multiple users to edit code and chat in real time through text. This is similar to how <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> allows multiple users to work on a document simultaneously. Squad includes space for writing code next to a chat window for online conversations and recording important actions like saving and opening files. The chats are also saved so that users can search them if they need to recall important pieces of information from the conversation. This platform is ideal for students working together on coding projects. Students can use the team management function to assign roles such as front end developer or database developer. Access can be restricted to group members for security. A 50% discount is available for students who email Squad using their school email address.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The chat records archived in Squad can have benefits for learning. Students working on a project can explain a concept to one of their group members and help their peers learn a concept if they are having trouble understanding. The archived chat records act as a resource that confused group members can easily refer to if they are having trouble in the future. Squad is excellent for providing a space for <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/201">students to learn from other students</a> about coding. The real time collaboration on the same programming code streamlines the code editing process among multiple individuals. It eliminates clunky email exchanges and saves time.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The pricing may be a bit steep for teachers with 30 student classrooms, even with the 50%  discount. Unless teachers have a big technology budget, it may be difficult to have the entire class on the platform.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Squad helps programmers work and learn together. It could be used as a collaborative layer with learning sites like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">Codecademy</a>. Students toiling to learn code individually could work together with others using Squad. The team management feature is excellent for keeping group members on task. In the classroom teachers could use this feature to split students into small groups to work on their own code. The groups could include students of different skill levels so that they could help each other learn. Although Squad does not provide learning content, it does provide a space for code learning locally or across the world.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Squad is real time collaborative coding.</p>
