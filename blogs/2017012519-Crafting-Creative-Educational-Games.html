<p><a href="https://minecraft.net/en/stats/">Microsoft’s Minecraft</a> has sold over 24 million copies worldwide. I first found out about the game when I was a fourth grade English teacher in Istanbul, Turkey, because all of my students were obsessively playing it. I had meetings with many parents concerned about their child’s gaming addictions and my school even changed the theme of our grammar workbooks to Minecraft in an effort to ride the wave. Microsoft has also taken notice of the phenomenon, as they recently released the <a href="https://education.minecraft.net">Education Edition</a>, which could be a game-changer for learning games.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Minecraft is an Open World game that allows its users to build their own societies and interact with other users. Players collect <i>inventory</i>, trade, poach from other users, and construct digital structures. The special education edition takes something kids already love and emphasizes learning opportunities. There are tons of pre-made worlds and lesson tutorials for teachers to choose from. I saw excellent lesson plans on geometry, fractions, and deforestation that prompt educators to translate new student understandings to the physical space. There is a strong emphasis on creative and constructive thinking in these vast digital worlds. Unlike other Minecraft editions, this one has new tools for teachers to utilize. For example, teachers can leave instructions on signs or with <i>people</i> that hyperlink to external resources. Students can take <i>selfies</i> and document work into an exportable portfolio, creating opportunities for feedback and assessment.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>If you are not a regular Minecraft user there will be a steep learning curve ahead. It took a while for me to begin navigating the world and using objects. Even with the tutorial, educators should be ready to dedicate a significant amount of time to the implementation of this game. Students who are not familiar with the game will need hours to learn how to play as simple tasks like walking back and forth, and focusing your view require some motor mastery. It is also extremely time consuming to build worlds and assignments. This is definitely not a last minute lesson plan option.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Students may have hours to spend on Minecraft that most teachers do not, but once the gameplay is implemented, there are tons of learning possibilities available for students. Research has a shown that there is a positive correlation between academic achievement and learning through gaming. It seems to be a win-win situation when educators teach students through media these learners already enjoy.</p>
