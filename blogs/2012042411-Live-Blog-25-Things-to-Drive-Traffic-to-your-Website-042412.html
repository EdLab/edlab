What resources do you already have? mailing lists etc., collect email addresses at every possible chance! 

Simple giveaways @ conferences... raffle, have people drop-off business cards, have email everywhere etc.

Important to segment these email lists! 

Create a detailed plan, timeline, schedule & test.  Do A/B testing  ---> Bisect to two different pages... like an eye test, A is better?  Why? Do you prefer B... (Is this always necessary?)

Everything on your site should be modular & buildable. 

Don't over-promise! 


<b>Main Challenges:</b>
