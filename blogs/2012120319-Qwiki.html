<a href="http://www.qwiki.com/">Qwiki</a> is a highly automated way to create an interactive video presentation by curating images, video, audio, and written content from the internet and personal files. Qwiki uses flexible audio and intuitive labeling and linking to create a professional-looking video with minimal user input. A winner of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/qwiki-techcrunch-disrupt-winner/">TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco</a>, the company moved <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/technology/for-tech-startups-new-york-has-increasing-allure.html?pagewanted=all">back to NYC</a> in February 2012 to pursue relationships with major media outlets. The relocation has paid off; the service is currently <a href="http://www.qwiki.com/">being used</a> by news outlets like ABC, Time, & Yahoo! and has a partnership with Bing for seamless integration into search results. Qwiki has released an iPad app and a mobile version is coming soon.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b>
Qwiki is highly intuitive. Its gesture-like drag and drop navigation seems to make it an obvious choice for touch and mobile. The system is also very scalable; as a touch program, it would be appropriate for young students though it has the capacity to be sophisticated enough to work beyond K-12. The program leads users through Qwiki creation in a fixed, deliberate way, but the diversity of inputs and arrangement make for an open and unique final product. Production is disarmingly simple and extremely fast. It will make a powerful school project hack until teachers get wise to its power.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b>
Once teachers do get wind of the system, it might be best to introduce it with a heavy dose of information literacy. Qwiki automatically attributes and links, but its display is only as good as the input site’s metadata. The capacity to integrate practically anything from the internet into a professional, snappy video is a power that comes with great responsibility. Quite a bit of attribution work and source vetting should go into curation of this kind, and Qwiki is so fast that it seems to court misuse.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Critical information selection has long been a key skill for formal schooling; curating sources in modern ways and applying critical skills to multimedia content may be the evaluation essay of the future. Qwiki’s speed and ease-of-use make it a contender for the evolution of curation in learning and tools. It may even change the way we communicate outside of school. The concept of building cross-content online spaces around particular ideas is becoming more important and far more common as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest constantly demonstrate. Qwiki seems like a distillation of this increasingly frequent interaction and that concept should make it standard in schools and beyond.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b>
Qwiki is clear, quick, and contemporary.</p>
