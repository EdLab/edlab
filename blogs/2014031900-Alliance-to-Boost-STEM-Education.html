          <p>
            At times, to overcome a common enemy, you need an alliance. This is true for the New Mexico/Texas Alliance for STEM Education, which <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-mexicotexas-alliance-for-stem-education-forms-program-to-help-students-and-their-parents-receive-high-school-diploma-250595891.html">just partnered with local high school students</a> in Albuquerque. The primary purpose of the alliance is to help the high school students help their parents complete their high school education. One of the main reasons behind the alliance is that a lot of parents go through difficult times in their lives (e.g. incarceration, early pregnancy) that prevented them from completing their high school education. Education experts will design the program and the curriculum is expected to enable the parents to finally complete their high school education. The program also aims to help increase interest and participation in STEM by minority groups in New Mexico and Texas. 

I think this is a great way to help the community. Not only are they developing a good educational system for the children, but also parents who were unable to complete their education. It's rare for people to receive a second chance in life, even if the situation was not their fault, so the alliance is a really great idea.
