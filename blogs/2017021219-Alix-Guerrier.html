<p>Alix Guerrier is the co-founder and president of <a href="https://learnzillion.com/p/">LearnZillion</a>, a platform that provides teachers with a library of interactive math and language arts lessons, videos, quizzes, and assignments for students. Guerrier is a former public school teacher who taught middle school and high school math. Before founding LearnZillion, he was a consultant in McKinsey & Company’s Education Practice. His previous professional experience also includes directing an after-school program in one of Boston’s public housing projects and working on public housing finance in New York. He currently serves on the boards of Capital City Public Charter School and the non-profit organization GuideStar USA. Guerrier has a Masters in Education from the Stanford University School of Education and an MBA degree from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. He graduated from Harvard University with an AB degree in physics.<p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at LearnZillion?</b><br>
<p>By far, the part of my professional background that has the greatest impact on my work today is my time as a classroom teacher. My first experience leading a classroom full-time was overseas in Brazil. When I returned to the U.S., I taught sixth grade and subsequently high school math in public schools in the San Francisco Bay Area. At LearnZillion, we work hard to create curricular materials and software that support classroom teachers in their efforts on behalf of students. I hope that my experience and those of my colleagues at LearnZillion (a large fraction of us, including my co-founder, have been classroom teachers and in some cases principals) allow us to more effectively design products that speak to the true needs experienced by educators on a daily basis. For a similar reason, I'm grateful for having had the opportunity to serve as a consultant to school districts for several years. At LearnZillion, we hope to serve the entire school district, in all its complexity, though we have a focus on tools that classroom teachers use.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at LearnZillion will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Our singular focus is on great teaching. That is, what teachers say to students, or what they don't say; what they ask students to do, how they respond to what they see students doing, and the other actions taken and decisions made by teachers in pursuit of introducing new concepts to their students. Teaching effectively is hard to do and almost every teacher I encounter shares the sense that he or she is on a journey of continually improving in the craft. Our goal is to support teacher growth along that path. We strongly believe that we can make a big difference in this area, and that teachers and students deserve to be better served. The specific core beliefs that guide our work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students’ circumstances should not limit their learning opportunities,
<li>Students need to feel cared for, believed in, and a sense of belonging among their peers and adults,
<li>Teaching that focuses on solid student understanding ensures successful learning performance,
<li>Students learn most through productive struggle towards a worthwhile goal,
<li>Technology cannot replace teachers, but can expand their effectiveness and generate opportunities for learning,
<li>Teaching improves with easy access to meaningful materials and time to dive deeply into content,
<li>Professional collaboration and community are vital to a teacher’s success, and
<li>School and district leaders empower teachers to learn and grow.
</ul>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Similar to other sectors, the growing power of data-fueled machine learning techniques will have a big impact on the work of teaching and learning. However, I suspect that this will <i>not</i> be through the replacement of teachers, mentors, parents, coaches, and the like with artificially intelligent robot tutors in the sky. Instead, I believe that first major benefits will accrue from the relationships and interactions between students and the adults who care about their learning.</p>

<p>I also believe in an inevitable move away from some of the abstractions that currently serve as proxies for learning, whether those be test scores, grades, badges, credentials, etc. In my mind, these proxies include some of the more recent and <i>disruptive</i> innovations. Instead, I believe that we will return to an understanding of learning as an inherently enjoyable and practical achievement for students. This would mean students learning simply for their own personal joy or because they want to acquire a particular set of knowledge and skills, independent of any external validation or credential.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at LearnZillion, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>The only other area of focus for me, though it is a very important one, is the project of raising two young daughters with my wife and other family members. Professionally, I would be happy to stay at LearnZillion for the duration; it is a blessing to be able to work with the team here.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
