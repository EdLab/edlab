          <p>
            Imagine yourself at the age 13 and coming home from school to hear that your father has found you a much older husband. Ideally, you'll remind your father of your rights and most likely call off the wedding. However, in some countries, girls have no say. Essentially, what the family decides is final. This is Laila's predicament. Laila is a thirteen-year-old girl from Yemen whose father gave her into marriage. As a result, Laila had to quit school and become a housewife, and eventually became a mother.
<p>
There are many girls around the world who have fallen victim to early child marriage like Laila. Child marriage destroys children's lives, and it's mostly exercised in developing countries. <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/youthink/empowering-girls-and-young-women-what-works?hootPostID=354cfad3f1db3333f4afd5abe91e1c8a" target = "blank">Empowering women and girls</a> can be very an effective way of combating this and other forms of discrimination or inequality. We need to promote girls' empowerment. We can do this by implementing comprehensive and interactive interventions in schools and community settings. This will be vital in improving sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Education is also very important in achieving this goal. However, there are many girls around the world being shunned or denied access to education. Girls need to be educated to achieve independence and demonstrate their skills.
