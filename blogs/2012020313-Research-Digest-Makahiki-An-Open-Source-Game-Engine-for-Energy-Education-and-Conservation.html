<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/11-07/11-07.pdf">Lee, G.E., Xu, Y., Brewer, R.S., Johnson, P.M., Makahiki: An Open Source Game Engine for Energy Education and Conservation. <i>Foundations of Digital Games</i>, 2012.</a>

<b>Description:</b> This paper describes a way of using <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamification</a></b> to teach students about energy and energy conservation. The authors go about this by creating Makahiki, an open source game engine, created for a residence hall competition, that uses the concepts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game">serious gaming</a> to teach players about energy issues and motivate them to conserve energy. The games combines a virtual setting, which was on a Moodle platform, with 24 real-world events like workshops on energy-related matters, trips to a wind farm, and more energy related activities. The most interesting real-life component of this game was that smart meters were installed on each residential floor to measure energy consumption and of course each floor would compete to see who can save the most energy. This process allows for instant feedback, an important gaming component. The paper describes the other activities of the game and report on ways to improve upon it, so that more students would participate next year and learn more about energy and energy consumption. Another goal is to have other schools adopt this open source game engine with few changes like removing the smart meter component, and changing the focus to water conservation. So future work will involve making Makihiki into a more pluggable framework.

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b> The interesting thing about this paper is that it involves making a game out of a very serious issue, and the game itself wasn't completely in the virtual world. Utilizing the real-world component of the smart meters can help students see how different appliances affect energy consumption, and hopefully form a habit of saving energy even after the competition. Another unique aspect of this paper was the fact that game engine was being requested for use in other schools. It would be an interesting product to create, an engaging game system that teaches students about an important issue that can be customized by each school that uses it. Hopefully this great game spreads to the other states as well.
