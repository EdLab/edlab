<a href="http://lingt.com/home/">Lingt</a> is a language learning program developed in <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N14/startups.html">2009</a> by Justin Cannon and Chris Varenhorst, a couple of MIT students annoyed with the lack of pronunciation feedback in their Chinese courses. The classroom edition of Lingt was developed to allow students to easily record audio files and share them with teachers. The platform, then backed by Y Combinator, expanded into a suite of tools for Chinese learning including a flascard-esque vocabulary tool, audio input and output, and progress tracking with game features. 

<b>Pros:</b>
Lingt gets right into the action. It seems meant to mimic the utter confusion of an unfamiliar country. There are timers and pressure and inexplicable progress bars. The system throws out a rapid-fire series of pictures, audio, multiple choice, and short answer questions. Success is met with a ding and failures are quickly swept away. The overall effect is addictive and stimulating. The clean UI and clever feedback have aged well and while the Flickr-sourced pictures occasionally malfunction, the system remains fast and spiffy. 

<b>Cons:</b>
It takes a long time to learn anything from Lingt. I think their quick approach could be augmented with a structured lesson. Learning based on guessing incorporates a bit too much failure to be really effective. It also has a bit of a ghost town feel, it's a good tool and still very effective but it would be nice to see a little energy around the platform.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Like our mSchool experiments in language learning, Lingt isn't a standalone product. It seems like it would work well to augment classroom learning in an introductory Chinese course, but it would be nicer if it could adapt to individual curriculums. The potential of the resource has led to its purchase by Dictonary.com, the Lingt structure is meant to augment the flash card functionality of the site. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Lingt does what it does very well but has applications beyond its current structure.
