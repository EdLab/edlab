Means, Barbara and Toyama, Yuki and Murphy, Robert and Bakia, Marianne and Jones, Karla (2009) Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning: A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies. Project Report. Centre for Learning Technology.</a>

U.S. Department of Education, Center for Technology in Learning published a project report investigating the effectiveness of online learning. 
It is an evaluation of “evidence-based practices in Online Learning. It is a meta-analysis, 50 studies were investigated. Here's a brief summary of background on these data sets. 	
-	40% of the studies were in the Medical/Health related subjects.
-	80% of the studies were conducted in Higher Education.
-	the average learner age ranged from 13 to 44.
-	number of students in the studies ranged from 16-1857, only 10% of the studies included more than 400 learners

These Research Questions are also the common questions that educators would like to ask. 
Here are they with the findings.
<b>1.	How does the effectiveness of online learning compare with that of face-to-face instruction? </b>
Results: 
Students in online conditions performed <b>modestly</b> better, on average, than those learning the same material through traditional face-to-face instruction. (modestly meaning not significant, not necessarily better)

<b>2.	Does supplementing face-to-face instruction with online instruction enhance learning? </b>
Results: 
Blends of online and face-to-face instruction, on average, had <b>significantly stronger</b> learning outcomes than did face-to-face instruction alone.
The effect sizes were larger in which the online instruction was collaborative or instructor-directed than in those studies where online learners worked independently. 

<b>3.	What practices are associated with more effective online learning? </b>
Results:
The effectiveness of online learning approaches appears quite broad across <b>different content and learner types</b>. (other variables considered: sample size, type of knowledge tested, study design, unit of assignment to condition, instructor equivalence, equivalence of curriculum)

Few rigorous research studies of the effectiveness of online learning for K—12 students have been published (only 7 in this meta-analysis). There were no experimental or controlled quasi-experimental studies comparing the learning effects of online versus face-to-face instruction for K—12 students from 1994 ~ 2006 in the literature. 

<b>4.	What conditions influence the effectiveness of online learning? </b>
Results:
<li>Online learning can be enhanced by giving <b>learners control</b> of their interactions with media and prompting <b>learner reflection</b>. </li>

<li>Providing individual <b>personalized guidance</b> appears to be more successful than the same mechanism for groups.  </li>

<li>Elements such as video or online quizzes do <b>not</b> appear to influence the amount that students learn in online classes. Inclusion of more media in an online application does not appear to enhance learning. The practice of providing online quizzes does not seem to be more effective than other tactics such as assigning homework. </li>

<br>
I'm not surprised with the results at all. I found it aligned with my phd work actually. Blended learning results in better learning performances. Empowering students with control and providing personalized guidance enhance students learning. The only thing i'm puzzled would be the last bullet point finding. Videos or online quizzes are two powerful mediums for instruction in education. I'd love to see the evaluation and results validation across domains.May be not good for one domain subject, but super powerful for another?
