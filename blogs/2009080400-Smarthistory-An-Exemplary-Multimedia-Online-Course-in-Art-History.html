            <a href="http://smarthistory.org">Smarthistory.org</a> was selected as the winner of the <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/">2009 Webby Award</a> for best education website.  The New York Times calls the Webby Awards the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet. This educational website was created in 2005 and is actually an open course focusing on art history. It is being developed by two art historians and funded by the Samuel H. Kress grant to partner with the Portland Art Museum. This open course is applied with rich multimedia tools including text, images, podcasts, and screen-casts, which enables a more dynamic and multifaceted learning experience for students than its traditional counterparts. As shown on its website, the course has gained popularity among faculties and learners in a number of art institutions and higher education institutions including Columbia, Duke, and Princeton.

"The Smarthistory audio was awesome, was never so interested in a history class before, enjoyed it thoroughly from beginning to end."

"Bravo! Thanks for bringing art history into the 21st century. I am definitely going to share this site/as well as your accompanying blog with my students and colleagues....Stokstad and Jansen are great but soooo heavy!"
J. Perez (faculty) 4/7/08</blockquote>

I was impressed by its clean design and harmonious presentation of multiple multimedia content. It further let me think about our going-on <b>TC Assets Project</b>. However, one of the main features of the Smarthistory lies in that it organizes content from multiple outside sources and makes it as an open resource course. Currently, the platforms we use for developing mini courses are <a href="http://pbworks.com/">PBWorks</a>, <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a>, and <a href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/moodle/">TC Moodle</a>. The former two are more self-design based, while the latter one is of a fixed format. There are two directions we might need to decide in the next-step development:

1) Open Resource Course -- Just like Smarthistory and <a href="http://hbsp.harvard.edu/">Harvard Business Publishing</a>, we organize and present content in an educative and artistic way, aiming at learners' self-directed learning without "imposing" the teacher-student interaction given in a formal course (instead, it will be linked with multiple social networking sites).

2) Formal EdLab Course -- We further polish the mini courses we have and select/design a common platform to put content on. We might also need to incorporate classic references which do not belong to TC assets.
