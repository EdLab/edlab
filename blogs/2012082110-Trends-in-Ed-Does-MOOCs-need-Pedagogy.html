          <p>
            MOOC, Massive Open Online Course, seems to become a landmark of the new digital learning map.  MOOC is unconventional in a way that unlike traditional classroom lecturing, <a href="http://courserafantasy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/creation-curation-and-virtual-trash-can.html?m=1"> “it is an opportunity to create content collaboratively and to curate existing content” </a>.  The ideal vision of MOOC lies on its ability to facilitate interactive and innovative learning relationships. In such collaboration, learners can transfer knowledge, ideas, and content that is valuable to others. Members of the learning community learn from each other, sharing understanding, solving problems collaboratively. 

What MOOC tries to make it true is that every learner is a <b>participant</b> of a community in which ideas, knowledge, and learning experiences are created and shared. Individual participants could bring their content valuable to other participants in their own ways. In this sense, MOOC experiment takes people to think about the participant pedagogy. What are effective pedagogical strategies to benefit massive online learning? Is there a norm of pedagogy of participatory learning? Here I quoted some interesting comments by <a href="http://researchity.net/2012/08/15/zero-pedagogy-a-hyperbolic-case-for-curation-and-creation-over-education/">Dominik Lukes</a> on this topic.

<blockquote> Despite its etymology, pedagogy [leading of boys], cannot be given. It must be sought. The learner is her own pedagogue. There may be more or less clearly given explanations, more or less productive sequences of learning, more or less accessible learning materials. But none have made, will make or can make a difference to the resistant learner.</blockquote>
<blockquote> If pedagogy could really make a difference to mass learning, it would have already done so. Advances in mass literacy, numeracy and other skill increases seem to always happen prior to putative advances in pedagogy but following the expansion of access.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A self-directed, self-motivated learner, will take any resources (no matter how pedagogically naive or badly instructionally designed — Khan Academy, iTunesU lectures, iPad ebooks, labs, conventional classes or TED videos) and use them to learn. As the learner becomes more aware of their own learning (gaining metacognitive skills), they will look for resources that suit their learning better. And, in many cases, will create such resources. That's why we need to encourage a culture of the remix. Or in starker terms: Curation and creation over education.
</blockquote>

Therefore (concluded from Dominik's comments), a self-directed, self-motivated learner would just learn from all available materials, even if they were poorly instructionally designed. Learner motivation seems to weigh more than pedagogy in a massive collaborative learning community. Do you agree? What are your thoughts?
