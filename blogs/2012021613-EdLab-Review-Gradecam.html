<a href="http://www.gradecam.com/">GradeCam</a> is an app that allows educators to instantly grade their multiple choice exams using a web or document camera (here is a <a href="http://www.gradecam.com/cameras/gradecam-has-friends/">list of compatible cameras</a>). GradeCam provides special forms for students to use for multiple choice exams. The form looks like a normal scantron but has an extra field for a student's identification number. This number helps the program know to whom an exam belongs.  Once the document camera takes a picture of the form, the program outputs a grade instantly, allowing educators to gather immediate feedback on their students' performance. Anyone can sign up for a free GradeCam account but there are several other  <a href="http://www.gradecam.com/plans/">payment plans</a> that provide more services and options.

<b>Pros:</b> 
The most obvious benefit to instant grading is the amount of time that educators will save grading exams. This will give them more time to teach, or to provide students with feedback on how they did on the exam. Any product that saves an educator time is an extremely valuable one!

<b>Cons:</b> 
The cost and need for extra equipment is something that drags this product down.The price for a single teacher to use GradeCam is $180 per year plus the cost of the camera, if needed.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
GradeCam provides teachers and students instant feedback on multiple choice exams. This feedback includes students' scores, test performance, class reports, and benchmarks. Still, GradeCam could offer more in terms of feedback. For example, it could provide students with extra resources to re-teach them about the questions they got wrong on the exam. Then, the student could take the same type of exam again, but with different questions, to see if they understood the concept. If they did not, the feedback could provide a different type of resource, and the process would repeat until the student fully understands the concept. This process is known as adaptive learning; GradeCam could potentially add some adaptive learning elements to their product.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
This could be the start of some powerfully innovative educational products but, as it is now, GradeCam is a great time-saver&mdash; a quality that is of high value to educators.
