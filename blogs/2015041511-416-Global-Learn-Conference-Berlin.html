            Hi everyone! I'm presenting my <a href="http://www.thechosenseed.weebly.com">John Milton Digital Library </a>tomorrow, April 16th, at the Global Learn conference in Berlin (I'll be presenting virtually, because airfare ain't cheap)! 

The presentation is from 12:05-12:25pm and I'll be covering the general purpose of the site, how I made it, why it's important, and other cool stuff. Here's the link to the discussion board, if you're so inclined to leave me feedback and compliments.
https://academicexperts.org/conf/glearn/2015/papers/44220/
<p>
I created this baby back in grad school for a class project when I discovered a digital library did not exist for John Milton (GASP). It was only supposed to be a paper but I got a little carried away and created the whole damn website (it's easier to write 20 pages about something that actually exists). It's in prototype mode, meaning all of the links either don't work or they go to landing pages that I didn't create. <strike>Also, I'm pretty sure there's some heavy copyright infringement going on because I lifted all of those images, and maybe some content, from Google.</strike>I'M AN HONORABLE LIBRARIAN, I SWEAR. </p>

<b>*Please don't crash my site like you all did last time.*</b> Be gentle with her.

Here's my abstract to whet your appetite:
<blockquote>The John Milton Digital Library (JMDL) is an online platform for scholars, researchers, students, professors, and information seekers interested in learning more about John Milton and his works. The JMDL aims to serve as an information and community resource for those wishing to study Milton's works alongside critical reviews, biographical information, and upcoming and existing exhibitions that may be of interest to those in the field. It is the only digital library of its kind and offers a host of useful and intellectually stimulating content, while giving its users access to the complete works of John Milton, courtesy of the public domain. The JMDL will offer full text PDF downloads of all of Milton's works, provide biographical information, collaborative online discussion spaces for intelligent conversation, and highlight critical reviews and exhibitions of Milton's works. A mock digital library has been created and readers are invited to peruse for a better visual representation.</blockquote>
