          <p>
            This summer I had an opportunity to intern at JPMorgan for six weeks. My internship experience was very good as I was exposed to the financial world and gained a lot of knowledge about banking. I was placed under the stock loan division under the prime brokerage department, which focuses on servicing hedge funds and other financial institutions. Going into the internship, I felt that Wall Street had a very strict working environment. However I was proven wrong by how welcoming and friendly the people were, especially towards interns. The stock loan team had over 20 members, which made it difficult for me to know everyone. However everyone made themselves available to help me become comfortable. 
<p>
I really liked how I was able to shadow my coworkers and ask them questions about what their work or any specific projects at JP Mogran. I was able to attend meetings, ask questions and sought new work once I was done with a task. This was important because it allowed me to grow and gain confidence. My boss and supervisors made themselves available to talk about work, school and life. I learned a lot about stock loan, and banking in general. Overall my time at JPMorgan was amazing and my biggest takeaway is to always have the will to learn, work hard, be creative and open to new ideas and feedback.
<p>
This fall, as I return to EdLab, I hope to carry on much of what I learned at JPMorgan. One way I think the EdLab can make its internship experience better for future interns is to allow them to help staff with work whenever there is a need. Also if possible, it might be good for them to shadow and learn from coworkers about what from time to time. This way the interns will be aware of what others are doing and the different projects EdLab is working on. I also think it is important for interns to improve communication and presentation, and it will be good to schedule meetings and constantly present their work, even if it is to a few colleagues.
