            One trend that I have noticed throughout my research on Global Education is the lack of quality teachers. Many undeveloped countries see this as the primary reason why students don't perform well. I recently <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/10911" target = "blank">blogged</a> about racial inequality in South Africa's schools. One of the solutions proposed by staff members there is the recruitment of better teachers from neighboring countries. What are some of the incentives that can cause neighboring teachers to leave their country and go to South Africa? Nonetheless, this <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/teacher-opinions-and-what-who-and-how-teacher-incentive-programs" target = "blank">article</a> from the World Bank compare and contrast the different incentive schemes that can boost teachers' performance as well as students' performance.
<p>
According to a source from the World Bank, there are five incentive schemes that have been studied. These incentive schemes can either be competitive or non-competitive. Although studies have proven that non-competitive teacher incentives are most effective, undeveloped countries are forced to adapt to competitive teacher incentives because of budget constraints. The five type of incentive schemes are: 
<ul>
<li><b>hardship pay</b> recruiting teachers to work in difficult conditions
<li><b>scarce expertise pay</b> recruiting teachers who can teach selected subjects (like math and science), <li><b>attendance pay</b> rewarding teachers who simply shows up at school and teach. 
</ul>
<p>
The remaining incentives are often referred to as "standard-based" because they establish the different levels teachers need to meet. The standard-based incentives are: 
<ul>
<li><b>certification pay</b> reward teachers who have shown mastery of teaching knowledge or skills
<li><b>merit pay</b> reward teachers for increases in the test scores of their students. 
</ul>
Generally, most of the attention is focused on these two incentives, including attendance pay because basically they are the most important ones and determine how well students are performing. By far, teacher incentives have proved to be a motivating program for teachers.
