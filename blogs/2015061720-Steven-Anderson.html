Steven W. Anderson is a learner, blogger, speaker, educational evangelist, author, and dad. As a former teacher and director of instructional technology, Steven (known on Twitter as <a href="http://bit.ly/1FYChI8">@web20classroom</a>), is highly sought after for his expertise in educational technology integration and using social media for learning. Steven presents at conferences worldwide and is also responsible in helping create #edchat, the most popular educational hashtag on Twitter. We asked him a few questions about his work and his predictions for the future of technology integration in classrooms.  

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
When I received my undergraduate degree in Middle Grades Education from Western Carolina I went straight to working in my own classroom. There I discovered the power that technology could have to impact learning. I was working with students in an alternative setting where traditional teaching wouldn’t work. We experimented with technology—using desktops, clickers, and more to help these students, who were not accustomed to success in the classroom, find some. From there I learned I could pursue a Masters in instructional technology and I could work with teachers to help them discover what I had done with technology. And the rest is professional history for me. I’ve had the opportunity to work with countless educators from across the globe, helping them feel empowered to use a variety of tools to engage students in different ways. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
We live in what might be the greatest times ever in human history. We have access to all known knowledge and are creating new and exciting knowledge daily. I want students to be able to drive their own learning paths and discover what matters to them. And we live in an age in which that is easier than ever. I hope that the work I do with educators helps them see that students, given the opportunity, have the potential to have a true impact in their world. But I also want educators to discover their passions for teaching and see that, through technology, teaching and learning can be exciting and meaningful again. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The increased penetration of digital devices in the hands of students will have the most impact. That, coupled with enhanced access to high-speed networks anywhere are opening and will open the potential for huge leaps in what students learn and can do. Also social media and our access to information and knowledge as it is created is changing content as we know it. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> 
I am continuing to work on several projects. I have a real passion for helping our educational leaders understand their role in the technology integration process. So I’ve been working with a number of administrators on helping them better understand technology, walkthroughs, and evaluating technology. I also continue work with schools and districts around my three books, <a href="http://bit.ly/1Qa7lnV"><i>The Relevant Educator</i></a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1JVmJVq"><i>Content Curation</i></a> (available from Corwin Press), and <a href="http://bit.ly/1LJfOxH"><i>The Tech-Savvy Administrator<i></a> (available from ASCD Press). 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
1) <a href="http://bit.ly/1FYGID3">Amber Teamann</a>, an Assistant Principal in Texas; a passionate learner doing incredible things for kids and leaders around the country. <br>
2) <a href="http://bit.ly/1ExqYQ7">Nick Provenzano</a> is a High School English Teacher in Michigan and one of the nation’s leaders in innovative teaching practices. <br>
3) <a href="http://bit.ly/1Qa888o">Kyle Pace</a> is an instructional technologist in Missouri; he is another technology leader, specializing in Google Apps for education and helping teachers discover their passions for learning.
