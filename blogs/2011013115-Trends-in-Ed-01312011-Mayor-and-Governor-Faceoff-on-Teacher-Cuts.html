            Andrew Cuomo's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/nyregion/31bloomberg.html?_r=1&ref=education">first political battle as governor</a> of New York has an opponent in New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. As expected by many insiders, Cuomo's first budget includes serious cuts to education, with teachers expected to be the worse hit. At issue is the budget's protection of long serving teachers when it comes to whom to lay off. It essentially states that the city must fire all teachers hired in the past five years, regardless of their performance. If it goes accordingly, around 15,000 teachers will get the ax.

Mayor Bloomberg is proposing a change to the law so the city can have more say in deciding which teachers to lay off. The so-called “seniority rule” is heavily backed by teacher unions and it is likely that Cuomo will not budge at the mayor's insistence. Hugely popular and enjoying a high approval rating since taking the reins earlier this year, one of Cuomo's early mandates is the reduction of spending. Mayor Bloomberg, suffering from the lowest approval ratings of his mayoral administration and <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5086">still feeling the fallout of the Cathleen Black appointment</a>, may see this fight as his way of crawling back into the education debate as he continues his quest for complete control of America's largest public school system. Battle lines have been drawn, now let the battle commence…..
