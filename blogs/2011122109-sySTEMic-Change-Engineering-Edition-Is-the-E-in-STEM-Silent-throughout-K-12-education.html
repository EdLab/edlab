Out of the STEM subjects, engineering does not seem to be as popular as the rest of his friends, Science, Technology, and Math. In K-12 education, there is a great emphasis on Science and Math education, but not as much for Technology, and nearly non-existent for Engineering. In a world growing more and more dependent on technology, shouldn't we start teaching our children from a young age all that goes into planning and creating technology.

Although engineering does not just pertain to creating technology such as iPhones, tablets and computers. It is a discipline that is used to build many other structures, and machines such as planes, space shuttles, trains, and buildings, among others. I believe that some students are already thinking and practicing engineering. An example is when pre-schoolers build structures with <a href ="http://www.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">LEGOS,</a> (<a href ="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6974">Now there's a a girl version!</a>). I believe we should continue to educate more students on the discipline of building and creating, the subject known as engineering.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> My opinion is that teaching students more engineering from a young age would change all of the STEM fields in general, not just education. There are some schools that are starting to introduce younger students to creating and programming robots. Companies are also contributing to the engineering education, by creating and selling products that will educate young students on robotics. LEGOS for example just came out with a product called <a href ="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6976">Mindstorms for which Kate has provided more details about in Digital vs Analogue.</a> The Engineering Edition of sySTEMic Change will take a closer look at some of the ways K-12 educators are teaching the subject of engineering, in hopes that more students will become more interested in STEM education. Let's keep building everyone.
