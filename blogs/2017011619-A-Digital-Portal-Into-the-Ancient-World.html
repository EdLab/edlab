<p><a href="http://topostext.org/index.php/our-places#36.1209864/21.0903250/5">ToposText</a> is a free web and mobile app that connects users to ancient Greek literary culture and history. The app presents over 5,000 places relevant to the ancient Greek world, including cities, shrines, castles, museums, and excavation sites. It then links these physical locations to the words of ancient authors who wrote about them in Greek or Latin. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>ToposText opens to a location-aware map of northern Europe dotted with yellow icons indicating sites of historic interest. When I tap on an icon at random, I am taken to a description of Abdera, an ancient Greek city-state. At the top of this city-stateâ€™s page is a detailed account of its current topography, intended to help orient modern visitors. Below this are excerpts from dozens of primary source texts written by Herodotus, Cicero, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch, all of which mention Aberda by name. Most of these texts are viewable in their original Greek or Latin and in English translation. Hyperlinks appear throughout the texts, allowing users to view all places mentioned by name on a reference map. I love that with ToposText I can spatially explore the world of antiquity and learn about historic sites from the scholars of the ancient world.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>I appreciate that ToposText includes resources for tourists (including links to Google Maps driving directions), but it would be helpful if the app offered photographs or videos of the places listed for those of us who are unable to visit in person. As it is, the app is mostly populated by dense primary source texts with little contemporary context. This is great for scholars but could be discouraging to a more general audience. In the future, I would also like to see the scope of this app extended to include more historical places and locations outside of Italy and Greece.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>As someone enamored with classical language and archeology, I am an enthusiastic fan of ToposText. This app is easy to use and would make a fantastic educational tool for university students or travelers interested in learning more about Greek and Roman history. However, the app is text-heavy and ancient scholarly writing can be difficult to read, even in translation. As a result, ToposText may only be of interest to those with some background in ancient history, archeology, or literature. The addition of more visual content and explanatory text would do a lot to make this resource more accessible. </p>
