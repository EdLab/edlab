<a href="http://www.brainnook.com/index.php">BrainNook</a> is a new platform and virtual learning environment, providing a multitude of games to encourage and grow children's English and Math skills.  Much like <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com/">Club Penguin</a>, Brain Nook seeks to provide a safe haven for children to play games, interact with each other in virtual worlds and (this is where they diverge from Club Penguin) to learn specific, trackable Math & English concepts.  From the BrainNook site: 

<i>BrainNook contains over a hundred educational games based on fundamental concepts in Math and English Grammar. The games cover Math concepts ranging from single-digit addition to 3D spatial visualization, and English concepts ranging from building simple sentences to counting syllables. These games are embedded within colorful virtual worlds that children can unlock and explore.</i>

<b>Pros:</b>
Accounts are easy to set-up and clearly explain what is involved in being a part of this online community.  It is fun to customize your characters (see screenshot below), much like Club Penguin, this ability to customize both your agent and environment seems like a key differentiator here.  Also, game dynamics, like badges & being able to "level-up" are clear & present here.  The idea of a "badge book" is fresh and fun, harking-back to the days of sticker albums and baseball card collection binders.   

<b>Cons:</b>
You have to continually add your "parent's" email address when you are first setting-up an account, but you could so easily just add another one of your own email addresses.  I inputted one of my many email addresses and am awaiting what I would imagine is a note letting parents know that there children are online engaging with other users in the game's virtual world. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we consider new games for learning and teaching, it seems that this concept of a more social gaming experience is still relevant and fresh.  Even though platforms like World of Warcraft, Club Penguin and more have been around for years, there is still room for refining and mining this concept for 21st century learners. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Again, as we have seen with any successful application, game or program, the simpler and cleaner the UI, with the lowest barrier-to-entry & adoption, the more successful and enjoyable to use.  The marriage of fun, bright graphics, measurable outcomes/skill acquisition and the opportunity to interact with other users in a virtual environment seems like a winning combination that we should explore further to build on our JumpMath project and other games we might develop in the near future.
