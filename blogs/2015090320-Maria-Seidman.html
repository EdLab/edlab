Maria Seidman is an award-winning entrepreneur to keep on your radar. Maria has much experience within the field of mobile technology, as she previously led the mobile and new business incubation groups at Warner Bros. Her most recent project is a <a href="http://bit.ly/1JAewrg">is a mobile platform called Yapp</a>, which enables individuals, groups, and organizations to create mobile applications for events, groups, and promotional purposes. Yapp has been featured on Good Morning America, CNN, BBC, Fox, and in publications such as the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, the New York Times, and Forbes. Seidman is Entrepreneur Magazine’s 2014 Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year. She received her BA in Economics and International Studies from Yale and holds an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
My liberal arts education helped me to think critically and creatively, both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. My MBA taught me some core business skills, but more than that, it helped shaped the way I interact with employees, customers, and stakeholders. My past professional experience was not a straight line to the company I founded. So if I were to advise a young person on the path to take in order to be an entrepreneur, I wouldn't say try out a lot of different industries and roles and then go do something unrelated. Yet, each of my jobs uniquely helped me prepare for what I'm doing now. In finance, I learned the basic fundamentals of accounting, valuations, and running a company profitably. In the entertainment business, I was fortunate to have been involved very early on with application development which is the core of what Yapp does. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
Many of our customers use Yapp to create apps for professional development, classrooms, and other settings where there is community and learning. I hope that through the use of mobile technology—which Yapp has made accessible to all—educators and students can better connect to each other and the material inside and outside of the training or class setting. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
Mobile proliferation and access. Giving people access to education whenever, wherever (i.e., on any device) will allow them to learn in greater depth and breadth. You no longer need access to a university or a physical class to learn. Obviously MOOCs are the first frontier of this, but even if I look at my 8-year-old I see the fundamental shift. When I was his age, I had to wait until they taught a unit on US history in my class to learn about the presidents. He already knows much about them because he's watched videos through a social studies app on his iPad, played trivia games on his phone, read Wikipedia online, and scoured the web for photos. Learning will be a lot more self-directed and formal education will have to be much more customized to meet students where they are. When we can get the world's knowledge at the tap of a finger, the role of formal education will shift dramatically; it will need to be more personalized and focus on human interaction.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> 
We are continuously improving and growing Yapp. Providing the world access to personalized, mobile app creation technology is no small feat. I will be working on that for many years to come.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<a href="http://bit.ly/1ey0QPY">Benedict Evans</a> is my go to for the most relevant insights and trends in mobile. <a href="http://bit.ly/1Ch39ll">Anil Dash</a> has interesting things to say on a wide variety of topics. And <a href="http://bit.ly/1G2QOvS">Entrepreneur Magazine</a> is my go to for advice and inspiration.</p>
