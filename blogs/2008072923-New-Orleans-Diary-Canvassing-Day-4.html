          <p>
            The last day of canvassing saw me and my partner Sally in the Third Ward. The first house we knocked on was occupied by a 50-something African American man who was too busy to talk as he was cooking dinner. He thanked us for our presence in the community and invited us to come back at a better time. We knocked on a few other doors where the inhabitants were also busy: one was on the phone and we woke up an elderly woman from her afternoon nap. As we turned left on the next street, we saw a 14-year dreadlocked African American male with a basketball in his hand. We took the opportunity to talk to him because he might offer some insight about life as a youth in the neighborhood. Clearly shy and soft spoken, he attended a high school on the other side of town because the only one in the neighborhood was crime-ridden and didn't offer many activities. He was particularly concerned about the high murder rate in his community. I realized during the course of the conversation that he kept looking at the street every-time a car passed. It became apparent that he was scared someone might be targeting him since he was talking to two outsiders who could be anything from volunteers to investigators. <p>

As we walked down one of the few bustling streets in the neighborhood, we decided to enter a hair salon. All five occupants were African American: three 20-somethings, an elderly and a 35-year-old who did most of the talking. She initially refused to talk about Katrina because she didn't want to cry or become angry. Slowly, she gave in to our persistent questions. She offered some of the most heartfelt and deep insights about life after Katrina that I encountered throughout the four days of canvassing. A mother to four children ranging in ages 8-16, she lived on the other side of town but came to the salon because she has been a lifelong customer. During the course of the conversation, the rest of the people in the salon occasionally butt in with their views. They all seemed to have lost hope with the neighborhood as crime was at an all time high and there were a lack of police to patrol the neighborhoods. She told us about the heartbreaking story of her best friend's son who was brutally gunned down in a nightclub a few weeks ago because he stepped on someone's shoes. To her and the rest of the people in the salon, this was their world, their reality, their New Orleans. <p>

Our last encounter was with a married 50-something couple in front of their porch. They didn't talk much about Katrina and rather started questioning us. Their curiosity about our whereabouts during 9/11 coupled with an interest in global affairs meant that we spent the better half of an hour discussing those topics. When we did retreat back to Katrina, the wife (the more outspoken of the two) revealed she had evacuated prior to the storm while her husband stayed. He had to swim in water up to his chest to safety and they lost everything in their house. With that, canvassing came to a close and I left with me a lifetime of stories and conversations I hope to share with anyone willing to listen.
