<p><a href="http://www.chemheritage.org/ChemCrafter/">ChemCrafter</a> is a free app for performing virtual chemistry experiments. There are three virtual books that guide users through an exploration of chemistry: a book of water experiments, one of chemical experiments, and one of salt experiments. Beginning with the more basic experiments, users learn about how elements react with one another by mixing them together and observing the results. The app provides an array of elements that users can place into test tubes and pour into containers along with other substances to create reactions. Watch new chemicals being created without ever having to step into a physical lab.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app is appropriate for anyone who wants to conduct experiments without worrying about chemical burns or accidentally creating small explosions. ChemCrafter removes the danger from chemistry experiments while still allowing the user to have the experience of somewhat controlling the outcome. There are occasional videos and pop-up facts describing an element or chemical as it is created from experiments, which gives some extra background on how it is or was used in the real world. There is a formula to follow for each experiment, and an option to place a "sticky note" in the bottom corner of your screen as you mix the elements to remind you of the proportions. Each tube is labeled with the periodic symbol of the elements along with the name, which aids in memorizing these symbols. ChemCrafter also emphasizes the importance of understanding the anticipated energy given off once a reaction is complete by requiring various sized containers to complete the experiments. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>By far, the biggest issue with this app is the coin system. Before users are permitted to complete any experiments, they must "purchase" the supplies with the in-game currency. Not only does this seem completely unnecessary for the function of the application, it is also distracting and frustrating since it is rather easy to run out of currency yet difficult to earn it back. Players will often find themselves repeating the same experiments over and over just to gain enough coins to continue onward toward more complex experiments. Equipment also breaks frequently, requiring you to purchase new containers. There appears to be some glitch where the app does not recognize that the new containers you buy are actually new. It does not always allow you to perform your experiments within them, often claiming that you cannot proceed since the container is broken. This causes further backtracking to again repeat experiments to gain enough money to acquire even more containers. Finally, each time you select a new item to purchase, there is a waiting period before you can use it. This time ranges from 1-5 minutes, and seems to serve no logical purpose within the app. It further frustrates users, possibly even encouraging them to abandon their experiments. Even though it's possible to speed up the process, it requires another form of currency that runs out quickly and cannot be replenished. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Although it appears attractive at first glance, ChemCrafters actually causes more frustration than it is worth. The experiments are actually quite limited, and it would be a more instructional and engaging application if the user could mix together chemicals to create more interesting reactions than fizzing and sparking. The constant need to repeat experiments simply to gain currency devalues this application as a useful tool for chemistry education. It can be fun to feel as if you are conducting experiments without the threat of danger, but the constant aggravation caused by the coin system renders it near impossible to enjoy. Chemcrafters is completely free to use, and therefore wouldn’t hurt to check out. Sadly, it doesn’t even seem to be worth the effort - you and your students will be steaming with annoyance that will unfortunately outweigh the potential learning benefits of this app.</p>
