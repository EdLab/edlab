After a meeting with the Evangelist and “spiritual” father of Design Thinking, David Kelley, in March 2009 at Stanford, I was curious what the “financial” father and his colleagues in Potsdam would have to say about this innovative approach in written words. Do I hold the Bible for innovation for the 21th century in my unpurified hands?

Design Thinking

The book, <i>Design Thinking. Innovation lernen — Ideenwelten Ã¶ffnen</i>, by Hasso Plattner, Christoph Meinel and Ulrich Weinberg, was published in January 2009 and offers insights into developing innovations, the Design Thinking process and viewpoints on future issues. It consists of 222 pages and is published in German.

Its table of contents is as follows: 


Preface
1. The history and founding of the HPI School of Design Thinking
2. The world needs more innovations
3. Future developments
4. Examples of Design Thinking projects

<p>On the first couple of pages, the founding of the HPI School of Design Thinking is described and Hasso Plattner mentions how he actually came to meet David Kelley, founder of IDEO, and with him, Design Thinking. The d.school at Stanford was originally founded by Hasso Plattner (financially) and David Kelley (ideologically), and soon after, HPI at Potsdam was created as the sister institute. The authors write that Design Thinking is based on using healthy common sense. Design thinking is lateral thinking. Both d.schools and their programs are characterized by the collaboration of students, professors and business people from different fields and businesses. Plattner uses the metaphor of Mark Twain: Mark Twain was painting a fence. It's usually an awful thing, but Mark was expressing a happy face during the painting process and so it happened that a lot of people started to paint the fence and Mark was watching them. Design thinking is a kind of participation in painting a fence. But we aren't watching you; we also want to participate to work on the ideas of tomorrow.</p>

<p>
In the <b>first chapter</b>, the authors argue why we need more innovations in the world. Germany's “Germany - land of ideas” initiative, is used to frame the problem that they have not capitalized and transformed enough innovations compared to other countries. Indeed, continued effort is needed to change that state-of-the-art. Different statistics are presented to underline the argument that nationwide change must take place in Germany in order to produce innovative results. For example, networking is underestimated, R&D is lacking, company-wide innovation-culture has to change, the society lacks innovative capability, entrepreneurship is missing, women are not participating in the innovation processes, German behavior is ambivalent towards new things, and there is a general lack of commitment. The list ends with a statement about the need to reshape the future by educating the innovators of tomorrow. The book presents pessimistic and negative descriptions about Germans, describing them as unopen to change during times of crisis and unwilling to embrace the inherent opportunity of challenging situations.
</p>

<p>
One question remains: How and with which method can we awaken an innovative mindset in people? One approach, suggested by the authors to solve this “innovation problem” is the Design Thinking method. They define Design Thinking as inventive thinking and clarify the different meaning of design in German and English. Design Thinking is described as a learning process which enables people of different disciplines to generate new knowledge, then based on that knowledge, create better solutions. Different phases in the Design Thinking process are defined and combined iteratively. These iterations grow and scaffold knowledge. The Design Thinking method consists of analytical phases, where information is gathered, ordered and analyzed, as well as synthetic phases, in which solutions are generated, tested and improved. This process leads from real world activity into a knowledge sphere with abstract theories and ideas, which are then translated back to solutions in practice. The authors mention that Design Thinking needs new skills and collaboration between disciplines. But these new skills, such as creativity, are not part of the education system and are especially missing in American and European schools. A culture of innovation within an organization requires skills or talent that are associated with Design Thinking: team-work, empathy, mindset for innovation, ability to change, and mental mobility. The profile of a design thinker consist of the following: empathetic, integrative thinker, experimental mind, team-player and optimistic. On the following pages of the book, the Design Thinking student program in Potsdam is introduced and some examples of projects exemplified.
</p>

<p><b>Chapter two</b> starts with insights about the Design Thinking process and his core elements, such as multidisciplinary teams and open space, which are both explained in detail. The concept of a “variable space” is seen as a synonym for an innovation culture, which incorporates the idea of working as someone likes to work in a specific situation.  In total, the Design Thinking Process is divided into six harmonized phases or processes, which lead to a fully functional, high-quality solution. In the literature, the Design Thinking process sometimes consists of only three (Observing, Brainstorming and Prototyping) or even seven phases, which all tend to be elaborating descriptions and emphasis.
</p>
The six phases of the Design-Thinking Process are:
 
1.	Understand
2.	Observe
3.	Define point of view
4.	Ideate
5.	Prototype
6.      Test

<i>Figure 1: Iterative Design Thinking Process. (Page 114)</i>

The phases were developed based on broad practical experience. The phase “point of view” serves as a hinge between all other linked phases. After running through these phases, technical, social or economic questions are addressed. On the next ten pages of the book, the single steps are described in more detail.  After that, comprehensive rules and principles are introduced. These include iteration, revisiting prior phases, visualizing, adopting brainstorming rules, and imposing time constraints. In particular, learning from failure (fail early and often) is mentioned as an important factor.  

<p>
Future developments are the main foci of <b>chapter three</b>. Different possible areas for applying Design Thinking are discussed. According to the authors, one important point is focusing on customers. Under the claim that imitation is desirable, executive education is described shortly before some research questions and projects are introduced in the Design Thinking Research Program. It is claimed that there is an immense need for research in the area of Design Thinking to generate verifiable theories. But the currently existing “action-model,” namely Design Thinking, works. Prerequisites now need to be considered to inform how the sequences are designed.
</p> 

<p><b>Chapter four</b> shows nine examples of Design Thinking projects, each described shortly and mentioning the students, teachers and project partners. 1. Personal supply chain, 2. TV-series authoring, 3. Transforming social awareness into action, 4. Social finding strategies, 5. Sustainable event for sustainable action, 6, Autonomy for mentally handicapped, 7. Alternative usage models for fairgrounds, 8. Sustainable energy usage. 9. People trusting people.</p>


<b>What can you expect?</b>
The book is an easy read for anybody interested in an innovative approach to generating innovations. Containing an immense number of pictures and quotes, it gives you a feeling and excitement for what Design Thinking is, or at least what it should be. It's definitely not the Bible, which should be translated to various languages, but it definitely is a very good start to spread the religion about Design Thinking and a clear statement on where future innovation, research and education should point. One remark remains: Why in German? The book itself admits that the language of communication is English on Page 70, because thinking in other terms is trained and a globalized communication learned. Conscious thinking is based on language and another language makes thinking more sensitive. <p>

In my opinion, the phases outlined by this action approach are innovative but not new. The novel and remarkable thing is to actually implement this approach for all kinds of challenges and problems. Personally, I think there is a lot potential for research in every single stage of this process. The promising aspect for me, which I have experienced in Design Thinking Challenges at Stanford, is to use and test this approach in education to attempt to change and innovate the way teachers and educators “design” think. Everything can be a Design Thinking challenge and should be, even building new Design Thinking Education!  Use the method and spread the gospel!
