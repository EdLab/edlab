            When the announcement was made a few days ago that George Lucas was selling Lucasfilm and the rights to his famous Star Wars franchise to Disney, along with the news that Disney will be producing Star Wars VII through IX, people's reactions were very mixed. Some were outraged, claiming that Lucas was "selling out" and that nothing good will come of Star Wars being in Disney's hands. Others were very enthused, saying that Disney's vast resources can help breathe new life into the franchise, and that Star Wars VII-IX will hopefully become what we all had hoped I-III would be. Several of my friends had very strong opinions about the announcement (both very positive and very negative).

I've never been a big Star Wars fan myself (Star Trek all the way!) so when the initial news broke, it didn't elicit much of a reaction from me. However, I became much more interested in the story when a friend retweeted <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/02/george-lucas-donate-4-billion_n_2067145.html" target="_blank">a HuffPo article</a> that follows up the announcement with the news that George Lucas plans to donate all $4 billion that he received in cash and Disney shares for the sale to education. It had previously been rumored that Lucas planned to donate a majority of the profits to charity, but it had not been made clear that he is in fact donating <i>all</i> profits, and that they will all be going to an educational foundation. Lucas' own foundation, Edutopia, is speculated to be the most likely recipient.

I think this is really exciting news for the field -- $4 billion should be enough to empower some real change. Also, I feel like we often discuss how much we could all gain if the 1% would contribute more to improving the lives of the 99% in areas like education instead of hoarding their wealth, and I think it's great to see George Lucas join the ranks of people like Bill and Melinda Gates who are doing just that.

What are your thoughts? How do you think the $4 billion could be put to best use?
