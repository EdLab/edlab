            Through our group meetings, we found it difficult to narrow our focus to only one problem in education.  But with much thought and teamwork, we found many of our issues to spawn from one particular problem: the over-institutionalization of schools.
The industrial revolution and the methods and practices it spawned were responsible for increasing the quality of life and the wealth per capita in the countries that now enjoy most of the benefits of modern day technology and standards of living. The processes that underlie the education system within these countries (and that have spread to developing, pre-industrial, countries) seem to bear a striking resemblance to a factory assembly line. Students are pushed through, in-depth knowledge and understanding are checked only superficially by tests, certification and one-size-fits all mentality ensures that sheep...*ahem* children are shaped to be nothing more than....excuse the metaphor, a brick in the wall. Hey teacher! Leave those kids alone!

This system manufactures students without teaching life skills and by neglecting to foster a development of personal interest.  One way this can be addressed is by enhancing the academic and career advisement that occurs in schools.  Also, by connecting students to their own community, they may develop a greater sense of the possibilities of career choices.  The community can serve as a means of support through times of learning and serve contribute to a students' realization of his/her own personal identity.  Unfortunately, standardized testing in a large obstacle that inhibits the development of personal interest and creativity in schools.  The abolishment of these forms of testing is a lofty goal.  However, awareness of this issue can be raised through smaller actions that empower students to change this system themselves.  
 
Some solutions we discussed are: 

1) School on a bus
2) Tools to help students cheat more effectively on tests
3) Lunch Box/Cell phone booster in one
4) Longer school day/span
5) Romance education 
6) Schools for gangs
