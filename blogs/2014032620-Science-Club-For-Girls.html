<i>Since its founding in 1994, Science Club for Girls (SCFG) has strived to provide the very best in girls-specific programming, by connecting girls in K-12 grades, especially those from underrepresented groups, with female mentor-scientists through free science and engineering programs in a fun, nurturing, interactive environment.</i> (From the Science Club for Girls site<a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/"></a>)


<p><b>Science Mentors for Girls</b><br>
Unique in its mentorship focus, Boston-based <a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/">Science Club for Girls (SCFG)</a> has since 1994, paired K-12 girls with working scientists to form strong mentor/mentee relationships.  Along with mentorship, the nonprofit provides out-of-school opportunities for girls to discover the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">STEM</a> fields and imagine themselves pursuing careers in these quickly growing industries.   SCFG Programming includes hands-on science club opportunities for primary grade girls (K-5), meant to help them discover the ubiquitous nature of science.  Later, older girls are provided with the chance to both act as role models to their younger peers and to discover potential future STEM careers.  This teen element  is a part of a comprehensive <a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/teen-programs-overview">CELLS (Career Exploration, Leadership & Life Skills) program</a>. Finally, all SCFG programming is offered at program sites in Massachusetts (in <a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/program-sites">Ghana too!</a>) and through "field trip" partner sites and <a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/campus-chapters">university chapters</a> that include Harvard and Brandeis.    

<p><b>Helping Stem the "Blue Washing" Tide</b><br>
As a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/science/mystery-of-the-missing-women-in-science.html?_r=0">recent New York Times article points-out</a>, "Even as girls prove their prowess in science and math, their ambivalence lingers when it comes to fields formerly painted boy blue."  These fields, though open to women, are not experiencing a leveling of the proverbial playing field and equal representation of women.  In the same New York Times article SCFG executive director <a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/staff">Connie Chow</a> notes that 29 percent of male college students elect to pursue STEM subjects, while their female counterparts only chose these subjects 15 percent of the time.  The article goes on to explain that success in STEM subjects is often not enough to encourage young women to pursue these fields; intent and motivation also need to be increased.   This is where programs like SCFG come in.  Offering a "trifecta" of mentorship, opportunity and hands-on experience, the program has already accrued <a href="http://scienceclubforgirls.org/impact">positive results</a> from the nearly one thousand participants who move through it each year.  While not revolutionary, SCFG is a part of an important grassroots movement to help prevent more young women and girls from missing the science boat.
