            Financial Literacy is an important part of life where by an individual can learn to handle money, be responsible and also stay away from financial crisises and debts. The economic problem going on have resulted in many individuals being in debt and losing control of how they should and can spend. People work hard for their money so they are obligated to spend it as they want, but in reality this attitide could result in people being in many financial problems. Young students, especially college students, are targets to many profitable organizations such as banks because they are quick to spend without thinking. Many also cannot control their debts because its an investment toward college. Understanding fiscal responsibility is an investment towards a better and comfortable life; it is important in figuring out and solving any financial situations.

Many teens and college students lack fiscal responsibility, which leads toward bad decision making that results in having a bad credit score or in bankruptcy. It is important for young adults to understand the use of money, how to save, to invest and plan for retirements and having enough money in case of an emergency. If a large population of young adults today lack financial responsibilities, it could result in an economic meltdown for the entire country.
