          <p>
            This is my first time to attend the <a href=" http://www.aera.net/">AERA Annual Meeting</a>. Before arriving at the conference, I wonder how a conference of 16,000 attendees (for 2007 annual meeting) might look in New York City, how it might impact the local areas, and how participants feel about the conference. 

2008. Mar. 24. 
02:00 PM
I arrive at Sheraton, one of the Co-headquarters of 2008 AERA. I check the 500-page 2008 AERA program again to make sure the session,<a href="http://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aera/aera08/index.php?click_key=1&cmd=Multi+Search+Search+Load+Session&session_id=46503&PHPSESSID=fe74d125174c5507d815f787e13dbc2e "> Handbook of Research in Social Studies Education</a>, is held in Sheraton Hotel and Tower, not Sheraton Manhattan Hotel that is located just across the street. I don't really know how 2008 AERA impacts the local areas, but I am sure many people think it confusing to find the correct meeting room. One presenter, after staying in this room for about five minutes, realizes she is in the wrong meeting room, and rush to the correct one immediately.

<!--break-->

Looking closely at the program, I start to wonder how ten papers can be presented within a 90-minute session. The tables in this meeting room remind me that it might be structured in a roundtable format. That makes much more sense to me. About 10 people are in this room right now.

02:20 PM
Almost all seats are taken, and there are about 80 people in this session. The number of the audience and the capacity of this meeting room fit perfectly.

The chairs of this session, <a href="http://www.uky.edu/Education/EDC/vita/LLevstikvita.pdf"> Linda Levstik </a> and <a href="http://ehe.osu.edu/edtl/faculty/TysonCynthia.htm"> Cynthia Tyson</a> welcome everyone, and briefly explain the background of this recently published book, <a href=" http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Research-Social-Studies-Education/dp/080585536X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206473303&sr=8-1"> Handbook of Research in Social Studies Education </a>. This handbook “outlines the current state of research in social studies education, on-going conflict over the content of the curriculum and encourages new research needed to move the field forward to foster the youth civic competence.”

02:35 PM
Professor Levstik briefly introduces <a href="http://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aera/aera08/index.php?click_key=1&cmd=Multi+Search+Search+Load+Session&session_id=46503&PHPSESSID=fe74d125174c5507d815f787e13dbc2e">ten presenters</a> and explains the plan for this session: each presenter will have twenty minutes to talk about his/her paper with a group of audience for each round; the audience will have three opportunities to interact with different presenters during the next hour of this session.


02: 40 PM
I join <a href=" http://vic.kennesaw.edu/sacs/PAGE_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/PAGE_EDD_FACULTY_VITAES/Zong_Guichun.pdf"> Guichun Zong's</a> table (two co-authors of this paper, Anegne Wilson and A. Yao Quashigah, are not present) to discuss the topic of teaching social studies from a global perspective. Professor Zong explains the main focus of this chapter is a review of theory in global education. Professor Zong points out that everyone in social studies education is talking about global education, but it lacks a clear definition, which triggers them to do a review on this topic. They trace the historical development and changes of global education in the U.S., and compare the core elements of global education among U.S., Canada, and U.K.

03:00 PM  
I move to <a href="http://education.washington.edu/areas/ci/profiles/parker.html"> Walter Parker's</a> table to discuss his topic, knowing and doing in democratic citizenship education. Before he starts the session, he has everyone briefly introduce himself/herself, which creates a great and welcoming climate that can only be done in this roundtable format of presentation. 

Professor Parker is mainly interested in how two emphases in democratic education, knowing and doing, are illustrated and represented in two types of classroom discussion, seminar and deliberation. The purpose of seminar is to “reach an enlarged understanding of a powerful text”, while the deliberation is to “reach a decision on what we should do about a shared problem”. The typical opening question for seminar is “what does this mean”; in contrast, the typical question for the deliberation is “what should we do”. Professor Parker argues that knowing and doing are two interdependent aspects in democratic citizenship education. The time constrain does not allow much discussion after his presentation.


03:20 PM  
I move to <a href="http://www.cech.uc.edu/faculty_staff.php?p=biographies_list&cn=BartonKC"> Keith Barton's</a> table to discuss his paper, research on students' ideas about history. The main task of his paper is to review all studies (about two hundred studies in the past 25 years) regarding to students understanding about history. In doing so, he hopes to contribute to more academic conversations based on what have been done in this field. 

He points out two directions for future research. First, most studies using pre/post survey to measure the change of student understanding in history. This approach only presents a static picture of students' changing historical understanding. Researchers need to further explore which part of daily classroom activities gradually leads to the change of student's historical understanding. Second, studies show students of diverse background have different understanding of history. However, researchers need further investigate how students with these different historical understanding interact with each other, and how these interactions change their understanding accordingly.

Professor Barton gives an effective presentation, which leaves him more time to discuss the paper with audience. Many topics such as helping students to deal with the partial historical evidence in the classroom, and elementary students' understanding of history are discussed after the presentation.


03:40 PM 
Professor Levistik and Tyson, hope that these presented papers will encourage educators and researchers to rethink and redefine social studies.


03: 50 PM
End of this session.
