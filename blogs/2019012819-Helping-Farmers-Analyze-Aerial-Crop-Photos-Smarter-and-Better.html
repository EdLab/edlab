<p>Because farmers manage such a large expanse of land, it can be hard to track and identify afflictions facing their crops until itâ€™s too late. While drone footage has been able to remedy some of these problems, in remote areas files take a very long time to upload to computers and often aren't of high enough quality to be useful.  </p>

<p>ViSUS, a small business sponsored by the National Science Foundation, aims to solve this problem by creating a better, faster program which can allow farmers to investigate changes in their crops in minute detail or from the perspective of an entire field. Their program gives farmers the ability to learn about trends across their fields in a more manageable and timely way.</p>

<p>What other barriers to technology adoption do farmers face? What learning opportunities could this technology provide to audiences outside of farming communities? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47511">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:10 Sara Hardman: </b>I wonder what kind of education is available for farmers to learn how to use this technology, as well as other new farming technologies. Is there some kind of distance education class geared toward training farmers on how to operate drones, for instance, or analyze drone footage?</p>

<p><b>@02:48 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>This product emphasizes that the current challenge many fields face is not how to access data, but rather how to sort and present data in a relevant way. In other words, it's not just the information that's important, it's how professionals can use that information to make good decisions. This has implications in the learning sphere. A seemingly infinite amount of information is at students' fingertips thanks to technology. Access to information is not enough for education, however; students need to learn how to use that information well.</p>
