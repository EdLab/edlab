An app store for schools 
Why because "web tools don't work in school."  
-Decided to solve 3 problems for schools & apps 
1) Discovery
2) Payment - credit cards aren't accepted 
3) Experience - students often can't access these "app stores" 

Created an app store to showcase apps 
-curated for ed
-Easy to discover relevant content 
-Categories

Built the platform to host the transactions 
-One login to remember 
-Organized by default
-Grading/calendar/messaging
-Private 

How do they compare to Google Apps for Education?  Google is more broad & general - they are selling their tools as being specific to high school. 

"Front End for School."

<b><a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos.com</a></b>

Originally called TutorTrove.com - to help tutors work better online.  
Similar to Polyvision for touchscreen software in the classroom... asynchronous as well as in-class.  

Collaborated with McGraw Hill. 

Wants to put Texas Instruments out of business, Check <a href="www. Desmos.com/calculator/">this</a> out.                          

Building Self-grading problems 

Working with all 4 big publishers to create interactive content 

Both working with people who are both creating and marketing content.

How do we treat the book like a living & breathing object with multimedia instead of a dead "box?"

<b>4 Key bets:</b>
1) Had to provide great textbooks
2) Transfer control to teachers through open licensing & platform - (creative commons licensing for faculty to adapt freely for classes through MIYO) 
3) Students don't want to read "one way" anymore
4) Want to deliver on the above at 20-30% cost savings with multimedia content

MIYO - Make it Your Own Platform for content creation/adaption 

Very interesting to see the CC licensing symbol so freely used throughout MIYO. 

Choice of how students want to consume media seems so crucial... I wonder if students are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/nyregion/20textbooks.html?pagewanted=all">fully ready for all these choices?</a> 

135 authors, 3,000 adoptions 

30 Million in venture capital 

Promotion 
1) Most promotion has been peer-to-peer! 
2) Email 
3) Search 

<b>Oh my gosh!  Steve Jobs Died!  So incredibly sad... what a visionary, legend of the technology world and beyond... what didn't he have an impact on?</b>

<b>Knewton.com</b>
Great review of Knewton from the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6315">EdLab blog</a>

From their site: 
<i>Use the Common Core standards, or your state standards, as a template to easily set long term goals and milestones for you students. Monitor how your class is mastering the standards or progressing toward their goals. Using Schoolbinder Goals you can help students see their educational expectations as small achievable milestones. Reflection and Metacognition are the pathways to learning.</i>

CCMTL@Columbia.edu did a plug at the end!
