">Voxy</a> is a language learning tool steered by user interest and location to create language lessons that stick. The system consists of a web interface with targeted learning activities and a mobile app for on-the-go lessons and reminders. The system is meant to "follow" the user and create an immersion-like experience that incentivizes learning with interesting content. Voxy works hard to make it fun; users translate popular songs, learn vocabulary based on location, and read real news stories curated by their own interests. In its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrhppUX5PpE
">early stages</a>, the site was aimed at English-learners in the United States, but usage has exploded abroad. In an August 2012 presentation founder Paul Gollash stated that Voxy currently lists 1.6 million users and most subscribers are from Brazil and Mexico.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
Voxy is highly customizable and the language tools included in the plan are varied and powerful. In addition to the location and interest-based content, users can set the frequency and dates of text message reminders they receive to maximize practice potential, and they can customize learning priorities so they address trouble areas like reading and vocabulary. These options make the system appropriate for language learners of all levels and a variety of backgrounds. Unusual among developer-heavy edtech, Voxy has a robust curriculum and pedagogy department to ensure that their appealing product is not all fun and games. The service runs $9.99 per month or $80 annually and offers package deals to schools and institutions.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
While the advertised one-on-one Skype tutoring seems tempting, the upsell in the interface is a bit distracting. The Spanish language for English speakers program is still in beta, but its launch creates the possibility for conversation matching between native and aspiring language learners. Sites like <a href="http://duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a> have capitalized on the work of the Cloud and Voxy could easily create value by offering something like discounted tuition on an additional language when users act as a tutor for their native language. Overall, Voxy is very exciting. They seem to be striving to improve upon their current site and include awesome content, which potentially positions them well to draw the critical mass that will establish Voxy as a destination for language learning on the web.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
This hybrid mobile/web learning system is an entirely new idea for language learning. The idea that language acquisition happens a little each day and best when we’re figuring out something we want in real life is well tested. Mobile technology has given us a revolutionary way to provide this experience for learners and mimic an immersion experience without leaving home. Voxy’s huge and growing user base seems like a great place to test the effectiveness of this strategy and hopefully we’ll see new ideas and methods grow from this technology.</p>

<p><b>Bottom Line:</b><br>
Voxy is patently fun and potentially revolutionary.</p>
