            The Arab Regional Agenda for Improving Education Quality (ARAIEQ) is a program designed to improve the quality of Middle East and North Africa schools. The purpose of this program is to improve the education systems of these regions. Just like many undeveloped countries, Arab countries know the importance of a quality education system on their future. Thus, at the ARAIEQ meeting, was held in Tunis, leaders discussed and proposed probable solutions for improving education in the region. 

This <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/araieq-working-together-improve-education-quality-mena-region?hootPostID=33cc1cd062f853998c96fbc3c00fe6e7" target = "blank">source</a> from the World Bank presents some of the discussed topics at the ARAIEQ meeting. One of the major talking points is creating measurably better systems. In essence, governments should make data on the quality education systems public. This is objective of ARAIEQ's evaluation program. Another idea is schools buildings and ICT. Technology today has become an important part of education. Many developed countries have are using technology to teach students as it inspires students to learn and be creative.

The other major talking point is investing in teachers. Teachers have the greatest impact on learning. As a result, if teachers don't have the qualities to teach or can't teach, the outcome is often reflected on students' performance. Another great idea that emerged from the meeting is early childhood investment. It called on Arab countries to invest in children's education at a very young age. Consequently, this will build the foundations of readiness for schooling. Lastly, different programs such as the Arab League's Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (ALESCO), must join forces with other programs to establish an ultimate goal to better help the education systems in the Middle East and North Africa. This I believe will strengthen schools in these regions to reach their goals. Additionally, students will learn better and also achieve their aspirations.
