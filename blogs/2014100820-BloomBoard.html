<p><a href="http://www.bloomboard.com/#3"> BloomBoard</a> is an online professional development tool for teachers and administrators in the education field. This tool is designed to provide personalized feedback and access to top resources for educators looking to grow and better their careers. BloomBoard is completely customizable, giving educators the ability to tailor their viewable resources to those most relevant to their field. BloomBoard can also incorporate student data for even better feedback and learning recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This tool gives teachers an organized and simple way to evaluate their own performance while providing the tools necessary for continued professional development. With BloomBoard, educators can easily keep track of their learning goals and participate in career-oriented conversations that will encourage and support them throughout their journey. Additionally, teachers can also keep a record of their certification and proficiency requirements for later reference. Administrators can use BloomBoard to track and manage educator observations and provide feedback in an efficient and effective way. Administrators can quickly view teacher performance analytics and identify problems and ways to improve overall team growth. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The learning curve for this platform is time consuming. In order to use this program, teachers and administrators need to be trained on BloomBoard’s interface through webinars and staff consultations. A representative from BloomBoard conducts a preliminary interview prior to introducing the platform to determine the needs, goals, and requirements for its potential users. After the interview, BloomBoard staff can have the program up and running for educators in about two weeks. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>BloomBoard is a great tool for educators and administrators alike. Teachers have a place to organize and analyze their professional feedback and gather resources for their development as educators. With BloomBoard, administrators have a succinct way to view team strengths and weaknesses, provide feedback in an orderly manner, and assess educators as a group.</p>

<p><p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>BloomBoard is the teacher’s way to get an A.</p>
