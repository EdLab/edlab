            As the summer months quickly approach, a record high 3 out of 4 teens will be unable to secure a summer job. These findings are the result of research conducted by Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies in which researchers observed employment trends from the past four decades. Such findings are a sharp contrast from the 54% teen unemployment rate experienced in the year 2000. Several factors are to be blamed for this spike in teen unemployment rate. 

Federal funding to programs that provide summer jobs have generally been cut thus eliminating many potential summer jobs available for teens.  Also with adult unemployment also at its peak due to the still slow economy, many adults are taking jobs that were previously occupied by teens. In fact, many employers prefer to hire older, much experienced workers since there are easier to manage as compared to teens. Several experts have noted the potential consequences that this statistic pose.

Economists predict a less experienced workforce in the near future as well as lower lifetime earnings. Urban studies experts also predict an increase in street violence among minority teens in inner cities such as Chicago, Washington D.C, and Los Angeles. These teens, given their lengthy summer vacations, are left with no occupations which in turn increases their likelihood of participating in violent behavior.

Currently, the teen unemployment rate in New York City should be at a moderate level due to its Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP). The program places hundreds of students with summer jobs which keeps them occupied for the duration of their summer vacation. With this example mind, some are asking the government to recognize the direct correlation between violence and teen unemployment by resuming funding to programs that help create more summer jobs for teens.
