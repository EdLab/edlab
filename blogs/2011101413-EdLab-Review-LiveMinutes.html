<a href ="http://liveminutes.com/oneclick/">LiveMinutes</a> is a free site designed specifically for web conferences. With LiveMinutes you can share documents live during a web conference, and its main feauture is that it will document your web conference for you. Any document that is shared or created during the conference will be saved in a set of slides that you or anybody else can view at any time.

<b>Pros:</b> One great pro is that it is completely free though there is a great chance they will probably charge corporate users in the near future. The website is also very simple to sign up for and use and once you are in a web conference, you have several cool features like using a collaborative whiteboard (my favorite), uploading documents, looking at a map, and very soon they will add a feature that allows you to share videos. You do currently have the option of having a web conference with your friends from Sykpe. The design of the site is very pleasing to the eye and you can open a new whiteboard, document, etc, from the home icon in the middle of the screen. The best part of LiveMinutes, besides the site being free, is that any documents or feature you use during the conference will be added to a slideshow that anybody can view after the conference.

<b>Cons:</b> While this website has some nice and unique features, there is no direction on where each feature is and how to use them. It took me a while to discover how to effectively use each feature. It would help if there was a little three minute tutorial on the basics of the site. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This site has some features that educators can use, with the interactive whiteboard automatically springing to mind. We seem to be seeing this feature in many sites like Qannection for example. It seems like  more and more whiteboards is the new trend.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>This website is one of many that are pushing the envelope when it comes to online collaboration. The one unique feature here is that this site records you web conference and packages the notes made during the conference into a nice looking slide show. I hope they take this a step further, while keeping their site free of course.
