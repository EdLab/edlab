          <p>
            Education, as we all know, is a vital to the success of any society. As a result, many parents around the globe are paying ample amount of money to ensure their children are receiving a quality education. However, this is not the case in some countries. In rebel held areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, students are facing a lot of challenges in obtaining an education. A <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/13/world/asia/pakistan-boy-stops-bomber-school/index.html">14 year-old boy recently met his demise</a> when he tackled a suicide bomber who was ready to blow up his school. Similarly in 2012, Malala Yousafzai, a teenage Pakistani girl was shot in the head at point blank by the Taliban because she expressed her desire about the rights of girls to have an education.

There is no doubt that while these Pakistani children are fighting to receive an education, there are also people who are oppose to the idea of education, especially for girls. In the case of the aforementioned young boy, it is obvious the suicide bomber is a member of Taliban, who are opposed to children receiving an education in Pakistan. The sad part about this is the students' willingness to learn in the face of obvious danger. I really admire the students' enthusiasm to learn and hope that the government will find a solution to help them succeed in their educational endeavors.
