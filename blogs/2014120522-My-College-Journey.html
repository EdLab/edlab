          <p>
            After a long wait, my college experience has finally started. At first I was scared, because I was entering a different world. I've been preparing since my senior year in high school but I didn't know if I was ready. Once I stepped foot on campus, I knew I had to keep up with the workload, in the classroom and on the soccer field.
 
Since I was attending college on a soccer scholarship, I reported earlier than most incoming freshman for preseason. Unfortunately an ankle injury I picked up in the summer resigned me to doing a lot of individual work with the trainer and had to wait several months before I played my first competitive game. This made it a bit difficult to build friendships and camaraderie with my new teammates. Things changed once all students reported to campus. For the semester, I am taking mainly electives such as math and writing since I have not yet declared a major.
 
I've been really enjoying my writing class because I've never been a good writer. The professor is really awesome and make sure I am constantly improving. The end of soccer season afforded me more time to meet new people and enjoy college life a bit. I am quite looking forward to the spring semester.
