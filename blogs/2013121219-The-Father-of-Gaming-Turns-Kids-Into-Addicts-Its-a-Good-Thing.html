Nolan Bushnell is a successful entrepreneur. His claims to fame include founding Atari, Inc. and Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theatre. Because of the success of his exploits in the video game industry, Bushnell is admirably referred to as the "Father of Gaming" (when you invent Pong, people pay their respects).  His latest venture brings him back into the gaming industry. Drawing from his experience in the field, along with research in cognition and neuroscience, Bushnell has high hopes that his edtech software company, <a href="http://www.brainrush.com/">Brainrush</a>, will fundamentally change how people learn.<p>

He applauds video games for being able to keep students in a constant flow state. They give players just enough so that they remain challenged and interested. This is the concept he wants to deliver to education and he plans to ride it in on a vehicle he knows all too well. His aim is to bring the addictiveness of video games to learning. As he says, "I’ve made a lot of money on that concept." His confidence in his plan is evident. <p>

When’s the last time a game or app sucked you into a flow state? Has an educational game ever had such a captivating effect on you? Could it? Let us know in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11856">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:00 Clark:</b> But there are definitely poorly designed games that can't get kids anywhere near that flow state. I would venture to say that these games are being used in classrooms across the country as I type<p>

<b>@01:31 Rita:</b> I think it depends on how often these games are being used by kids. Wouldn't it eventually get the point of over-saturation, where the games don't bring as much excitement as they once did?
