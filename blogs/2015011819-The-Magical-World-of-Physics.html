You can learn more at Disney parks than what your favorite character smells like in real life! This video teases at the wealth of science knowledge young students can glean from ride mechanics while on guided learning tours of the most magical of places. <p>

Disney’s <a href="http://www.disneyyouth.com/our-programs/education/sp/youth-education-series/program/yes-energy-and-waves-physics-lab-101-dlr/#categories-youth-education-series">Youth Education Series</a> (YES) programs take pride in providing unique, hands-on learning experiences for students in elementary, middle, and high school. With a campus like the Magic Kingdom to roam, there certainly are no shortages of those. For example, kids are encouraged to climb aboard thrill rides to learn about positive g-force and lateral g-force. Meanwhile, students also gain appreciation for speed, velocity, and acceleration as they loop-de-loop on hair-whipping roller coasters. It’s a vivid way to see science in a new, fun light. Speaking of light, students can also learn how Imagineers manipulate properties of light and sound in designing attractions. <p>

You don’t have to be a Mouseketeer to get excited about Disney’s offerings. You don’t even have to be a kid! Following through with your natural curiosity about how things work is the next best thing to being at the happiest place on earth. Sure, you might be one Space Mountain short of a Pluto sighting, but if there’s anything that Disney has taught us, it’s that a whole new world [of science] is just beyond the riverbend. <p> 

How do you find science in the everyday? Do you wish they had guided science tours for adults? (Don’t lie.) Let us know in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16345">on Vialogues.</a>   <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:40 MartinPaper:</b> I wonder if any students who have taken these courses have gone and become park imagineers. If anything, you'd think it'd be a good foot in the door.<p>

<b>@00:52 JordaJean:</b> Do you think it's more effective if students have learned about the topics covered at YES before going through the program or is it better that they study it in class after?
