<p> <a href="https://www.appolearning.com">Appolearning</a> is home to a large library of educational apps for anyone to browse. The site has a very active community of teachers, parents, and "app gurus" that curate and organize the learning apps that are available in iTunes and Google Play (e.g. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1044">DragonBox</a>, <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1244">Hopscotch</a>, <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1248">Bobo Explores Light</a>). Not only does Appolearningâ€™s community carefully curate and organize each learning app, but they also give them a rating. Their <a href="https://www.appolearning.com/report_card">evaluation rubric</a> is based on educational content, kid appeal, assessment, features and design, value, and safety and privacy.</p>

<p>The apps are organized by traditional school level, subject, and platform (e.g. iPad, Android). When users select a subject they are directed to a list of apps that fall under that category. Below this list is a brief description of each app along with a personal endorsement from the expert that selected it. An interesting aspect of the platform is that any teacher can request to be an expert and create their own list of recommended apps. Appolearning is available on the web and for the iPad.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The digital library of edtech resources could be very valuable to teachers and parents. The site emphasizes sharing resources in an online community of educators. A newsletter email is also available for teachers who want to keep abreast of the latest edtech apps. Apps are ranked on a 100-point scale that is useful for a quick quality overview. Users always have the option to look through the details of the ratings report for more specific ranking information.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Each subject category contains only five apps selected by experts, which may be disappointing for users interested in browsing many apps at once. Additional apps in each category are provided by the Appolearning community.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Appolearning takes on the challenge of making sense out of the thousands of edtech apps that are available for teachers and parents to use. It tackles this problem by letting teachers, parents and edtech gurus sort out the apps for end users. Users of the platform can trust that the apps selected will be valuable learning resources because they come recommended by people who are in the education field.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Appolearning is an edtech library built by the education community.</p>
