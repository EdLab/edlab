            I was interested to find that <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com">Union Square Ventures</a>, the most well-known tech-VC firm in NYC, is interested in investing in game changing services/technologies in education (in addition to the environment).  This was discussed in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/technology/22venture.html">a Times article today</a>.  Albert Werner on USV's blog writes:

<blockquote>
We believe that the same shift will become increasingly important in other areas of life that have longer standing and slower changing institutions. Take education, for example. For hundreds of years education has essentially been organized around schools and universities. To date, this has even been largely true in distance/online education (e.g., University of Phoenix). It may be difficult for us to conceive of alternatives because we are so used to the existing structures, but these are in no small part based on historical difficulties in disseminating information. Books at one point were super expensive and even the Sorbonne (the oldest still operating university) had only a few hundred in their library. With book digitization proceeding at a rapid pace and most new research publications available electronically, having a library will soon no longer be a reason to have a university. Lectures could historically only be heard at the time and place of the lecture. Now we can watch a video recording of a lecture over the web. A tutor had to be in the same place to look at the work of a student and provide feedback. All of this is of course slightly overstating the restrictions on the flow of information, as there were correspondence based courses even in the age of snail mail, but they accounted for a vanishing fraction of education. In recent years, however, we have seen a significant upswing in home schooling. While other social factors are at work, a key enabler for homeschooling has been the web. With access to course materials, ability to watch lectures and even tutor at a distance, we believe that we are only at the beginning of the web's impact on the fundamental structure of education. We expect much of that change to be away from the existing educational institutions and towards empowering individuals and newly-formed groups.
</blockquote>

Werner accurately describes the cognitive difficulty of imagining education that isn't orchestrated by schools and universities.  Despite this difficulty, USV continues to be interested in investment opportunities which look to do the work of education without the use of existing institutions.  I am wondering what kind of services they have in mind that could be profitable in the short-term but not be cognitively insurmountable for the already-indoctrinated?  Some kind of service for home schoolers?  My biggest concern for them is underestimating the force of institutionalism: with consumer tech, you have a large and growing body of early adopters.  With education, sure, you could have a huge number of early adopters (the children themselves), but good luck on selling the parents.  I wonder if the early adopters of new technology (the iPhone/Twitter-totting crowd) are as willing to be the early adopters of "new" services for their children?  Early adopters tend to be more affluent and educated, but is this same group as willing to early adopt with their children?  It will be interesting to see what they eventually do invest in, or if they have to change course and focus on other things.
