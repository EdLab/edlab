<a href="http://educationnext.org/do-schools-begin-too-early/">Edwards, Finley. (2012). Do Schools Begin Too Early. 12 EducationNext 3.</a>

Every high school student knows the pain of unnaturally early schooldays, but it's hard to get much traction for reform by arguing that you're tired.  Finley Edwards, an economist at Colby College, adapts his job market paper to offer a more serious quantitative evaluation of the damages of early start times.
<!--break-->
Summary:

Edwards argument is simple: “an increase in the amount of sleep needed and a change in the natural timing of the sleep cycle. Hormonal changes, in particular, the secretion of melatonin, shift the natural circadian rhythm of adolescents, making it increasingly difficult for them to fall asleep early in the evening. Lack of sleep, in turn, can interfere with learning.”

Since most school districts use staggered start times for its schools so as to get by with fewer buses, it's fairly easy to get data on how students fare under different schedules.  The specific data for Edwards' paper is drawn from Wake County, in North Carolina, in which school start times range from 7:30 to 9:15 (as compared to the national median start time of 8:00).  

The first level of analysis is a simplistic comparison (with appropriate controls) of student achievement across the different start times.  From there, Edwards moves on to comparing achievement levels of individual schools as they switch from one start time to another, and of individual students as they switch from schools with one start time to another.  

From this he finds a statistically significant increase in student test scores as a result of later start times, an effect that grows as students enter into adolescence.  The effects are not large (only a few percentile points), but it does seem to persist as students age, and work more strongly on the “lower end of the distribution of test scores.”  There aren't many policy interventions that look even that promising.

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b>

The problems with standardized schooling extend beyond what happens in the classroom.  Large scale coordination of student learning in the industrial age required or at least encouraged the early start times we still inflict upon our adolescent learners, but the rise of online, asynchronous learning should easily take care of this, along with so many other issues arising from the industrial age classroom.
