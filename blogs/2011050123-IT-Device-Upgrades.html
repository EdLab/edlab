          <p>
            USB 3.0: 

USB 3.0 has a date rate of 5Gbps data rate (compared with Hi-Speed USB 2.0's 480Mbps). A 25 GB HD movie will take just 70 seconds to trasfer while with USB 2.0, it'll take 13.9 min. More power will be able to go to the device (which will hopefully eliminate some of the power issues we see today with portable hard drives that require extra power from a second USB port). Plus, when a device's battery is drained, it will now still be recognized by a laptop, for example, so you can charge it (this doesn't work with USB 2.0).

iPad 2:

iPad 2 is 33 percent thinner than its predecessor and just a smidge lighter. (The iPad 2 weighs 1.3 pounds and the first iPad weighed a-not-exactly-chunky 1.5 pounds.) Meanwhile, the iPad 2 gets a pair of cameras — one rear-facing and one front-facing and a gyroscope, just like the iPhone 4, which should improve gaming capability. Operating speed is up, too, thanks to a Dual-core 1GHz A5 processor. 

Motorola ATRIX 4G vs Apple iPhone 4:

ATRIX 4G has a plastic construction while iPhone 4 has a metal one — which makes iPhone 4 look and feel like the more premium device. iPhone 4 is noticeably heavier than ATRIX 4G while the latter is more susceptible to scratching. The Motorola ATRIX 4G boasts a larger screen with a 4” qHD display and packs a mighty resolution of 540 x 960 pixels. Albeit, it still doesn't come close to offering the higher pixel density count found with the 3.5” IPS display of the iPhone 4 with its resolution of 640 x 960 pixels. Color production is a little bit more natural looking with the iPhone 4 since darker colors, such as black, have a smoky appearance with the ATRIX 4G. Moreover, colors better retain their vibrancy at various angles on the iphone 4's Retina Display. Both are found extremely responsive to the touch. As opposed to the proprietary 30-pin connection port with the iPhone 4, The ATRIX 4G has the microUSB and microHDMI ports — which are used in conjunction with the handset's innovative sharing qualities.
