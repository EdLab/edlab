<p>Spelling books and flashcards can be a drag in the digital age, so how do you bring the magic back to something as boring as basic literacy? <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letris-4-best-word-puzzle-game/id478540241?mt=8">Letris 4</a> is a spelling game that is a clear descendant from one of the legendary games from yesteryear: the Russian-made, tile-matching video game Tetris. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>If Letris 4 looks like Tetris, sounds like Tetris, and plays like Tetris, then it’s Tetris (just including words and additional types of game play to make it more fully-featured to fit in today’s competitive video game industry). The app tasks players with building words from individual letters on each tile. Letters stream down from the top, and you tap them sequentially to form whole words. Once you create a word, it disappears. And if you don’t, the bottom fills until your screen is completely covered with tiles. </p>

<p>Besides its basic literacy function, Letris 4 is brighter and shinier than its humble predecessor. Letris 4 takes the functionality of Tetris and spices it up, taking full-advantage of the social media age. For example, the app includes features like multiplayer mode and weekly tournaments to build a community. It also provides support for multiple languages, which makes it a fun resource for learners looking to improve their spelling in different tongues. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Due to the need for speed in creating words, Letris 4 may rapidly exhaust the patience of those who want to move past the rudiments of spelling. Making longer words takes additional time and may make players lose more quickly. Given the speed of the game, as you advance, you are rewarded for creating many small words rather than fewer long words. Also, based on the native word bank in this app, atypical and longer words may not register, further contributing to your loss. </p>
 
<p>The interface is better than average but not spectacular, and the interactivity is serviceable. Overall, the aesthetics and gameplay are good but less flashy than those found in most apps. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>This game is fun and would help beginning English language learners and those with low levels of literacy. But those with more advanced literacy aspirations may need to find a slower-paced alternative with different types of blocks to build their language skills. Also, given the pace of the game, if you aren’t confident in basic spelling, this game may be too chaotic.</p>
