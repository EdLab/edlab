            Soccer, the most played sport in the world often has an issue that comes up now and then. One of the biggest issues that the sport faces today is officiating. The officiating issue recently came to the forefront when two of Europe's biggest teams, Spain's FC Barcelona and England's Chelsea, met in the <a href="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/index.html">UEFA Champions League</a> semifinals. The UEFA Champions League is an annual competition where Europe's best soccer teams compete over nine months to crown a winner. A few questionable calls by the officials dimmed what turned out to be a classic game and the outcry from players and fans alike has been profound.  
 
<a href="http://www.fifa.com/">FIFA</a>, the world governing body of soccer, refuses to offer the use of instant replay and states that the game should be decided by the officials only. If instant replay was allowed, it would make the games much easier for officiating. The camera would see things that the referee missed but FIFA committee argues that the game should go on without being interrupted. Instant replay will make it much easier for the referee to decide the right call.  

In the aforementioned game, Chelsea winning by a goal but there is an away goal rule that states that if the game came to a tie, and the away team scores, the goal would count as two goals. The referee missed a few penalties which caused Chelsea to be eliminated out of the tournament. A visibly irate Chelsea coach Guss Hiddink claimed that “if those calls were made correctly,” his team would have continue on to the final where they would have a repeat of their epic final against Manchester United last year. Instant replay has proved useful in American sports and so should FIFA allow instant replay in soccer?
