<p>Why are the STEM professions dominated by men? Solving the gender gap in STEM has been a growing issue in recent years. In an exploration of these gender differences, two researchers analyzed data from almost a half a million students from across the world, and their results are somewhat paradoxical to conventional wisdom. The findings show that societies that were the most gender equitable displayed larger STEM gaps. </p>

<p>For the analysis, the researchers used a dataset from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâ€™s (OECD) large-scale international assessment, PISA, which included almost 500,000 students from 67 nations or economic areas. PISA evaluates students on science, math, and reading, and records demographic and psychometric information from the test-takers. The students in the representative sample were aged 15 to 16 years old.</p>

<p>In analyzing gender differences on the test, the researchers found general parity in science literacy, as girls outperformed boys in 19 nations, boys outperformed girls in 22, and there were no gender differences in 26 countries. However, when the scores were broken down by top-performing subject, the scholars found that boys overwhelming had science as their best-scoring subject while girls conversely had reading as theirs. Even if girls performed better than boys in science, the former group still tended to have reading as their top subject. The authors found that these disparities were stronger in societies that were more gender equitable.</p>

<p>Students were also asked to self-assess their own abilities and interests in various subjects. Boys generally rated themselves to be higher achievers in science, while female counterparts reported lower self-assessment in this area. Likewise, boys displayed higher degrees of interest in STEM subjects compared to girls. These results were especially acute in nations that were more gender equal, such as Finland. Self-efficacy in science was only relatively correlated with science scores, meaning boys potentially overestimate their abilities while girls underestimate theirs. </p> 

<p>The authors contend that these results can help explain why girls with academic capabilities are not pursuing STEM careers, especially in societies that were more equitable to gender roles. They claim that girls in these societies are choosing their best subjects, which are often those related to reading, even as they are quite intellectually capable in STEM. Furthermore, they also believe that another factor for the gap is that medical and health professions that are dominated by women are not included in STEM measures. More research will have to be undertaken to understand these surprising findings, emphasizing factors beyond the classroom.</p>
