            Urbanization used to be a term associated with social mobility and economic opportunities, but this trend has declined in recent times. In this article <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/">Urban Plight: Vanishing Upward Mobility</a>, Joel Kotkin notes that cities have become “a place where people could create their own futures and lift up their families”. Cities previous served as unique centers for social uplift but evidence suggests uplift in cities is no longer the case. He cites large urban areas such as New York, London and Tokyo as places that previously had property owning middle class families. This helped the ascension of some members of the middle class into the ranks of the bourgeoisie. But now patterns in economic and social mobility are changing., 

According to a Brookings Institution study, New York and Los Angeles have a small percentage of middle class neighborhoods. In 1980, Manhattan was ranked 17th in social inequalities but by 2007 it was ranked first. The top fifth percent of Manhattan residents earned 52 times than those in the lowest fifth. Survey by Crain's Chicago Business shows a similar trend occurred in Chicago. Businesses there have collapsed and even prior to the most recent recession, there were fewer jobs than in 1989 and opportunities for middle class families were lower.
