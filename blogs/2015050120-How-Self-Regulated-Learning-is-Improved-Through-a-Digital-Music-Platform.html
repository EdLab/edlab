Being a good musician doesn't just happen. In addition to logging countless practice hours to achieve musical excellence, a good music student needs to develop self-regulated learning skills. The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto knows that the most successful students are motivated, determined, independent, and reflective. </p>

<p>That's why they've built an online digital music learning platform for students to strengthen these skills. Through the iScore platform students are guided through the steps of <i>planning, doing, and reflecting</i>, "a process for thinking about what a person wants to achieve and how they want to get there." </p> 

<p>Providing a digital space for students to record, watch, and reflect on their performances should encourage them to be more deliberate and thoughtful in their practice time. It's also easy to imagine that once developed, these skills might translate well to other subject areas. </p>

<p>Can you imagine music students actively using this platform? How else could it benefit music instruction? Add your thoughts and join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/22119/">on Vialogues</a>.<p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i><p>

<p><b>@00:43 Brian.Sweeting:</b> This is an excellent articulation of the skills that are needed for a music studentâ€”I think these are reasons that music students often excel in other academic areas. </p>

<p><b>LauraCostello:</b> That's a great point, Brian! I also think that these skills are essential for online learners as well. Some interesting studies that have come out recently seem to indicate that those who perform best in MOOCS already have many of these independent learning skills. </p>

<p><b>@01:24 Brian.Sweeting: </b> Just as it's important for a music instructor to provide targeted feedback after a performance, I think it's equally important for students to reflect on their own performance and self-evaluate pitch, rhythm, temp, and dynamics. I could never stop going sharp on some high notes on the saxophone until I listened to recordings of myself and heard the intonation problems. </p>

<p><b> @chingfu: </b> I like this social communication feature on this platform. So students can share their works and give each other feedback on their performances. </p>
