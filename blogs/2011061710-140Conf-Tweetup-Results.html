          <p>
            Last night, I went to a Syracuse 140 Conference tweetup. I had an interesting conversation with one of the presenters at the conference, Professor Anthony Rotolo, and got some really interesting insights and ideas about some of EdLab's projects. The key points from the conversation:

1. If LaunchPad 39B wants to distinguish itself it needs to really showcase the resources that TC could offer, like access to the library's resources and teachers and classrooms, because their are already reputable incubators in NYC and TC has direct ties to resources that would be particularly helpful for edupreneurs.

2. We should think about making a platform for online classes that is friendly to teachers who want to be able to interact with all of their students and don't want the focus to be on self-direction. Prof. Rotolo said that many professors are interested in being "free agents" because they know that students want to take their class online, but they currently have to offer their classes online through their universities which is not only expensive for the student, but also makes the class less interactive because the universities tend to have dry platforms. He said that he would love to offer a class where he could VoIP conference call all of his students for class and show them video or powerpoint at the same time, but there currently isn't a platform that will allow him to do so without great expense, which means that he would have to transfer the cost to the students. 

3. He also expressed concern that much of the edtech developments now are happening for tools that will be useful in terms of connecting educators with students outside of the classroom, but that there wasn't enough being done to change how things happen in the classroom, or translating the classroom online.

Prof. Rotolo was really interested in the work that EdLab is doing and said that he would be interested in speaking at a seminar. 

Also, I ended up speaking with a woman from 2tor (which is affiliated with Noodle- one of the startups from Walkabout NYC) who was VERY interested in the work that EdLab is doing and said that she would love to try to get 2tor and EdLab to collaborate on projects. She also expressed interest in trying to have an edtech meetup to build more relationships.
