<i>Automating Reserves</i> 

<b><a href="http://www.atlas-sys.com/products/ares/">www.atlas-sys.com/products/ares</a></b>

Provided by <a href="http://www.atlas-sys.com/">Atlas Systems, Inc.</a>, <b>Ares 2.5</b> is a complete reserves management solution for both electronic and hard copy reserves. Ares features extensive copyright management functionality with connectivity to the Copyright Clearance Center (CCC) rights management database, plus the ability to accept a wide variety of file formats and optional integration with a variety of e-Learning environments such as Moodle and Blackboard.

<b>Price:</b> The base fee consists of (a) the annual Ares Software License Fee plus (b) the Initial Implementation Fee.* 

<li>The Software License Fee is an annual subscription fee based on the full time enrollment (FTEs) of the institution; it includes all updates and new releases during the license period. This fee also includes unlimited telephone and email support. For example, based on FTEs at Teachers College, this fee would amount to $6,000/year. </li>
<li>The Initial Implementation Fee of $2,000 includes remote installation of Ares software on the local server, four hours of remote web-based training, and four hours of remote web-based help sessions to answer questions and help configure the system. </li>
*Optional services such as on-site assistance and server hosting may be purchased for an additional charge.

<b>How it works:</b> The Ares system is currently not available for public demonstration on the company website. However, the next scheduled demonstration is Wednesday, June 9, 2010 at 10:00 am (EST). To register for this demonstration, please click <a href="https://atlas-sys.webex.com/ec0605lb/eventcenter/enroll/join.do?siteurl=atlas-sys&confId=510655786 ">here</a>. The demonstration is free of charge to all participants, however pre-registration is required.

<b>Prop points:</b> There are many useful features included in the Ares software system. Usage tracking allows library staff and course instructors to see which reserve materials are being used most. Reserve staff has the option of capturing anonymous statistics or detailed usage data that will show which user accessed a particular item. The Ares web pages are customizable and use a template-based system allowing libraries to markup the standard HTML web pages based on workflow needs or university branding. In addition, the OpenURL feature allows teaching faculty to submit requests for electronic reserve materials via the library's local catalog. Also, Ares has a built-in Z39.50 interface to make searching for library owned material easier. Reserve desk staff can search the catalog, import shelving location and call number information and then print pull slips to retrieve materials.

With respect to customer service, Ares users have access to the Atlas Community Portal which allows the exchange of innovative ideas about Atlas products and services, as well as case studies which provide guidance about Ares system installation, implementation, and patron feedback.

<b>Drop points:</b> There are some drawbacks to using the Ares software system. If you require on-site assistance to help configure the system for your library site, including editing web pages, print templates, email templates, setting policies, etc., Atlas charges an extra fee. In addition, if you choose not to install Ares on your local server, Atlas' hosted server services (which include 50GB of drive space for E-Reserve materials) costs an additional  $5,000/year. If your Ares installation is hosted by Atlas, additional storage space may be added at any time during the contract period at a prorated amount of $100/month ($1,200/year).

Aside from additional costs, there are other potential downsides to using Ares. Library staff can only scan material directly into Ares using a TWAIN-compliant scanner. Also, Atlas Systems has partnered with the Copyright Clearance Center, meaning that the library can secure copyright permissions for their electronic reserves materials <u>after</u> purchasing a new annual subscription service or by using the standard rights management gateway.

<b>Final score:</b> Ares is a complete reserves management solution for both electronic and hard copy reserves. It has many key features such as those discussed above, plus built-in security measures such as system authentication and access control. Also, it can provide alerts to students when new materials have been added for a specific course via email or RSS feeds. Annual fees and additional costs are the major detractors from this system. Current users of the Ares system include: Cornell, Northwestern, University of Chicago, Rice, Babson, and University of Southern California.

<b>Recommended uses:</b> E-reserve and hard copy management solution for higher ed libraries.
