<p><a href="https://myhomeworkapp.com/">myHomework</a> is a course planner platform that spans across multiple devices, allowing students to keep track of class schedules, assignment due dates, and announcements. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The selling point for myHomework is its ability to streamline across phones, tablets, and computers. It’s fairly seamless to hop back and forth between these devices. I was impressed with the clean design on both the desktop and mobile versions. Compared to potential competitors, such as Blackboard, this is certainly an upgrade.</p>    

<p>myHomework also has a teaching companion called Teachers.io. This second app allows teachers to upload their syllabi, assign homework, and make class announcements that can be synced to the student planner. If a teacher is using this software, it will likely simplify the class integration process for the student.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>This planning app comes with a free version or a paid upgrade at $4.99. The free version has advertisements, which are not too bothersome. However, I am concerned about the data collected by this app. When I signed up, I immediately got a message from Google saying myHomework could "View and manage the files in your Google Drive." The app needs this access so students can turn in assignments via their drive directly to their teachers.</p>

<p>The biggest issue with myHomework is that it only optimally works when teachers are also using Teachers.io. If instructors are not utilizing this companion app, the student planner does not offer much incentive to use. Teachers are already overwhelmed with a multitude of other platforms integrated directly with their schools. I think they will be hesitant to add another service just so their students can use myHomework.</p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with myHomework, but there is also nothing too exciting or innovative about it. The design is sleek and seamless across devices. If teachers utilize Teachers.io, it’s a good idea to use myHomework.<p>

<p>If a teacher is not using this service, however, students should probably also skip it. I can actually see this app adding confusion for a student already inundated with other education apps. Simply using Google Calendar would be a better alternative in most cases.</p>
