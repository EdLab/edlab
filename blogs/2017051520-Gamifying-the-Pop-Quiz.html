<p><a href="https://www.quizizz.com/">Quizizz</a> is free a multiplayer classroom quiz tool that allows students to practice answering content questions together. Teachers can find quizzes made by other educators or create their own to put their students to the test.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Quizizz gamifies pop quizzes by making them a competition between class members. Students create accounts and login using a quiz id to complete assigned quizzes in the classroom or at home. They can create avatars and track their results on a class-wide leaderboard. Quizziz has a teacher dashboard where teachers can see detailed student-level reports on class responses. The ability to have students work individually or in groups is an advantage of Quizizz over other similar platforms such as <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3376/quizalize">Quizalize</a>.</p>
 
<p>For teachers in schools that already extensively integrate technology into instruction, this platform could be a good way to get a snapshot of student understanding. The ability to search, edit, and assign quizzes that other educators have previously created could save teachers time especially when testing students on core concepts.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Quizziz adds fun game elements to make the traditional pop quiz more enticing to students, the game mechanics may not be engaging enough to get kids excited about pop quizzes. Pop quizzes as a formative assessment tap a narrow slice of students’ understanding, so while the data from these tests provides information to teachers, that information reveals only one facet of students’ understanding. Moreover, the public contests among students might well set in motion a status hierarchy that could lead to lower motivation for students who find themselves consistently at the bottom. Also, Quizziz relies only on multiple choice questions so it doesn’t provide many additional features beyond classroom clickers, aside from images. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Quizzizz’s integration of more fun gaming elements finds a middle ground between being student-focused and useful for teachers. However, the features of Quizizz aren’t extensive enough to make it a must-use for classrooms. If students spend most of their days using technology, this pop quiz app could easily fit with the classroom workflow, but it may not add enough value to student learning to be worth tracking down the school’s laptop cart.</p>
