<p>The prevalence of technology-based curriculum reform means it is no surprise that media-centered classrooms have emerged in the field of music education. As a music teacher at Edinbrook Elementary School in Minnesota for over seven years, Ms. Friant knows her way around an interactive music curriculum. She has been implementing technology into her music lessons. She has witnessed firsthand the immense impact it has had on her students’ participation and engagement.</p>
 
<p>She has succeeded in her goal to amplify the classroom—from how she plays her music to how the students are able to physically answer questions regarding the music they are hearing. With the help of applications like <a href="http://www.vicfirth.com/education/keyboard/speednotereading.html">Speed Note</a>, Ms. Friant has been able to promote music in an alternative way to increase every student’s music literacy. She plans to continue using technology to bridge and enhance the music education experience with her students, one note at a time.</p>
 
<p>With the implementation of technology into a music education curriculum, what are the potential benefits and limitations regarding student engagement in the classroom? Tell us about your experiences with music education in the ongoing discussion <a href= "https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23231">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>
 
<p><b>@01:05 jennyshen:</b> Are there ways in which teachers can still emphasize the value of print books so that students don't entirely lose interest and excitement for them?</p>
 
<p><b>@01:08 sarahvandenberg:</b> I like how technology also presents opportunities for movement in the classroom and kinetic learning in her class. Too often, I imagine sitting at a screen!</p>
 
<p><b>@01:52 PG.Williamson:</b> I wonder how much these students are actually internalizing fluidity and the meaning within the notes, as opposed to just memorizing the location of them.</p>
