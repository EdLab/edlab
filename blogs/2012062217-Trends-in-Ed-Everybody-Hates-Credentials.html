          <p>
            This week, the provocative literary magazine n+1 jumped on board the anti-credential train with a stirring editorial titled <a href="http://nplusonemag.com/death-by-degrees">“Death by Degrees”</a>.  Beginning with the Taiping Rebellion (launched, they claim, by a poor peasant whom 19th century China's ostensibly meritocratic system had unjustly rejected), n+1 argues that our current credentialist system, meaning everything from college to medical to law degrees, has grown rigid and exploitative, resulting in entrenched inequality and greater class stratification.  In the process, they have lost their primary purpose as a “system for imparting knowledge”.
<!--break-->
I take this editorial as a sign that we may be heading towards a new anti-credential consensus.  For instance, it's interesting to see n+1, which is a fairly left-wing publication, echo arguments Milton Friedman made 50 years ago in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism_and_Freedom">Capitalism and Freedom</a> against the American Medical Association's guild-like restrictions against would-be doctors

As they put it: "Not all the demons identified by the Tea Party have been phantoms. We on our side are right to reject rule by the 1 percent – and so are they right to reject rule by a credentialed elite. Introductory economics courses paint “rent-seekers” as gruesome creatures who amass monopoly privileges; credential-seekers, who sterilize the intellect by pouring time and money into the accumulation of permits, belong in the same circle of hell."

They end by a call for those at the top of the “educational pyramid” to take the first step towards rejecting the system, which fits with their overall pseudo-revolutionary aesthetic but does not, unfortunately, represent a realistic proposal.  Our best hope is to build alternative institutions linking young high school graduates with desirable careers.
