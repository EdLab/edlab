Many businesses and schools are looking to advance the future of education through technology, and <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/home.html">HP</a> is no different. Attempting to develop the "classroom of the future," HPâ€™s newest creation is the <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/ad/vantagepoint/form.html">VantagePoint touchwall</a>, a six-panel touchscreen device that focuses on enhancing collaboration within the classroom.  Not only can teachers use the wall for presentations, students can use it to work on projects together.  Another way to incorporate student interaction with the touchwall is to connect individual touchscreen computers for impromptu testing scenarios. In this video, viewers are shown an example of how the VantagePoint touchwall can be used in the classroom to find the tallest building in the world.  While the teacher shows the building on the touchwall, students are asked to quickly find the exact height of the building using their individual computers. <p>

HP is using touchscreen technology to foster interactive learning within the classroom. However, is it a step toward becoming the "classroom of the future?" The VantagePoint touchwall, as attractive as it is, is not a simple or low-cost device that can be incorporated in all classroom settings.  Do you think if HP were to help more schools install the touchwall at lower costs, it could become a new approach to using classroom technology? Or should they work on creating low-cost tools that can be used more widely around the world?  Watch the video and add your thoughts to the discussion<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9490"> on Vialogues.</a> <p>

<b>@01:22 dani100:</b> "It makes it an ideal scenario for collaboration with multiple people sharing the space." <p>

<b>@01:38 dani100:</b> White boards are great, but I think what makes the VantagePoint better is the fact that you are able to zoom in and out and add more than just pictures using tape.  They can put in videos and links, and look up information at any time while staying on the screen. <p>

<b>@05.15 gnatriello:</b> This is a very cool installation, but I wonder how expensive it is and whether it will be made widely available or only in schools with a great deal of resources? Should tech companies and schools be partnering on technologies that are expensive or should they be developing low cost approaches that can be used widely?
