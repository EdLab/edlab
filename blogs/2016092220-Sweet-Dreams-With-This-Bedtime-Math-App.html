<p> The concept of replacing bedtime stories with bedtime math sounds appealing to anyone promoting math and science education. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2015/10/students_with_math-anxious_parents_may_benefit_from_free_app.html"> Education Week</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/08/446490524/where-the-wild-fractions-are-the-power-of-a-bedtime-math-story">NPR</a>, and <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/mix-a-little-math-into-that-bedtime-story/">The Hechinger Report </a>all reported enthusiastically about the app <a href="http://bedtimemath.org">Bedtime Math</a> for doing just that. However, I found that though the concept is appealing, the app is still in need of development. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> Bedtime Math is a free app that encourages parents and children to practice math together. The app provides a problem scenario followed by clickable questions of varying difficulty with engaging animations that liven up the text. The interface is user friendly, making it easy to navigate without directions. In addition, <a href="http://7657-presscdn-0-39.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/PDFs/BTMResearch-201608.pdf">research</a> done by the University of Chicago shows that children who used the app improved their math skills. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> What I found disappointing was also one of the most important components of this app: the content. The situations and stories were both difficult to follow and poorly written. Each scenario was filled with dry facts that can be difficult for teachers or parents to pitch to their kids as <i>fun</i>. The images in the stories were occasionally of a poor quality, another hard sell for children accustomed to state-of-the-art graphics and three dimensional cartoons. I also found that having the math problems at the end of a scenario instead of within the story development was a bit off-putting. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Though the concept behind the app is appealing, parents could have a hard time convincing their kids that fact-based scenarios are more interesting than Peter Pan or The Cat in the Hat. That being said, it might be useful for putting both children and parents to sleep.</p>
