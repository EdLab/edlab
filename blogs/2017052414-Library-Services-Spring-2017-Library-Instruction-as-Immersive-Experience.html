<p style="text-align: left">In Spring 2014 I had the good fortune to attend a performance of Shakespeare's <em>Macbeth</em>, with Sir Kenneth Branagh in the title role,<em> </em>at the Park Avenue Armory in New York; the official trailer may give you some sense of what the production was about:</p>
[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYspTufVisM[/embed]

Another short video, in which Oz Woloshyn interviews Rebecca Robertson, President and Executive Producer of the Park Avenue Armory, for <em>Charlie Rose</em>, provides a bit of the history of the Armory, a time-lapse sequence of the "load-in" of the set, and a very nice description and depiction of the path (topographical and metaphorical) by which audience members travel to their seats, moving from the entrance to the 55,000 square feet drill hall to the purpose-built performance space at the far end of the space.

This production of <em>Macbeth</em> has been described as "immersive"; I found the entire production to be remarkable, and I thought there were some elements that made the experience indeed participatory--as Ms. Robertson puts it, "The thing that we try to do here is make audiences part of whatever's going on"--though probably not quite in the way that some more recent theater works (for example, <em>Sleep No More</em>, the site-specific immersive theatrical production based on aspects of <em>Macbeth</em>) actively situate audience members in the midst of the dramatic action and engage them, sometimes on an individual level, in the literal <em>milieu</em> of the play.  This short video conveys some sense of the ominous interior space, maybe particularly the aural space, of the production:

[embed]https://vimeo.com/71373502[/embed]

I have to say that the element of the Park Avenue Armory <em>Macbeth</em> performance I found most truly immersive was the journey from the hall entrance to the performance space, "a traverse stage flanked on two sides by steeply raked spectator stands" (<em>Hollywood Reporter</em> review, 6/5/2014, at <a href="http://bit.ly/2qdgk2g">http://bit.ly/2qdgk2g</a>), which takes one over a very darkened, very convincing flagstoned and muddy field, to one's seat.  This is not to suggest that the ensuing play performance was anything less than brilliantly compelling Shakespearean drama; but I found, as I had found with <em>Sleep No More</em>, the first few minutes of the experience to be the most mysterious and exciting.  As Rebecca Robertson says in the <em>Charlie Rose</em> video, "When you walk in and you see these stones and that light and that glow and that really creepy heath that has those witches rolling around in it . . . I think you're in a different world, and that's what we tried to do."

I probably have to admit that I'm very taken with the creepiness, and I do consider this quality to be entirely consistent with the uncanny nature of the play, from the weirdness of the Weird Sisters, to the ghastliness of the murders, to the ghostly visitations that madden and ultimately doom Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in the course of the drama.  I think though that, as much as any other aspect of the production, it was the initial passage over the barely-lit heath that had the greatest effect on me, and that in some ways carried over through the on-stage enactment of the play.

I'm not exactly sure how to make the connection between theatrical performances of the kind the Branagh <em>Macbeth</em> and the <em>Sleep No More</em> experience embody, and the potential use of the Smith Learning Theater (or aspects of it) for the purpose of library instruction (or research immersion or constructivist information literacy situated learning).  I'm also unclear on how possible it might be, in the event that such use of the SLT might be realized, to transition from a successfully mysterious and portentous progress from the theater entrance to the site of instruction (assuming this kind of atmosphere to be desirable scene-setting), to sustained engagement of participants in the teaching/learning experience.  I do think that there are some interesting, if possibly superficial, parallels between the Armory drill hall space and the Learning Theater space; what Sir Ken has to say addresses the character of the Armory building overall, but may have some bearing on how the library's fourth floor, as a locus in the building with some history (like the rest of the building) of its own, may be used to good advantage in a variety of possible ways:

[embed]https://youtu.be/34cOUq3V0zE[/embed]

I find it more than interesting to speculate on meshing the dramatic/interactive/immersive potential of the Learning Theater and the (I think) undeniable real-life excitement and adventure of the research journey, and though I feel it to be not a small stretch to bring this conjunction about, I think it would be among the most satisfying possible undertakings of the Gottesman era if this were to be explored in the proper spirit.  I hope it will happen, and I think it can happen; I'll be very interested to see what we (the library and the community) can together do.

During Spring 2017, Services librarians consulted with students and researchers who were seeking literature or resources on a broad range of topics and subject areas exemplifying the diversity of disciplines in which serious work is being done at the College.  Consultation themes, and information sought, included the following:

</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Senior librarians responded to a total number of 803 queries of various kinds--reference and information questions, research consultation requests, inquiries concerning library hours and operations, questions and problems pertaining to room reservations, circulation issues--that came to us via the library's email Support Request service.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Senior librarians and services associates provided 48 research consultations to individuals or small groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Librarians and associates presented 10 course-specific librarian information sessions, either in the classroom or in library spaces, for a total of 218 attendees.</li>
</ul>
Last summer I was interviewed by Ella Morton of <em>Atlas Obscura</em> for an article on "library anxiety" (see <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-strange-affliction-of-library-anxiety-and-what-librarians-do-to-help">http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-strange-affliction-of-library-anxiety-and-what-librarians-do-to-help</a>), and towards the end of the piece, remarking on the library's Services Team's group visit to and experience of <em>Sleep No More</em>, I said, “The idea was to try to get a sense of how space and sound and imagery could be used in our space . . . I think the thing that I liked most about it was the little bit of the scariness of it, the creepiness . . . Maybe it’s a good thing to kind of embrace the anxiety.”  I think I realize now that what I've been working towards is the idea of how a bridge between library instruction and the Learning Theater would work:  the notion of addressing students' uneasiness or outright fear about libraries and library research by inoculating them via a scary/fun passage into or through the Learning Theater, in advance of an immersive magical mystery tour (also scary/fun) of the library research landscape.
