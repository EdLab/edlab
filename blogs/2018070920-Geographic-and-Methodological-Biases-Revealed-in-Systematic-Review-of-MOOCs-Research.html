<p>The concept of the massive open online course (MOOC) has barely been around for a decade. Nonetheless, MOOCs have proliferated across the world with a promise to democratize education by <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/2915/anant-agarwal">opening learning acess</a> to anyone with an internet connection. Given the recent inundation of this technology, researchers have heavily studied the impact of MOOCs. Yet there have been few systematic analyses of these studies. In a meta-analysis of research on MOOCs, a team of researchers set out to understand what methods have been used in these studies, which actors and geographic locations have been the focus of inquiries, and where these researchers come from.</p>   

<p>The team scoured journal databases, Scopus, and other peer-reviewed journals for articles related to MOOCs published from 2014 to 2016. They only included empirical studies on the educational aspects of MOOCs, excluding literature reviews, conceptual papers, and software development-related articles. The completed sample included 146 empirical studies on this topic.</p>  

<p>In their analysis, the researchers found that research on MOOCs was concentrated in 12 journals, with approximately one-fifth of all research published in one journal. Quantitative methodologies dominated the sample of publications, with almost half relying on this approach. Mixed methods were used in over a third of the articles, while less than 20% of this research relied on qualitative design. Most of the quantitative studies relied upon surveys for simple descriptive analyses. Students were by far the most popular subject for these publications.</p>    

<p>The United States was the focal point for much of the MOOC research. Half of the publications had author affiliations from the US, while over a third of the studies focused on American research subjects, which was more than three times the number of other countries. Research from the United Kingdom was the next closest country in both of these categories. Only around one in five of the sampled studies had a global theme. Further, authors of MOOC studies tended to publish with people from their own nation.</p>  

<p>From the findings, it is clear the research on MOOCs has tended to be quantitative in nature, focused on students, and centered in the United States. The researchers suggest that more diverse research is needed to enrich the perspectives related to MOOC applicability and design challenges. They argue that cross-cultural comparison studies are especially important for future MOOC research.</p>
