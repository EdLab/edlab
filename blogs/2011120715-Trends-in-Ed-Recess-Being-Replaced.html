          <p>
            A recent article in the New York Times describes how P.S. 188 and other schools throughout New York City are allowing some students to do extra-curricular activities during their recess time. Some extra activities include chorus, computer programming, electrical circuits, creating comic books, and learning sign language, among others. Students are allowed to choose which activity they would like to do without needing parental consent. Excluding parental consent will allow students to choose which recess activity they would like to do on their own.  Students have the option of partaking in these extra-curricular activities instead of going to recess; so all students participating in the activities are fully interested in them.

What interests me most is how these schools are adding more value to recess time, by providing students who are interested, to use recess as a time to learn some extra skills. This is a great way to manage time in schools to teach students even during their free time. I hope this will become more of a trend in more schools nationwide. During these activities, students will be able to interact with other students that have similar interests, regardless of age. We should have more times during the school day where students get to work with other students with similar interests, instead of other students of the same age. 

Of course we need to discuss the issue of cost for implementing this type of program. To support these recess activities P.S. 188's Parent Teacher Association raised $12,500 to keep these voluntary clubs active. It would take a strong support from parents and teachers to donate their time to keep these extra curricular activities running. During my time in high school, I had the opportunity to skip recess after lunch and play chess with other students and my Math Research teacher, who would sacrifice his break to teach students the game of chess. If more teachers can pitch in like this and keep this trend growing throughout the city, than maybe this can lead to a changing recess, and more aspects of the school day, to include more efficient learning.
