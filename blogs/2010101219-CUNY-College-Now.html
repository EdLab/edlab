            For decades, the City University of New York (CUNY) has been an institution committed to serving the students of the New York metropolitan area and one program that illustrates such efforts is the College Now Program. College Now is designed to prepare students for college course work and earning college credits in the process. Most of the CUNY colleges are partnered with a public high school within their vicinity and with a lot of CUNY schools (the largest urban university in the United States) spread out across the city, the program is available in nearly every high school.

An astonishing aspect about this program is that it is offered for FREE with no strings attached. Unlike Advanced Placement courses, College Now don't require a pricey test to determine whether you've earned a college credit or not. This allows students to truly learn without worrying about whether they will have gained enough information to pass a high stakes test. All a participant has to do is to pass the course and they will receive the credit for successfully completing a college level class.  The requirements for admittance to the program are fair and not overly selective and as a result it tends to attract a broad range of serious, college-minded public high school students from all five boroughs.

The benefits of such a dual enrollment program is that students gain an edge during the college recruiting process and making them more desirable to colleges. It also allows schools that don't offer enough AP classes to give students an alternative route to a college equivalent course. My current school, Aviation High School in Queens, is designated as a career and technical high school and as such there is less emphasis on AP classes as compared to other schools. Programs such College Now makes this program critical to students looking to challenge themselves academically and gain an edge in the college process. I am currently taking a college algebra course sponsored by LaGuardia Community College this semester and will be hoping to take calculus next semester. I am also looking forward to taking an introduction to business course during my senior year to further explore my interest in business.

 Another benefit of College Now is that it allows students to explore a potential college major without shelling paying any fees. Since its inaugural year in 1983, this program had been widely successful and it seems like it's going remain like that for a long time.
