<p>Coachella, California, home to one of the largest music festivals in the country, is also one of the nation’s poorest school districts. With most students living below the poverty line, and some homeless, the district’s new superintendent, Darryl Adams, knew he had to give students greater access to educational resources for them to succeed in school. During a time when the internet and technology are essential components to high quality education, the resources these students needed included online access and portable devices.</p>

<p>In such a sprawling district, giving students Wi-Fi access outside school is no easy feat, so Adams decided to take the project to the road. The district equipped all of its school buses with solar-powered routers and gave each student an iPad. Not only could students access the internet during their trips home, but also in the evenings; some school buses were parked throughout the district overnight so that students could access them 24/7. With a portable device and access to Wi-Fi, students were better able to finish their assignments and feel prepared for school. The district called their project Wi-Fi on Wheels. </p>

<p>Since Adams became superintendent, the graduation rate in the Coachella district rose from 70% to 80%. Why do you think students with greater access to educational resources are more likely to graduate high school? Do you think students today need the internet and portable devices to succeed in school? Answer these questions and pose your own <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/29821/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:41 jennyshen:</b> It's sobering to see how something as heavily sponsored and funded as Coachella the music festival is juxtaposed next to Coachella the underfunded and poor school district. In these cases, it seems as though the social boundary lines are impermeable, and it makes me wonder whether there are opportunities to break down those boundaries. What if some of Coachella profits went to supporting public schools in the area?</p>

<p><b>@06:07 ABARRY:</b> Technology is playing a huge role on our educations system. These new innovations are motivating students to excel in class.</p>
