          <p>
            As part of EdLab's Development and Research's Learning and Teaching project, I have been working on a mini course about student and teacher rights. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/education/19suspend.html?src=me&ref=general">A recent article in the New York Times</a> noted an ongoing legal battle between the rights of students who face suspension or expulsion for infractions such as “profanity, defiant behavior, pushing matches and other acts that used to be handled with a visit to the principal's office or detention.” One of the major sections of my mini course specifically deals with the rights students may or may not possess when it comes to suspension and expulsion.

Here is a synopsis of the case highlighted in the Times:
<blockquote>
As school let out one day in January 2008, students from rival towns faced off. Two girls flailed away for several seconds and clusters of boys pummeled each other until teachers pulled them apart. The fistfights at Southside High School involved no weapons and no serious injuries, and in some ways seemed as old-fashioned as the country roads here in eastern North Carolina. But the punishment was strictly up-to-date: Sheriff's deputies handcuffed and briefly arrested a dozen students. The school suspended seven of them for a short period and six others from the melee, including the two girls, for the entire semester. As extra punishment, the girls were told they could not attend Beaufort County's alternative school for troubled students and were denied aid to study at home. 
</blockquote>

What are the rights of the students in this instance? According to the US Supreme Court case <i>Goss v. Lopez (1975)</i>, students facing temporary suspension have interests qualifying for protection of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and due process requires that the student be given oral or a written notice of the charges against him and, if he denied them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story. The Clause requires at least these rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion.  Furthermore, a notice or hearing should precede the removal of the student from school grounds. In those cases where a student's presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process may be immediately removed from school. In such cases, the necessary notice and rudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable.

In a federal district court two years after <i>Goss</i>, a federal district court ruled in <i>Gonzales v. McEuen</i> that during expulsions, there must be a notice that communicates to the recipient the nature of the proceedings. The notice given to the student must include a statement not only of the specific charge, but also the basic rights to be afforded to the student: to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, and to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. 

The Times article didn't mention whether the two girls in question were presented with a chance to hire counsel, and present evidence, among other provisions as outlined in <i>Goss</i> and <i>McEuen</i>, but judging from the subsequent lawsuit, it is safe to assume such rights were not afforded the students. It is interesting to see how the North Carolina Supreme Court will rule on the case as it could have major implications on the ongoing battle between schools' zero tolerance policies and students' constitutional right to a public education as outlined in the majority opinion in <i>Goss</i>.
