          <p>
            I was just reading about the situation unfolding at U of Virginia.  On June 10, President Teresa A. Sullivan, the school's first female President, resigned from her position after only 2 years on the job. Apparently, this came as a shock to the UVa community, where it seems she was generally well regarded.

E-mails between board members made public later in the week revealed that the Board of Visitors (Trustees) wanted to make a strong push in the direction of online education, with at least one prominent donor forwarding articles from the Wall Street Journal and New York Times concerning MOOC (Massively Online Open Courses) to BoV members. The articles address the potential for these MOOC's to bring down university costs, at the expense of faculty.

Predictably, these revelations set off a firestorm around campus, and now one of two board members who was instrumental in Sullivan's decision to resign has stepped down, and pressure remains on the other board member in the form of protests and demonstrations held at the UVa campus. The governor of Virginia, who was part of the committee who selected the board, also criticized their decision.

Today, the interim president has announced he will suspend talks with the current board amid rumors of reinstating President Sullivan. In a letter to the UVa community, he concludes, "Trust cannot be restored in our community until the President Sullivan's status is clarified and ultimately resolved."

So, what's your take? Is the board right in it's emphasis on outsourcing some classes to MIT/Stanford for free at the cost of retaining faculty members? Is this the new model and the UVa community is stuck in it's ways? Will we continue to see this battle being played out across other campuses? Or is there more benefit developing a stronger, internal program in the face of rising college tuitions?

Here are the articles:
