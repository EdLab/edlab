<p>From <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2017.00021/full">Alexa</a> to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3833/one-hospitals-newest-staff-member-is-a-robot">Pepper</a> to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4429/how-human-is-too-human-for-robots">Erica</a>, social robots are a big part of life and are only going to continue playing greater roles in our lives in the coming years. As they do so, it becomes increasingly important to understand which attributes make social bots more likeable and which make them positively creepy. Regarding the latter, there is a well-known effect called the <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4316/how-not-to-fall-in-the-uncanny-valley-in-digital-simulations">Uncanny Valley Effect</a> that robot designers want to avoid. Making robots likeable is way trickier than making them creepy, as it stands. Yet new research points to a clue that might make spending time with social robots something of a joy.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="http://online.brescia.edu/psychology-news/pratfall-effect/">Pratfall Effect</a> is a psychological phenomenon that states that people who make mistakes are generally viewed as more attractive than people who are flawless (good news for the clumsy among us!). A group of researchers wanted to determine whether this effect could also be applicable when it comes to social robots.</p>
 
<p>The team split 45 participants into an experimental group and a control group. Each interacted with a social robot in two different scenarios: a 10-question interview and a Lego building task. In the experimental group, the social robot made a total of eight mistakes between the two scenarios; it performed without mistake in the control group. Afterwards, the researchers administered questionnaires measuring participants’ perceptions of the robot’s likeability, anthropomorphism, and perceived intelligence.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that between the flawless and the flawed robot, there was no difference in how participants perceived their intelligence or anthropomorphism. However, there was a huge difference in how likeable the bots were, with the flawed robot being regarded as much more likeable than the flawless one. The Pratfall Effect held up.</p>
 
<p>Maybe robots that make mistakes are more likeable because it makes them seem more human, or at least less I-could-easily-take-over-the-world. The researchers suggest that social robot designers should consider potential imperfections they can program into their bots. Yet they also point out that more research needs to be done on the limits to these social robot mistakes. After all, despite the fact that it was very flawed, no one wants a Hal in their life.</p>
