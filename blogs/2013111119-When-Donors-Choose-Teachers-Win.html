Being a good teacher means giving all of yourself to your students, but does it also mean giving all of your paycheck? Many teachers know the harsh reality of a school budget that won't budge on necessary school supplies so, in response, they find themselves picking up the tab. This video comes from an organization that wants to flip the script on what has regrettably become the norm. <p>

Think of DonorsChoose.org like a Kickstarter for education: teachers post their dream projects along with the cost of said project, and philanthropic donors choose which ones they'd like to support by pledging as little or as much money as they want. If a project fails to meet its funding goal, donors get back their money in the form of account credits. Once a project is funded, all donors receive photos of students engaging in the project, a thank you letter from the teacher, and a cost report that details how each dollar of the entire donation was spent. If you donate $50 or more, you’ll even get thank you notes from students. Even if you only donate $1, you’ll receive the same level of transparency as with larger donations. DonorsChoose.org calls this "citizen philanthropy."<p>

Over 80% of the funded projects on the site come from high poverty schools.  Could DonorsChoose.org serve as a new (or at least, sustainable, supplementary) model to help fund public education in the US?

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:57 MartinPaper:</b> I've heard people lambaste donorschoose and orgs like it, and I don't think that's particularly fair. To me, the issue is not that they exist, but that they have to exist at all.<p>

<b>@01:36 Clark:</b> These are great incentives for donors. Knowing exactly how your money is being used-- and realizing the impact of your donation-- may make them more likely to donate in the future. At the very least, they'll feel good about their one-time donation.<p>

<b>@02:20 Rita:</b> I’m impressed with the caliber of celeb endorsements in this video!
