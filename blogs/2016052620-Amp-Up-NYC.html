Band teachers across the country live to share their love of music with students and inspire the next generation of great musicians. However, woodwind instruments and Bach fugues fall a little short of igniting passion for performance among youth. Whether a school has been stripped of its music education or is looking to revamp an existing band program,  
<a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/ampupnyc/">Amp Up NYC</a> brings music to New York City public schools using instruments and repertoire that kids want to play like pop, hip hop, rock, country, and reggae. Amp Up is a partnership between 
<a href="http://www.littlekidsrock.org/">Little Kids Rock </a> and 
<a href="https://www.berklee.edu/">Berklee College of Music </a> and has reached over 600 schools within the NYC Department of Education since 2014. It all begins with Modern Band 101, a daylong professional development program for teachers hosted at institutions across the five boroughs, including NYU and Queens College. Starting with an open jam session, teachers from all instrumental backgrounds get a crash course in modern band instruments like guitar, keyboard, drums, and bass along with methods to get kids playing immediately. Throughout the day, they'll discover alternative ways to teach music that is welcoming to all students and model the kinds of risk taking they'll hope to see in their own classroom like rocking out on their first guitar solo. Teachers leave with curricula, resources, and a grant for instruments; ready to launch their own programs that get their students as excited about music as they are.
