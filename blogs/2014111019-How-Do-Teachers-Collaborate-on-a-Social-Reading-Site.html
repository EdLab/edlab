<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/08/22/1461444814547683?papetoc">Social Media in Literacy Education: Exploring Social Reading With Pre-Service Teachers</a> (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joachim Vlieghe, Geert Vandermeersche, & Ronald Soetaert</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> New Media & Society</p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do pre-service teachers act and perceive their social reading practices on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The authors conducted a five-month study on Flemish student teachers’ reflective practices on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, currently the most popular social reading platform. 79 participants joined the study during their enrollment in a teacher education program in Ghent, Belgium. The data set includes student teachers’ participation in the Goodreads environment, observations of their own and other participants’ activities on the site, as well as their reflections through writing and discussing with peers. </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Teacher participants addressed prominent themes that focused on both social reading and literacy education. The authors found that the participants used the Goodreads’ Virtual Bookshelf as a personal archive and organizer to bring their own attention to reading, embraced the open nature of the platform while being critical about the Goodreads content contributed by non-professional readers, consciously perceived their reader identities represented by their reading history and peer assessment, and viewed their personally-curated, visible list of friends on the site as stimuli for engagement in social reading.</p>

<p>In regard to literacy education, the findings further suggest that the participants used the site to discuss how to select books for their future classes to cater to the planned school curriculum and how to act as mediators and protectors of students’ involvement in online discussions. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The study highlights an interesting case for using Goodreads as a teacher affinity-space for learning and for potential curricular planning of students’ literacy education. The reflections and experiences of teachers in the study suggest ways that educators can enhance their own classroom curricula by introducing social media sites as formal or informal learning spaces.</p>
