          <p>
            I always like to keep an eye on educational technology startups to see what is or isn't picking up.  In doing this, I came across <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/25/mendeley-snags-2-million-in-early-stage-funding-for-research-paper-management-tool/">Mendeley</a>, which is a research paper management tool.  I signed-up and downloaded the tool, but must say I kind of miss the point. <p> 

The tool allows you to manage your research papers, and auto-extracts information from them.  However, I thought it would do more for you, like display researchers papers that it thinks you haven't read but should.  If it does this, I can't seem to find the option where this is possible.  I am not a big fan of sophisticated tools that are designed to make you more organized (I feel like between Outlook, a relatively well-organized file system, a couple of Word docs, and a synced-mobile, you have all the organizational capacity you really need).  I can imagine this is only useful if you are a very senior scholar and have many dozens of papers that you want to be able to easily retrieve (but even then, do most people really want to go that far back?)  Who is really wadding through too much of their own intellectual property?  The point is probably to get a good organization tool that people actually use, then start providing more sophisticated networking applications.  The problem is, if no one is really interested in getting more  organized (like me), then that makes the networking applications part a non-starter.
