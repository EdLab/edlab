<p>Scientists and parents alike have raised valid concerns about  <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171201122927.htm">screen addiction</a> and the harmful aspects of digital devices in the hands of young children. It’s no surprise then that while thousands of interactive apps tout their educational benefits, many parents remain skeptical. However, researchers in Rijeka, Croatia have recently demonstrated that there are cases in which a problem-solving strategy learned on a touchscreen device can be transferred to the physical world. This would seem to indicate that rather than being harmful, touchscreen apps can in some cases provide the same opportunities for learning as traditional, non-digital resources.</p>
 
<p>To determine how children’s experience solving a problem in one modality affected their ability to do so in another, researchers studied 49 children ages three to six as they completed four trials of a problem-solving puzzle either in 2D form on a touchscreen device or in physical, 3D form. The puzzle consisted of three rings of different sizes and colors that had to be moved and placed in a particular order on a set of wooden pegs. Children were divided into three groups: those that completed the puzzle four times exclusively in 3D, those that completed the first and last puzzle in 3D, but the second and third puzzle in 2D, and those who completed the first three puzzles in 2D and the final puzzle in 3D. Researchers recorded the time it took children to complete each puzzle and tracked the number of moves used to complete the task.</p>
 
<p>Results of the study revealed that while children under the age of four did not show improvement between trials of puzzle solving regardless of modality, children four years and older demonstrated a successful transfer of learning from 2D to 3D, even without prior exposure to the 3D model. Total moves and time per move significantly decreased from the first trial to the final trial for children ages four and up, regardless of which of the three groups they were in. This demonstrates that, at least for children ages four and older, the modality of exposure is not a factor that affects the ability to learn a problem-solving technique.</p>

<p>This study points out the limits of regarding screen time as a passive viewing activity. So many interactive apps for touchscreen devices exist, and while not all those claiming to provide learning opportunities actually do, it’s clear that some can supply active, cognitive engagement that results in problem-solving learning. Perhaps understanding more about what types of skills can be most effectively acquired using touchscreen technology can help guide us towards a more expansive understanding of what educational apps are capable of.</p>
