            As an immigrant, it is always hard to believe that your inclusion within a new country is absolute. The assimilation can be even harder if your appearance and customs go against the norm. Luckily, assimilation becomes easier through the years. Eventually, however, your native country becomes foreign because of the amount of time spent away from it. Sometimes, the language and customs of your immigrant nation become extraordinarily habitual. So what happens when you go back to your roots?
<p>
Well, that's exactly what I'll find out in a few days. Peru, land of the free home of the wait–I mean land of the Incas, is my native country. Having spent a total of 16 years outside of Peru (10 in the States, 6 in Canada, quite a long story) it is hard to imagine what the experience will be like. My parents diligently drilled the Spanish language, Peruvian customs (food!) and slang into my brain as a kid. I have not forgotten the sense of humor and unique personalities of the Peruvian. After all, a large part of my Peruvian family and friends are located in New Jersey (God knows why) so I have always been within reach of Peruvian culture. Despite my acclimation to Peruvian food, people etc. in the States, my family warned me: Peruvians in Peru are not the same as Peruvians out of Peru. Since I've been away from my country and people for such a long time, I will easily be singled out as “agringada” which pretty much means white-washed. Oh the horror! After countless hours spent in front of Univision watching novelas with my aunt, eating spicy Peruvian food and learning really vulgar slang from my cousins, I am still gringa (aka white). 
<p>
It is inevitable for immigrants to never quite fit into their immigrant nation. After all I'm still Peruvian (or Canadian if we want to get passport-technical), not American. My green card still marks me as an immigrant and even if I was American, I think my appearance would give it away (if not my endlessly misspelled and mispronounced name). On top of that, from what I've heard, going back to my native country will not assuage my displacement issues. They won't accept me either!
<p>
So what becomes of those immigrants who don't quite fit in at home or abroad? They form their own group. It's not hard to find other immigrants in the same position. At some point, it becomes clear that we're outcasts in both countries and the formation of our own little community suits us best. That's the immigrant way of life, and I quite like it.
