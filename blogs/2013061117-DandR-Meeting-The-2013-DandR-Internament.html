<b>Week 22: Jo Agnitti</b>

In the Internament, only one team can rise victorious and claim the glory that befalls champions. 

Four righteous bands of competitors rose to accept the challenge before them: Prove your worth in the games of knowledge, creativity, and speed. While all proved mighty, only one team outlasted them all.

It was team Sweet Thangs (led by captains Brian Sweeting and Thanh Nguyen) vs. The Royals (led by captain Roy Kim) vs. Get Lucky (led by captains James Manlapid and Shuguang Han) vs. The Singing Rabbits (led by captains Mable Yiu and Sakar Khattar). 

Round one tested teams' knowledge of trivia; namely, music, television, computer science, and products. It saw the rise of three and the fall of one. While team Singing Rabbits said goodbye to their chance at the gold, their importance in the games intensified.

Round two found contestants with $1 million to spend from the NSF.  The only rule was that they had to use it to support STEAM education. Playing the role of NSF granters, the Singing Rabbits deemed which two winning ideas would allow the teams to advance to the next round. While the Sweet Thangs' idea for a museum on the river (powered by steam) was innovative, it was not enough to sway the judges. And so we parted ways with team Sweet Thangs. 

Or did we? 

Round three called into question everything contestants knew about our new interns in the deviously-crafted “Intern or Friend” challenge. Given one factual statement, team members vied to be the first to answer whether it was about an intern or an actor from the show Friends. 

In an unprecedented move, the two remaining teams voluntarily COMBINED FORCES with the displaced (ahem *losing*) teams to create two MEGA TEAMS! So it was team Royal Sweet Thangs vs. Singing Rabbits Get Lucky. After quite a showing from both teams, Royal Sweet Thangs narrowly came out ahead by one point. A thrilling game, indeed. 

And so we crown our winners of the 2013 D&R Internament. Until next year....
