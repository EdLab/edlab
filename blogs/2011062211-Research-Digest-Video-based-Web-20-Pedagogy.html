            <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=16291">Juzwik, Mary., Sherry, Michael., Caughlan, Samantha., Heintz, Anne., & Borsheim-Black, Carlin. (2012). Supporting Dialogically Organized Instruction in an English Teacher Preparation Program: A Video-Based, Web 2.0-Mediated Response and Revision Pedagogy. <i>Teachers College Record</i>, 114(3).</a>

Teachers College Record recently published an account of the application of Web 2.0 Video-based learning to teacher instruction in a Masters program.  This, I thought, might have some relevance to our Vialogues project.

Review:
According to the authors of this article, there are a few problems with our current system for training teachers.  Although classroom experiences can vary wildly depending on the student composition, we tend only to give teachers experience with one classroom before sending them out into the wilds.  To add on to their future difficulties, we also only train them in one limited method of classroom, interaction, recitation.  “Recitation” describes the custom of restricting student vocalization to demonstrating lesson absorption.  

To ameliorate these difficulties, the authors turn to a suite of tools, including digital video and Internet social networking.  Instead of simply instructing teachers candidates (TCs) to try harder to incorporate student discussion, or imagine other methods of teaching and learning, they created opportunities to share ideas and feedback between different learners.  They carried out this exercise with a group of TCs in the secondary English teacher preparation program at Michigan State University.  The TCs videotaped their lessons and group discussions, which they then shared and critiqued over <a href="http://voicethread.com/">Voicethread</a>.

Although the data are only qualitative, and derived from a single use-case, the paper inspires some confidence that these video discussions did serve to make teaching practices more “visible and flexible.”  Although there were issues of trust, and these tools did require a significant time investment that could seem onerous, the basic principle remains solid.  Videotaping classroom practices allows for more rigorous, objective, and group-mediated evaluation of lesson plans and teaching methods.

Edlab Relevance:
They make a fairly convincing case for the effectiveness of shared video discussion, and also write: “one significant drawback of Voicethread (as opposed to Viddler, for example) was that interns could not easily respond "at the instructional moment" on which they were commenting; rather, comments in the thread appeared after the video clip.”  This seems like a good argument for the Vialogues platform, and I think this paper offers up both a justification, and a variety of use cases, for the program's application to teacher instruction.
