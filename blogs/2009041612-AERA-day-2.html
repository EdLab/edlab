            Yes, I made my first presentation on Tuesday along with two other presenters. The focus was on K-12 Online teachers, and I will consider the attendance (about 12) not very impressive by AERA standards. Whilst the first presenter discussed a study that surveyed US online (virtual high school) teachers and compared their characteristics with that of their traditional (f2f) counterparts, the second discussed an online professional development project for in-service teachers being undertaken by the University of Florida. 

The first speaker's main conclusion was that though there is no apparent difference in characteristics between online and f2f teachers, on the whole, the more experienced teachers and those who hold advanced degrees (Masters & Doctoral) tend to be more inclined towards engaging in online instruction. 

The second speaker dwelt on the concept of Online Anchored Professional Learning - emphasizing on how using online web-based tools to engage teachers in interdisciplinary exploratory and learning processes that are anchored by real-life professional activities (recorded on video), is a powerful way of enriching teachers' knowledge and skills repertoire and also widening their perspectives.

As the final speaker, I discussed some recommendations (based on feedback from pre-service teachers who took an online educational technology course) that instructors can adopt to help implement effective online learning courses, particularly within the context of limited technology infrastructure. I made the case that whilst educators are taking steps to introduce technology and investigating whatever best practices can be adopted in order to enhance student engagement and learning, it is worthwhile trying to understand how the prospective learners perceive these innovative instructional strategies within their individual and collective learning contexts. This is because feedback obtained from such actions can greatly contribute to enhancing the design and effective delivery of online courses.

The chair and discussant of the session, in their respective summaries, both emphasized on the fact that technology integration in education in general is still very much peripheral, and whilst it is imperative to engage in research and development projects, we need to proceed with cautious optimism - as previous educational “silver bullets” failed to live up to the attendant hype. Also, the general thinking that Net-generation learners are technologically savvy, and will therefore be very comfortable engaging in learning activities facilitated by these technologies, should not be overemphasized as it is increasingly clear that the savviness is mostly limited to superficial use - texting and facebooking for example. The cultural dimension vis-Ã -vis technology use should also not be overlooked.

A short Q&A session was mostly limited to the sharing of ideas and resources among presenters and attendees.

Wednesday was another hectic day - details of my poster presentation will come later
