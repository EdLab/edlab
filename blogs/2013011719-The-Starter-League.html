<i>We’re working with 37signals to train and empower aspiring problem solvers.  Over the past decade, they’ve taught thousands how to build successful web applications.  Joining their expertise with our immersive training creates a perfect storm for starter education… We aren’t looking to scale to 20 cities and pump out lemmings. We’re committed to creating the best learning experience you’ve ever had, we won’t compromise that for anything. Our people and our programs come first.</i>

<b>We don’t want to "Pump out Lemmings"</b><br>
<p>
Picking up where online "code academies" often leave off, <a href="http://starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> has created an in-person intensive mentorship and incubation experience that takes learners from idea to product. Previously known as Code Academy (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>), the small school located in Chicago has taught groups of students to learn, "Rails, Ruby, HTML/CSS, and User Experience Design."  The newest incarnation of The Starter League is still committed to teaching learners who are accepted into the program how to code and design, but now they will learn how to take theory to the next level. They will now learn how to move from theory to the process of shipping their web app and starting a company, all in three months.  Uniquely connected to the "real" startup world through a partnership with<a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a>, a leading software company known for ground-breaking project management tools, the alliance will create the opportunity for additional mentorship opportunities and internships and allow learners to take classes in-person at the 37Signals offices in Chicago.  Additionally, curriculum for the course will be developed based on 37Signals’ unique software development process, and the course will be taught by leaders of the company, which includes one of the first developers of the "Rails" language.  37Signals is so sure that The Starter League has the potential to disrupt both coding education and entrepreneurship incubation, that they have bought a stake in the company, the first outside investment since their founding over 10 years ago.

<b> Company-Connected, Personal, and Perhaps Local</b><br>
<p>
A growing number of leading universities such as Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania have developed programs to teach entrepreneurship and are responsible for producing numerous notable entrepreneurs.  The Starter League, however, with its 3-month cohort program is attempting to compete with these long-established educational institutions by partnering with an established technology company to offer both training in entrepreneurship and programing.  Engineers and entrepreneurs at the partner company will function as mentors and teachers.  Less a replacement for an online learning experience, and more a new model of education in the "real-world," the program provides an important reminder of the value of individuals gathering together in real time.  In addition, instead of the traditional experience of theory-based learning, the program emphasizes gaining "practical, hands-on knowledge."  Learners receive both training in how to use the most "modern tools of the trade" and how to promote and sell their subsequent products from "passionate practitioners."  This is especially valuable as a major complaint of traditional education is that the learning that occurs throughout a multi-year program is often obsolete as soon as students graduate.  Also, learners who are accepted into the 11-week program are provided with a unique angle that both online and in-person programs would do well to emulate, a focus on project-based learning.  Instead of working on theoretical problem sets or pouring over case studies, the program takes aspiring developers from ideation (their own) to a finished product and beyond.  Additionally, The Starter League has the potential to blaze a new trail towards locally- based, intense "league" training developed in close partnership with successful companies and resident mentors.  This model could take motivated learners to the entrepreneurial "big leagues" as founders and developers without investing many years and hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Would you bet on this minor league becoming a major league success?
