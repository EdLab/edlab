            According to <a href="http://www.quora.com/At-Facebook-and-Google-why-are-many-new-CS-graduates-offered-120k+-with-a-30-120k-signing-bonus-while-those-with-a-few-years-experience-are-offered-a-baseline-salary-with-no-bonus" target="_blank">this post on Quora</a> (answered by a former Google recruiter), NO!

According to the answer, this is because to Google (and many other large companies) the competitiveness exists more on recruiting new CS graduates than software engineers with a few years of experience. For recruiting the former, there is no existing data for them to figure out what budget they should spend each year so they tend to offer more so as to compete with other employers. But for the latter, they can figure out (by industry analysis, data mining, intelligence, etc.) how much they should offer in order to <i>win over</i> other competitors so their strategies are more conservative. As a result, for example, A is a software engineer with 3 years of experience and is gradated from the same CS program of the same school as B, who is a new graduate. But B tend to receive a higher salary+bonus package than A.

This is a very interesting Q&A on Quora. I hope this isn't true in small- to mid-size companies.

BTW Quora appears to do very well in their intelligent recommendation algorithms in selecting Q&As for my daily digest. Most of the time I have the push to click the links in the email.
