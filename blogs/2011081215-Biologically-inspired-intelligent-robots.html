            <strong>Title</strong>: Biologically inspired intelligent robots

<strong>Editors</strong>: Yoseph Bar-Cohen and Cynthia Breazeal

<strong>Publisher</strong>:Â  SPIE Press

<strong>Call number:</strong> <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search%7ES6?/cTJ211+.B38+2003/ctj++211+b38+2003/-3,-1,,E/browse">TJ211 .B38 2003</a><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/c?SEARCH=LC49+.W45+2009&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit"></a>

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

Advances in biologically-inspired technologies, such as artificial  intelligence and artificial muscles, are making the possibility of  engineering robots that look and behave like humans a closer reality.  The multidisciplinary issues involved in the development of these robots  include materials, actuators, sensors, structures, functionality,  control, intelligence, and autonomy. This book reviews various aspects  ranging from the biological model to the vision for the future.

<strong>About the editors: </strong>

<strong>Dr.  Yoseph Bar-Cohen</strong> is a Senior Research Scientist and Group Supervisor at  JPL. He is also a Fellow of two technical societies, SPIE and ASNT. In  his <a href="http://ndeaa.jpl.nasa.gov/">NDEAA</a> lab, which he established in  1991, many novel methods and mechanisms were developed. He received his  Ph. D. in Physics (1979) from the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.  He (co)authored over 320 publications, has 19-registered patents, he is  the Editor and coauthor of 6 books, and he chaired (co)Chaired 38  Conferences and Symposia. He made two notable discoveries of ultrasonic  wave phenomena in composite materials: the leaky Lamb waves (LLW) (1983)  and the polar backscattering (1983). He is the initiator of the SPIE  Conf. on electroactive polymers (EAP), chairing it since 1999, and his  challenge wrestling match between an arm driven by EAP and human has  become an annual highlight. In April 2003, Business Week named him as  one of five technology gurus who are "Pushing Tech's Boundaries." His  scientific and engineering accomplishments have earned him many honors  and awards including the 2001 NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement  Medal, two SPIE's Lifetime Achievement Awards including NDE (in 2001)  and Smart Materials and Structures (in 2005), 2006 ASNT Sustained  Excellence award, and the 2007 SPIE President's Award.

<strong>Dr. Cynthia Breazeal</strong> is an  Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology where she founded and directs the Personal  Robots Group at the Media Lab. She is a pioneer of social robotics and  Human Robot Interaction. She has authored the book <em>Designing Sociable  Robots</em>, has published over 100 peer-reviewed articles in journals and  conferences on the topics of autonomous robotics, artificial  intelligence, human robot interaction, and robot learning. She serves on  several editorial boards in the areas of autonomous robots, affective  computing, entertainment technology and multi-agent systems. She is also  a member of the advisory board for the Science Channel and an Overseer  at the Museum of Science, Boston.
