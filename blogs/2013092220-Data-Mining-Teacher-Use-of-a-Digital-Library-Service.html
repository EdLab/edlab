<p><b>Title:</b> Understanding Teacher Users of a Digital Library Service: A Clustering Approach (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Beijie Xu, Mimi Recker</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.educationaldatamining.org/JEDM/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69">Journal of Educational Data Mining</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
How can educational data mining reveal teachers' use of a digital library service?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Educational digital libraries are an important resource for teachers seeking community and curriculum guidance. Research to investigate teachers’ information seeking practices for instructional planning and other purposes has primarily been carried out through traditional research methods like interviews and surveys. Fewer studies have used modern educational data mining techniques to explore the impact of the digital library tools and services on teachers and their resulting instructional practices. <a href="http://www.educationaldatamining.org/JEDM/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69">Understanding Teacher Users of a Digital Library Service: A Clustering Approach</a>  used a data mining technique called clustering to investigate teachers' diverse online behaviors using digital library services. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">Clustering</a> relies on establishing connections between groups of data objects.</p>

<p>The study used a digital library service called <a href="http://ia.usu.edu/">Instructional Architect</a> which encourages teachers to create and share instructional activities and online resources. The site allows teachers to manage resources and projects, share with other educators, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a> projects saved under the Creative Commons’ licenses. In the years from 2002 to 2010, over 5,500 teachers registered in the system and created over 12,000 projects and 54,000 online resources. The authors examined how teachers used their own resource collection, how they used others’ projects, and how they navigated the site. The data came from 757 teachers, excluding those who were registered, but had never used the site features.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors identified several clusters in the data. The largest cluster was made up of <i>islanders</i>, teachers who created their own projects, but seldom browsed and never copied the projects of other teachers. In turn the projects created by the islanders were rarely visited or copied. The next largest cluster was made up of <i>window shoppers</i> who created a few private projects, perhaps just for practice or fun. Other groups included <i>lukewarm users</i> who dabbled with adding a little content and few resource links and spent the most time searching and browsing though they rarely used content, and <i>beneficiaries</i> who were willing to share their work with the public, but were seldom visited by other users. Overall, the authors found that content and resource richness characterized high quality projects, and the most successful project creators spent a lot of time searching and browsing before creating projects of their own. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
These results shed light on the importance of behavioral and navigation support in digital systems, particularly those that have many different functions. This study revealed that in a complex digital environment, there are many types of users and understanding this can help experience designers guide users into more productive and rewarding roles. For teachers using a digital instruction library, these roles would include the creation of innovative remixed curricula and communication with other educators.</p>
