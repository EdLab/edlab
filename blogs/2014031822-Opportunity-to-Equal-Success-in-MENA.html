          <p>
            I believe the strength of a nation's economy plays a role in the performances of students on assessment exams used to determine global rankings. As a result, if citizens of a country are educated, they can create jobs to further boost the economy. In undeveloped countries, the lack of investment in schools is the reason why most students don't receive a quality education. This is true in places like the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. The World Bank has been able to <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/achieving-shared-prosperity-middle-east-and-north-africa">highlight the reasons</a> why there continues to be extreme poverty in this region. Additionally, the World Bank offered suggested ideas to improve the lives of those in the MENA region.

The first problem is the high unemployment rate in the region. People are not finding jobs because they don't have <i>wasta</i> (connections to high level government officials). Some of the people who are fortunate to find employment are teachers, most of whom are not highly qualified. For instance, in Tunisia, Syria, and Morocco, students are underperforming relative to their peers in other developing countries on standardized eighth grade math exams. The other main issues concern expensive energy subsidies that benefit only the rich and slow economic growth in per capita terms.

As to how to solve the issue of poverty in the MENA region, the World Bank has suggested that everyone must have a fair opportunity to success. For example, energy subsidies shouldn't only benefit the rich, but households that are at a disadvantage. There should be no reason why the top 20% should consume 60% of energy subsidies. I believe that if nations are held accountable for these problems rather the people, a solution can be reached and everyone will be happy.
