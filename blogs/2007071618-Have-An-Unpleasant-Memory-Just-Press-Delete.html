            Have you ever wished that there was something that could make all your bad memories go away? Or perhaps you've wanted the power to press delete and forget forever. Since turning back time seems to be out of our reach just yet, maybe science can help us block out unpleasant experiences in our past. 

Scientists have not yet been able to provide us with the convenient option of pressing “Delete” to erase our memories, but they have been making progress in studies that could develop drugs for the suppression of memories. In recent years, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN1233536520070712?pageNumber=1">studies</a> have been conducted at the University of Colorado and Stanford University that directly connect the blocking of memory to biological functions in our brain. Although these experiments are still developmental and in their early stages, it is clear that we can actively try to forget unwanted memories. 

The results were similar in these studies and confirmed speculation that humans have the ability to suppress unwanted memories. Read more about them <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/health/feeds/hscout/2007/07/12/hscout606357.html">here</a>. When trying not to recall certain words or images, the subjects were more likely not to remember them. They showed that when we tried not to remember certain memories, we were activating the left and right frontal cortexes of our brain- areas used to repress memories. This in turn decreased our use of the hippocampus, the part we normally use to remember. One other significant discovery was that our emotional center, the amgdala, was being deactivated. It was no surprise to me that when trying to forget our memories, we are in a sense “turning off” our emotions connected to them. 

The drug propanolol is now being used in a study (coupled with therapy) to reduce stress incurred when recalling traumatic experiences. Patients on the drug seem to be showing fewer signs of stress when compared to those on the placebo. Harvard University and McGill University have also been working on a <a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/070702_bad_memories.html">drug</a> to help block the biochemical pathways used for recalling memories. Although the number of subjects used in these studies is still very low, progress is being made. 

Anyone familiar with heartache can profess that suppressing memories is easier said than done. I can believe that if we continuously work to erase a certain memory, its details may dim and eventually we might forget entirely, but how effective will this be on truly traumatic experiences like rape? Also, is the ease with which we forget an implication of our will power? Much research has been done but there still doesn't seem to be enough information to answer all of our questions. 

If a drug can be developed to successfully fight post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, phobias and other disorders, this is indeed a breakthrough. As of now, we can only remain optimistic and hope that this will happen sooner than later.
