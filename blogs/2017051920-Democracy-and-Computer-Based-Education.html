<p>The connection between education and democracy has long been discussed, particularly after John Dewey’s philosophical text Democracy and Education was published during World War I. Yet as computer-based education continues to grow, it is important to examine the relationship between digital education and democracy. The question becomes: how can a virtual education prepare students for citizenship?</p>
 
<p>While knowledge building is an important part of online learning, there are other aspects of a virtual community that could be important elements in developing political agency in students. According to a new study, this includes the freedom to exercise power and the ability to organically negotiate power dynamics with other students in the class.</p>
 
<p>Researchers studied a computer-supported eighth grade humanities class for an entire school year, where students participated through an online learning platform. On this platform, students had complete freedom regarding how they organized their participation and the direction the conversations went. The researchers were less interested in the content of the comments and more in the way they were posted.</p>
 
<p>They found that the conversation in the first half of the course was drastically different from that of the second half. Namely, the first half was mainly comprised of random postings and students talking over one another, and the second half included more dialogue, continued threads of thought, and comment organization. Over time, the students created both public spaces on the platform and private spaces where they could reflect individually.</p>
 
<p>The researchers suggest that having freedom in online participation allowed students to collectively create a successful virtual community over the course of the year. Although there were issues with power dynamics at the beginning of the year, such as students continually talking over one another, by the end they had created a system that afforded organic dialogue. Students also had greater flexibility in moving between a public and private forum. These results demonstrate that when students collaboratively create both knowledge and power dynamics together, they are able to practice building a polis, or a democratic community in which all are active participants.</p>
