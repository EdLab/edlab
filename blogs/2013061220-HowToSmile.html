<p><a href="http://www.howtosmile.org/">HowtoSmile</a> provides educators with creative activities that are designed to teach younger students about math and science. These activities, which are curated from free online resources, are intended for educators who teach outside of the classroom in places like museums, aquariums, zoos, after school programs, technology centers, and parks. The activities are sorted by Common Core Standards for easy reference, though this type of activity sorting may not be so useful for HowtoSmile’s un-classroom educators. Each activity provides instructions, materials needed, and cost estimates.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Each activity includes a link to the procedure and gives a detailed description complete with materials needed, subjects and activity topics. Users can browse through the activities and select one to use depending the subject they wish to teach their students. When users are signed into the site they can earn badges and points for interacting and contributing to site content. HowtoSmile encourages users to log in often, offer meaningful comments, and upvote other users’ comments to create an active and helpful community on the site. Users can also refine search results for a better browsing experience.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The activities require a certain amount of money and skill to perform. Some organizations may not have access to the materials needed for some of the activities featured on the site.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>HowtoSmile provides creative activities that promote learning about math, chemistry, energy, cooking, astronomy, and other science and math subjects. Though some of the activities are sorted by standards, the site encourages educators to utilize these activities for programs outside of school. These programs often <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/444">promote learning as readily</a> as traditional classrooms. Exposure to STEM activities might encourage students to choose STEM careers. Providing information on career opportunities in these areas could enhance this prospect and allow young students to see how the concepts they are learning are being used in the real world.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>HowtoSmile provides educators with creative learning activities.</p>
