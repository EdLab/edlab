            Yea, Education 3.0 is just a word and a number.  But it is a word and number that has been creating buzz amongst educators for a while. A simple definition of 3.0 is "bringing in the outside world into the classroom". Specifically, bringing in the world that these students will one day have to go out and face everyday. The idea is that 3.0 schools will cultivate knowledge-producing kids where they can share, remix, and capitalize on new ideas and where educators can embrace accelerating change rather than fight it. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heartstringcantata/6419005939/" title="NewParadigmModel by heartstringcantata, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7173/6419005939_1057dda70e.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="NewParadigmModel"></a>

The School at Columbia University allowed their 8th graders to participate in a project called <a href="http://www.educationnation.com/index.cfm?objectid=D0F415B6-13D3-11E1-8E80000C296BA163&aka=0">“Tools for Schools”</a> that is a good example of education 3.0. The students were challenged to redesign classroom furniture that better fits the needs of today's students by collaborating with real design firms outside of school. 

Education 3.0 acknowledges global change, and the new educational sector is driven by globalization and information technology. It emphasizes the skills students need in order to compete globally in an ever-changing world. Education 3.0 seems to suggest not only new ways of teaching, but an entirely whole new set of <b>content</b> to teach. 

For EdLab, it is important for us to keep in mind about developing technology and tools for the future education 3.0 schools, not in the current 2.0 versions we have now. Technology must serve a bigger purpose in classrooms, a purpose beyond just using Smartboards so the kids in the back can see better or having iPads in schools just for the sake of having iPads in schools. It would be a shame to see new technologies being used to teach outdated information of an outdated curriculum. Schools WILL change (it must!) and so should the purpose behind the tools created for it. 

The details of the proposed paradigm of education 3.0 may seem overly idealistic, thinking too far ahead into the future, or maybe even impossible. But I think the overall concept of teaching kids to actively participate in an increasingly globalized world in a tangible way is absolutely vital if American schools even want to compete in future education.
