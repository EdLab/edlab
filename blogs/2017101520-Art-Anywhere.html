<p><i><a href="https://www.artsy.net/about">Artsy</a> seeks to make <em>all</em> the worldâ€™s art accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. With this as their mission, they aim to be a tool that not only educates people about art, but also enables them to collect it.</i> </p>
 
<p><b>Auction Paddles Not Necessary</b></p>

<p>To connect with art lovers online, Artsy partners with leading galleries and institutions. The website showcases art from many sources, including galleries, foundations, estates, fairs, and auctions. Previously, artwork would only be displayed in each of these specific venues for a certain time. However, thanks to the Artsy platform, collectors can easily view art from around the U.S. and the world. The Artsy database houses many thousands of art images spanning several different periods and styles. Specialists with experience at leading galleries, museums, and auction houses work with prospective buyers to help them discover potential pieces for their new or already expansive personal collections.</p>
 
<p>For collectors, Artsy offers a detailed listing of works currently available for sale. The pieces available for purchase through the site range in price from more affordable options around the hundred-dollar mark to much costlier items, with price tags that exceed a million dollars. Unlike traditional art dealers, Artsy takes no commission from these sales, simply linking buyers with gallery partners. </p>

<p><b>Art for the People </b></p>
 
<p>Artsy serves not only as a platform for collectors to peruse, sell, and purchase artworks, but also as a news resource reporting on the latest happenings in the art world. This coverage alerts readers to upcoming or current shows and cultural events. Visitors to Artsy can also create their own collections by saving their favorite works to their account, which allows them to revisit pieces after further research or to track and view them over time. While Artsy primarily targets collectors, it provides an extensive range of features to connect with a broad audience of art enthusiasts and professionals alike.</p>

<p>As for educators, Artsy provides an extensive database of high-resolution images that are free to download and use. The platform also provides tools to help educators learn about artists biographies, art periods, movements, works, and stories behind art.</p>
