<p>University education is increasingly moving to an online format, with supporters citing, among other advantages, the appeal of such learning to young, digitally native students. In this study, researcher Katja Fleischmann investigates undergraduate design students’ perspectives about online and blended learning.</p>   
 
<p>Fleischmann administered a survey with closed and open-ended questions to 40 undergraduate design students who had just completed a face-to-face design course. The survey probed the students’ levels of digital fluency, their experience with online learning, and their openness to digital teaching methods in the design field. While 97.5% of participants used social media and 75% had prior experience with online learning, 75% of the students responded that they would not take the course they had just completed in a fully online format. If forced to choose between an entirely online course and a blended course, 92.5% would choose the blended course, with online lectures and in-person studio time. However, if given a choice among all three learning options, 67.5% would pick face-to-face teaching.</p>

<p>The open-ended questions administered in the survey offer insights into why these undergraduate design students value face-to-face learning. Increased incentive to focus, enriching interactions with peers and teachers, and the opportunity for immediate feedback were common reasons students preferred the in-person class. Conversely, those who preferred online learning cited flexibility and the ability to learn at one’s own pace.</p>

<p>The study concluded that face-to-face teaching helps many students learn. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the frequent use of digital devices in personal life does not necessarily correlate with a preference for online learning. Fleischmann suggests that architects of future online courses incorporate instant instructor feedback mechanisms and increased opportunities for collaboration in order to meet students’ learning needs.</p>
