Any software developer who has worked in the last half decade should know the name <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/02/about-me.html">Jeff Atwood</a>.  In 2008 Atwood founded and built the leading question and answer site for "professional and enthusiast programmers," <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>, and went-on to create a joint venture with <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html">Joel Spolsky</a> that would result in the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange network of Question and Answer sites</a>.  Atwood’s own experience with programming began with Microsoft’s BASIC language in the 1980’s and evolved into Pascal, early Delphi and VB.NET or C#.  Atwood, ever the lifelong learner, is currently tackling popular programming language <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.  Despite a rich programming pedigree, Atwood maintains that computers are merely a reflection of the people who use and program them.  As such, Atwood advocates that in addition to learning software development, people should also "...study the people <i>behind</i> the software."  Along with a "dream job" at <a href="http://www.vertigo.com/">Vertigo Software</a>, Atwood considers his entry into blogging in 2004 to be a pinnacle point of his career.  This experience blogging served as an inspiration for what would later become Stack Overflow and ultimately one of the <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/p-c1rF4kxgLUzNc">most popular destinations on the web</a>, the Stack Exchange network.  In 2012 Atwood left Stack Exchange and in 2013 created the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/02/civilized-discourse-construction-kit.html">Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc.</a> and corresponding <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse open-source discussion platform</a>.  Now that Atwood has reinvented how programmers share ideas and ask questions, it will be exciting to see how he helps further evolve the world’s digital discussions.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have a minor in computer science and a major in environmental science from the University of Virginia. However, I was a programmer from my early teens. I was particularly interested in how computers can help make sense of complex, interesting problems, like environmental data. Programming without a problem to solve isn't interesting to me.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My blog at <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog">codinghorror.com/blog</a> -- I learned that keeping a "research journal" online, if you make an effort to keep it interesting and entertaining to other people, can be very successful. That was the springboard that led to me creating <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> and the rest of the Stack Exchange network. None of that would have been possible without the audience that formed around my public, entertaining research journal, if you will. 
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> There is a heavy emphasis on peer-to-peer learning at Stack Exchange. Everyone knows a little more than someone else, and you teach each other within the constraints of the Stack Exchange Question and Answer system. This means you don't need those mythical "experts" to be around, because the true experts are usually too busy to spend a lot of time teaching anyone. The framework of reputation scores, badges, voting, editing, and other incentives at Stack Exchange are there to help the community peer review the submissions and ensure that the best, most accurate information rises to the top. There is a sort of chicken and egg problem, however, in that you need a few knowledgeable folks to seed the community early on -- signs of expertise, if encouraged, grows more expertise over time. But you can't have the blind leading the blind.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Certainly online learning, seeded by experts, but growing through peers teaching peers. Not a passive activity of watching lectures and doing graded exercises, but more like structured, collaborative exercises with groups and goals. Stack Exchange is a good canary in the coalmine for this model, as are a lot of topics involving programming, which is not just incredibly deep and specialized, but requires constant learning and re-learning of skills, more than most professions.

<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We are working on <a href="http://www.discourse.org">Discourse.org</a> , a completely 100% free open source forum system for public discussions. We want to bring the same concepts of community self-governance and sustainability to online discussion that we did with Stack Exchange and Question and Answer. Discourse is forum software that helps people build communities that treat each other like human beings, not soulless, faceless typing computers. We call it the Civilized Discourse Construction Kit. We love online discussions, but we hate the terrible 1999-era discussion software that so many smart people are trapped in.
