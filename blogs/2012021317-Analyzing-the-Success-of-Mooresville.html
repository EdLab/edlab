          <p>
            North Carolina was the first to open a public university in the United States, and now it is home to one of the highest performing public schools in the country.  Mooresville Intermediate School is a part of the <a href="http://www.mgsd.k12.nc.us/MGSD/Home.html">Mooresville Graded School District</a> and recently profiled in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/education/mooresville-school-district-a-laptop-success-story.html?ref=education"> article by the New York Times</a> as a national model for the school of the future.  

Sixty visitors a month are allowed to crowd the halls to try to glean some knowledge as to why test scores and attendance are considerably higher and dropout rates are consistently lower than other schools in the state.  Karen Cator, director of educational technology for the US Department of Education and a former Apple executive describes the district's success, to the New York Times: “Other districts are doing things, but what we see in Mooresville is the whole package: using the budget, innovating, using data, involvement with the community and leadership.”  How exactly does this district accomplish these often elusive goals?  

<b>After reading the aforementioned New York Times article in which Ms. Cator was quoted, I have attempted to summarize the district's success as follows:</b>

1) <b>Technology + Accessibility:</b> The district provides leased MacBook Air laptops to every student.  For those that cannot afford high-speed internet, the district has struck a deal with providers to offer economically disadvantaged families a much lower rate. All families must pay a yearly fee of $50 to subsidize computer repairs, and again, lower income families are not expected to carry this cost.  

2) <b>Blended, Personalized and Self-paced:</b> Many schools seek to replace teachers with technology.  At Mooresville, it appears that teachers and technology are each able to do what they do best.  Teachers provide one-on-one attention to the students who need it most while self-paced learning platforms and activities take students through lessons at their rate of learning.

3) <b>Make Tough Choices:</b> To pay for the aforementioned technology, teachers and other services had to be cut. Class sizes grew, but technology helped teachers to better manage the additional students.  

4) <b>Harness Data:</b> Teachers, parents and students were able to track performance, more closely, and change their delivery and behavior more quickly. 

5) <b>Give-up Control:</b> Teachers are encouraged to "give up control" and "trust" their students.  This seemed to be one of the most perplexing aspects of Mooresville's success to the 60 visitors who are allowed to observe student/teacher interaction.  Perhaps in trust and greater freedom lies better performance and student engagement?
