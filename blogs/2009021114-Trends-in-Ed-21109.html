            <b>Nintendo in Classrooms</b>
Wii Music hit store shelves last October at the same time that Nintendo approached the National Music Education Association.  The goal was to see if the game could work in a classroom setting.  Well, does it work?  <a href=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29127548/>An article</a> about integrating the music game reveals that there's about 60 music teachers around the country that have begun to combine the use of popular game consoles into their regular curriculum, and they are quite excited to motivate students who have been uninterested to participate in class.  

Is ‘participation' more important than gaining the actual knowledge + skill of playing a musical instrument?  While that debate is probably ongoing amongst the teachers, there are two sides of the coin worth sharing here.  <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwxSJ1h8OMk>The upside</a> is that it allows players to virtually experiment with 66 different instruments ranging from an ukulele and bagpipes to DJ turntables, in addition to playing mini-games like “Pitch Perfect” and improvising as a member of an ensemble.  The downside is this virtual musical experience can translate into what many of us accept as music-al.            

<b>The Composer in You</b> 
In relation to today's theme on music education, check out a prototype of the “Sheet Music Editor,” created by students of a user interface class at the <a href=http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/welcome.html?L=1>Hasso Plattner Institute</a> in Potsdam, Germany.  This demo shows how you can make notes of musical notes you hear anytime anywhere, maybe even the tunes you hear inside your head (which could potentially develop into an orchestra score)!

<b>iPhone App-a-Day</b>
Here's a slight change in direction towards tools/utility program.  Considering the tough economy these days, everyone is looking to save, which requires paying a little more attention on personal expense habits, including your tipping or ‘splitting' habits.  Do you usually round up or down — or would you like to be precise down to the decimal points?  If accuracy is your thing, there are easy-to-use tip calculator applications and I was able to find three of them rather quickly (yes, competition at your face): <a href=http://www.apptism.com/apps/quicktip>Quick Tip Calculator</a>, <a href=http://www.apptism.com/apps/tipulator-the-fun-tip-calculator>Tipulator</a>, and <b>Check Please</b>.
