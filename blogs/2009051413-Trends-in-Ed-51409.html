            <b>Social learning platforms</b>

Let's face it: Learning Management Systems (LMS) are so passÃ©.  Social learning platforms are where it's at now!  These platforms provide a space for individuals to store and share information, including their own learning experiences. In addition, they provide an opportunity for groups to work collaboratively in an informal manner.  Of course, let's not forget that they <i>do</i> support <u>formal</u> social and collaborative learning. Some tools that may be used in social learning platforms are:
Blogs
Microblogs
RSS feeds
Social bookmarks
Social networks
File sharing
Collaboration tools (i.e. Google docs, Zoho writer)

Here are a few SLPs that I have come across lately.  Think about these the next time you need to create an eLearning space!

<a href="http://elgg.org/">Elgg</a> is an open source software that allows users to create their own online communities.  Users can customize all aspects including the appearance and functionality.  Teachers and students have the option to utilize all of the features listed above.

<a href="http://www.podclass.com/">Podclass</a> is an “online marketplace for the buying, selling and sharing of expertise in the form of online classes and video podcasts.” It has a Facebook app that allows for course management by providing class lists and the ability for students to connect to each other via messaging or forums.  The Facebook app also allows teachers to use videos to teach.

<a href="http://sclipo.com/frontpage">Sclipo</a> allows teachers of online courses to set up their own “academies” and fill them with courses on any subject.  The content of courses can include uploaded docs and web cam videos. It is a new product and because of this, many of the “social” tools are not yet up and running. Expect to see groups, events, and forums options for courses in the future.

<a href=http://learningzen.com/Default.aspx">Learning Zen</a> takes a collaborative approach to teaching and learning. Its goal is to, “give everyone access to knowledge that will make them better today than they were yesterday.” It offers certificates of completion for learners and also provides reports of progress and individual feedback.

Of course, having the capabilities for social learning is one thing; knowing how to harness the power of these tools is another.  I haven't yet seen any good tutorials on how to use these… Maybe this is a job for the EdLab (I'm picturing the Development & Research team rolling out of the back of a old school black van, A-Team style)– to create the social learning platform creation tutorial to end all social learning platform creation tutorials.
