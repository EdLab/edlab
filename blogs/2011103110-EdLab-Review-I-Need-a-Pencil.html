<a href="http://ineedapencil.com/AboutUs.aspx">I Need a Pencil</a> is a free SAT test prep site that provides lessons to reinforce/review concepts commonly covered on the exam, sample tests and trackable performance metrics.  While not truly "adaptive" in a classic sense, like a fee-based test prep provider (Knewton.com etc.) INAP seems to have the basics down pat and will provide a scaled-back, yet effective means of preparation. 

Founded by then high-schooler, Jason Shah in 2005, INAP remains a leading source of SAT test prep for learners who can't afford to spend often exorbitant amounts on test-prep and tutors.  Shah worked as a tutor himself and was inspired to develop the site after shadowing his older sister who was working with <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/">Teach for America</a>.  His experience with his sister coupled-with research he conducted into the effects of income disparity and SAT scores led to the initial launch & eventual success of INAP.  Learn more about this income-based disparity <a href ="http://rethinkingadmissions.blogs.wfu.edu/2010/09/14/new-sat-scores-reflect-growing-disparities/">here</a>.  Also, explore more about INAP and Jason Shah, who is now at Harvard in the vialogue embedded below. 

<b>Pros:</b>  
From what I can tell this test prep program is simple, easy-to-use and straightforward.  The options, while less "fun,"interactive or responsive/adaptive to the learners performance than other fee-based test prep sites (Kaplan, Knewton etc.), this program seems to get the job of SAT test-prep done effectively.  The simplicity and no-fee structure seems to erase many common barriers-to-entry of other platforms for low-income students.  

One of the benefits of a more stripped-down approach (no videos, flash animation etc.) is that the program will work well across many different operating systems and in school districts with low-bandwidth and blocks on video content.  The site even provides down-loadable bubble sheets to practice with, ironically no free pencils!  Another interesting feature, is that students can email their results to a pre-determined "mentor."  Overall, this site seems like a valuable resource for students who can't afford "fancier" models of test prep.  The proof is in the pudding as the founder is now at Harvard and recently partnered with <a href ="http://www.ck12.org/about/">CK-12 Foundation</a> . 

<b>Cons:</b>
The above benefit of low-barrier technology may also turn-off students and educators used to more interactivity or who prefer video-based learning.  Additionally, the lack of adaptive technology definitely slows-down assessment as students have to calculate and then manually enter their final section scores into a "score projector" that will calculate their performance on the actual test.  This is fittingly good math practice!  

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As the EdLab continues to endeavor to develop online tools for learning, it is important to remember that income disparity plagues many learners throughout the country.  How technology helps to ameliorate these disparities can become unfairly secondary to the barriers that cost and available technological resources can create.  

<b>Our Takeaways:</b>
Cost, available technology and the correspondent development emphasis that we give to new tools should be balanced with the desired game-changing impact.  Sometimes all students really need is a virtual "pencil" when we feel that a future-focused digital pen is what they should have.
