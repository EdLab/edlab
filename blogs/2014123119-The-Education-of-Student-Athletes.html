          <p>
            It is widely known that college teams and their athletes serve as brand endorses for many of the top programs in the country. However, the whole notion of student-athlete has taken a considerable hit due to recent scandals. Some student athletes enroll in courses regarded as "easy classes." Additionally, some student athletes also have the notion that they are in school only to play sports. As a result, some aim at passing their courses just to be eligible for their teams.
<p>
A recent <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2014/1223/Amid-bowl-game-hoopla-What-about-education" target = "blank">report</a> indicated that athletic scholarships are seen as a way to compensate student athletes for playing. If indeed student athletes are being paid to play, I believe it becomes obligatory for them to study and they should not receive any favors from professors just because they play sports. Others argue that student athletes should be given the opportunity to play the sport of their choice full time for the college without taking any classes. After their playing days are over, others believe they should be granted a full scholarship to complete their degrees at the same college.
