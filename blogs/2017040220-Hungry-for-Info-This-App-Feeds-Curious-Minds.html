<p>Have you ever found yourself wandering from one Wikipedia page to the next, insatiably collecting bits of trivia and unusual facts until it feels like your mind is full to capacity with random information? If so, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/curiosity-daily-facts-knowledge-discovery/id1000848816?mt=8">Curiosity</a> might just be your new favorite app. It curates the most interesting information on the web so that you can learn about things you never knew existed, but now don’t know what you’d do without. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Each day, Curiosity shares five new articles with its users ranging across almost any topic you can think of. Most articles focus on new research, obscure historical facts, unique initiatives, or interesting places to explore. Each article provides a few paragraphs of information on the topic, a section explaining why they’ve chosen to cover it, and several related videos. While some of the information seems hard to believe, each article is well sourced, containing links to the original information.</p>
 
<p>The best part of exploring this app is the sheer <i>interestingness</i> of the information. For instance, I learned that Webster’s dictionary accidentally <a href="https://curiosity.com/topics/websters-dictionary-invented-a-new-word-by-accident-curiosity/">published a fake word</a> for 13 years before someone caught the mistake. (You lived a good life, <i>dord</i>.) I also learned a piece of history that made my math-loving bones shiver with distress: there once was a man in Indiana who <a href="https://curiosity.com/topics/happy-pi-day-how-pi-was-almost-legally-changed-to-32-curiosity/">tried to legally redefine pi</a> as 3.2 instead of 3.141529…, etc. And yes, feel free to use that fact at the next dinner party you attend.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While you can sift through articles by either day or subject, Curiosity does not contain a search feature for specific inquiries. Because of this, you can search for articles in the category </i>universe</i>, but would be unable to search for information on a specific planet or galaxy. In addition, Curiosity does not offer an individualized curation plan. Although I appreciate this because it expands my knowledge in avenues I usually neglect, people who prefer receiving daily news curated specifically according to their tastes will be less-than-pleased.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>As a trivia-loving, former-quiz-team-captaining seeker of unusual facts, I loved the information I found on Curiosity. The articles were thoughtful, well written and researched, and interesting enough to elicit many audible <i>wows</i> (as my coworkers can attest). Although the lack of a direct search feature does negatively affect how I use the app, overall Curiosity is one that I’ll be keeping on my phone for subway rides and coffee breaks.</p>
