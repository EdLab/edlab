<b>Title:</b> The Effect of Technology-Supported, Student-Centered Instruction on Seventh Grade Students’ Learning in English/Language Arts
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Terri Simpson & Sanghoon Park
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://www.editlib.org/p/48467"> Society for Information Technology & Teacher Education International Conference (SITE) 2013</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Pedagogical solutions offered for the ongoing supposed crisis in schooling, particularly among low-scoring students, tend to break down into two categories. The focus tends to be either on the potential of introducing new technologies in the classroom, or on implementing a more innovative teaching method. Studies examining those solutions tend to be similarly siloed into one category or the other.
<p>
This study looks at whether there is a synergistic effect when new technologies are introduced in conjunction with a new style of teaching.  The authors took two separate English classes, of similar achievement levels, and in one class implemented a novel "student-centered technology-based" teaching plan, which involves targeting lessons at individual students based on their progress, while allowing them to determine the method and timing of their lessons. These 100-minute, 5 times a week lessons were managed through the Blackboard system, allowing for the individualized attention required by the plan. 
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Analyzing the change in scores on basic English and language arts achievement tests, the authors found a statistically significant difference in scores between the students given the "student-centered technology-based" curriculum, and those enrolled in a regular class. The gap in average scores wasn’t large, and it is unclear whether the effect was large enough to justify the resources used in creating it.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
Any study touting increased student achievement should require extensive replication before any policy decisions are made, but these results are encouraging. We don’t yet have a good grasp on the potential effects of new technologies for cheaply and efficiently delivering personalized instruction to our students, instead of forcing them to endure the traditional one size fits all factory model, but the future looks bright.  Expect many more studies like this one in the near future.
