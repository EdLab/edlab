Sajan George is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.matchbooklearning.com/">Matchbook Learning</a>, a national nonprofit charter school turnaround management organization. George’s entire career has been involved in turnarounds, first with large corporations, then large urban school districts, and now individual schools. Prior to founding Matchbook Learning, he was a Managing Director with Alvarez & Marsal where he led their education practice and was instrumental in turning around entire K–12 public school districts in St. Louis, New Orleans, New York City, Washington D.C., and Detroit, among other major cities.
 
<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Matchbook Learning?</b><br>
<p>I have spent my entire career doing turnarounds. Originally it was with corporate turnarounds, helping turnaround companies in crisis. I then did turnarounds with districts, applying my turnaround skills to large urban school districts. Finally, in 2011, I launched Matchbook Learning to apply those turnaround skills to individual failing schools. The arc of my career has always been turnarounds and it shapes my work and belief at Matchbook Learning that every child, regardless of their background, deserves a chance to succeed academically at the highest levels and that even the most challenging school situations have hope. </p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Matchbook Learning will change the way students learn?</b><br>
<p>Personalization is the lever by which we reach every student. Personalizing learning by content, experience, pace, and goals will enable every student to be motivated to learn and enjoy what they are learning. Motivation and passion will change every student every time. We just need to get better in how we design and systemize for this effect. </p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>There are two broad trends I see that will have the most impact on learning. As content and assessments are moving online (e.g., schools and districts are rapidly discontinuing the purchase of textbooks and paper based assessments), we're building massive amounts of data, profiles, and potential useable research to affect how students consume, manage, and produce information into knowledge. Technology will continue to democratize where and how students learn what they desire to learn. This will reshape how we think about school buildings, school teachers, and their respective purposes. There will be a wider proliferation of choices in how students prepare for the world. </p>
 
<p>Not only is the way that students prepare changing, but that world that they are preparing for is also changing and has already changed dramatically. Millennials currently have four different jobs before the age of 32 and 10 different jobs by the age of 40. Even if they slow down after 40, it is quite conceivable that the average person now will hold between 12 and 15 different jobs over a lifetime. This means that the actual content you absorbed in your early schooling years is rapidly becoming obsolete. What does become important is the ability or competence to search, find, and apply yourself in a new job context. This entrepreneurial skill cuts across industries and is no longer confined to technology start-ups. The ability to pitch an idea, bring it to fruition, fund it, and scale the concept for individual success may be the only job skill that is not easily outsourced or automated. Entrepreneurship is the industry of our future that we should be preparing for. Not all of us will start our own businesses, but all of us will need to get used to work that looks and feels like defined projects with shorter timelines and higher risk and reward profiles than we are used to. </p>
 
<p><b>What were some initial challenges in starting Matchbook Learning and how did you overcome them?</b><br>
<p>Matchbook Learning is prototyping its personalized learning platform <i>Spark</i> with a non-Matchbook Learning school in Washington, DC, Orr Elementary school. We plan to test the idea whether in a school we do not run ourselves or one we partner with. We hope to meet students that are often behind their more affluent grade level peers right where they are academically. Then we hope to help them progress on what they need to know in a mastery based manner. At the same time, we plan to expose them to grade level rigorous content so that they both fill their specific academic gaps while simultaneously closing their broader academic gaps with the demands of our twenty-first-century society. </p>
