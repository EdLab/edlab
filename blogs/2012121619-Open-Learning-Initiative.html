<i>Improvement in post secondary education will require converting teaching from a solo sport to a community based research activity.</i> (<a href="http://oli.cmu.edu/get-to-know-oli/learn-more-about-oli/">Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon</a>)

<b>Endless Feedback Loops </b> 
<br>
Combining domain experts with software engineers, learning scientists and human computer interaction experts, the team at Carnegie Mellon University’s, <a href="http://oli.cmu.edu/">Open Learning Initiative</a> (OLI), seeks to create effective, adaptive learning environments for higher education.   Grounded in the most up-to-date learning science and data gathered over the past decade through the OLI learning platform, the initiative is striving to combine research with technology to ultimately make education more inexpensive and effective.  Through their adaptive platform developed in 2002, OLI utilizes learner and educator feedback loops to create "just-in-time" opportunities for reinforcement and formative assessment.  The OLI platform provides learners with tips and hints when incorrect answers are given and quickly advances to a higher difficulty level once multiple right answers are provided, thereby ensuring that users are fully challenged and engaged.  Students are also given suggestions from the platform, based on their performance, to help them to study more effectively.  Educators, have a dedicated dashboard that tracks learner metrics and provides the insight necessary to help adapt delivery of course content.  Developed to be used both during independent study and in preparation for class work, the OLI approach has been found to help make coursework more efficient and ultimately cheaper to deliver.  In 2010, OLI was given funding to test the platform to help level the "playing field" at community colleges and allow students with a wide range of backgrounds to all catch-up to one another.  The <a href="http://oli.cmu.edu/learn-with-oli/see-our-free-open-courses/">current courses</a> offered through the OLI platform are free or low-cost and include over a dozen subjects ranging from American English Speech to Statistical Reasoning.
<p>

<b>Leveling the Playing Field</b>
<br>
CMU has created a division of OLI devoted to supporting Community Colleges (CC-OLI).  CMU hopes CC-OLI will facilitate a "25% higher rate of course completion for students from vulnerable populations, with a focus on gatekeeper courses critical to graduation success."  As in the classic OLI adaptive learning initiative, students in community colleges are given the same benefit of greater course personalization, reinforcement and analytics.  However, for CC-OLI the program proposes the formation of a consortium of community colleges dedicated to making this program a success and uniting all-too-often disparate groups.  CC-OLI courses are still under development, but four courses with traditionally high attendance rates and low-levels of success are currently being piloted.  These courses include Introductory-level Statistics, Anatomy & Physiology, Biology and Psychology.  The group hopes that in the next three years the program will expand to 40 community college partners and 100 classrooms.  Funded by CMU, state agencies and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among others, this initiative paired with OLI’s core offerings could not come at a better time.  As the US Bureau of Labor statistics predicts, "At least 57% of job openings in the United States between 2006 and 2016 will require some postsecondary education."  Thanks to the Open Learning Initiative students across a wide range of higher education institutions have a better chance of becoming ideal job candidates, instead of unemployment statistics.
