Everything in this world costs money, does it not? All those optimists that claim “love don't cost a thing” and “money cannot buy true happiness” although technically are right, are also lying to themselves. Love might not cost a thing on its own, but dates sure do, and the road to romancing and wooing a lady sure does take a lot from your pockets. True happiness cannot be bought but the thought of piles of things you might own with that money does make a few of us glitter from our eyes and tingle way down to our toes. So needless to say “money makes the world go round.” 
<P> 

In our money oriented world and culture, have we lost track of our morals? Take for instance higher learning. Knowledge is admirable, and a noble thing to seek, yet how can we put a price on it? Of course cost of books, paper, materials, all the things that surround us have a price, but it is blatantly clear that we as students are being robbed blind! Tuition costs in every college around the nation are sky rocketing, especially private, but also even in state institutions! 
<P>

Encouraging the youth of America to attend college is one thing, but for those of middle and lower middle class families, higher learning is harder to accomplish then ever before. Face it, we are not a country of rich fat pampered brats, hmmm… wait a minute let me rephrase, that did sound a little ironic. The majority of the population in our country is not made up of elite and prestigious socialites, who live off of large sum inheritances we are entitled to receive once our parents have kicked the bucket. So attending a college that cost upwards of $30,000 a year is practically committing suicide.  
<P>
They say that the majority of Americans will die with debt. Yet I don't see much help from the education department. Can someone explain to me what exactly costs $30,000 a year? Okay so some of you might be saying $30,000 a year is not much, so let's do the math. $30,000 times the number of students in that particular university, and those are just the minimum costs, not including the profit made by school cafeterias and bookstores. So let's say hypothetically that this university has only a small number of constituents (500) the result would still be 15,000,000 DOLLARS not including the profit made by campus businesses. And to be honest, I highly doubt the pay off of being a professor is THAT great, especially given their attitudes in class. 
<P>
I'm no idiot; we all know that office supplies, insurance costs, maintenance fees and employee salaries and benefits etc. are needed to run these institutions. No one is denying that these all have costs, however if our money indeed is going to places and things required to keep our facilities running then why are we not given reports of where our money is being spent? If we think of this world as all material possessions, then we can think in terms of paying then receiving a service or goods. But then–subtracting the costs mentioned above–how much are we paying for our minds to be enlightened and filled with knowledge. And further, if we are just paying customers, then why can't we go back to the registrars' office and state the fact that we are not pleased with the results of our education and simply complain until our money has been returned to us. It's not like college is a “if not completely satisfied money back guaranteed!” Although I do wish this was the case.  
<P>
More, if we are thinking of college as a corporation with shares and us students as corporation owners who are investing our money into it, shouldn't we have a say in where our money is being spent? Or if we don't have a say at least given the knowledge of where exactly our money is going. I believe that although the higher education system has the right to charge a fee and tuition for things needed for it to properly function, making a greater profit off of a less than affordable society is just wrong. It's funny how students like me are being royally screwed so that my low income family with a single working mother has to pay a majority of my tuition, while athletes and students with families who have greater income are awarded greater scholarships and work study.  
<P>
With the upcoming election my advice to candidates are to appeal to the younger generation. Topics that are important to us as are more aid for those wanting to attend college, or at least some restrictions on the amount universities can charge students for yearly tuition. Because I sure as hell do not want to be paying off my college loans until the age of 45, and wishing I had a life. 

Recently Congress has finally voted to give benefits to students who have taken out private loans and are working to lower interest rates for these loans. However this is only the beginning, there should be further more concern for freeing up money so that we can pursue these dreams! Unlike our dear mister President who believes that this is more like welfare and plans to disregard such bills.

PS: Thank you so much President Bush for looking out for us average Americans. *thumbs up* 
I'm so glad that now that you cannot run for another term you are planning to royally screw over the future of our nation. KUDOS to YOU!
