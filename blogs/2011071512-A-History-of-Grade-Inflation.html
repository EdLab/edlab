          <p>
            An article about grade inflation published yesterday in Teachers College Record has attracted <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/the-history-of-college-grade-inflation/">a</a> <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/as-represent-43-percent-of-grades-on-average-at-colleges-report-says/34583">lot</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/college-inc/post/easy-a-study-finds-43percent-of-grades-are-a/2011/07/14/gIQAO67oEI_blog.html">of</a> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2011-07-14-college-grades-analysis_n.htm">media</a> <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2011/07/chart-its-easier-ever-get-good-grades-college/39986/">attention.</a> The paper looks at the percentages of letter grades handed out by colleges over the past few decades, and states that since 1960 the number of A-range grades awarded at American universities has increased by 28 percentage points. The paper also concludes that while 15% of grades awarded in 1960 were A's, 43% are today. 

The authors, noted opponents of grade inflation (here is Stuart Rojstaczer's <a href="http://gradeinflation.com/">website</a>), argue that the increase in A-range grades results from a consumer-focused approach to education, where professors see the professional benefits in handing out A's such as better reviews from students, which can lead to tenure in a competitive market. Students are "customers" and higher grades lead to better customer satisfaction, which in turn results in better outcomes for the professor and a better reputation for the school. The authors of the paper (which is available online <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=16473">here</a>) also make the conclusion that grades in the American university system are no longer meaningful, and the lack of distinction among students who all get A's and B's will lead to more testing and other measures to determine student performance among those applying to graduate and professional schools.  

At Columbia, students in Columbia College (unlike those in SEAS, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) receive a extra surprise on their transcript along with their grades. When I needed a copy of my transcript to renew my non-driver ID (city dwellers, unite!), I saw the percentage of A-range grades awarded in each class listed next to each letter grade. This measure, I learned, was put in place supposedly to combat grade inflation. Apparently, professors would be less likely to give out too many A's if anyone who needed a student's  transcript could see how easy or difficult that A grade was. Although I had heard my professors mention in class that they get scolded by the administration for giving out too many A's, in the majority of my classes over 50% of the class grades were A's (one was as high as 89%). 

I'm not sure if my professors even know this number is on our transcripts, and wonder if they would care, since grade inflation seems to still be happening and this measure is not new. I also know many professors who are aware of the policy but have defended the amount of A's they give--in one of my smaller seminars, the professor mentioned that he was prepared to be challenged in giving most of us A's but he really believed many of us had worked hard and produced excellent work over the course of the semester. In the end, I'm really not sure about this policy's effectiveness, as professors seem to want to grade the way they grade while students will be stuck with the consequences anytime anyone looks at their transcript.
