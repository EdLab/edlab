<a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/blog/public-policy/2015/01/digital-divide-not-binary">Some surprising new research</a> suggests that the most common stranger to technology isn’t the person who can’t have it, but the person who doesn’t want it. Findings like this represent opportunities for community leaders to encourage students to explore digital innovation, especially when job preparedness for some of the fastest growing markets depends upon tech literacy. </p>

<p>In a place like Delaware where <a href="https://www.dtcc.edu/about/college-initiatives/cirwa/labor-market-studies">STEM job growth projections are surging</a>, bridging the digital divide has special meaning. An initiative like <a href="http://www.mclf.org/boss.htm">Beating Odds Studying STEM (B.O.S.S.)</a>, a volunteer-run after-school program, is one creative example of how philanthropists, educators, and business experts are teaming up to demystify the sciences for under-served kids. B.O.S.S. combines <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">coding lessons through Scratch</a> with workshops in entrepreneurship to educate students in the languages of computers and markets that flow so audibly in tandem in the world they’re bound to encounter. B.O.S.S. kids get the chance to build real-world programs and solve real-world problems with the digital skills and business tools that might have otherwise seemed beyond their reach.</p>

<p>By creating learning opportunities in practical technology and math, B.O.S.S. also reminds us that half the battle of teaching STEM is communicating its relevance. What other ways can we bridge the digital consciousness divide? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23233/">Share your thoughts on Vialogues.</a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:01 AbdulMalik:</b> Most students (myself included) remember almost every teacher who made learning fun. Students tend to remember more of what they learn in the classroom when they are engaged in several activities. Fun activities make students more proactive and this enhances the learning experience. </p>

<p><b>@01:35 melAIL8:</b> I really wished there were such clubs for me to partake in when I was a younger. I like the business part of the B.O.S.S. club, it would have helped me think critically, solving problems and even starting to build my own business.</p>

<p><b>@02:30 kingyoussef:</b> According to the Delaware STEM Council Report, the goal is to increase STEM literacy for all Delaware students including those who pursue non-STEM related careers, but still need STEM skills. </p>
