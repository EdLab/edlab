            In a recent online article in the <a href ="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/education/06houston.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=education">New York Times</a>, troubled public schools in Houston are the first to experiment with using teaching techniques from its neighboring charter schools. A charter school is a publicly funded independent school established by teachers, parents, or community groups under the terms of a charter with a local or national authority. Seeing the good results charter schools had, the Houston superintendent decided that instead of letting parents think that charter school is a better quality school for their children, why not try to replicate their way of teaching to get better results? And so the experiment, known as Apollo 20, began in Houston. Should this experiment succeed it will show that bad schools can be fixed.

An interesting part of the article are the five policies that are common among successful charters according to Dr. Fryer, an economist and head of Harvard's EdLabs. The five policies are: longer school days and years, more rigorous and selective hiring of principals and teachers, frequent quizzes whose results determine what needs to be retaught, what he calls “high-dosage tutoring”, and a “no excuses” culture. 

I agree with most of the policies, especially that frequent quizzes to determine what needs to be retaught. Most of the time if a student does poorly on a quiz or test, the teacher will not go back and show the student their mistakes, they will move on to the next topic. Also the “high dosage tutoring” is an important policy I strongly believe in, and the tutoring should be personalized to students' learning style. I am hoping that this experiment in Houston is a success, and that more schools will seriously look into new ways of improving, for the sake of our future.
