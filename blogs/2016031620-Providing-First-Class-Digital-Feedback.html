<p>Learners benefit from high-quality feedback. However, overworked professors who teach ever-increasing numbers of students have less time to provide individualized help than ever before. Fortunately, computer-based systems can improve the assessment process within post-secondary learning environments to meet this widening gap. </p>
 
<p>A study evaluated a digital assessment system based on educator and student perspectives. The study population was wide-ranging and included undergraduate and graduate participants, those in different size courses and different disciplines, and even teachers with different levels of experience. </p>

<p>The study found that students and faculty members obtained high-quality benefits from this feedback system. Educators marked faster and reduced the time it took to return student work. They also decreased marking errors, made feedback more consistent and readable, and appreciated the eco-friendliness of using less paper. Although responses were mainly positive, educators were neutral regarding ease of use, needing assistance, and quality of feedback. Some respondents took a lot of time to learn the system and believed this outweighed resulting efficiencies. </p>

<p>Students reported that they appreciated the readability of feedback and found it much better than assessments provided in other courses. They also liked that responses were timely, specific, detailed, and included a large quantity of feedback. Students found no significant drawbacks. A few respondents believed that the system’s layout could be improved and that it could offer embedded comments within documents. </p>
 
<p>The researchers concluded that if faculty members commit effort to training, they could use the system with success. This suggests that interested instructors should be provided with sufficient time and resources to learn how to provide highly personalized feedback when using digital assessment systems. </p>
 
<p>This study is important because class sizes at all levels may increase as education budgets plateau or shrink. As processing power increases, device prices drop, and computers improve in their ability to collect and analyze information, feedback can become increasingly individualized to improve educational experiences for all learners. Finally, as a cross-study analysis of feedback in computer-based learning environments showed, <a href="http://rer.sagepub.com/content/85/4/475.full.pdf+html/">providing detailed feedback improves student learning outcomes</a> more than simply providing a correct answer. This suggests that feedback systems that allow in-depth assessment have substantial potential for improving student learning on a larger scale. </p>
