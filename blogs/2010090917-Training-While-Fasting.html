          <p>
            During the beginning of this current Ramadan, I read <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5883577,00.html/">this article</a> about professional soccer players who observed the fast during the month. The physical activity required of these athletes along with fasting makes it a very difficult and strenuous task for the body to endure, especially during the hot summer days. As Ramadan would be occurring in the summer months for the next couple of years, exceptions have been made for these athletes to eat and drink on game days. 

<p>
As an athlete, I was at first very elated to hear this news because my school's preseason falls right in the middle of the month of Ramadan but I soon came to realize that the exceptions only applied to professional athletes. I began to wonder how I was going to handle three training sessions a day while keeping up with the fast. I've long had the experience of playing while fasting but this was the first time I would have to go through multiple training sessions in a day while fasting.</p> 

<p>
While contemplating on how to get around this burden, I came across an article about a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/highschool/news/story?id=5467167">Michigan High School football team</a> that holds preseason practices at night to accommodate its Muslim players. Since there are a few Muslims on my school's soccer team, I made a suggestion to the coach if we could follow a similar pattern but unfortunately adjustments couldn't be made due to the difficulty of acquiring permits for fields with flood lights. So I had no option but to go through a week of a very difficult training regiment.</p>

<p>
Even though it was a very challenging experience, I was able to get through it without any major health concerns but I'm certain that I've lost more that 10 pounds during in the process.</p>
