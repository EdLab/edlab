<p><a href="http://www.tripppin.com/">Tripppin</a> is an English learning game that follows two English teachers, Tripp and Pin, on their journey around the world. The game consists of a series of engaging videos shot on location that follow the story of the journey while introducing new vocabulary and knowledge. Tripppin works on web or mobile and seems like an entertaining and structured way to pick up some casual English phrases and sharpen language skills.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game is set up as a video story with quiz and interactive elements embedded in the action. The dialogue is slow and clear but touches on phrases and vocabulary that students may not have learned in a traditional classroom. The video production values could be higher, but Tripp and Pin’s infectious delight in teaching more than makes up for the occasionally tinny audio. Beyond the game narrative, Tripppin offers a language learning social network where users can connect with their friends, family, and teachers through video chat and collaborate on missions to advance in the game. Creating community on the site might help with retention, especially for users who have completed the narrative game.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The videos might be a bit cheesy for some users, though that is a common peril of second language learning. It would be helpful if video transcripts were available for beginning and intermediate students who might not catch all the spoken phrases. The unorthodox spelling of the site’s name also seems like a contradiction in mission, especially because it is pronounced "tripping" in the audio. Site use might increase with a name change to something more conducive to word of mouth and non-native English speaker web searching.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Tripppin seems like a good product for English language learners who are making the transition from formalized education to independent study. The site and directions are all in English and aimed at more advanced language learners, but the action and jokes seem to be aimed at a young adult audience. The challenging quizzes, fast-paced video, and social support on Tripppin place it in a unique niche for digital language learning tools; the site will not teach English from the ground up, but it’s exciting enough to help language learners retain and practice their classroom-taught skills.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Tripppin is appealing enough to inspire independent language study.</p>
