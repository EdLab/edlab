<i>Located in Silicon Valley, Draper University of Heroes is the brainchild of free-spirited venture capitalist Tim Draper, aka "The Riskmaster."  We are an unconventional world-class boarding school for the brightest young entrepreneurs from around the world. We built this school because the world needs more heroes.</i> (From the <a href="http://draperuniversity.com/about/#sthash.iiUwYq2U.dpuf">DraperU site</a>)

<b>Building Entrepreneurs from the Ground-up</b><br>
<a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1070">Tim Draper</a> has created a school to "build entrepreneurs from the ground up." <a href="http://draperuniversity.com/">Draper University of Heroes</a> is an 8-week "outside the box" residential and online learning experience for budding entrepreneurs.   Open to 18-25 year-olds, and focused on helping to create entrepreneurship focused "superheroes," the program strives to produce future leaders while helping to reimagine the future of entrepreneurship education.  Ignoring the classic "case study" approach taken in most traditional business schools, the program encourages participants to "learn by doing," try new things, take risks, and embrace failure.  Participants are expected to do this while working to create a new company and secure funding.  Draper is known as the "<a href="http://theriskmaster.blogspot.com/">Riskmaster</a>" and has even gone so far as to write a theme song that goes, "He is the Riskmaster, lives fast and drives faster..." And it is just this mentality of quickly innovating, taking calculated risks and "failing faster" that he hopes to instill in his graduates.  The website for DraperU seems to embody this "risk" in video clips of the founder and participants kayaking, go-karting, and participating in a wide variety of team-building outdoors activities.  
<p>
<b>"Venture Capital, Change in Entrepreneurship & School"</b><br>
The Draper University curriculum focuses on business design, creating vision, survival training, finance, and daily public speaking.  The program also encourages what Draper describes as "building freedom" around the world and "working really hard."  Draper even feels that this program can help to "build progress" in fields ranging from medicine to space exploration. Combining unique program speakers, a superhero, and "heroes journey" narrative with mentorship, networking, and the opportunity to pitch ideas to leading venture capitalists is a unique roster of experiences meant to encourage innovative outside-the-box thinking.  Past participants have described the program as "encouraging the crazy thoughts and ideas" and make the claim that "this is what you need as an entrepreneur."  While innovative and unique, the program is not free.  Clocking-in at $9,500 for fall semester alone, (room, board, meals, activities and more are included) the program might be cost prohibitive for most unemployed young people.  However, the program does offer scholarships and makes the unusual (yet fitting) offer to applicants of putting their education on "layaway" (paying back a percentage with their salary over ten years), paying with <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> and "making an offer."  All very fitting for the entrepreneurship school of the future.  It will be interesting to discover how and why this program is able to provide a viable, effective alternative to an expensive, time-consuming MBA, or even an incubator/accelerator program.
