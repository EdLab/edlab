<p>Alvin Crawford is the CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1S4T0KJ">Knowledge Delivery Systems (KDS)</a>, an organization that provides professional development assistance for blended and online learning in K–12 classrooms. Before KDS, Alvin spent nearly a decade at SchoolNet, where he built educational software for school districts. He has also worked at Zentropy Partners, Ogilvy One, and Digitas. He holds a B.S. from Tufts University and an MBA from the Wallace E. Carroll Graduate School of Management at Boston College with a Certificate in Change Management. We asked him a few questions about his background and his take on the direction of personalized learning.</p>

<p><b>How have your past professional experiences shaped your current work?</b><br>
<p>Out of college, I owned a community newspaper and then worked at the Center for Corporate Community Relations, a corporate social responsibility think tank. My understanding of the challenges with inner city communities and education started in the late 1980s. In business school, I earned a Leadership for Change Certificate along with my MBA. At the time, there was an emerging movement about doing well by doing good. I knew that the internet was where I wanted to focus, and my early internet experiences, in the late 1990s, were working at big interactive agencies helping big corporations understand how to leverage the internet to grow their business and create better operational efficiencies. A good friend and colleague introduced me to edtech in 1999 and I haven’t looked back.</p>
 
<p><b>What impact do you think your work will have on the future of learning?</b><br>
<p>The teacher in the classroom is the #1 in-school factor that affects student achievement. Despite the rhetoric, school districts and the education industry have done very little to change professional development and research suggests they have had little to no impact on teacher knowledge or student achievement outcomes. Yet, most research estimates that we spend $10-20,000/teacher per year on PD. By focusing on improving the experience and outcomes of professional learning for teachers at a system level, I hope to help districts develop and retain teachers who can support the needs of all students. Using technology to support teacher development on both a formal and informal basis can allow teachers to have a personalized learning experience and reach their full potential.</p> 

<p><b>What trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
If done well, personalized learning can be a transformative approach to individualizing instruction. It still requires the teacher to understand the approach and create an environment where students can thrive. Competency based education is a game changer for both K–12 and higher education. For too long the focus has been on the degree or the Carnegie hour, rather than the competencies that the learner has developed. In today’s dynamic workplace, we need to make sure that the notion of college and career is competency based. Finally, for K–12, one of the most exciting trends is the move away from teacher evaluation as the core activity of districts. What gets measured gets done. Unfortunately, there was little emphasis on improvement in that model. We need to be focused on developing people in order for them to improve. I know it’s a strange concept, but learning happens when the focus is on development. It doesn’t when the emphasis is on measurement. Critics argue that measurement is critically important. I agree. Any good support system measures progress to ensure that there is continuous improvement.  The emphasis though, is improving the development rather than the efficacy of the measurement.   

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>We are just finishing a socially collaborative space for teachers that we affectionately call, MyEdGuru.  It mixes the notion of Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn into a closed educator community. As for new projects, we are beginning to dive deep into competency based models and the packaging of credentials into certifications and other stackable units that align to traditional and non-traditional incentive structures. In the past, earning a Masters Degree earned you salary points in education. We believe that more effective skills in challenge areas or areas of focus should earn you more points and create more effective teachers. The incentive lanes in K–12 education need to strategically align with the needs of the children the system supports. This approach should have a transformative effect on spending and on the outcomes for students.</p>
