            Imagine how the world would be if great devices like the iPhone, iPad, Samsung Galaxy, or any other tablet didn't exist in the market. Great minds like Steve Jobs, has helped our generation to progress and go beyond our imaginations. Consequently, this has also brought competition to the market to help the economy function properly and avoid any form of monopoly. Before many of the other devices came into the market, Apple was the top earner in the mobile device market. After getting the attention of consumers with the iPod, Apple went ahead and created the first generation of iPhones, which further generated interest in its products. The first iPhone was big, heavy, and the best of all, it was a touch screen phone. After reigning as the industry's top seller, Apple soon encountered a competition. 

One of Apple's main competitors became Samsung, whose Galaxy phone has become a direct rival to Apple's iPhone. As we all know, the Galaxy has about four to five different models. The competition between these two companies is very intense that it almost caused the ban of selling of Apple products. According to this <a href"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/obama-administration-overturns-ban-on-apple-products/?src=me">article</a>, the Obama administration vetoed a federal commission's ban that would have stopped Apple from selling some iPhones and iPads in the United States. The United States International Trade Commission believed that Apple had violated a patent that Samsung owned related to transmission of data over cellular networks. In other words, Samsung claims that Apple has not paid fees for its patents. To read more about this, you can click on the article and feel free to share your thoughts. I just cannot imagine what would have happened if this ban had gone through and was not vetoed.
