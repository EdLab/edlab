            Below are some of the "pet projects" that I am currently thinking about that I can work on at the EdLab.  Please let me know your honest thoughts about this, as I encourage your comments.

1 + Increasing International Consulting Services in the EdLab

This would involve working with Hui Soo to focus on consulting with international educational organizations in creating solutions for connecting with each other easily (virtually).  Upon graduating from TC, I am possibly looking to go into International Educational Consulting, so this would provide a win-win situation for TC, the EdLab and myself.

2 + Innovative Use of Mobile Devices as an Educational Tool (mLearning)

When I look around in class, I am usually the only student who is utilizing a laptop in class for notes, examples and research.  There are many reasons to this, most notably the cost of purchasing and maintaining a laptop computer.  After class, I see everyone looking at their cell phones and sending/checking messages, browsing the Internet or some other form of mobile communication.

The question becomes, "How can we leverage this already established social network in an educational setting?"

It seems that tackling this would be an innovative way to present a new approach to facilitate learning in the classroom.

3 + Create Interactive Portfolio for Media Design Group

I have been casually speaking with Ian in the Media Design Group about the possibilities of creating an interactive portfolio for his personal work and for the Media Design Group.  The idea is that, similar to the need for an EdLab and CSG site, the Media group can showcase their work in a truly interactive manner that puts their innovations in the public eye and fosters growth for new projects and visibility for the MDG and EdLab.

Too many times I have seen great design work that is either not put up for public view or published in a manner that minimizes the impact of the work itself.  This collaboration with TSI and MDG would create more than just a single project; it will serve to build a stronger alliance of the EdLab, a truly diverse perspective of the projects that we create and the elimination of borders between groups.

Thoughts?
