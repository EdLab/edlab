          <p>
            The New York Times seems to think so in its Friday article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/technology/11computing.html?_r=1&hp">Computer Studies Made Cool, on Film and Now on Campus</a> 

The popular major for those inspired by egotistical characters from award-winning movies seemed to be economics for the longest period of time, and business or finance if a college offered such majors. Even those who did not major in economics, finance, or business ended up aspiring to work on Wall Street, whether they were English or civil engineering majors. Now not everyone wanted to be Gordon Gekko specifically and I'm sure not everyone wants to be Mark Zuckerberg, but both movies have portrayed these two characters as people who live desirable lives. This trend might go beyond TSN but it still serves as a symbol to an underlying trend toward STEM and computer science more specifically.

From my experience as a Columbia University student, this trend seems to be coming to fruition here as well. Acceptance rates for Columbia's engineering school are quickly catching up with acceptance rates for Columbia College (liberal arts and sciences). Columbia changed the name of its engineering school from The Fu Foundation School for Engineering and Applied Science to Columbia Engineering, seemingly to place both schools on more equal footing.

On the whole, even if my idealistic compsci friends have to put it up with more Zuckerberg-wannabes, this should still be viewed as a positive development. Society's most powerful inventions and innovations, with respect to benefiting the general welfare over these past 60 years, have come from engineering, not finance.
