<p><i>"Global Kids, Inc. - the premier nonprofit educational organization for global learning and youth development - works to ensure that urban youth have the knowledge, skills, experiences and values they need to succeed in school, participate effectively in the democratic process, and achieve leadership in their communities and on the global stage."</i> (via <a href="http://www.globalkids.org/">Global Kids</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalkids.org/">Global Kids</a> leverages "peer education, social action, digital media, and service-learning" to enact global change.  To accomplish this goal, Global Kids has both onsite programs and online programs. The onsite programs take place in and after school in Washington D.C. and New York City. Global Kids participants visit and live in areas where their race or culture is under-represented. Global Kids prepares students for this responsibility through intensive programs for everything from global leadership to policy. In this way, Global Kids helps students to become informal change-makers in their community now and prepares them to work towards equality and representation in their future careers.</p>

<p><b>Global Citizens, Local Learning</b><br>
Global Kids' flagship afterschool program is <i>Power of Citizenry</i> which trains students in "leadership skills, understanding of global issues, and exposure to higher education and career readiness opportunities." This program reaches over 500 students annually. The keystone of the <i>Power of Citizenry</i> program is peer learning and every year participants help spread their knowledge to over 5,000 other students across the globe. The program has had events in Costa Rica, Croatia, Denmark, Eritrea, Haiti, Kenya, Northern Ireland, Peru, and South Africa.  Founded by Carole Artigiani in 1989, Global Kids has already worked with over 120,000 students.</p>

<p><b>Beating the Odds</b><br>
Through its onsite and online programs, Global Kids aims to prepare students to lead in a sustainable and healthy future. The programs focuses on educating students about international affairs and preparing them for success with 21st century skills. This kind of preparation has proven to be a winning mix. Although participants are drawn from low performing schools, over 96% attend college. Many participants receive additional funding and go on to become leaders in their communities and industries.</p>
