<b>Title:</b> The Role of Feedback in E-Assessments for Engineering Education (2012)
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Maria Limiou & Michael Smith
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10639-012-9200-5#page-1">Education and Information Technologies</a>
<p>
<b> Research Question:</b> Does increased access to feedback improve the performance of undergraduate engineering students?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Although feedback can be an incredibly effective way for students to learn and improve, the traditional classroom offers few opportunities to provide students with a sense of what they’re doing right or wrong in their projects. Furthermore, when they do receive feedback (e.g., a grade on a test), it’s often long after they’ve completed the relevant learning unit.
<p>
For this study, the authors wanted to test whether different methods of providing students with feedback might affect how well and how quickly the students learned. To do so, they had a group of engineering professors and PhD students develop a series of e-assessments (online tests, involving a mix of multiple choice, true/false, and short answer questions) to be offered to a group of undergraduate engineering students. These undergraduate students were divided into two groups, each of about 100 students, differing only in the kinds of feedback they would be provided. The control group was only given a grade when submitting answers to an e-assessment, and told which were the correct answers. In addition, they could only submit their answers to the e-assessment questions once. The experimental group was given much more extensive feedback as to why an answer might be correct or incorrect, and students in that group were allowed to attempt an e-assessment question as many times as they liked.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
A post-course questionnaire provided to the subjects indicated that the control group felt the lack of feedback and, unlike the experimental group, didn’t find the e-assessment system to be a useful learning tool. Neither did they find the e-assessment system to be a motivator to study harder or to develop a better understanding of the course material.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
Although it’s useful to survey students on how they feel about a learning tool, this study unfortunately didn’t attempt to analyze whether student learning actually benefited under either condition. There is an opportunity for future research to confirm (or disprove) the common-sense hypothesis that better, more targeted feedback can help students develop a stronger grasp of the material, and furthermore whether the learning gains from such a system justify the required investments.
