            “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sometimes I think that what we want to make possible is the living of lyrical moments, moments at which human beings (freed to feel, to know, and to imagine) suddenly understand their own lives in relation to all that surrounds</span>.” -- Maxine Greene

I feel excited about the on-going Teaching of Writing class I am taking. The recent keynote was about the power of poetry writing.  

The following is an example of a daily poetry writing that happened at the Bancroft Building:

Clouds move gently
Under the blue sky
An old building
Stands there
For decades
It has a red and blue roof
With delicate carvings
At the base of each window
Moving shadows are reflected
On the glass
In the color of sunset

Poetry gives children a new way to look at the world and transform pictures in their minds into words. Some teachers think that the teaching of poetry should happen in secondary schools. However, poetry writing actually can be tried by elementary students, too. 

Teaching of poetry is an indispensable part of aesthetic education. Maxine Greene (2001, <span style="font-style: italic;">Variations on a Blue Guitar: The Lincoln Center Institute Lectures on Aesthetic Education</span>) defines aesthetic education as “<span style="font-weight: bold;">an intentional undertaking designed to nurture appreciative, reflective, cultural, participatory engagements with the arts by enabling learners to notice what is there to be noticed, and to lend works of art their lives in such a way that they can achieve them as variously meaningful.</span>” 

Teaching of poetry can happen anywhere, not limited to space, time, and traditional formats of poetry writing. As Maxine Greene put in her book, which echoed aesthetic ideas given by a Chinese educator and artist named Zikai Feng in the 1930s, we as teachers should render students the capability of seeking beautiful moments in their daily life. The beautiful moments are moments that they can appreciate, share, reflect on, and write about. The beautiful moments can be found from regular scenes, such as patterns on an old wall, scenes through a classroom window, breeze felt after a thunderstorm in a scorching summer, a blossoming rose in the backyard, etc. 

A well-known example of beautiful moments found in daily life is the song <a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/thesoundofmusic/myfavoritethings.htm"><i>My Favorite Things</i></a> sung by Maria in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Sound of Music</span>. It is my favorite piece. I fell in love with it when I was a high school student learning English in China. 

Students will have “trained” eyes of looking for beauty in every corner of their lives. Yes! The beauty of life lies in the seemingly unchanged daily life (!), as said by the old idiom “Beauty is but in the eyes of the beholder”.
