<p>From child prodigy to MBE, Dr. Anne-Marie Imafidon is Head Stemette and co-founder of <a href="http://stemettes.org">Stemettes</a>, the award-winning social enterprise inspiring the next generation of females to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) via a series of prestigious events and opportunities.</p>

<p>One of the youngest people ever to be awarded a Master’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science by the University of Oxford, at age 20, Anne-Marie unsurprisingly continued to soar. In 2017 she was included in the BBC’s list of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41380265">100 inspirational and innovative women</a>, received a <a href="http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/entertainment/people/marie-claire-future-shapers-542684">Marie Claire Future Shaper</a> award, and was named the 7th Most Influential Woman in IT and one of the 50 most inspiring women in Europe by <a href="http://www.inspiringfifty.com/inspiring-fifty-europe-2017/">Inspiring Fifty</a>. In further recognition of her influence and achievements, Anne-Marie was awarded an MBE in the 2017 New Year’s Honours for services to young women and STEM sectors. As of June 2017, she is also an Honorary Fellow at Keble College, Oxford.</p>
<p>Not only a champion of getting women into STEM positions, Anne-Marie has previously worked with Goldman Sachs, Hewlett-Packard, and Deutsche Bank, amassing a wealth of experience. A recognized thought leader in the tech space, she has spoken at numerous prestigious keynote events, such as SXSW and Founders Forum, and to clients across the globe including Google, Mercedes-Benz, Lufthansa, and ASOS.</p>
<p><b>You have an amazing educational and professional history. How did those experiences prepare and inspire you to create Stemettes?</b><br> My formative years have shaped how I see myself and my personal sense of value. They also allowed me to have an unwavering passion for technology, to the point that I didn't even notice I was often the only girl. Part of my motivation for Stemettes was definitely rooted in giving similar opportunities to all kinds of girls, where they can explore whether they have these passions in a safe space and in an unencumbered environment.</p>
<p><b>What kind of impact do you hope Stemettes has on the national or global learning landscape?</b><br>
I'd love for us to fully shift a social norm: the one that says girls don't do technical things. So we'd see more women in STEM: in soaps, in the papers, as toys, and as part of national discourse. </p>

<p><b>How do you think current social movements will change learning in the years ahead, and what role does Stemettes play in that development?</b><br>
I'm hoping for a real digital revolution in our educational system and in the adult learning space, including exams completed digitally and more people accessing online platforms for learning. There is also so much about empowering people to learn themselves in ways that suit them, at times that suit them. Stemettes is certainly helping girls explore their options for learning, especially when they don't have the right kind of support already.</p>
 
<p><b>What other projects are you currently working on, whether new developments for Stemettes or something completely different?</b><br>
Our TV and book projects are quite different and have been a stretch for the team. It's all new territory that works very differently (and a lot slower) compared to what we're used to, but we're persevering because we know how much this will multiply and boost our impact. It'll also help us complete our mission.</p>
 
</p><b>Who else is doing work that inspires you?</b><br>
We love what the Liverpool Girl Geeks are up to, and also love the concept behind the Tech Talent Charter. Finally, Hollywood is doing so much in this space now that we may be able to call it a day sooner than we thought!</p>
