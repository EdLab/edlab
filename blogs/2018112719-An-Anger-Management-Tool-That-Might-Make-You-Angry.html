<p><a href="https://www.betterkids.education/#developing-emotional-intelligence-through-play">Better Kids</a> is an international company that aims to promote emotional intelligence through digital and physical play. Their first venture is Wisdom-Kingdom of Anger, an app designed for Pre-K through 2nd grade classrooms that combines ten minutes of digital play with a 30-minute lesson plan that reinforces the game’s content through hands-on group activities. The company is working on developing similar games for other primary emotions such as sadness, fear, and joy.</p>
 
<p>In Wisdom-Kingdom of Anger, the user is a young boy who stumbles into a land plagued by anger. By playing games, the user gains superpowers that help the inhabitants of the kingdom (who have human bodies but leaf or vegetable heads) release their anger. Superpowers include drawing the anger, roaring like a lion, and hugging a pillow. Once the inhabitant has calmed down, the user applies the appropriate reconciliation superpower to help connect the plant-person to something positive. Reconciliation superpowers include reading a book and singing your favorite song.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Wisdom-Kingdom of Anger offers a thoughtful combination of professional development courses and lesson plans with their app. When I signed up for a free trial, I received a sample lesson plan to accompany one of the games in the activity area. The game asks students to match various eyes and mouths to form angry faces. The lesson then involves students practicing angry and happy faces in pairs. The lesson plan includes references to the science behind facial expressions, including how muscles connect our eyes and mouth, and how emotions are contagious. Not only did the lesson connect well to the game, it was also easy to implement, and the research provided helpful background knowledge. While I did not practice the lesson with a class, I felt prepared to conduct this short activity and confident that it would enhance the knowledge students gained through the game. By supporting teachers with professional development and lesson plans, Better Kids makes important strides toward preparing educators to teach emotional intelligence skills.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While the individual games in Wisdom-Kingdom of Anger could pair well with classroom activities, the adventure within the game itself is confusing and frustrating. After earning superpowers by playing games, the user is asked to provide the appropriate superpowers to relieve the plant inhabitants of their anger. Each angry resident offers picture clues to help the user choose the right remedy. However, both the clues and the icons designating each superpower are fairly unclear. For example, the superpower "take a shower" is represented by a whirlpool icon. The clue to apply this icon is a red umbrella. If the user chooses the wrong superpower, she loses that power and has to earn it back by playing more games.</p> 

<p>Also, not all the superpowers the user has earned appear as remedy options. On more than one occasion, I earned the "take a shower" superpower but was unable to apply it because it did not appear in my list of options. These logistical limitations make the game frustrating and all-but-impossible to win. I was only able to relieve one plant-person of his anger. After over a dozen tries to apply the proper three remedies to the second livid leaf-man, I gave up, frustrated that I kept losing my superpowers because I didn’t understand the clues, and irritated that the superpowers I had earned were not appearing in my list of options. If I were considering purchasing this game, my free trial experience would convince me that it is not worth the <a href="https://www.betterkids.education/pricing/">cost</a>.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The support Wisdom-Kingdom of Anger offers teachers is rare and valuable, and the individual games in this app pair well with classroom lessons on understanding and managing anger. However, the game’s hefty price tag and lack of usability will give teachers and students plenty of frustrations to manage.</p>
