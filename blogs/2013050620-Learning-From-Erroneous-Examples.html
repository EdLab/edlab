<p><b>Title:</b> Erroneous examples: effects on learning fractions in a web-based setting (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Dimitra Tsovaltzi, Bruce M. McLaren, Erica Melis, & Ann-Kristin Meyer<p>
<p><b>Study Design: </b> Erroneous examples, where teachers use deliberately error-ridden examples as a pedagogic tool, are a controversial subject in education.  There are theoretical arguments for and against their use. </p>
<p>The authors of this study set out to test the effectiveness of erroneous examples by taking advantage of novel adaptive instruction techniques, which allow them to customize the amount and kind of erroneous examples provided in accordance with individual student characteristics.  As their test case, they take on fractions, a "core topic in middle school math curricula around the world," by dividing a few sets of volunteer students into control and experimental groups, and varying the amount of erroneous example instruction offered across groups. </p>
<p><b>Findings: </b> The small sample size didn’t give this study a lot of statistical power, and the results were mixed.  Although using erroneous examples in the classroom did seem to help produce more learning, these effects were strongly dependent on the qualities of the class in which the erroneous examples were applied.  In particular, the tool was more useful for older students, and when focusing student attention on conceptual issues. 
<p><b>Moving Forward: </b>

More than anything else, what this study emphasizes is the necessity of developing a more fine-grained understanding of our learning tools.  What we think a tool’s effect might be in the aggregate, if applied over an entire student population, can be very different from its effect on individual students.  With pedagogical techniques like erroneous examples, which can potentially have harmful, as well as beneficial effects, the necessity of developing individualized applications is even more apparent. <p>
