Alex Kelly is Director of <a href="https://www.unifrog.org/">Unifrog</a>, an online platform that connects students to university programs and apprenticeships, while allowing teachers to track their progress. He founded the national education charity, <a href="http://www.theaccessproject.com/index.php/home/">The Access Project</a>, which he ran for five years before co-founding Unifrog. He has advised U.K. Secretaries of State for Education on topics ranging from initial teacher training to what the best international school systems can teach the U.K. He previously taught high school English.

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Unifrog?</b><br>
<p>My first job was teaching in an inner city school in north London. I struggled with classroom management and wasn't a great teacher, but one of my classes was a top set group of 12-year-olds and I found teaching them a joy. I was only 21-years-old and very naive, but I was convinced that these students should have been able to go on one day to study in top universities. The problem was that the school didn't have a strong history of sending students on to selective universities. This inequality of access to education is a serious problem in the U.K. and across much of the world, and the issue has kept me fired up ever since. I started Unifrog to address one factor that contributes to education inequality: different amounts of support for students from different backgrounds during the process of progression from secondary to higher or further education. Unifrog is making it easier for students from any background to find and apply for the best next step for them after high school.<p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Unifrog will change the way students pursue college admissions and internships?</b><br>
<p>We support students with every step of the process from working out what their interests are, to shortlisting opportunities, to writing successful applications. We also support high schools with everything from planning their guidance, to recording what they've delivered to students, and then using their destinations data to improve their practice. In this way we aim to be a one-stop shop for both parties. We also want to be a one-stop shop in terms of allowing students to compare every post high school opportunity, wherever it is in the world, and whether it's university, an apprenticeship, or an online course.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think the imminent impact of AI on jobs will mean young people will need to think very hard about how their education will prepare them for successful adulthood. There might be some surprising effects. For example, in countries that implement Universal Basic Income, perhaps more people will want to study purely for the pleasure of learning.<p> 

<p><b>What are the future plans for Unifrog?</b><br>
<p>We are focused on becoming the one-stop shop for post high school destinations: supporting students and teachers with every step of the journey, for every progression route, and for opportunities all over the world. This mission will keep us busy for a while! One of the challenges we've set ourselves is that as the platform becomes more sophisticated, we are trying to make using it feel simpler. For both students and teachers, we want the complex process of post high school progression to be joyful.<p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
I don't have a Twitter account! But I really enjoy talking about the future of education with friends of mine who work in the sector, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/EdFidoe">Ed Fidoe</a>, who has started a high school from scratch and is now working on starting a new university, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_TAP">Andrew Berwick</a> who took over from me at the university access charity I founded and used to run called The Access Project.
