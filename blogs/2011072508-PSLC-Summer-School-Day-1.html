          <p>
            First day at PSLC has started with a bang, seems like lot of interesting students and mentors are here. Looking forward to the developments, would keep you guys updated. 


Classes of EDM Method (Banker & Yacef, 2009)
- Prediction - lot of emphasis
- Clustering
- Relationship Mining: whether students are
- Discovery with Models
- Distillation of Data for Human Judgement


Prediction:
Develop a model which can infer a single aspect of the data (predicted variable) from some combination of other aspects of the data (predictor variables)

- Does a student know a skill?
- Which students are off-task?
- Which students will fail the class?

KDD Cup : - Top 3 data mining conferences
Premier 
Bayesian Knowledge tracing


Clustering:
When we have unstructured data we use clustering, define sets of students or problems that can guide us to get some knowledge about the data.

- find points that naturally group together, splitting full data set into set of clusters

Relationship Mining:
Discover relationships between variables in a dataset with many variables
- Association rule mining
- Correlation mining
- Sequential pattern mining
- Causal Data mining 

Discovery with Models:
- Pre-existing models (developed with EDM prediction methods or clustering or knowledge engineering)
- Applied to data and used as a component in another analysis.

Distillation of Data for Human Judgment
- Making compex data understandable by humans to leverage their judgement
- Text replays are a simple example of this

Knowledge Engineering
- Creating a model by hand rather than automatically fitting model
- In one comparison, leads to worse fit to gold-standard labels of construct of interest than data mining (Roll et al, 2005) but similar qualitative performance.

EDM Track schedule

Tuesday 10 am
- Education data mining with DataShop (Stamper)

Tuesday 11am 
- Item Response Theory and learning factor analysis

EDM Tools:
1) DataShop - repository for educational data.
2) Excel (Add ins)
   - Data Analysis : Anova
   - Equation Solver - fit a model 
(initial knowledge - bayesian knowledge tracing) 
  - Scatterplots
3) Free data mining packages
  - Weka 
  - RapidMiner

Weka vs RapidMiner
- Weka easier to use than RapidMiner
- RapidMiner significantly powerful than RapidMiner

In particularâ€¦
- It is impossible to do key types of model validation for EDM within Weka's GUI
- RapidMiner can be kludged into owing so (more on this in hands-on session)

4) SPSS
  - statistical package and therefore can do a wide variety of statistical tests
 - it can also do some forms of data mining like factor analysis (a relative of clustering)

Difference between statistical packages (like SPSS) and data mining packages like Weka -

5) R 
- is an open source competitor to SPSS
- more powerful and flexible than SPSS
- but much harder to use - I find it easy to accidentally do very, very incorrect things in R


IRT Model
- Associative Model 

DataShop
- Phil Patt uses data webservices of DataShop to get the data and analyze 

Matlab
- Beck and Changs Bayes Net Toolkit - Student modeling is built in Matlab


Pre-processing
1) Where does EDM data come from?
   - Tutor or log files
   - Surveys/Tests
   - Recorded / Conversational data
   - from Sensors or Eye tracking or Facial Recognition (confused/angry), hand sensors, butt sensor (best data captured way)

Common Approach
- Flat Data file 
 (even if you store your data in databases, most data mining techniques require a flat file)

some useful features to distill for educational software
- Type of interface widget
- "Pknow" : the probability that the student knew the skill before answering (using Bayesia knowledge-tracing or PFA or your favorite approach)
- Assessment of progress student is making towards correct answer (how many fewer constraints violated)
- Whether this action is the first time a student attempts a given problem step
- "Optoprac": How many 
- "timeSD" : time taken in terms of standard deviations above (+) or below (-) average for this skill across all actions and students
- "time2SD": sum of timeSD for the last 3 action or 5 or 4 
- Action type counts or percents
   : Total number of actions so fat
   : No of actions on this skill, divided by optoproac
   : no. of actions in last n actions

logistical regression models
Code available
Ryan Baker has code available for EDM

- Distilling datashop data
- Bayesian knowledge tracing
