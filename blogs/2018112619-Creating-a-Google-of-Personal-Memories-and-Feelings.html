<p>Neo is a cyborg using technology to collect and store his memories as he lives them. Every day, Neo puts on three devices: a camera to record images and sound, a signal-tracking band to measure body temperature and heart rate, and an EEG cap to measure brain activity. The combined data from these devices give Neo a portrait of each day, documenting both what he did how he felt during each activity.</p>

<p>Neo hopes to create a machine learning system that will recognize and tag specific moments, making it possible to search his memories as if they were a personal Google. The project has given Neo greater insight into his own feelings during different activities, and he hopes others will benefit from this ability as well, particularly those with brain damage or disease. Maybe it could help people retain a sense of identity, or help them analyze emotions that they wouldnâ€™t understand otherwise. Or maybe this technology would just get in the way of living in the moment.</p>

<p>How do you think this technology could benefit people? Do you foresee it becoming the norm? Would you like the ability to Google moments in your life? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/45321">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:33 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> This project seems promising for promoting emotional intelligence. I can see it being used by people struggling with mental health or behavior issues to help identify emotional triggers. Large-scale knowledge of emotions associated with activities such as checking one's phone could also contribute to research about the consequences of particular behaviors.</p>

<p><b>@01:36 RuthS:</b> I think we should put more emphasis on staying in touch with ourselves so that we know how we feel throughout the day rather than relying on EEG data and video recordings. Why should we examine personal data later when we collect is as we're living? We should just analyze it then.</p>
