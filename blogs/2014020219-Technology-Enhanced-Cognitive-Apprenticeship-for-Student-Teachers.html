<p><b>Title:</b> Student Teacher Communication and Performance During a Clinical Experience Supported by a Technology-Enhanced Cognitive Apprenticeship (2014)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Theodore J. Kopcha, Christianna Alger</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513002960#">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
How does teacher performance differ between student teachers who participate in a technology-enhanced cognitive apprenticeship (TECA) and those who do not? How does the method of communication and frequency of communication about specific teaching practices differ between groups?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Cognitive apprenticeship is a learning model that leverages the strengths of apprenticeship for learning higher level, less observable thinking skills. It encourages instructors to make thinking visible in all teaching activities, situates learning tasks in authentic contexts, and helps learners transfer what they learn to different situations. A technology-enhanced cognitive apprenticeship (TECA) is an environment in which new technologies are incorporated in a clinical training program that employs a cognitive apprenticeship learning approach. Scholars have been interested in how TECA can contribute to learning at the clinical training stage. However, only a few studies examine the difference in performance and communication for those who participated in TECA and those who did not.</p> 

<p>This study sought empirical evidence on the effects of TECA on student teachers' performance and communication with their peers, supervisors and cooperating teachers during their student teaching year. 54 student teachers from a large university in the Southwest who were engaged in a yearlong clinical experience as part of their degree requirement volunteered to participate in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to either a TECA that used the eSupervision program or a traditional student teaching program. The results of several questionnaires investigating student teachers' perceptions about the quality of guidance they received, the frequency and ways of communication, and their sense of self-efficacy in teaching were collected and analyzed along with the Portfolio Assessment for California teachers (PACT) .</p>


<p><b>Findings:</b>
Student teachers who participated in eSupervision achieved higher scores in planning instruction than non-eSupervision participants, but no statistically significant differences were found in both groups' performance for implementing, assessing or reflecting on instruction. This could be due to the design of eSupervision that focuses on learning to plan. Moreover, student teachers in the eSupervision program had fewer face-to-face conversations with their supervisors but more communication through eSupervision online tools such as private and public discussion boards. eSupervision may provide a more cost efficient approach to student teacher supervision since some logistical arrangements of in person conversations have been replaced with more accessible online communication. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Findings from this study suggest that a customized TECA program with eSupervision is more effective than the traditional student teaching program in helping student teachers learn how to plan their instruction and may save on the travel costs of face-to-face supervision. More design-based research on different TECA features to support other aspects of student teacher professional development would be helpful for designing a more powerful student teaching TECA program. Developing such technology enhanced cognitive apprenticeships could also be useful in other professional fields.</p>
