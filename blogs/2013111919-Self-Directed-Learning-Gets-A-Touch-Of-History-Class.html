Middle school history teacher Mary Perrine is a self-proclaimed hater of textbooks. So, she applied for and received a grant that gives her students more control over their own learning; they are able to choose what and how they want to learn. After Mrs. Perrine introduces a topic, she works with her students to identify learning targets.  Her students then dig deeper into the subject to find an area of interest for a project. She calls these "Power Projects." <p>

The response from parents has been overwhelmingly positive. Says Mrs. Perrine, "Every parent I have talked to has said ‘This is the best thing. Kids love school for the first time.’" Most importantly, the feedback from students has been inspiring. In fact, Mrs. Perrine had students switching into her class just so they could participate in this unique learning experience. Perhaps most satisfying of all is the fact that students put forth extra effort on their projects, working on them through the night. <p>

Watch the video to hear it from the students themselves and <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11578">join the ongoing conversation</a> to add your own thoughts on Mrs. Perrine’s teaching strategy. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:17 Carla:</b> Is it normal for students to use the vernacular "learning targets"? I'm wondering if the awareness of goals is an outcome of the pedagogy. I think it's great that kids understand why they are learning what they're learning.<p>

<b>@02:36 Clark:</b> I would've been interested to see exactly how the class is set up-- how do kids identify their interests? How does the teacher ensure that they are aligned to the learning targets?
