            In this day and age, providing a better education for girls has become even more difficult in undeveloped countries. In many developing countries, girls are not permitted to attend school and rather pushed into marriage. Child marriage is the name given to this act. Child marriage usually occurs from age 15 and above. However, not every female is forced into child marriage. That is, girls who have obtained a secondary education are less likely to become married at a young age. Child marriage forces girls into early adulthood and motherhood. As a result, they tend to lack emotional and physical maturity and deprive them of a lot of educational opportunities. Life is based on sequential growth. At every age in a person's life, that person is suppose to be doing something that corresponds to his or her age. If this doesn't occur, the person might suffer from psychological problems.
<p>
<a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/education/eliminating-child-marriage-boost-girls-education" target = "blank">Child marriage</a>  remains pervasive in many developing countries. However, there have been some ideas presented to combat this act. Many countries have taken the first step to create laws to prevent marriage below age 18. Since these laws are not enforced, child marriage still frequently occurs. Some suggested solutions include creating better and safer job opportunities for girls. I believe that if we put these ideas into actions, we can end child marriage. After all, an empowered and educated female can benefit society. In essence, she will get the skills to be a better parent, worker, and citizen.
