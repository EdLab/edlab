            This  is a listing of databases of particular relevance for research   and study in the Department of Biobehavioral Sciences;<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2010/07/h-department-name_l3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2089" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2010/07/h-department-name_l3-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="153" /></a> the  databases  correlate with the programs and disciplines within the  department. Many  of these  databases cover the periodical  literature  in their respective   fields, but some also provide citations  and  abstracts for books, book  chapters,  papers, reports, dissertations,   and curriculum materials,  as well as  statistical and directory   information, and some are  full-text resources and collections of  non-print  materials of various   kinds.  Virtually all of the  periodical indexes listed below are enabled  to provide linkage to full  text e-journal articles when available.

There are several key databases that are critical for searching the    literature  in essentially all subject fields at the College; these    include <a title="ERIC" href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/log_and_go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvq2st5lq8v.search.serialssolutions.com%2Flog%3FL%3DVQ2ST5LQ8V%26D%3DBNK%26U%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Feduproxy.tc-library.org%252F%253Furl%253Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.csa.com%252Fhtbin%252Fdbrng.cgi%253Fusername%253Dtccu%2526access%253Dtccu2%2526db%253Deric-set-c&amp;name=ERIC">ERIC</a>,  <a title="Education  Full Text" href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/log_and_go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvq2st5lq8v.search.serialssolutions.com%2Flog%3FL%3DVQ2ST5LQ8V%26D%3DWED%26U%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Feduproxy.tc-library.org%252F%253Furl%253Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fvnweb.hwwilsonweb.com%252Fhww%252Fjumpstart.jhtml%253Fcustid%253D0000124743%2526prod%253DEDUFT&amp;name=Education++Full+Text">Education  Full Text</a>, <a title="PsycInfo" href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/log_and_go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvq2st5lq8v.search.serialssolutions.com%2Flog%3FL%3DVQ2ST5LQ8V%26D%3DDOR%26U%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Feduproxy.tc-library.org%252F%253Furl%253Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fgateway.ovid.com%252Fovidweb.cgi%253FT%253DJS%2526MODE%253Dovid%2526NEWS%253Dn%2526PAGE%253Dmain%2526D%253Dpsyh&amp;name=PsycInfo">PsycINFO</a>,  <a title="ProQuest" href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/log_and_go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.columbia.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fcul%2Fresolve%3FANH8357&amp;name=ProQuest">ProQuest</a>,  <a title="Academic  Search Premier" href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/log_and_go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvq2st5lq8v.search.serialssolutions.com%2Flog%3FL%3DVQ2ST5LQ8V%26D%3DEAP%26U%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Feduproxy.tc-library.org%252F%253Furl%253Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fsearch.ebscohost.com%252Flogin.aspx%253Fauthtype%253Dip%252Cuid%2526profile%253Dehost%2526defaultdb%253Daph&amp;name=Academic++Search+Premier">Academic  Search Premier</a>, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?AMG1286">JSTOR</a>,  and <a title="Digital  Dissertations" href="http://library.tc.columbia.edu/log_and_go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvq2st5lq8v.search.serialssolutions.com%2Flog%3FL%3DVQ2ST5LQ8V%26D%3DBGE%26U%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Feduproxy.tc-library.org%252F%253Furl%253Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fproquest.umi.com%252Flogin%253FCOPT%253DREJTPUcyODcrM2IwZiZJTlQ9MCZWRVI9Mg%253D%253D%2526clientId%253D65913&amp;name=Digital++Dissertations">Digital  Dissertations</a>.
