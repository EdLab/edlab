          <p>
            It looks like the field known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_sciences">Learning Sciences</a> (governed by <a href="http://www.isls.org/index.html">ISLS, the International Society of the Learning sciences</a>, which publishes <a href="http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/computing/lst/jls/">the Journal of the Learning Sciences</a> and <a href="http://ijcscl.org/">the International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning</a>), is gaining steam.  <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/14">Hui Soo</a>, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/7">Gary</a>, and I attended the <a href="http://www.isls.org/cscl2007/">CSCL 2007 conference</a> this summer in New Brunswick and had some good discussions with some of the folks from this area.  From my vantage point, this area should be of special interest to the lab, especially because many of the projects that fit into this area look to use digital technology to enhance learning.  Some of the methods that fit into this area include design-based research (which I have looked into quite a bit) and analyzing collaborative discourse.  Some of the areas of research include online collaborative learning, knowledge-building, virtual worlds, and transforming schools and society.  Such scholars as <a href="http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/common/people/profile/?ProfileID=52">Allan Collins</a> (some of us who have seen speak), who has argued for a radical transformation of the education system by leveraging new communications technology, is active in this field.    

In addition, in 2006 the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lWGLNdAsCRwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cambridge+handbook+of+the+learning+sciences&psp=1">Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences</a> was published, which is a very good volume that pulls together many of the different research areas.  All the copies at the TC Library are checked-out (<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/1482?browseby=chart&sortfiles=volume&optdisplay=0">Wendy</a> found me one of the missing copies!), but you can view a copy on <a href="http://eduproxy.tc-library.org/?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/teacherscollege/Doc?id=10130369">EBrary</a> (Columbia login required).

Faculty who participate in the Learning Sciences come both from Education schools and Computer Science programs (among others).  This year, there are several open positions within the Learning Sciences (or Educational Technology) across several universities, including <a href="http://ed.stanford.edu/suse/faculty/faculty-lstd.html">Stanford</a>, <a href="http://www.isls.org/positions/faculty/faculty0008.html">NYU</a>, <a href="http://site.educ.indiana.edu/Portals/28/Faculty%20Openings/Learning%20Sciences.pdf">Indiana</a>, <a href="http://chronicle.com/jobs/id.php?id=0000532491-01">Carnegie Mellon</a>, and <a href="http://chronicle.com/jobs/id.php?id=0000538267-01">Berkeley</a> (which is one of the keys to me that the field is gaining steam).  The field doesn't seem to have much of a foot-hold here at TC (although there have been some conference presentations from TC <a href="http://www.tc.edu/mst/CCTE/">CCTE</a> people), it is an area that I think TC, EdLab and CCTE should get more invovled in.
