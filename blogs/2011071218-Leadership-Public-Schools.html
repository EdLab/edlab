            Schools are often hesitant to adopt new methods because of their anxiety about balancing innovation and accountability, especially when it comes to <a href= “http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2011/06/15/03innovation.h04.html?tkn=PWQFrX0X9Z7LLgW2pa1PeoKL%2BEHawRJfWMND&cmp=clp-edweek”>education technology</a>.  There has also been an ongoing debate about what really changes schools; is it culture, accountability, technology, or teachers? Leadership Public Schools, a charter school network in the Bay Area, uses a combination of all of the above to achieve results for their underprivileged high school students.

Leadership accomplishes a combination of all four factors by their focus on building community and using technology comprehensively.  LPS creates a unique school culture by combining personalization with common experiences and focusing everything on support for college readiness. The foundation for all of this is LPS' curriculum, which is designed to ensure that 100 percent of their graduating seniors meet the University of California entrance requirements and are accepted to college. One of their graduation requirements is even applying to at least one two- or four-year college.

Every student participates in “signature experiences” like the freshman leadership retreat and academic leadership class. The most notable signature experience is called Week without Walls, in which students participate in activities outside of school for a week, such as: making a music video, service learning, or interviewing entrepreneurs, and culminates in presentations and exhibitions. Every student is also assigned to an academic advisory group, a family of one teacher and twenty students, with which they spend all four years meeting with for Friday Family Meetings “to celebrate successes, address school issues, and reinforce the college-going culture.” 

Students receive continued support and reinforcing of the college-going culture through intensive counseling, academic monitoring and intervention, and individualization. Leadership Public Schools use “diagnostic data and computer assisted supports” to individualize everything from their roadmap of courses to “tailored instruction based on their progress throughout the year” on skills identified in the Northwest Evaluation Association's Measures of Academic Progress.  The personalization for students comes through a variety of applications of technology, most notable of which is their College Access Readers. Through their partnership with the CK-12 Foundation, Leadership Public Schools created, <a href=http://ck-12.org/about/leadership-public-schools-case-study/>College Access Readers</a>, free, open source e-textbooks which allow teachers to rearrange chapters and edit text and illustrations. College Access Readers even enable instruction tailored to students' level of reading proficiency with text-to-speech for Special Education students and translation for English language learners. 

	Overall, Leadership Public Schools seem to strike the right middle ground between standardized skills-based curriculum and individualization while creating an atmosphere that encourages learning beyond standardized tests and maintaining high expectations.
