            <i>If you had the chance to read any of George's posts on the EdLab Blog, you would have quickly picked up on George's ability to embed the issues of education into a historical and global context. George shares his valuable insights into international developments and current affairs on the EdLab blog, as seen <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5613">here</a>, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5424">here</a>, and <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5593">here</a>. For George's best of, "Trends in Ed: Armed Conflict and Education" seemed most appropriate in helping us all remember how interconnected and fundamental the issue of education is to all people.</i>

<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5366">Original Post Here</a>

A <a href=http://www.unicef.org/education/index_57799.html">recent report</a> concluded that nearly 40% of all children currently out of school live in war torn countries or conflict zones. The annual report was compiled by the ‘Education for All' Global Monitoring Report (GMR), which monitors the educational needs of all children across the globe to reach their goal of “education for all” by 2015. According to the report, the overall global community is failing to provide “critical educational needs” for almost 28 million children affected by armed conflict. 

The report notes most of the world's poorer countries spend more on arms and military spending than they do on basic education for its citizens. For instance, if the 21 countries with the biggest disparity were to cut military spending by just 10 per cent, an additional 9.5 million children could attend school. The report calls for a larger role for NGOs such as UNESCO and UNICEF in peace building efforts and to that end UNICEF is conducting research on the importance of education in peace-building and long-term development plans for crisis-hit countries. Anthony Lake, Executive Director of UNICEF argues “armed conflicts destroy more than lives and buildings. They destroy progress and can defeat potential.” The report seems timely in light of the recent violent uprisings in Libya and Ivory Coast, adding to a long list of countries embroiled in what seem like never-ending armed conflicts.
