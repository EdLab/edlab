<b>Title:</b> How Communities Support Innovative Activities: An Exploration of Assistance and Sharing Among End-users (2003)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Nikolaus Franke & Sonali Shah
<p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> A hot topic in the business world is understanding sources of innovation. While many innovative products have been developed within companies, consumers have also played an important role in the creation of innovative products. Unknown are the processes and resources that innovative consumers rely on to come up with new product ideas. 
<p>  
Nikolaus Franke and Sonali Shah examined the processes by which innovative users of products outside of firms obtained the necessary resources and assistance to develop innovative ideas. Considering that prior research highlights the important role that informal <a href=" http://www.infed.org/biblio/communities_of_practice.htm "> communities of practice  </a> play in developing innovative products, the authors of this study looked at four communities outside of firms that were sports-oriented and that engaged in innovative activities. They included a sailplaning community, a canyoning community, a boardercross community and a handicapped cycling community. Through a questionnaire, the authors asked members across the four groups about personal characteristics, community interactions, if he or she had created an innovative product, and in what ways participants were involved, if at all, in the development of an innovation.

<p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Roughly a third of the community members had self-reported creating an innovative product. Of this third, the authors discovered that innovators interacted differently within their voluntary communities compared to non-innovators. Innovators had been involved in communities for a longer period of time and they tended to spend noticeably more time with other community members. Investing in communities turned out to be important in the innovative process. While an individual member might have developed an innovative idea, he or she relied on the assistance of others to turn it into a functioning prototype. In fact, all of the innovators in the study obtained help from other individuals in their communities during the innovation process. Members offered help at no cost and innovations were shared freely among community members. Why? The biggest motivator was the joy of working with and helping others. Participants explained, "…it is fun to create something jointly." The researchers purported that the fact the communities were situated in a non-market and non-competitive environment encouraged knowledge-sharing. 
  
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The findings of the study suggest that voluntary communities made up of innovative product-users are a potentially important source of market innovation.  What’s key is finding communities that encourage open knowledge-sharing and other innovative activities. Future research could focus on how innovative-user communities initially got off the ground, as well as an in-depth look at the processes that occur within them that fosters mutually beneficial support. This particular study focused on innovative communities revolving around sports. Future studies could examine communities in other sectors and industrial markets.
