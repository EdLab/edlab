Thank you to everyone for participating in yesterday's D&R that focused on:
<ul>
<li>Observing readership habits</li>
<li>Creating guidelines for writing titles and summaries</li>
<li>Applying those guidelines to NLT content</li>
</ul>
I hope this process helps us think about how we frame our content on NLT as we seek to increase readership. Here's a summary of each team's guidelines and article summaries.

<b>Guidelines</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Team Slate:</b> Styles that capture attention are controversial, edgy, to the point, and have snappy verbage; they maintain a balance between catchy and informative. Bloomberg Businessweek has great summaries with the “bottom line.”</li>
<p>
<li><b>Team Atlantic:</b> Big pictures sometimes backfire when they only feature the logo of a company; however, pictures of people may be more effective. Using context surrounding the names of products in an article title may draw in more people. Also, using unusual keywords may draw attention, (i.e. “ugly” in the Trayvon Martin article on BBC and “self-righteous, annoying, and important” in the Thom Yorke article on Atlantic). </li>
<p>
<li><b>Team Huffington Post:</b> Short descriptions and quotes are best.</li>
<p>
<li><b>Team NYTimes:</b> Pique the reader's interest, but don't give it all away. Provide the functionality to have the reader dive immediately into comments. Don't list sections on the front page because it isn't relevant.</li>
<p>
<li><b>Team Buzzfeed:</b> Having a keyword in the title, like a specific person's name makes it more relevant. Having an accompanying picture like a thumbnail which is relevant to the article content catches the reader's attention, as does having a different background color for featured articles. Funny things are catchy and more likely to be clicked on.</li>


<b>NLT Content Revamp</b>

<ul>
<li><b>Team Slate:</b> Vialogues' <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/795/"target="_blank">Entrepreneurship as a High School Course</a> becomes <i>There's a new subject in town... entrepreneurship takes high schools by storm</i>
Summary: Tired of boring old High School... this high school program aim to reinvent what it means to learn and think about entrepreneurship.  Educators cover the pros & cons of the program and participants talk about their experience. </li>
<p>
<li><b>Team Atlantic:</b> Research Digest's <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/815"target="_blank">Educational Entrepreneurship</a> becomes <i>How to Grow an Entrepreneur </i>
Summary: Are US policies hindering the development of homegrown tech leaders? </li>
<p>
<li><b>Team Huffington Post:</b> Profiles' <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/709/"target="_blank"> Jonathan Askin</a> becomes <i>Professor and Provocateur, Jonathan Askin.</i>
Summary: ”My goal is to train the next generation of attorneys to adopt the ‘hacker ethos...'” </i>
Keywords: entrepreneur, digital age</li>
<p>
<li><b>Team NYTimes:</b> EdLab Review's <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/813/"target="_blank">Treehouse</a> becomes <i>Build your coding skills with Treehouse</i>
Treehouse is a platform that enables users to learn and practice writing code through project-based lessons. How does Treehouse stack up to some of the more well-known coding sites? </li>
<p>
<li><b>Team Buzzfeed:</b> NL Sector's <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/779"target="_blank">National STEM Video Game Challenge</a> becomes <i>16 cool kids who learned STEM skills by creating video games</i>
Summary: Promoting STEM based Learning amongst kids through National STEM Video Game Challenge
Keywords: STEM, educational video games, challange, competition, Joan Ganz Cooney Center, Sesame </li>
