<strong>Title:</strong> The Making of Americans: Democracy and Our Schools

<strong>Author: </strong>E. D. Hirsch, Jr.

<strong>Publisher: </strong>Yale University Press

<strong>Call No.: </strong> LA217.2 .H57 2009

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

<strong> F</strong><strong>rom the bestselling author of <em>Cultural Literacy</em>, a passionate and cogent argument for reforming the way we teach our </strong><strong>children</strong>

Why,  after decades of commissions, reforms, and efforts at innovation, do  our schools continue to disappoint us?  In this comprehensive and  thought-provoking book, educational theorist E. D. Hirsch, Jr. offers a  masterful analysis of how American ideas about education have veered off  course, what we must do to right them, and most importantly <em>why</em>.  He argues that the core problem with American education is that  educational theorists, especially in the early grades, have for the past  sixty years rejected academic content in favor of “child-centered” and  “how-to” learning theories that are at odds with how children really  learn.  The result is failing schools and widening inequality, as only  children from content-rich (usually better-off) homes can take advantage  of the schools’ educational methods.

Hirsch  unabashedly confronts the education establishment, arguing that a  content-based curriculum is essential to addressing social and economic  inequality. A nationwide, specific, grade-by-grade curriculum  established in the early school grades can help fulfill one of America’s  oldest and most compelling dreams: to give all children, regardless of  language, religion, or origins, the opportunity to participate as equals  and become competent citizens. Hirsch not only reminds us of these  inspiring ideals, he offers an ambitious and specific plan for achieving  them.
