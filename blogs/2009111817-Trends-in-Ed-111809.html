          <p>
            Salesforce recently released <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-10400538-264.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20">a social network for companies</a>. Coworkers can use the in-house only network to share feeds, updates, etc. This seems to be a clear example of the "cargo cult" mentality  that causes developers to imitate superficial features of successful websites and applications without really understanding what makes them work. Salesforce isn't the only one guilty of this. Many empty social networks have been created  for both informal and formal education in an attempt to capitalize on the social network craze. I have been crawling the net trying to find information about successful social networks and all of the articles seem to miss one major point: it's all about the other users. Users join a social network to interact with other people. If a user isn't interested in what other members of the social network have to say, they aren't going to stay around for long. <p>

A successful social network really depends, in my opinion, on who else is in the network. As designers, we tend to try to think of interesting ways for people to interact with each other while ignoring the fact that no tool will make another user more interesting. Does this mean we should give up trying to create social networks? Of course not. However, we should some time thinking about <i>who</i> will be using the network rather than <i>how</i> they will use it. Will the people we are lumping together really want to connect? Thoughts?
