            So, Linkedin has released new profile sections for students and recent graduates so that they can showcase their skills and experience from school on Linkedin.

What are these added profile sections?

Projects
Honors & Awards
Organisations
Test Scores
Courses

Here is the <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2011/07/15/student-profile-sections/?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"> full article</a> from their blog.

If you did not know already, we added two profile fields to the Academic Information section of <a href=http://ednode.com/?next=/people/"> Ednode</a> a few weeks back. So, other than Institution, Major, Dates of school and Degree, we believe that these two fields will help in searching and identifying people for help and information more meaningfully.

1. Course(s) Instructed as a TA or as an Instructor: A subtle way to highlight your proficiency/knowledge in a course.

2 Favorite Coursework: This could be your all time favorite courses taken or taught. The idea is to focus on the interdisciplinary aspect of many degree programs, so even though your degree might be in Political Science, your favorite coursework could be Statistics, i.e. outside the standard, required courses of a Political Science degree. 

The Ednode team has also implemented the functionality (which is in the process of being pushed to the production) wherein you can directly import all your data from Linkedin to your Ednode profile.

So, what does Linkedin going academic mean for the Ednode team? In a way it makes us feel good, that

1. Now the users can directly import all their course information as well from linkedin to Ednode. - Helping us to reduce the burden on the user of refilling their profile on Ednode.

2. We feel that we are headed in the direct direction, developing features and use cases that have a real need in the world.

Stay with us, as we continue to flush Ednode's identity, make it more usable. and get famous :)
