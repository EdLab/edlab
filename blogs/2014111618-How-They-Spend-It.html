          <p>
            The amount of time teachers spend in school varies from country to country. In some countries, it is mandatory for teachers to spend certain hours in the classroom. Few countries are lenient about the hours teachers spend in the classroom. Generally, primary school teachers are expected to teach more hours than that of secondary school. This is understandable because at the primary school level, students are more involved in extra curricular learning activities. Additionally, students at that stage have more time to learn and receive help.
<p>
This <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2014/09/10/the-countries-where-teachers-spend-the-most-time-in-the-classroom-infographic/" target = "blank">article</a>  presents an infographic on the amount of hours teachers spend in classroom across the world. For instance, in Chile, France, and the United States, educators spend over six hours teaching. Conversely, the number is between three and six hours in most countries. Overall, Chile has the highest number (1,049) for the annual hours of mandatory instruction time in primary education. This is followed by Australia with 1,010 hours, and the United States at 967 hours. I believe the hours teachers spend in classroom should have a positive effect on students. However, since it wasn't mentioned in the article, it can't be implied that Chile's primary school students are doing better than Australia's students or China's students. China averages 612 hours, the lowest according to the selected list of countries included in the infographic.
