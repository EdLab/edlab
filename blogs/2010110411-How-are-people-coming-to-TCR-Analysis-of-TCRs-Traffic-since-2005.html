          <p>
            Traffic to TCR since 2005 has been primarily through three sources: (We can only trace back till 2005 as we do not have data prior to that)

1) Search engines - 62% traffic.
2) Direct traffic to TCR - 21%
3) Traffic through referring sites - 17%

<b> <u>Search Engine traffic Analysis </u></b>

- Out of the top 10 search engines responsible for traffic to TCR, in 8 of them, the most frequently used keyword was "teachers college record". These 10 search engines represent the majority of search engines used by people now-a days. This suggests that a lot of people are using different search engines to reach to the homepage of TCR.

- Analyzing the overall,top 100 queries entered in the search engines, I found the following:

1) 20 different navigational queries : intended to reach to the home page of TCR, for e.g. "teachers college record".
2) 22 queries on different books.
3) 19 queries on different articles.
4) 12 queries on people.
5) 27 queries on some topic.

- It is <b>interesting</b> to see that most of the times, when searching for books or articles, people used the name of the book/article along-with the author's last name as their query. This suggests that people know what they are looking for.
 
<b>Visits made to TCR through the queries:</b>

1) Most visits were made to TCR through navigational queries. (69,337 visits)
2) This was followed by visits made to TCR while searching for books. (13,545 visits)
3) Next was the visits made while searching for articles. (10,573 visits)
4) This was followed by visits made while searching for some topic. (9,437 visits)
4) Least number of visits were made to TCR when searching for people. (5,041 visits).

- This suggests that people are least likely to visit TCR when they want to learn about some person. They are most likely to visit TCR when they want to learn about some book or article. It is again <b>interesting</b> to see that even though people made the most number of queries overall when searching for a topic (27 queries), but overall they made very less visits to TCR using those queries. This may suggest that again, TCR may not be a very helpful resource to people, if they want to just learn about a topic, for e.g. "generation gap". They are likely to use other resources to accomplish their task.

<b>Most looked up book</b>

Larry Cuban's book titled "teachers and machines: the classroom use of technology" was the most searched book, receiving 3431 visits on the TCR's website.

<b> Most looked up article</b>

Dempsey's article titled "parental involvement in children's education: why does it make a difference" was the most searched/visited article. (3145 visits)

<b> Most searched person</b>

George Veletsianos  was the most visited person.(1178 visits)

<b> Most looked up topic</b>

Parental involvement in education was the most looked up topic with 2215 total visits.

<b> <u>Traffic through referring sites- Analysis </u></b>

- I studied the top 50 referral sources and categorized the traffic into the following different categories:

1) The most number of visits to TCR were made through referrals on the scholarly literature websites and resources like Google Scholar, wikipedia and google books. (34,994 visits)
2) This was followed by visits made to TCR through the different email domains. (32,349 visits). This number probably represents the amount of traffic we are getting from the newsletters. In terms of total traffic, this number represents 0.2% of total TCR website traffic.
3) The next source of referral was through the different websites of Teachers College like tc.columbia.edu, pocket-knowledge etc. (16,640 visits). It might be interesting to see if/how  we can increase the number of referrals through our own websites.
4) The last and very interesting source of referral was through the educational organization and websites like maec.org, teach-now.org etc.
