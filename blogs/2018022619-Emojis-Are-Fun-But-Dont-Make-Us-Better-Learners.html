<p>Emojis have done something that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8672371/learn-esperanto-language-duolingo-app-origin-history">Esperanto</a> couldn’t; they've become a global language understood by everyone and a regular and increasingly necessary part of our daily lives. On Facebook alone, we use over 60 millions emojis daily. As emojis become an integrated part of written language, particularly for teens and young adults, researchers are examining whether emojis enhance or hinder textual learning.</p>
 
<p>One such study focused on the use of emojis, as well as storytelling, in relaying health information to college students. Researchers sent a series of health related text messages to 426 undergraduate participants. The messages were either narrative or non-narrative, meaning they were formed into a story or not, and were sprinkled with varying amounts of emojis, from high (3 per text message), to low (1 per text message), to none. Afterwards/, the researchers gave participants a questionnaire measuring their reactions to the messages.</p>
 
<p>Overall, they found that the use of emojis correlated with increased attention and perceptions of how personal the texts were, but decreased perceived credibility and willingness to make connections between the texts and other facets of their lives. Regarding storytelling, the researchers found the non-narrative text series increased making connections and perceptions of personalization, and decreased participants’ desire to counter argue the messages. The authors cite <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321630125X?via%3Dihub">previous research</a> showing new information is most likely to change behavior when readers find it credible and make connections between it and their lives.</p>
 
<p>Because there is not a one-size-fits-all right answer here, the researchers suggest using different text strategies for different types of health messages. If a piece of health information is particularly important and requires participants to change their behavior in some way, the researchers recommend using a non-narrative text message without emojis. This provides the greatest level of credibility and willingness to connect the info to their life style. If, however, there’s a health message that is not particularly demanding, the researchers recommend using narrative texts with emojis to increase personalization and attention.</p>
 
<p>Emojis are a part of written language now, so it’s important to consider the implications they have for learning. In this case, researchers examined how emojis, as well as storytelling, affect readers’ perceptions of health information. While some uses of emojis get a thumbs up, the participants still prefer more direct and less picture-filled messages to relay important content. Sorry sunglasses emoji; people like you, but not everyone takes you seriously.</p>
