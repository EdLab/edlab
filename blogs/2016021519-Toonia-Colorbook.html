Kids love to color. With <a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toonia-colorbook-educational/id633956731?mt=8">Toonia Colorbook</a>, your mobile device becomes a portable coloring book—no need to carry around pesky crayons, markers, and papers with you anymore! </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>For those with messy or forgetful kids, Toonia Colorbook is a gem. Keeping your kids stocked with art supplies, like paper, pencils, and crayons, can become a real drag—not to mention expensive—depending on their habits. Toonia is also fabulous at helping kids sharpen their hand-eye coordination; they can develop fine motor skills at their own pace. Youngsters who are a little clumsy will benefit by the repetition they need as they practice wherever they go. </p>

<p>Toonia Colorbook is easy for tots to use. Funky drawing templates are included—kids just need to pick a preferred drawing, find a color, and start coloring by tracing their fingers on the tablet. Toonia’s soft gentle music could calm hyperactive kids. Toonia is also great at building community, as multi-touch functionality turns coloring into a collaborative process—friends and family become co-artists by drawing on the tablet too. Tiny Toulouses can save, share, and print their work by touching the share icon. The kitchen fridge will be plastered with colorful drawings in no time with Toonia Colorbook, the portable art studio! </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Toonia Colorbook may be a little frustrating for those who want to draw fine lines or fill in tight corners. In fact, anything smaller than the tip of a finger is problematic. As such, hardcore fine artists may not like coloring with the app and prefer the control of a good old-fashioned pencil or crayon. </p>

<p> Although upfront costs are minimal and there is a free version of the app, the backend costs could quickly grow if you aren’t careful. Leaving an enthusiastic little one with a quick trigger finger by the home color printer could make you yearn for the old days of buying Crayolas instead of toner. If you are on a budget, you may need to make a firm agreement on printing or disconnect the WiFi print option on your device.  </p>
 
<p>Finally, embracing exclusively digital media art production on an iPad may not be the best choice for your child. The fantasy world of real Crayolas and sharpies, pencils and pens, provides a satisfying tactile experience that simply cannot be replicated on a tablet. And when our world view is restricted to a tablet window, everything begins to look the same. Apps, regardless of the awesome power of design, tend to flatten over time, one melting into another, resulting in a numbing sameness. In the limitless fantasy life of a child, that could be the dearest price. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Toonia Colorbook is a great way for a young artist to embrace art on-the-go. Coloring, doodling, and scribbling are fun and responsive. Sharing with friends and family can also be a pick-me-up when your kids have the blues. But as good as Toonia Colorbook can be, leaving a little nook of your house open to pens and paper can allow kids to explore their lives in an infinite number of ways beyond the restrictive screenspace of a hand-held device. Just make sure you budget time to clean up the mess. </p>
