          <p>
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media">Digital Media</a> is becoming very significant in the lives of children. Almost everything that children do nowadays is done with the help of an electrical device. Schools have also started using the help of digital media (televisions, smart boards, computers) to aid the students in their learning. Are these new methods helpful or harmful for the next generations?

	Many studies have shown that digital media is harmful to young kids. As part of my research on digital media, I came across a study that shows the average kid spends 197 minutes watching television and 67 minutes playing video games. This raises many questions and concerns. Are kids going to get addicted to media? Does media contribute to childhood aggression? These are all valid questions, but studies also show that media can be extremely helpful to kids as well. With programs like AOL Instant Messenger and MSN messenger, kids can become more sociable. Another study done on kids with cancer showed that the kids who played the game <a href="http://www.re-mission.net/">Re-Mission</a>,(a game where you have to attack bad germs in the system), responded better and had higher levels of prescribed drugs in their bloodstream than kids who didn't play. 

	Educational television shows can also help children. Kids tend to respond to fun things and that's why they learn more by watching educational TV than sitting in a boring classroom. I think that digital media is good for kids to some extent. Digital Media can be used for great things like education, but sometimes it is used for ineffective things such as playing video games. Parents need to make sure that their kids are getting exposed to the right kind of digital media, the one that can help them learn and be more sociable.
