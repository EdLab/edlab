<p>"Constructivism" is currently one of the biggest buzzwords in science education, and it is often applied in the context of the"flipped classroom." Students do the textbook reading at home, and make meaning out of information by engaging in problem solving and in-class interactions. But like most buzzwords, it is only pedagogically useful if implemented with intention and a critical eye. As such, the people who need to have the deepest understanding of what "constructivism" really means are teachers, which means teacher training should address it in full.</p>
 
<p>A researcher at a Canadian university’s School of Education investigated which tools were most useful in training teachers to apply constructivist pedagogy in flipped classroom lesson plans. The study spanned three years and participants were elementary school science teaching interns. The study evaluated which of four different learning tools was most effective in supporting teacher understanding.</p>
 
<p>The four tools included a CD, a voice-over PowerPoint, a video-recorded lecture, and a handbook of formative assessments. The CD contained examples of poor lesson plans for students to evaluate the errors in implementing constructivism. Results showed that the CD was the least useful of the four tools, primarily because it took too much time to access and because many of the interns did not have CD drives on their laptops. From this, the researcher determined that the medium of the tools provided is particularly important in terms of its perceived effectiveness.</p>
 
<p>The voice-over PowerPoint categorized common inadequacies found in constructivist lesson plans. The third tool was a video-recorded lecture that explained how to establish contexts for learning that would give students a "need to know" feeling so that they could come to class with a desire to build upon their understanding of the material. Teaching interns tended to find this helpful in order to go beyond the prototypical "sensationalist" demos containing lights, explosions, and smoke. The interns found the mini-handbook of formative assessments—evaluations conducted throughout the trajectory of the learning process to gauge student understanding—most helpful, because they previously had trouble understanding formative assessments in the context of a constructivist flipped classroom lesson. Receiving examples improved their understanding of integrating this type of evaluation into their lesson plans.</p>

<p>Constructivism is still being studied by a host of education researchers, especially with respect to its impact on student learning across different ages and subjects. However, this study provides some guidance for teacher education programs grounded in constructivist thinking, in considering which mediums are more or less effective in learning how to plan lessons.</p>
