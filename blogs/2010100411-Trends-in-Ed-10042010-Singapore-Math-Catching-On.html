          <p>
            In an effort to better prepare students for life in a global economy, <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/education/01math.html?_r=1&ref=education">a few school districts across the country</a> are adopting the national math model of Singapore. Singapore's students have usually ranked in the top tier of international math exams since the mid-1990s. Various reasons account for the recent interest in Singapore Math, though the model had been adopted as far back as 30 years ago, mainly by home school parents and certain districts through hearsay. <p>

For decades, educators and administrators across the country have been trying to find a proper math model for students and each model, including the “new math” model in the 1960s, failed to meet expectations. The Singaporean model has become popular among school districts and administrators because it “devotes more time to fewer topics, to ensure that children master through detailed instruction, questions, problem solving, and visual and hands-on aids like blocks, cards and bar charts.”

The recent adoptions of the Singaporean model by school districts have seen a rise in the sales of companies who sell programs and textbooks related to Singapore Math. Though studies show students who are taught Singapore Math score higher on standardized exams, there are concerns the model is too expensive, especially for poor school districts, nor is it easy to adopt. Opponents further express concerns about importing a foreign textbook, with its different style and references to foreign concepts. The textbooks run anywhere from $40 to $52 a year per student and working textbooks must be replaced every school year. There are also the costs associated with training teachers to teach the Singapore method. <p>
