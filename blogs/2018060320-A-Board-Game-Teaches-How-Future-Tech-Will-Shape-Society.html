<p>Technology is developing at such a rapid rate that it seems almost impossible to slow down the advance of new products and emerging trends (nor should we necessarily want to slow down these advancements). But <a href="https://ideacouture.com">Idea Couture</a>, a Canada-based global innovation and experience design firm, believes that we should at least think about the implications of new tech before releasing it into society. To encourage others to do the same, they created Impact: A Foresight Game. Originally released on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1597264393/impact-a-foresight-game">Kickstarter</a>, the game is now available to buy <a href="https://ideacouture.com/impact/">directly from the company’s website</a> for $65.</p>

<p>Each player chooses a different profession of the future and then must make decisions about new technological advances based on what is most beneficial to that particular field. To win, players must consider how the latest advances will continue evolving society at large. After the game ends, players should have a better understanding of emerging technologies such as AI, robotics, and the Internet of Things. They will also have practice thinking about how this emerging tech will evolve and shape the society of the future.</p>

<p>What is the benefit of teaching this material through a board game rather than through a mobile game, text, or other mediums? Why is it important to think about how emerging technology will shape society? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/43856">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:05 Ryan Allen:</b> This is amazing. I love how educators are <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5036/rex-brynen">incorporating boardgames into education</a>. I've seen a lot of these kinds of games, but this is the first one that I've seen focused on futurism and innovation. I'd love to test this out in a real classroom.</p>

<p><b>@02:50 Dallas Milanovich:</b> The fact this was intended for policy makers is really interesting! A game for politicians—I wonder how that worked out. Does it teach collaboration, though? This seems like something you would want to emphasize when working with politicians who have different agendas and see the future differently.</p>
