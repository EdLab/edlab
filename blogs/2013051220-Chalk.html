<p><a href="http://www.chalkschools.com/">Chalk</a> is a paper-busting web app that wants to take the pain out of classroom document exchange. The system digitizes and stores common circulating forms, like permission slips, to simplify the flow of documents among parents, students, and teachers. Co-founder Sarah Chou, a former school administrator, worked with colleague Qian Wang at the Stanford Graduate School of Education to develop the <a href="https://gse-ldt.stanford.edu/students/ma-projects/chalk-transforming-school-decisions-ground">initial version of Chalk</a>, which was aimed primarily at communication between administrators and teachers. The present-day iteration was incubated at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/imagine-k12-third-graduation/">Imagine K-12</a> and is now solely focused on tools for the paperless classroom.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The best thing about Chalk is its permeability; the teacher account sign-up is a simple, 6-field affair and parents don’t even need to create accounts to interact with classroom forms. Teachers can easily upload home-cooked class spreadsheets with any variable fields and drag those fields into their uploaded PDFs. Once the documents are sent, parents receive them via email and can sign and send them back from their web browser.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Chalk is very easy to master, but teacher-side activities like figuring out how to drop fields into documents can be a bit challenging at first. Chalk offers a robust tutorial section to help new users master site functions. Uploading documents and class lists represent a significant time investment early in the sign up process, but it certainly will not take teachers any longer than printing a stack of permission slips and keeping track of their status of each by hand.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Many learning management systems aimed at K-12 students have built-in document exchange, but Chalk’s standalone system is appropriate for teachers in traditional classrooms who want to reduce paper waste or make document exchange more efficient. The system eliminates the young and unreliable middlemen of traditional parent-teacher communication in favor of a powerful direct channel. In schools, Chalk may not be able to compete with one-stop systems like Edmodo, but the technology is so elegant and simple that it seems likely that it will be co-opted into more lucrative applications in business.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Chalk makes parent teacher communication at least easy and perhaps even fun.</p>
