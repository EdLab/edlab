<p>What do teachers think about the use of video games in the classroom? What are their concerns around in-class video gaming? A recent study examined sixteen classroom teachers’ opinions of video games in the classroom as part of a larger mixed-methods research project that involved ten primary and secondary schools in Australia.</p>

<p>The study revealed that teachers had optimistic views about the educational benefits of video games. Specifically, teachers believed that video games were inherently motivating and engaging because they provide students with immersive virtual learning experiences. They further thought that video games could help students develop collaboration and problem solving skills and that they could provide differentiated learning opportunities.</p>

<p>Though there was remarkable consistency in teachers’ optimistic views towards classroom-based video gaming, their concerns about gaming were more diverse. Echoing findings from the literature, teachers were concerned about the novelty factor that might wear off after students’ initial play, the challenge of managing students’ behaviors in the in-game world, and the uncertainty in identifying quality video games for classroom learning. The authors found that the often-cited critique of video games as violent and full of inappropriate content was not a prevalent concern among teacher participants.</p>

<p>The study contains a positive message about how teachers might understand and perceive the use of video games for classroom teaching and learning. However, it did not specify the teachers’ prior experiences with video games or in game literacy. It also did not provide information about how the teachers integrated video games into classroom instruction and how this strategy might connect to a subject-orientated school curriculum. Future research is needed to examine cases of teachers’ classroom use of video games, including ways that educators connect to school curricula and relevant assessment methods.</p>
