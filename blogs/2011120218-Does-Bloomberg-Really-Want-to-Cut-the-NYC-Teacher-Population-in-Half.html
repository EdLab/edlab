            Possibly.  But only hypothetically and with a crucial caveat, that the good teachers be paid more.  Here is a portion of the speech in question given recently at MIT and featured in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2011/12/02/bloomberg-says-large-classes-are-fine-by-him/">New York Times School Book Blog</a>: 

<i>Education is very much, I've always thought, just like the real estate business. Real estate business, there are three things that matter: location, location, location is the old joke. Well in education, it is: quality of teacher, quality of teacher, quality of teacher. And I would–if I had the ability, which nobody does really, to just design a system and say, ‘ex cathedra, this is what we're going to do,' you would cut the number of teachers in half, but you would double the compensation of them, and you would weed out all the bad ones and just have good teachers. And double the class size with a better teacher is a good deal for the students.</i>

Most troubling to me, is not the fact that Bloomberg alludes to cutting the number of NYC teachers in half, but that he feels that larger class sizes will be ok in any context.  Even with an exceptional teacher, who is paid more, a larger (double no-less) class size is a recipe for disaster.  Historical studies like those featured in <a href="http://ed.gov/pubs/ReducingClass/Class_size.html">this archive</a> substantially prove that larger class size is often correlated with lower student performance, especially among minority students.   This correlation is also the case, though harder to prove, at the <a href="http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4471">higher ed level</a>.
