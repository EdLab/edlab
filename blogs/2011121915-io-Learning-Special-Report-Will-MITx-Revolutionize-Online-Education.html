            Will <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/mitx-faq-1219.html">M.I.T.x</a>, slated to launch in Spring 2012, be the most ground-breaking online education platform since the institution launched their suite of online courses as "OpenCourseWare" over 10 years ago?  Could M.I.T.x surpass the popularity of Stanford's 100K+ student-strong <a href="https://www.ai-class.com/home/">AI course</a> (Explore more <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6634">here</a>)?  The answer is possibly, maybe.  Richard DeMillo, director of the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/research/21stcenturyuniversities">Center for 21st Century Universities at the Georgia Institute of Technology</a> certainly thinks so, “... I think M.I.T. offering a credential will make quite a splash. If I were still in industry and someone came in with an M.I.T.x credential, I'd take it.”  Read more in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/education/mit-expands-free-online-courses-offering-certificates.html?_r=1&nl=technology&emc=techupdateema21">this</a> New York Times article.

<b>Tentative Details...</b>
What you ask are the main differentiators as laid-out in preliminary plans?  <b>First,</b> a proprietary platform is being developed based on research into how people learn that is currently underway at M.I.T.  This platform will also be free and open to any university that wants to adapt/adopt it to develop their own online learning programs.  Currently, M.I.T. only has available their original OCW collection of video-based lessons.  <b>Second,</b> enrichment materials and adaptive learning technologies will be integrated into the platform, from online laboratories and self-assessments to student-to-student discussions, M.I.T.x will be operate as a distinctly different learning environment than what has come before from the institution.  <b>Finally,</b> while free to take courses, the new platform will include the opportunity for individuals to, for a small fee, earn credentials.  This is one of the first times (Stanford offered a free "statement of accomplishment" through the Advanced track of their AI course) an institution has offered free courses with a small fee for credentialing.  It remains to be seen how much weight these credentials will be given and exactly what metrics will be used to determine mastery.  For now the very fact that they are being considered by a world-class institution as a way to lower the barrier to knowledge at their university is an exciting leap in the right direction.   

<b>EdLab Relevance & Take-aways...</b>
As we continue to explore and evolve our mSchool model and plans it will be vital to monitor the success or failure of M.I.T.x.  How can we create a proprietary learning environment that takes the features, functions and plans for M.I.T.x even further?  What is the next frontier?   As we explored in a recent D&R meeting led by <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/2602">Skanda</a> & <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/2553">Fred</a> is online testing a possible faster & cheaper avenue to credentials?  An interesting element of the M.I.T.x plans for the EdLab to explore is that the platform will be open-source and available to all universities to adapt at will.   What are the pros & cons for our projects if we keep platforms as open as possible for other to test and adapt?  Also, the credentials offered from M.I.T.x will not be from M.I.T. per se, but instead, from a separate non-profit credentialing group that the institution is developing especially for the initiative and this might be an option we explore for the mSchool.  The future of higher-ed level online learning looks brighter than ever before, and once M.I.T. launches M.I.T.x those bright lights will have the credentials to prove it.
