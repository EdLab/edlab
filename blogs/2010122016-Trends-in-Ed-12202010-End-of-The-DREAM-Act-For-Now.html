            In a flurry of activities before breaking for the holidays, the Senate decided two pieces of contentious legislation this past weekend. First, it voted to repeal the military's “don't ask, don't tell” policy, which in effect will now allow openly gay men and women to serve in the military without fear of retribution. The second piece of legislation concerned the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. The Dream Act will give students of illegal parents a chance to attend college or enlist in the armed forces, a step which will put them on the path for legalization and eventual citizenship. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/12/18/senate-tries-pass-dream-act/">The Senate voted not to hear the Dream Act.</a> Immigration is expected to be one of the key issues on the agenda awaiting the next Congress when it takes office in mid-January. 

When Congress commences next year, Republicans will have the majority in the House and have enough seats in the Senate to filibuster any piece of legislation. As expected, the Republicans want to flex their political muscle with its new members and as such secured enough votes for a filibuster to derail the passage of the DREAM Act until it comes up for a vote again. The Senate's decision means for undocumented students, their only probable chance to change their legal standing is over until further notice. The debate surrounding immigration is split along party lines, with Republicans viewing the DREAM Act as a backdoor step for illegal immigrants, whether they are students or not. Supporters of the Act are already preparing for the next fight of what is expected to be a long and controversial issue.
