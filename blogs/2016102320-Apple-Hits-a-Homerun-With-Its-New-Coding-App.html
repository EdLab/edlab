<p>In September, Apple released a new app, Swift Playgrounds, that teaches people how to code using Swift, the actual programming language used to create apps for Apple products. Geared toward late-elementary and middle school children, Swift Playgrounds is appropriate for classroom and free time learning. The app looks similar to Apple’s app store because users browse the games and challenges before deciding which ones they want to add to their collection, except all the options are free.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>While many learn-to-code apps stop their instruction after basic commands, Swift Playgrounds teaches users an entire coding language. Users learn Swift by solving puzzles in a 3D world, most of which involve moving Byte, the game’s main character, around the landscape to accomplish tasks. There are currently two levels in the app: the Fundamentals of Swift and Beyond the Basics. Each level contains lessons grouped by coding skill. For instance, players start with a series of challenges on commands, then work their way through other topics such as functions, loops, and algorithms.</p>
 
<p>Players learn each lesson entirely by doing. They’re presented with a particular challenge, such as collecting gems or toggling switches, and must enter the correct series of codes to accomplish it. The app provides a list of the commands, but players must order to solve the challenge. When users run their code, Byte will follow their commands exactly as it is written.</p>
 
<p>A task such as teaching an entire coding language to kids could be overwhelming, but the lessons in Swift Playgrounds build on each other in small increments. Each lesson is a manageable piece. Although users can skip to any lesson at any time, it’s unlikely they’ll be able to accomplish later lessons without first going through the ones leading up to it. While Apple developers were creating the app, they received feedback from both educators and young students to make sure the game is accessible and entertaining for children.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The only downside to Swift Playgrounds is that it has such limited availability right now. It is restricted to iPads with the most recent operating system. Also, currently the app only has five challenges to supplement the two main lesson sets, though Apple will continue to release new ones. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Swift Playgrounds is a fantastic app for kids to learn the basics of coding. It’s a series of puzzles that are both challenging and fun that will please children and educators. In addition to completing lessons and challenges, users can create their own playgrounds and share them with others, meaning that it could appeal to seasoned coders as well. Although the app only teaches one language, Swift, users are able to apply these basic coding skills to any programming field.</p>
