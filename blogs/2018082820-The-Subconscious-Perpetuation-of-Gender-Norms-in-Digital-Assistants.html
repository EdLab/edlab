<p>The first digital assistants that spoke to us were navigation devices like Garmin. I can still remember swapping the Garmin voice between American and British accents, but one thing that never changed was the fact that the Garmin was a <i>she</i>. This trend has continued with digital assistants today like Siri, Alexa, and Google Home. While you can change these devices to speak with a masculine voice, the feminine default setting definitely says something about societal gender norms.</p>

<p>Studies have found that people tend to listen to female voices a little bit more and feel more comfortable asking them to complete tasks. One reason for this could be that assistant, secretary, and phone operator roles have mostly fallen upon women, so people are more accustomed to speaking to female voices in these contexts and therefore might trust a female-voiced digital device more.</p>

<p>But regardless of the reason, the question remains: by always defaulting digital assistant voices to female, are we perpetuating antiquated gender norms for women? Would you ever set your digital assistantâ€™s voice to male? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44282">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:57 Melanie Hering:</b> I wonder if there have been studies done about how people treat Siri differently when it is set to a male vs. female voice. We tend to be pretty abusive of our digital assistants, and I wonder if there'd be a slight difference in treatment of male-voiced assistants.</p>

<p><b>@02:28 Dallas Milanovich:</b> This is what I always think of - the traditional image of a secretary is a woman. Not saying it's right, but it's what we automatically imagine, so digital assistants fit into our expectations. I think these devices should all be like Siri and offer both male and female voice options to challenge the norm.</p>
