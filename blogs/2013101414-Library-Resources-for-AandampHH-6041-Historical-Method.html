            <span style="font-weight: normal">This research guide is an overview of library resources specifically prepared for Professor Cally White's class: A&amp;HH6041, Historical Methods. The guide describes resources available within TC, as well as an extended overview of digitally accessible archives in New York State and beyond. </span>
<h2>Library catalogs</h2>
<strong>ONLINE CATALOGS</strong>

<a title="EDUCAT" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/">EDUCAT</a> is the online library catalog at Teachers College. It shows all the books, journals, e-journals, e-books, media, and other resources available specifically at TC.
<ul>
	<li>See our video on <a title="Searching EDUCAT" href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/273">how to search in EDUCAT</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a title="CLIO" href="http://library.columbia.edu/">CLIO</a> is the online catalog for all of the Columbia University libraries, excluding Teachers College, Columbia Law School, and Jewish Theological Seminary. If you cannot find resources on EDUCAT, then search for them in CLIO.
<ul>
	<li>See our video on <a title="Searching in CLIO" href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/276">how to search in CLIO</a>.</li>
</ul>
For both catalogs, if you already know the resource you want, you should search by title or author. If you do not know these, then a good option is to search by subject.

<strong>SEARCHING BY SUBJECT</strong>

Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) are the official subject terms used in academic libraries in the United States. Some subject headings relevant to this course are listed below. Search for these under the “subject” tab in EDUCAT or by selecting “subject” in the drop-down menu in CLIO.
<ul>
	<li>Education — United States — Historiography</li>
	<li>Education — United States — History</li>
	<li>Historiography</li>
	<li>Historiography — History</li>
	<li>History — Methodology</li>
	<li>History — Philosophy</li>
	<li>History — Research</li>
	<li>History — Study and teaching</li>
	<li>History–Study and teaching (Elementary)</li>
	<li>History–Study and teaching (Secondary)</li>
	<li>History — [time period, e.g. 20th century]</li>
	<li>Paper — Preservation — United States</li>
	<li>United States — Historiography</li>
	<li>United States — History</li>
	<li>Women — Education</li>
</ul>
For more details on how to find subject headings on your own and search with them, see this guide for <a title="Searching by subject in EDUCAT" href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/llange/searching-by-subject-on-educat">searching by subject in EDUCAT</a>.

<strong>SEARCHING FOR CURRICULUM MATERIALS &amp; TEXTBOOKS</strong>

The subject headings in the list above which include “Study and teaching” will lead you directly to curriculum materials, which are almost entirely located on the second floor reading room in the library. Using the term "study and teaching" differentiates books about a subject from books about how to teach a subject. For further tips, see this <a title="How to search for textbooks" href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/llange/searching-for-textbooks">detailed overview of how to search for textbooks</a>.

<h2>TC archives: PocketKnowledge</h2>
<strong>OVERVIEW:</strong>

What kinds of items tend to be in pocket knowledge?

Pocket knowledge is the institutional repository for Teachers College, which holds papers, dissertations, and other works authored by TC faculty, staff, students, and alumni. It is also the digital archive of the library, which means it holds digitized items of historical value to TC and/or the education field.  This includes correspondence, photographs, manuscripts, diaries, and other items. For instance,<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/33186?browseby=chart&amp;sortfiles=volume&amp;optdisplay=0"> the diaries of William Kilpatrick</a> are in PocketKnowledge, as are <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/45192">Victor D’Amico’s architectural drawings</a> and papers.

<strong>Who has access?</strong>
Teachers College and Columbia students, faculty, staff, and TC alumni.

<strong>GETTING IN:</strong>

First, you need an account to view files.

<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/login/redirect=browse">To open an account</a>: you need to be a TC or Columbia student. Click “log in” and then “sign up” which will walk you through the steps.

<strong>SEARCH:</strong>

To find items, you can enter search terms either in “pockets” or in “tags,” or, for the most exhaustive results, try “search all.” (To do this, click the advanced options, and select “all.”) To survey what collections exist in the database, click “search and browse all items” at the top of the screen, which will allow you to browse.

<strong>BROWSING:</strong>

Items are stored in Pockets, which is a collection of items linked by a common topic; you may want to simply browse the pockets to see what types of collections we have. You can also browse tags, which are descriptors providing access points to individual items across the collections (ie pockets). Tags operate similarly to “subject terms” in EDUCAT or the “thesaurus” in an electronic database of articles. It’s handy to know which terms someone else used to describe an item because we all describe things differently.

<strong>COLLECTIONS OF INTRIGUE:</strong>

<strong>There are many, but here is a small sampling:
</strong>

<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/42937">Manuscript Group 1</a> (valuable education manuscripts circa 1682-1983 written by a host of famous historical figures)

<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/74239?browseby=chart&amp;sortfiles=volume&amp;optdisplay=0">Rothman Lantern Slide Collection</a> (images from WW1)

<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/29542?browseby=chart&amp;sortfiles=volume&amp;optdisplay=0">Florence Nightingale Collection</a>

<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/4944?browseby=chart&amp;sortfiles=volume&amp;optdisplay=0">Historic Portraits of TC Faculty Collection</a>

<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/32085?browseby=chart&amp;sortfiles=volume&amp;optdisplay=0">Adelaide Nutting Historical Nursing Collection</a>
<h2>Digital archives outside TC</h2>

<strong>NAVIGATING THE COLLECTIONS</strong>

Each of the above collections offer ways to search by keyword or by subject term. Some of the collections offer advanced boolean search options while others do not. Note that each collection has its own guide for how to search it most efficiently. Once you are in a collection performing a search, you're searching within that collection.

The collections are organized by <em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em>. If you don't already know which subject headings describe your topic, your best bet is to search by keywords. If you’re curious to know more, check out the resources below:

<h3>Using the Library of Congress Digital Archives Creatively</h3>
<a href="http://www.tejucole.com/">Teju Cole</a>, author of OPEN CITY, has been using the <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Library of Congress Historical Newspaper Collection</a> to create <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/04/09/150068298/simple-tweets-of-fate-teju-coles-condensed-news">daily tweets reflecting accounts of murder</a> and mayhem from exactly one hundred years ago. He collects these “news of the weird” tidbits on his <a href="https://twitter.com/tejucole">Twitter feed</a>.

<strong>AN IN-DEPTH APPROACH TO TWO OF THE DIGITAL ARCHIVES LISTED ABOVE</strong>

<strong>National Archives (NARA) :</strong>

The National Archives are quite simply “the nation’s record keeper.” They famously hold documents such as the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence. (Those major documents are held at the DC branch—the MD office holds 2 million cubic feet of materials!) They also hold military records, immigration records, land records, the US census data, genealogical data, and more. The digital collections are a way for users around the country to access their materials from the comfort of the classroom.

<a href="http://docsteach.org/"><strong>DocsTeach</strong></a> is a new software developed by NARA specifically to assist social studies teachers in using these collections in their classroom. There are three ways to use this software:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://docsteach.org/documents">Explore their vast ready-made collections</a> developed around time periods in our nation’s history and develop a plan on the fly or create a plan ahead of time in your own style.</li>
	<li><a href="http://docsteach.org/activities">Use their ready-made lesson plans</a> created around the above-mentioned collections. Within each collection there are a series of different lesson plan approaches, all developed by NARA.</li>
	<li><a href="http://docsteach.org/tools">Use their software</a> to place images you’ve stored in folders into their lesson-plan templates. There are a variety of template styles for you to choose from. You need to set up an account with them to use this option.</li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>

<strong><a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/education/teachers/curriculum-library">THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY CURRICULUM LIBRARY</a>:</strong>

What’s here: in an effort to “make history come alive” the NYHS offers curriculum related kits to help teachers use their digital collections in the classroom.  Staged as a series of exhibits, their lesson plans align with the New York State Learning Standards.

<strong>New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War</strong>

Covers the contentious divide in NYS over slavery and the Civil War through images, documents, maps, letters, and text, with accompanying lesson plans designed using their materials. They provide an overall <a href="http://nydivided.org/Education/">lesson plan by PDF</a>, as well as lessons by unit.

<strong>For a structured approach:</strong> The exhibit is broken down in multiple ways, including sections on <a href="http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/">Pro-South NY</a>, <a href="http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T2/">Fighting Slavery</a>, and <a href="http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T3/">Civil War</a>. These are structured narratives already put together by the NYH for you to share with your students.

<strong>For a less structured approach</strong>, they also break up the materials by <a href="http://nydivided.org/popup/People/BlackSoldiers.php">people</a>, <a href="http://nydivided.org/popup/Places/ATStewartStore.php">places</a>, and<a href="http://nydivided.org/popup/Documents/AlbionBroadside.php">documents</a>, which each contain images and accompanying texts.

<strong>In their own words</strong>: “This is not the American history that our grandparents learned in school. Exciting new discoveries and new questions asked by recent generations of scholars have upended our understanding of the national past, including that of New York City and State,” says James O. Horton, the chief historian of the exhibition.

<strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>

This is both an exhibition and a database of original documents (digitized, of course). This exhibition is an excellent example of a non-linear learning platform, where students can learn by seeing visual accompaniments to textual historical notes, but because the site guides its viewers through history through components one can click at will and in any order, it offers a model for a non-textbook approach for students who have trouble learning linearly.

The exhibit includes various approaches to understanding Hamilton:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/virtualtour/good.html">A virtual tour with audio clips</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/nyc_and_nj.html">Virtual maps</a> guiding users through key historical moments in NY and NJ</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/letters/07_02.html">A calendar of facts</a> (which would make it easy to tweet history aka Teju Cole)</li>
	<li>Four <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/document_viewer/start.html">pivotal documents</a> with handy transcriptions</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/timeline/index.html">timeline</a> of his vast and intriguing life</li>
	<li>A way to understand him in the <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/gallery/index.html">context of his peers</a></li>
</ul>
There’s also a <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/database/index.html">document database</a> if you are looking for something specific and want to do a search. However, another way of approaching this collection is to scour through the entire contents, <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/about/contents.html">HERE</a>.

And if all of this isn’t a tidy enough package, they have put together pdf documents with lesson plans specifically for <a href="http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/about/teachers.html">teachers using this collection.</a>
