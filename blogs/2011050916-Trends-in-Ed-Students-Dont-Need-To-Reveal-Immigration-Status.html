          <p>
            In the increasingly partisan and political battle over immigration, it seems almost no one is immune from an inspection of his or her immigration status. Last week, the <a href="http://www.care2.com/causes/education/blog/yes-immigrant-children-have-the-right-to-go-to-us-public-schools/">US Department of Education sent a memo</a> to all public schools districts and states declaring that school districts don't have the right to ask or request documentation that may reveal a student's legal status. In the memo, the DOE plainly states, "the undocumented or noncitizen status of a student (or his or her parent or guardian) is irrelevant to that student's entitlement to an elementary and secondary public school education." The DOE's reasoning in the memo is based on the 1982 US Supreme Court case <i>Plyler v. Doe</i>, which guaranteed â€œthe right of all children, regardless of immigration status, to attend public school as long as they [have] met the age and residency requirements set by state law."

The DOE's memo came indirectly as a result of several school districts requesting certain documentation from students that may show their legal standing. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found around 139 school districts in New York where school officials requested the immigration papers of prospective students. States such as New Jersey and Maryland have taken steps to stop the practice while other states such as Tennessee and Arizona are considering legislation that will make it mandatory for all students to reveal their legal status during enrollment.
