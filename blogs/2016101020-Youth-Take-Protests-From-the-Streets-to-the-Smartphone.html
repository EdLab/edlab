<p>Youth movements have often been the catalyst for social change within societies. Yet, when we think of protest or activism, we donâ€™t often think of smart phones or technology. However, recently published research points to ways students are using mobile devices in order to democratize spaces in the classroom and society as a whole. </p>

<p>While people's support groups used to be limited to those they could call, social media platforms have greatly expanded networks and people's ability to influence those networks. In this study, the research team used case studies to demonstrate how youth-led mobile movements are a force for social good. They referenced macro events like the Arab Spring, and micro revolutionists like 13-year-old Trisha Prabhu, who became a finalist in the Google Science Fair after creating a Cyberbullying Prevention app. They also pointed to organizations like YouthRadio that work with students to design mobile app solutions for youth participation in news media. These cases serve as proof of the cooperative opportunities students undertake through mobile phones to fill needs for themselves and their communities.</p>

<p>The authors claim that many educators have still not utilized mobile products to their full potential in classrooms. With <a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2015/03/02/teachers-parents-react-to-first-day-of-school-cell-phone-ban-lift/#.V88oomWCxFI">legislation now allowing cell phones in the classroom </a>and research supporting the benefits they bring to students, educators have more opportunities than ever to create spaces for mobile learning, especially ones that promote social good.
