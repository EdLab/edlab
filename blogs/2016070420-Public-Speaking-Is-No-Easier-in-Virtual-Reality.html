<p>More than heights and death, people fear public speaking. But with the advent of online courses, lectures, and group discussions, not all speech giving is done in public anymore. The question is, do people become as nervous when making a speech in front of a virtual audience as they do in front of a real one? Seeking to answer this question, a recent study compared people’s stress responses while giving speeches in real settings to those in virtual settings.</p>
 
<p>The participants in the study presented a five minute speech in front of one of three settings: a live audience, a virtual audience using a virtual reality (VR) headset, and an empty virtual lecture hall. The researchers collected data on the participants’ stress responses by measuring their physiological responses, as well as their self-reported feelings.</p>
 
<p>The results may surprise you: the participants had nearly equal stress responses when giving speeches to both real and virtual audiences. In each case, the researchers noticed that heart rate, blood flow, sweating, and pupil dilation all increased at comparable levels. In addition, the participants’ self-reports demonstrated that they felt equally stressed in both situations. The control group, those who spoke in front of an empty virtual lecture hall, had significantly lower stress responses compared to either of the other groups.</p>
 
<p>This study may be bad news for anyone with a fear of public speaking, as it demonstrates that even using a VR headset to speak to a virtual audience incites stress responses difficult to overcome. As long as there are people in the audience (real or not) the speaker will likely have elevated levels of anxiety. As VR is being used in more educational settings, this study reminds us that even in digital environments public speaking is difficult, unless, that is, VR provides a way to delete the audience. </p>
