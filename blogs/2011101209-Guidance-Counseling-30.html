            When you think back to your high school experience and how you chose your college/career path... was your school guidance counselor's advice pivotal in these decisions?  In my case, the answer is yes.  However, due to the current economy and rapidly shifting career landscape, many high-schoolers are making these decisions without the support past generations relied on.  To help solve this problem many new options are emerging.  The future of school guidance is here and it's... online. 

<b>History</b> 
School Counseling (also called Guidance Counseling) got its start at the beginning of the 20th century and was focused solely on “vocational guidance.”  Fast-forward to the 50's & the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik... this event alone would forever change guidance counseling in schools.   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_counselor">From Wikipedia</a>, "Out of concern that the Russians were winning the space race and that there were not enough scientists and mathematicians, the government passed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Education_Act">National Defense Education Act</a>, spurring growth in vocational guidance through larger funding." 

School counseling further grew along with the Civil Rights movement to encourage an emphasis on personal development, not just vocational goals.  Later, in the 80's & 90's school counseling went into a decline as standards-based educational reforms made the counselors role less prominent.  Finally, <a href="http://www.edtrust.org/">The Education Trust</a> backed an initiative that led to the formation in the early 2000's of the <a href="http://www.edtrust.org/dc/tsc">National Center for Transforming School Counseling</a> (NCTSC) which has helped inform current best practice in the field.

<b>Current Trends</b>
Due to the United State's current economic crisis many school counselors are facing lay-offs and creating a lack of available college/career guidance for secondary students countrywide.  From <a href="http://neatoday.org/2011/02/07/counselors-often-hidden-heroes-in-america%E2%80%99s-schools/">Counselor's are Often Hidden Heros in America's Schools</a>: 

<i>In many school districts throughout the country, layoffs and budget cuts have decimated the ranks of school counselors and allowed counselor-to-student ratios to balloon. While the American School Counselor Association recommends a counselor-to-student ratio of 250-to-1, ratios in many states already exceed 500-to-1. Ratios could continue to increase as states plan new rounds of cuts for the 2011-2012 school year.</i>

In addition to the stress of finding the right path with less available guidance, recent college grads face some of the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">bleakest employment stats</a> in our nation's hisotry.  This fact, coupled with an unprecedented amount of  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/education/12college.html">school loan debt</a> makes the college preparation stakes that much higher.   Jennifer Openshaw, CEO of <a href="http://www.superfutures.com/home">SuperFutures</a> states, “I didn't have any great guidance and actually went to three undergraduate colleges, partly because of money but partly because I was still finding my way.  The bottom line is that today it is more important than ever that you make the most of your high school years, because that is your foundation.” 

<b>Future Directions</b>
Carol Frey points-out in <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2010/08/16/a-crash-course-in-college-preparedness?PageNr=3">this recent Us News & World Report piece</a> on college preparedness, “...the wise student is one who doesn't hesitate to seek out help on campusÂ­.  An even wiser one, many would agree, starts the journey with some curiosity and critical thinking long before freshman year.”  This insight is being cultivated for students using webinars and video-conferencing, resume and social networking "bootcamps" and traditional career and personal goals assessmenon on free sites like Bill & Melinda Gates grant recipient, <a href="http://getschooled.com/">Get Schooled</a>, and fee-based SuperFutures and <a href="http://www.naviance.com/">Naviance</a>.  These online resources are taking-over where brick & mortar institutions leave-off, helping to prepare students for careers whose requirements are very different than those of even the last few years.  Ms. Openshaw explains, “Many jobs of the future, we don't even know what those are yet today, so kids need to be equipped with the ability to think, to connect, to engage & the ability to make a decision about a career path they want to explore.”  

Obama outlines in his Blueprint for Education Reform how by the year 2020 all high school students will be "college and career ready."   Obama explicitly states that, “Today, more than ever, a world-class education is a prerequisite for success.”  How will young people attain this world-class education and advance on the world stage if those tasked with helping them to choose their future paths are becoming obsolete?   This is a question that perhaps only technology and groups like SuperFutures can help answer.
