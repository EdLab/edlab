            In accounting, one method that merchandisers use to determine the amount of inventories available and the cost of goods sold is the cost flow assumption method.  Under the cost flow assumption method, companies can use the FIFO (First in, first out) method, LIFO (Last in, first out) method, or the Average cost method. However, two of the methods that I want to discuss in today's blog are FIFO and LIFO. To use LIFO or FIFO, some companies use the periodic inventory system; which states that companies do not keep detailed inventory records of the goods on hand throughout the period.

Under FIFO, companies assume that the earliest goods purchased are the first ones sold. For example, if a company purchase goods on April 15th, August 18th and November 25th, they would assume that the earliest goods purchased were the first to be sold, in this case goods that were purchased in April. Thus to find the company's ending inventory, the units of the last purchased goods will be multiplied by its unit cost to find ending inventory (400 x 13)=$5200 and (300-250=50 x 12)=$600. We subtracted 250 from 330 to 50, which will give us the units in ending inventory. Then subtracting the cost of units not sold (ending inventory) (5200 + 600)=$5800 from cost of all goods available for sale ($12,000) will give us the cost of goods sold ($6,200).
 
An Illustration
DATE             EXPLANATION                UNITS        UNIT COST   TOTAL COST
Jan. 1	    Beginning Inventory        100		$10		  $1,000
April. 15       Purchased			   200		  11		    2,200
Aug. 18        Purchased			   300		  12		    3,600
Nov. 25        Purchased			   400		  13		    5,200

	  Total units available for sale	  1,000				  $12,000
	  Units in ending inventory	      450
	  Units Sold				      550

Under LIFO, companies assume that the latest goods purchased are the first to be sold. In LIFO, we use the units of the earliest purchased to find the ending inventory. Thus, {100+200+(300-150)}=450, which is the units of our ending inventory. To find the cost of the units not sold (ending inventory), we multiply every unit by their unit cost to get the ending inventory. (100 x 10)=$100, (200 x 11)=$2,200, and (150 x 12)=$1,800. Ending Inventory (100+2,200+1,800)=$5000, subtracted from cost of all goods available for sale ($12,000) to get the cost of goods sold ($7,000). The difference in the ending inventories and cost of goods sold of each method is due to the unit costs that the company allocated to the ending inventory. This is how companies determine how much they would make from selling their remaining inventory and how much they made from the goods they already sold.
