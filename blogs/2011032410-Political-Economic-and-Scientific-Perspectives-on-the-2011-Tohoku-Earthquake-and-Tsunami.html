          <p>
            Two days ago I attended an event held at Columbia Business School on "The Economic, Health, and Political Consequences of Japan's Earthquake" hosted by Columbia's Program for Economic Research and the Weatherhead East Asian Institute. David J. Brenner, Higgins Professor of Radiation Biophysics, Gerald L. Curtis, Burgess Professor of Political Science, and David E. Weinstein, Carl S. Shoup Professor of the Japanese Economy, all shared their insights from their respective disciplines. Needless to say, the event was highly informative. What really stood out to me was the confidence with which they spoke of Japan's future. After Professor Weinstein's somber opening in which he described anecdotal accounts of the earthquake and tsunami, each of them proceeded to establish a theme that things were simply not as bad as they have been portrayed by the Western media. 

Japan's political situation has long been criticized as too dysfunctional compared to political systems in other OECD countries. Yet contrary to this conventional wisdom, Professor Curtis made it clear that the Japanese government, currently under the leadership of the Democratic Party of Japan, has shown itself to be more competent and transparent than previous Liberal Democratic Party governments. In comparing how the LDP handled the 1995 Kobe Earthquake with the DPJ's handling of this current earthquake, Professor Curtis credited the DPJ for constantly having informed officials ready at hand to answer questions from the media and the public at nearly all times of the day. I remember watching CNN during spring break and seeing Anderson Cooper and Eliot Spitzer accusing Japanese government officials of being willfully opaque in their answers. Yet the truth of the matter was that the situation was very uncertain and the government was at risk of misinforming its people. Professor Curtis also took time to take on the criticism of the Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan as someone lacking in charisma. Unlike Americans, the Japanese people simply do not look for charisma in their leaders. Likewise, the sensationalistic nature of the American media seems directly at odds with the calm but informative coverage NHK, Japan's public broadcasting organization, has been providing. While Professor Curtis seemed to place most of the blame on the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) for lacking crisis preparation and an underlying complacency, it seemed clear from his analysis that the Japanese government's performance through this crisis has been better than expected given the severity and unique nature of the disaster.

Professor Weinstein's analysis of the economic picture in Japan was also quite encouraging. While the human loss from this crisis certainly has been significant and has by no means been cheap, going forward, the situation might not be so bleak. If we are to grasp anything about Japan's economy from how it responded to the Kobe earthquake, it must be the resiliency with which it bounced back from such an adverse supply shock. In fact, most of the literature on the economics of disasters has shown that economies with well-developed institutions, such as those found in OECD countries, easily rebound, even after significant human toll. In contrast, underdeveloped countries, such as Haiti, that do not have well-developed institutions, tend to suffer for many years following a natural disaster. These institutions include features such as property rights and the rule of law as well as the quality of technology and public goods available. Thus, from both Professor Weinstein's account and the existing economic literature, it seems clear that Japan will be able to rebound over the medium to long term from this disaster, barring any significant increase in radioactive material at the Fukushima reactors. 

Yet many are indeed worrying about how the troubles at the Fukushima reactors will affect an already dire situation. Concerns over radiation levels are largely overdone, according to Professor Brenner, as he claimed that even if the reactor released the same amount of radioactive particles as it has in these past couple of weeks, cancer risks increase less than .01% for the nearest 100,000 people. If there was a sharp increase in the amount of radioactive particles, cancer risks would increase less than .05% for the nearest 500,000 people. Likewise, worries about Iodine-131 and Cesium-137 isotopes entering the milk and spinach supply are probably overblown as well. The half-life of I-131 is 8 days; thus, even if milk is found to be radioactive, as long as it is not consumed for enough time, the levels of radiation will naturally come down to a tolerable level in fairly short time. Additionally, even though Cesium has a much longer half-life, approximately 30 years, the levels of Cesium found in the Japanese food supply have not even come close to exceeding FDA regulation levels. That being said, Professor Brenner did make clear that Cesium-levels would need to be monitored closely since it would likely enter and remain in the food supply for many years, although probably not at dangerous levels. Nevertheless, those who claim to fall sick because of the increased radiation are most likely reacting as a psycho-social response than any actual radiation sickness.

In hearing these scholars opine on the Japanese situation, I was struck by how reliable Japanese media had been in contrast to the sensationalist nature of the American television media. Yet this is an important distinction to make since so many rely on television media for the latest information on crises and catastrophes. I was equally impressed by how much institutions can make a difference in disaster relief and recovery. While this is not directly related to EdLab's efforts with the National Center for Disaster Preparedness in improving courses such as one on "Basic Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication for Public Health Workers" for the CDC, it is still important to underscore that such efforts are probably vastly underrated for their economic value. Cost-benefit analyses have clearly shown that effective disaster preparedness are worth the given costs, especially when it simply involves the dissemination of information.
