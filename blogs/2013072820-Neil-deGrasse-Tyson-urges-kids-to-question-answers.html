If science had its version of rock stars, Neil deGrasse Tyson would be in the Hall of Fame. He’s a physicist by trade but may be more well known throughout certain online communities as the ultimate source of witty science-related one-liners. <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/neil-degrasse-tyson-reaction">He even has his own meme!</a> He’s able to reach younger people in a way that has eluded many science educators before him; and when he speaks, they listen. <p>

That’s why when Neil Tyson says that kids need to up their science literacy skills, it doesn’t fall on deaf ears. Kids are naturally inquisitive, he explains. They explore and question. They bang pots and observe. But as they grow, somewhere along the way they lose their inherent inclination to investigate, gather information, and challenge "facts." Without this analytic thinking, kids are susceptible to believe everything without question. But as a role model and leading science authority, Tyson serves as a beacon for all those who would otherwise be lost in a sea of gullibility. <p>

To weigh in on the importance of scientific inquiry for both children and adults, join the conversation on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9837">Vialogues</a>. <br>

<p><b>@00:00 yiu.mable:</b> I really like how he talks about the importance of curiosity. I think that it is something that is key for all people to have in order to really learn and think more. <br>

<p><b>@1:30 MartinPaper:</b> "What level of inquiry do you bring?" I know plenty of adults who are more likely to blindly believe what they hear over questioning it.<br>

<p><b>@3:30 YogiP:</b> Sadly, while many kids are at first encouraged to think scientifically, they are equally discouraged to question authority figures.
