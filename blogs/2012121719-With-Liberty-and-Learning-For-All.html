Mark Surman is in the game of openness. As the executive director of the Mozilla Foundation, he is committed to combining open technology with internet culture to transform education.  He also served on the committee for the Digital Media and Learning Conference earlier this year, with his sub-theme focusing on democratizing learning innovation. 
<p>
In this interview with new media specialist Howard Rheingold, Mark paints an exciting picture of the future of education that involves breaking the chains of an oppressive system lived by millions of students worldwide. He credits the internet for allowing information to be freely accessible, and people for taking charge of their own learning experiences. 
<p>
In an attempt to bring teens into the conversation, Mark describes a series of workshops known as "Hackasaurus" that encourages teens to discover how to "remix the web." In Markâ€™s opinion, "everybody needs to learn how to code, at least a little bit." To make Hackasaurus participants feel involved from the get-go, they are asked repeatedly for their feedback as it relates to the workshops; they essentially become their own learning designers. This is the goal that Mark seems most excited about hitting: to cultivate a community of participants who are also creators of their own learning environment, and who subsequently develop learning innovations.

<b>@2:07 DLales:</b> Hackasaurus- a set of learning activities for teenagers, helping them remix the web. Is this an introduction to programming?

<p>
<b>@3:22 jagnitti:</b> Oo.. what's a "design jam" I wonder?
