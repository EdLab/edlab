          <p>
            The New York Times published a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/education/07winerip.html">article</a> criticizing New York City's push to pay teachers based on value-added. While the article could have been more informative, its overall point that value-added is highly imperfect system seems valid. A line from one of my favorite edublogs, The Quick & The Ed, sums it up quite nicely, "Value-added is the worst form of teacher evaluation but it's better than everything else."

Here is what I see as the good, the bad, and the ugly of value-added:

The Good: Value-added provides an intuitive way of determining what teachers produce when certain variables, most notably socioeconomic status, are controlled for. To put it simply, NYT needs to give more information on the demographics of Ms. Isaacson's students. Socioeconomic status and test scores fall in tandem all too often. We also ought to know how many students in prior years and in comparable classes got into Stuyvesant. This sort of information is essential if we are to place our faith in an anecdotal sob story, whether true or not. The question NYT fails to ask is would another (or the average) teacher have done better? It may be the case that the answer is no, but clearly this article is more narrative than analysis.

The Bad: One of the problems I have with the value-added model is its dependence on one posttest minus one pretest. Doesn't this amount to relying on a sample size of one? It would make more sense to move to a system that depends on multiple evaluations of various kinds (summative, interim, and formative) throughout the year? Then testing flukes could be more easily identifiable and thrown out. In doing so, I have to think that teacher quality also becomes more easily observable. This is also an area where technology can come to be quite useful. Evaluations are often costly but technology can make such processes less cumbersome. With more information available, estimates of student achievement and teacher quality can become far more robust

The Ugly: Going to two decimal points in determining the average score, when individual scores are whole numbers, is probably a major source for error propagation. Ms. Isaacson's students, if evaluated on a more detailed scale, could have scored anywhere between 2.50-3.49. There are undoubtedly students who are close to getting a 4 but end up with a 3 and students with a 3 who easily could have received a 2. While it would be nice to say that, on the whole, these numbers average themselves out, Ms. Isaacson is not teaching an infinite number of students. It could very well be the case that most of her students who received 4s were on the border between 3 and 4. If we are going to expect teachers to improve the average testing score by such precise numbers, we ought to at least give them more precise individual testing scores. 

Ultimately, proponents of value-added merit pay must admit that output observation in education is still incredibly fallible. While it makes sense to make employment and paycheck decisions on both output and input, these decisions should still be based primarily on those inputs that are observable and add value until better evaluation systems are established.
