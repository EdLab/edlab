<p><b>Title:</b> Undergraduates’ Text Messaging Language and Literacy Skills (2014)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abbie Grace, Nenagh Kemp, Frances Heritage Martin, & Rauno Parrila</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11145-013-9471-2">Reading and Writing</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How does texting affect undergraduate literacy skills?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> While some research has shown that texting increases the literacy skills of children, not much is known about its impact on college students. This study looked at 150 students at a university in Western Canada and 86 students in a university in Eastern Australia. All of the students were native English speakers. The study investigated the use of "naturalistic textism" by asking the participants to sound out words in a nonword reading task and complete spelling tasks. In addition, the students in Australia were asked to complete real word and nonword reading tasks, a phonological processing task, a questionnaire regarding their reading history to understand word knowledge and vocabulary, and a nonverbal reasoning task.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b> For both groups using "oftextisms"(such as u for you) and textism, defined as "abbreviations or re-spelling," there was a negative correlation with spelling. For the Australian students there was a negative correlation between textism use and scores for timed nonword reading, spoonerisms, and personal reading history. In addition, the duration of cell phone ownership was negatively correlated with spelling, but positively correlated with Word Attack, a subtest on the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test. In addition, for the Australians, the number of messages sent per day was negatively correlated with Word Attack scores. Finally the researchers found, "Australian students who thought that using textisms was more appropriate had poorer nonword reading and reported having had more difficulty learning to read, than those who found it less appropriate."</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The study concludes that a host of factors, such as culture, attitude, and personality, all contribute to texting’s effect on individual literacy. This suggests that we should tread carefully when it comes to using texting for educational purposes. Despite this, the conclusion is certainly not that phone use is bad. Phone apps that suggest more advanced words or have an interactive word check might help inspire more literate texting. There are big opportunities for new ideas in the world of cell phone-based writing.</p>
