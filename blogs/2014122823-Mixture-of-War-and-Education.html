            In the Arab world, many children are at great risk because of conflict and turmoil. As we all know, war is very destructive and deadly. Many children in the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/09/27/schools-close-libya-gaza-iraq-middle-east-islamic-state/16117227/" target = "blank">Arab world have been forced to quit school due to conflict</a>. Thus, many children don't have access to education. For instance in Iraq, thousands have taken shelter in schools in the Kurdistan region and elsewhere. This is one of the reasons why many children in Iraq can't go to school. Consequently, parents have chosen not to care about their children's education due to the ongoing conflict. 

Another region in the Arab world facing educational challenges as a result of war is Gaza. During the recent conflict there, an estimated 2,100 Gazans were killed, 500 of them were children. Additionally, 81 schools were damaged, and at least 90 served as shelters for up to 290,000 displaced people. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) built these schools. The purpose of having school buildings is to provide a safe and secure learning environment for children. If there are no school buildings, it will be hard for children to study.

Similarly, in Syria, reports from Save the Children suggest that the war has caused trauma that interferes with children's ability to learn. This demonstrates that children are not only affected physically by war, but psychologically it interferes with their studies as well.
