<a href=”http://www.coredogs.com”>CoreDogs</a> is a <a href=”http://www.flippedtextbook.com”>“flipped textbook”</a> designed to teach the core skills behind building websites. [This type of flipped learning is slightly different than the flipped learning discussed <a href=”http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/us/25iht-educside25.html?smid=pl-share”>in the NY Times today</a>.] The concept is built around the idea that students learn better when engaged in active outcome-based learning focused on specific real-world tasks with ample opportunity to practice their skills, while the instructor's role is to help the student along and offer guidance.

This video explains the basic concept:

<b>Pros:</b>
For starters, their slogan is “Effective, efficient, and with dogs.” The “with dogs” part is an interesting gimmick, and one that I, as a dog-person, totally respond to. (I guess that would be less of a pro if I didn't like dogs.) The characters that guide you through the lessons in a quasi-Socratic fashion are dogs, and the examples are mostly dog-themed. It gives an interesting consistency to the examples and materials.

There are also integrated exercises that can easily be shared with either the CoreDogs community or just a handful of others (like classmates or an instructor). Anyone designated as a reviewer is then given a notification that there's an assignment for review, and a rubric is given along with quick answer comments (because different students in the same class might be at different places in the curriculum with a flipped-style course). An instructor can also use the CoreDogs curriculum in conjunction with more traditional teaching approaches. As important as the flipped learning is to CoreDogs, equally important is the idea of deep knowledge, where students learn on a task-based basis instead of learning concepts without applying them.

<b>Cons:</b>
While there are active learning elements in each of the lessons in the form of exercises, and there is an element of humor injected into each of the lessons, I couldn't help but feel that the lessons would come more to life with the addition of some short videos or other interactive features.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Learning tools that embrace technology, especially collaborative technologies, are always of interest to the EdLab. While CoreDogs is a little sparse in the collaborative aspect, and interactivity is on the low end, the entire concept of flipped textbooks and learning is quite interesting. It made me think a lot of the <a href=”http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7847”>EdLab seminar</a> this past week with <a href=”http://eduss.com/”>EDUSS</a>. There seems to be a real undercurrent of change in education, ushered in by technology, and it'll be interesting to see where it goes.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
CoreDogs and the flipped textbook method appear to show a lot of promise and present a nice counterpoint to much of technology instruction.
