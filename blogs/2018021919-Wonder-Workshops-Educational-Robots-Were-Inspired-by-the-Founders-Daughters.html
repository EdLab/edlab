<p><i>"While Lincoln Logs and LEGOs were the building blocks of past generations’ play, coding is the tool of the 21st century kid."</i> (<a href="https://www.makewonder.com/about">Wonder Workshop</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Coding Bots</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.makewonder.com">Wonder Workshop</a> is a Silicon Valley-based startup that specializes in educational robots. The company’s CleverBots are programmable robots that have been designed to introduce kids to skills for future careers. Through a free mobile app, children can program these robots to perform various tasks, such as rolling through a maze. The app comes with hundreds of preloaded missions for children to explore, which allow them to problem solve and learn to code as they play.</p>

<p>The educational bots come in three models ranging in price from around $70 for the basic Dot bot, to around $150 for the remote control car-like editions, Dash and Cue. Dot and Dash are targeted at kids ages six and above, while Cue is designed for early teens. These CleverBots were even named one of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s "favorite STEM gifts for kids."</p>

<p><b>Inspired by Their Daughters</b></p>
<p>Co-founder Vikas Gupta was inspired to create the company after his daughter was born. He was dismayed at the low numbers of women in technical fields and believed that the problem started young, as girls were discouraged from engaging with tech-related toys or activities. He and the other co-founders, Saurabh Gupta and Mikal Greaves, set out to make educational toys that could attract girls.</p>

<p>In early design phases, the founders would bring home prototypes for their daughters to play with. After getting complaints that early models looked like a "boy’s toy," the three went back to the lab for a redesign. They incorporated the feedback and used gender neutral color tones in the final models. Today, girls are engaging with CleverBots just like boys, and an all-girl team even captured the top prize at the company’s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/community/hartland/2017/03/28/pink-eagles-win/99733476/">Wonder League Robotics Competition</a> in 2017.</p>
