<b>Description</b>
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that, I have it on good authority, is used by a best-selling author (who I cannot name).  I am also told that it is popular among software developers.  Using it, one breaks up work on a task into 25 minute chunks, separated by 5 minute breaks.  Thinking of work as divided into discrete chunks also helps one better manage and visualize a work schedule, as progress can be quantified and tracked across time.   There are a variety of apps that that serve as pomodoro timers, but I picked Pomodairo:

<b>Pros</b>
Pomodairo is simply and unobtrusive, and it also offers a task list for you to put up your schedule.  It also keeps track of your Pomodoro usage, so you can look back on the statistics of your working behavior.  It will also integrate with Twitter (if that's what you're into).

<b>Cons</b>
As you might expect, it's not a particularly sophisticated program, and for the future I would like to see the pomodoro technique, or a similar time/work measure, incorporated with larger scale learning tools.

<b>Edlab Relevance</b>
Although it can be fairly hard (depending on the student/learner) to remain focused without supervision, this is an inevitable problem to online and distance education.  Any program that can help you stay independently motivated is probably going to be an important (if often overlooked) part of this new trend.  In addition, the focus on quantifying effort (both past and prospective) may also prove useful for instructors trying to figure out how time-intensive their assignments are.  

<b>Our Takeaway</b>
If you're having problems focusing, Pomodairo (or a similar app) can be a useful tool.  I use it for writing stories, and I think it's helped my productivity a fair amount.
