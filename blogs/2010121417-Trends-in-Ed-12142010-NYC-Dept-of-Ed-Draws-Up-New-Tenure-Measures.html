          <p>
            New York City's Department of Education <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/teacher_tenure_standards_raised_JDdSlN4jsRo7yYRBxCw8gO">recently changed its tenure policy</a> as it is now demanding more of those teachers seeking lifetime employment. Tenure is usually granted to teachers who have been working for three or more years and once granted, they practically serve for life.  The new tenure standards will be based on recommendations such as classroom preparation and student feedback, among others. As expected, the response from teacher unions was swift and critical of the Department's plans, which is intended to highlight bad teachers and reward good ones.  United Federation of Teachers (UFT) President Mark Mulgrew lamented “every time the DOE needs a cheap headline, they make some pronouncement about teacher tenure, conveniently ignoring the fact that the process for granting tenure has always been within the DOE and the chancellor's control.”

Mayor Bloomberg made changing the method for granting tenure one of the benchmarks of his reform for America's largest public school system. Under the new standards, teachers eligible for and seeking tenure must be rated effective for two consecutive years in student learning, instructional practice and professional contributions, among other areas. Principals, among others, will be charged with making recommendations based on classroom observation and planning. A probation extension or termination follows those who do not meet the requirements. The number of teachers rejected from obtaining tenure has increased in the past few years, a stat most likely to be maintained under the new measures.
