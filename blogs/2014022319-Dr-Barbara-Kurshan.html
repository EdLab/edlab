Over a career that started in the early computer programming trenches, Dr. Barbara (Bobbi) Kurshan has honed and shared her vision of "what can be" in the fields of education and technology.  Combining her experience as an educator, entrepreneur, and visionary, Dr. Kurshan has worked to support education entrepreneurs and to develop innovative edtech solutions. She currently serves as the Executive Director of Academic Innovation and is a Senior Fellow in Education at the <a href="http://www.gse.upenn.edu">Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania</a>.  Dr. Kurshan also runs Penn’s <a href="http://nestcentral.org">Milken-GSE Business Plan Competition</a> and chairs the University’s new "hybrid incubator and seed fund" for edtech investment, <a href="http://www.gse.upenn.edu/pressroom/press-releases/2013/09/investors-and-start-ups-board-new-education-fund-initiative-created-collabora">EDSi (Education Design Studio)</a>.  Previous roles have included strategic consultancy in the fields of education, technology and innovation and a global leadership role at a for-profit higher education consortium. Dr. Kurshan also helped to build a leading, global open source education community, <a href="http://www.curriki.org">Curriki</a>, and served as Co-CEO of <a href="http://www.core-learning.com">Core Learning</a>, an education investment fund.  Representative of her long-standing career in educational technology, Dr. Kurshan was also the Chief Academic Officer of <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/press/000622.bigchalk.html">bigchalk,</a> a premier early online learning destination.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> It seems that my education has from the beginning directed my work and is my passion also.  When I attended college, I found the only computer programming class in the course catalog. It required punch cards and a 24 hour wait to run your program only to find the next day that you had one card punched incorrectly.  I knew immediately that I wanted to use computers for teaching and learning.  I went on to get a Masters in Computer Science and a Teaching Certificate. My doctoral work focused on how children learn using computers. I knew early on that teaching and learning would be dramatically changed by technology.  My current role allows me to explore where the nexus is between academic innovation and education entrepreneurs and how to make a difference in the future of learning.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My professional experiences are unique in that all are part of a new innovative education ecosystem that is the synthesis of research, practice, entrepreneurship, and investment.  My experiences as a professor and researcher at a university, a teacher of math, an investor in edtech companies and an entrepreneur have significantly influenced my work as the Executive Director of Academic Innovation at the Graduate School of Education (GSE) at the University of Pennsylvania.  I am better able to understand how to take research to practice as I nurture early stage edtech companies.  In addition, my own experiences starting for-profit and non-profit early stage companies provide me with a special set of skills to help entrepreneurs start and grow new enterprises.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I sincerely hope that my work will provide a new model for change that is based on the collaboration among researchers, entrepreneurs, investors and education practitioners.  Through new academic programs for teachers and a new approach to edtech incubators I hope my work will create a new and unique way of thinking about innovation in education.  For example, the Education Design Studio, Inc (EDSi) is a hybrid of an incubator, design thinking curriculum, social impact company and seed fund which is engaging entrepreneurs, investors, researchers, and teachers in a blended learning experience for growing companies and impacting learning.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Learning is changing rapidly as both educators and learners have access to new technologies and new school design models for K-12, higher education, training, and lifelong learning  The disruption of higher education through new course options like MOOCs, just-in-time learning for workers, new school models for K-12 and the ability to learn anyplace and anytime, will change the learning landscape more rapidly than ever before.  I do believe that personalized learning, rapid visualization of learner data, and access to mobile technologies are current trends that will be the drivers for new ideas and trends yet to be imagined.  I believe we need to help educators and researchers understand that change and new ideas need to be implemented in an iterative process, so that they can test, analyze, and change new products and processes rapidly, so that learning can benefit from being in sync with "internet speed."

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Today my work at the GSE is driven by research to practice.  Through the Milken – Penn GSE Business Plan Competition, the Academic Innovation group is helping to support new ideas and early stage companies in education.  EDSi is giving the best ideas and companies from the Business Plan Competition the opportunity to receive the support and funding necessary to have the instruction and funding they need to be successful. We are also working on new degree and certificate programs that take the best of the academic world and what we know about successful entrepreneurs and teachers to build the next generation of educators and entrepreneurs - those that will revolutionize school reform.   We are also conducting research with several other schools and incubators on education innovation ecosystems and planning to write a guide for teachers, researchers, investors, and entrepreneurs. These are big ideas and big projects, and I hope we can make my work at PENN_GSE the standard for change in education.
