">Heilig, J. V., & Jez, S. J. (2010). Teach for America: A review of the evidence. Boulder, CO: Education and the Public Interest Center & Education Policy Research Unit. Retrieved from http://epicpolicy.org/publication/teach-for-america</a>

Despite the fact that every year it pulls in thousands of very talented college grads and millions of dollars in public funding, I haven't seen very much discussion of whether or not Teach for America works.  After looking into it a little, the latest comprehensive review of the evidence I could find was published by the Great Lakes Center for Education Research and Practice in 2010.

<b>Summary</b>:
Low-quality schools, educating poor and minority students, tend not to attract the most qualified teachers, and often have difficulty filling positions.  Teach for America was founded to fill in the gaps at such schools, with recent college graduates serving as the shock troops of the campaign.  As it turns out, the evidence on how much they're helping is somewhat mixed, although there is some evidence that their students see significant gains on mathematics abilities.

Another tack the study takes is on the issue of attrition. Teach for America recruits typically only spend a year or two in the system, before moving on to a new career. A relatively uncontroversial finding in the research literature is that teachers tend to become more effective with practice, at least for the first few years.  Therefore TFA recruits tend to miss the opportunity to gain and apply these skills.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
The ultimate conclusion is that TFA is something of a stop gap measure, and not a panacea or even a model for future change. Certainly more long-term commitments from TFA recruits, as the authors recommend, would be a good idea, but ultimately the program is simply not geared towards the necessary reforms. The real value-added would be in figuring out better and more sustainable ways for bright college graduates to contribute to the education sector.
