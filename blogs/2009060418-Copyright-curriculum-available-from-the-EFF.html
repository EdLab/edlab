            The EFF, legal defenders of fair use extraordinaires, has produced <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/">a curriculum about copyright, which is now available online.</a> It's aimed mostly at high schoolers, and should be easy for teachers to adopt, as it includes lesson plans and additional information.

It's about time -- media corporations and their lobbying associations have had <a href="http://www.copyrightfoundation.org/curriculum?key=for_educators">their own curricula</a> out for quite a while, and they've already gained some traction. Among other things, the industry lobbied for tech infrastructure money in California schools to be tied to a requirement that teachers teach about copyright law.

I reviewed both curricula last night to prepare for <a href="http://www.2600.com/news/view/article/11845">a show on the topic on Off The Hook</a>, and there were some interesting contrasts:

The EFF's curriculum sadly falls short in a few practical ways: they do not have materials explicitly geared toward middle schoolers, while the industry curricula do. The industry also does a better job of targeting its curricula towards a range of different subjects, from history to art and beyond, and heaven knows teachers are busy enough without having to adapt a topic for their own subject. The industry materials also have a jazzier look, with more graphics and layout fanciness. However, the EFF comes through with some really interesting material -- the <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handouts/a-fair(y)-use-tale">Disney mashup video</a> from the <a href="http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?display=home">Media Education Foundation</a>, available in a range of formats, is really neat and accessible, and it's gained over 5 million hits <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJn_jC4FNDo">on YouTube(!)</a>

Aside from that, though, I found the simple, streamlined EFF curriculum to be of far better quality. The industry labels its curriculum as a "copyright" curriculum, while the EFF labels theirs as a "fair use" curriculum. The industry curriculum barely mentions fair use. Where it does, it tells teachers that rights must be secured before using a copyrighted media property -- a near-guarantee that teachers will throw up their hands in despair, say "I don't have time for that," and tell their students never to use media properties in their own work.

The industry curriculum also confusingly conflates plagiarism with copyright violation -- something the EFF curriculum works hard to avoid. These kinds of confusions are a serious problem, considering <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/resources/publications/the_cost_of_copyright_confusion_for_media_literacy/">Renee Hobbs's research indicating that the confusion of educators at all levels about copyright has a chilling effect on what materials they use to teach.</a>

There are some really flagrant errors in the part of the industry curriculum I read. This curriculum's writers seemed to think they needed to cover viruses, porn, hackers, firewalls, and creepy people in chat rooms <i>at the same time</i> as they dealt with copyright protection. Witness this quiz and suggested response taken from a middle school curriculum:

<i>TO: B4UCopy Helpline 
FROM: Panicked 
“This is serious. I've been getting email receipts for all kinds of things I didn't buy. Jewelry, cameras, even a big-screen TV. It's thousands of dollars, and these things are being shipped to people I don't even know! I think it all started after I found a free copy of a computer graphics program I wanted to try. What 
should I do?”</i>

<i>The problem here is spyware. The student in this example would have to uninstall the illegal computer graphics program and use anti-virus software to eliminate the spyware. The student should also install a firewall which will protect his or her computer from unauthorized access and use by hackers. </i>

I don't know about you, but I've never heard of spyware charging people for things. If you get fake receipts by email the problem is usually <i>phishing</i>, not spyware. An illegal copy of name-brand graphics software is not the same thing as spyware (though sometimes when you're using off-brand stuff you get what you're not expecting), and anti-virus software won't help you with phishing. Firewalls are a great idea, but this problem has nothing to do with hackers accessing and using your machine. And besides, most of the <a href="http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&id=3&mode=txt">people who proudly</a> <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">call themselves hackers</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">are not out to try to hurt people.</a>

Finally, the industry curriculum treats the laws involving copyright as if they're already set in stone, when they're very much changing right before our eyes. Answer codes in the industry curriculum frequently begin with "The right answer is..." or "Encourage students to answer..." Teachers are encouraged to tell students that respecting copyright is part of being a law-abiding citizen.

Meanwhile, the guest from the EFF on Off The Hook last night told us their lesson plan was devised with the idea that teachers and students should really ask questions about the laws and come to their own conclusions.

Clearly I have my own opinion about these two curricula, but I encourage you all to check both out, compare them, and tell me what you think. 

And if you're looking for a quick video which is just about fair use, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTo10CzMgZE">the episode of The Media Show which we did with New York Law School professor James Grimmelmann.</a>
