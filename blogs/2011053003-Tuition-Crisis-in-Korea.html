          <p>
            Quite often, my classmates in Columbia undergraduate studies joke about how much they have to pay in order to receive a college education in the United States. In addition, there's been a lot of buzz lately about how college education is a "scam," and how it is entirely possible to succeed without one. Some companies have gone as far as offering students money to drop out of college to pursue their entrepreneurial spirits.

What people in the states forget, however, is that there is federal financial aid available. Yes, it's entirely true that it's often inadequate and some students still cannot attend college because of financial reasons. However, the fact that it is there at all makes the college education system here different from the one in Korea.

This is why even though Korean tuition is about 1/5th of the average American tuition, there are students protesting to half the tuition. Since most students pay for their tuition through loans and part-time jobs, the burden is still too big for a lot of students whose family cannot afford to pay the tuition out of their own pocket.

Currently, the universities say that they cannot do this without the government's support. While some in the government promise the realization of "halved tuition," it's likely to be just a ruse to earn votes in the upcoming presidential election. The future does not seem to bright for those Korean students who is trying their best.
