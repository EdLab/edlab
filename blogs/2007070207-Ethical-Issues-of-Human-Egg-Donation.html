          <p>
            Last year, Hwang Woo-Suk, a cloning researcher in North Korea, was charged with an ethical violation. He used his female lab assistants as egg donors. One might ask what is wrong with donating eggs. In fact, by donating human eggs as a medical experimentation, it would aid in furthering research on embryonic stem cells. However, there are some considerations to think about before answering recklessly. 

<p/>
To be precise, in order for a woman to donate, a series of powerful hormone injections need to be injected for at least two weeks, as well as blood tests and ultrasounds to see if eggs are ready to be taken out.

During the procedure, there are possible risks of puncturing the bladder or nearby blood vessels. 
Egg donation can lead to another problem called Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). This syndrome can lead to abdominal pain and pressure as well as swelling. In severe cases, it can lead to death. 

<p/>
It's not hard to believe that although there are clear facts of possible damages to egg donors, poorer females are more likely to donate their eggs than wealthier females due to their monetary needs. 

<P/>
After reading this article called, “Egg Donation,” written by C. Ben Mitchell, PH.D, the whole process of egg donating, I thought, was nothing more than hens laying eggs every morning. Even though many egg donors are in need of money, moral values should be heavily emphasized.
