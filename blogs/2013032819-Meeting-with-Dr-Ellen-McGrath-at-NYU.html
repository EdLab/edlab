            *KEEP PRIVATE*

Today I had the privilege of visiting Dr. Ellen McGrath down at NYU.  A side note before sharing the takeaways. The space was beautiful! The design seemed geared toward encouraging learning in today's context - with mobile furniture  and open space. 
 

And now onto the takeaways. Dr. McGrath is an expert in social entrepreneurship and the social innovation program she helps run at NYU is churning out a generation of leaders, who are cooking up great ideas to resolve dire social problems, publishing books and winning pitch competitions  (despite being undergrad students competing against grad students and well-established companies). 

I met with her to get her thoughts on the educational entrepreneurial ecosystem here in NYC. She mentioned a bunch of folks with whom we already have contacts such as Be Social Change and the Centre for Social Innovation. In addition she mentioned other individuals who I did not know and who are apparently doing some interesting ed tech start up work. She will put me in contact with them and I look forward to following up.  

While there are many programs out there to support entrepreneurship, her program at NYU pride themselves on helping learners obtain valuable hand-on skills necessary for social entrepreneurship. She offered to do a workshop at EdLab so that perhaps we could then share with educational entrepreneurs who visit us.  She also suggested perhaps arranging seats in a circle at the next demo night for a more collaborative feel and to get away from the old-school class setting. 

Overall it was a great visit and we look forward to further developing connections between NYU and CU.
