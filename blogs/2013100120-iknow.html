<p>Did you know that Christopher Nolan’s movies are getting longer and that congressional representatives from Chicago have sponsored the most firearm control bills?</p>

<p>Movie buffs and political wonks can now satisfy their appetites for trivia in a more interactive platform than Wikipedia. A new data-driven knowledge sharing community called <a href="http://iknow.io/">iknow</a> collects information on movies and politics to facilitate public analysis, sharing, and discussion. It allows users to create and share their own insights by comparing different data sets and adding visualizations. The data is collected from a combination of sources, (<a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> [the same data source used by Google’s knowledge graph], <a href="http://www.opusdata.com/">OpusData</a>, <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/">Govtrack.us</a>, and <a href="http://influenceexplorer.com/">Influence Explorer</a>) and is searchable by multiple variables.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Although new users might be confused on their first visit, (a more prominent and informational "about" section would be useful), a simple "getting started" section guides users through the insight creation process. For the more inquisitive, a tool called Data Navigator offers more specific and extensive queries and the option to see how existing insights are made and modified to obtain new results. </p>

<p>Navigating the tabbed display is easy and encourages users to explore insights that are new, trending, and most liked. All of the insights are simple, visual, easy to digest, and shareable across multiple social networks, as well as within the iknow community. Users can also follow and share insights submitted by interested members.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Right now the database collections are limited to movies and politics. The site promises to add data on sports, music, education, and economics, although the sources for these areas are not identified.</p>

<p>iknow has gone through different iterations in its evolution to the current version. Originally built for more academic purposes, it was intended to be a platform for improving information retention by calculating individual rates of learning. According to user reviews and feedback on earlier versions, it evaluated responses to questions based on speed, accuracy, and difficulty to determine the best time for a learner to review information. The site has since deviated from this model, and while not as obviously educational, there are still many ways in which it could be used in the classroom.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> As more databases are added to the site, it could easily become a very popular tool for educators in multiple subjects. In a political science discussion it would provide students a simple comparison of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s legislative histories, and in a film history class it would sort movies by which had the lowest budget and highest revenue. In addition to presenting new information, it is also an interesting way to introduce subject material and generate discussion topics.</p>

<p>The simplicity of creating insights on the site could encourage students to search for and share information with their instructors and peers. It has the potential to change learning from a passive to an active process; rather than reading facts in a text, students are instead rewarded for satisfying their curiosity and sharing information over which they can feel a sense of ownership.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>iknow is a visually engaging platform for comparing and sharing data.</p>
