            The NFL and NBA are both heading towards lockouts; these two sports associations differ on why they are having lockouts though the motive seems to be money. The NFL is heading towardsa lockout because it seems all both sides (players and owners) are not willing to find a solution to how to divide up the immense profits the league makes every year. In my view, I think the owners are actually being greedy as they are seeking more money in addition to the billions they already have. NFL ought to be embarrassed to call this little problem as a lockout and even though some think the league might still play in the fall, the lockout isover 100 days and the meetings has yet to achieve anything. This so called lockout can end if the players and owners agree with the owners on a new bargaining agreement.

The NBA lockout has been quiet because negotiations are still fresh and the NBA doesn't generate as much money as the NFL. Also, 22 out of the 30 franchises are currently running at a loss and thus making negotiations very interesting on both sides. Though there is still time for the NBA and its players to come to some sort of agreement, it is interesting to see two of the most popular sports going through lockouts at the same time. I am curious to know what will happen should both the NFL and NBA go through with their lockouts this fall.
