<p>Can educational multimedia engage students as deeply as watching a cringeworthy reality show? New research examines the parasocial processes that could be triggered when learning from educational videos. Parasocial interaction describes a viewer’s cognitive, affective, or behavioral responses toward media figures who cannot respond or reciprocate, like when fans yell at athletes playing sports on TV or audibly sigh at a contestant on the Bachelor.</p>
 
<p>To examine the role of parasocial interaction on learning, researchers produced a lecture on statistics that took place in a large empty auditorium. The level of addressing to the viewing audience was manipulated by changing how the lecturer’s proximity (near or far) and orientation (front-facing or side-facing) was captured in the videos. To test their hypothesis, 88 university students were randomly assigned to one condition of either near or far and either front-facing or side-facing. Participants watched four educational videos on basic statistics concepts.</p>
 
<p>While there was no effect for proximity, students who watched videos where the presenter faced the camera reported higher subjective addressing and prosocial interaction than students who watched videos where the lecturer was filmed from the side. Importantly, students who watched the front-facing videos outperformed the students who watched the lateral view videos on retention scores.</p>
 
<p>Social cues may resonate with learners even when watching lecturers online. Evidence from this study indicates that having presenters look into the camera to address a virtual audience impacts learning outcomes. This research has implications for MOOCs and online courses where the instructor might not actively address online viewers. Despite the distance, online professors can help their students feel more connected by simply changing a camera angle.</p>
