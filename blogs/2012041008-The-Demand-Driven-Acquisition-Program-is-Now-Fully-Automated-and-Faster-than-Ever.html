Last week the Gottesman Library's Demand Driven Acquisition (DDA) program became much more streamlined and automated. 

The DDA program is an initiative the library implemented a while back to automatically purchase e-books based on patron activity. We receive a batch of "discovery" records every week which we upload to EDUCAT (the Gottesman Libraries' database). These discovery records are the bibliographic records that patrons can find and view the ebook that comes with them. If there is a patron on an ebook for more than ten minutes, it triggers a purchase and then the library will receive a fuller record complete with an order and item record to replace the discovery record. 

The problem we had before last week was finding a way to upload and replace the discovery records with the fuller records. To do this, a load table needed to be created from scratch. Last week I completed the creation of this new DDA load table (Load H) as this is something I have been working on the side along with my other Materials tasks. The load tables allow us to upload a mass amount of records from companies like ebrary, Serial Solutions, etc., and customize them all at once. By creating this load table the DDA program is now a faster process, from patron discovery to purchasing. We can now purchase the items "demanded" by patrons and have the complete record of this purchase, faster than before.

Creating this Load H through Innovative would have normally cost the library $1,500. Innovative also provides training to create load tables that would mean a trip to California and a fee of $25,000 I believe. Learning the coding behind creating the load table and actually creating it must've took me about 5 hours to do altogether, so you can get a sense of how much the library has saved. I had some help with a reference manual that we found online, but it took a lot of detective work and trail and error to understand how to code the load table. 

The good news is that now we can create any load table to serve any purpose the library has, and that the Gottesman Libraries has an advanced DDA program which is now fully automated!
