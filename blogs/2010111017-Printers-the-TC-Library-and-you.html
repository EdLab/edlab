            if you're reading this, it's no doubt because you've had cause to become, shall we say, <em>acquainted</em>, with the printing system in the library at TC - particularly the difference between printing in Butler on the main CU campus, and the Gottesman library here at TC.

the reason why i have sat down to write about this fascinating subject is because i have a peculiar insight into the nuances of the printing set-up in our library: i write, then, not only a student and patron of the library system, but also as a library assistant at TC, and a member of the TC and CU senates, where i was formerly a member of the CU library committee.

so, what can i tell you that you don't already know? well, <em>everything</em>, as it most probably will turn out.

because, first off, what most people don't actually realize - and this became somewhat loudly apparent during the several student senate meetings in which the printing situation was discussed - is that the printing system at TC is run by, and the proceeds go to, a columbia-based business. which means that the money you pay for printing - well, that goes to columbia. the people who decide how much you should pay, and if/when a price rise should come into effect? well, again, that decision is made by the folks over the way, in the basement of the journalism school.

so why do we have to pay to print at TC, whilst we can print out up to 20 pages a week for free in Butler library? well, from what we have been told by this same printing services provider, the price per sheet is to cover the cost of servicing the printers and copiers provided under our current print services contract. and, as we all know, these printers and copiers take a great deal of maintenance and upkeep - which is one of the reasons why they have recently been replaced with upgraded models, even though the previous machines were only themselves installed a couple of years ago.

but, you ask, why can't they apply the same system as they have at CU to the library here? apparently, for us to have a comprehensive, all-in-one library account which connects to printing, computing, and student accounts would require the College as a whole to transfer from the banner administrative system to the same
