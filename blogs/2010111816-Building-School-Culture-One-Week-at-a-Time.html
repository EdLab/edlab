<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

Use Friday Focus memos to motivate and engage your staff every week, and help create a school culture focused on the growth of students <em>and</em> teachers.

Easy to understand and implement, Friday Focus memos offer an effective and efficient way to improve student learning, staff development, and school culture from within. Written by educational consultant and former principal of two award-winning schools, Jeffrey Zoul, these memos focus on topics such as active learning, high expectations, gratitude, test preparation, and more. Zoul provides 37 teaching and learning memos, one for each week of the school year, for principals and other administrators to reproduce and circulate among their staff.

Zoul prefaces each memo with stories from his experiences as a teacher, coach, and assistant principal in the K-12 levels. You can also write your own memos, with guidance on possible topics and teacher takeaways.

Other memo topics include:
<ul>
	<li> The heart of coaching</li>
	<li> A community of leaders</li>
	<li> Homework perspectives</li>
	<li> Response to intervention basics</li>
	<li> Principles of great teaching</li>
</ul>
“Readers will relate to this book because the essential topic of school culture is addressed from the perspective of multiple voices – teachers, principals, assistant principals, specialists, and department heads.” -Deborah L. Wortham, Ed.D., Superintendent, Steelton-Highspire School District, PA
