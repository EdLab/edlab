<i>Maker Faire inspires, educates, and entertains curious and creative learners of all ages. It celebrates arts, crafts, engineering, food, green design, music, science and technology and brings together communities who embrace the DIY (do-it-yourself) spirit.</i> (<a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a>).</p>
<p><b>Make my Day </b></p>
<p>
Since the dawn of Bob Villa and his PBS-hosted television show <a href=" http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/">This Old House</a>, the do-it-yourself (DIY) spirit has been alive and well in the US.  And while DIY might not be a new term, what sets the current trend apart is that this spirit of independent invention is being embraced by learners and educators to augment and in some cases even replace the traditional classroom experience.  From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab">Fabrication Labs</a> replete with 3-D printers to how-to videos describing the steps to launch a rocket, educators and learners are entering the realm of DIY 2.0.  At the helm of this movement is <a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/index.html">Maker Faire</a>. Started in 2006 by <a href="http://makezine.com/">Make Magazine</a> to "celebrate arts, crafts, engineering, science projects and the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mindset," the global fair, which started at a fairground in California, is now held throughout the year and across the globe and encompasses thousands of booths covering everything from the ABC’s of <a href=" http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, to cooking with circuitry (conductive dough). The fair made a repeat appearance in New York in September at the Hall of Science in Flushing Meadows, a location made famous by the 1964
World’s Fair and the Men in Black movie franchise (learn more about the "Unisphere" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKpAMVRtHmI">here</a>).

<b>Science Fair 2.0... How are Educators Utilizing Maker Faire?</b>
Educators are increasingly relying on project and inquiry-based education experts to create lessons that integrate more out-of-the-book, real-world experiences and experimentation. Even if you are engaged solely in online content delivery, students both expect to "get their hands dirty" through project-based learning opportunities and are clamoring for the experience. Enter Maker Faire.  From dedicated "Education Days" and speakers like John Seely Brown, to support materials and standards-aligned lesson plans, the team behind Maker Faire has provided both the stage and the support to encourage inquiry and constructivist-oriented experiences. With a special emphasis on STEM subjects Maker Faire stands to provide a much needed bridge between "cool science" and the kind too often found in the classroom -- "boring." Through a wide range of interactive experiences, workstations, competitions and old-school science fair displays, the team, behind Maker Faire is helping both to ignite interest in science and technology, and also to make connections between fields and new discoveries that are at the fringe of "maker" culture. Whether a new use for an old technology, like electronic circuits or an old use for a new technology, like the Tesla machine, Maker Faire, like all good tinkerers, is always at the leading edge of what individuals can create on their own outside of the sanctioned bounds of an institution. After all, the fringe is where the interesting developments often happen. Will Maker Labs and similar things be at the center of learning environments of the future? Only time will tell, but a few million dedicated citizen scientists might be onto something. </p>
