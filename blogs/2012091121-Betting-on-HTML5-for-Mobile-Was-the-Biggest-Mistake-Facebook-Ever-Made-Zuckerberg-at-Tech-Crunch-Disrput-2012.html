Facebook, which recently released their native iOS app, has seen its users consume twice as much content on its app since the its release. 

Facebook's original app was on HTML5, which was slow and clunky. Speaking today at the Tech Crunch Disrupt event in San Francisco, founder Mark Zuckerberg said that betting too much on HTML 5 was the biggest strategic mistake Facebook ever made. 

Facebook decided to build HTML5 app two years ago. They spent around six months to build their HTML app and another four months to decide not to go that route, and burning two years, which has been "very painful" according to Zuckerberg. 

Zuckerberg said that HTML5 is not bad and that he is excited about the future of HTML5, but currently it is not there yet. Today, mobile interaction level is at its highest, and being good enough is not good enough. Facebook has to have the highest quality. 

I have tried the new iOS app for Facebook and its a huge improvement over their earlier app. Its fast with a user interface (UI) that sticks to the speed. And with the Facebook integration in <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/iphone-5-software-rundown-pre-event-the-ios-6-we-know-today-11246875">iPhone 5</a>, you could post directly on Facebook from your webpage in Safari, which would probably help Facebook have an even firmer hold on its mobile users. 

As we build our own New Learning Times (NLT) HTML 5 app, are there things that we can learn from Facebook's experience? What has our experience been so far in building and designing the HTML5 app for NLT? 

I hope that some one from the NLT team can throw some light into this conversation.
