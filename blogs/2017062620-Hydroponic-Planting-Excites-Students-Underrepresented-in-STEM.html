<p>Many studies have shown that people who become interested in science in childhood are more likely to pursue a degree in science, yet STEM fields notoriously lack diversity. For this reason, more STEM programs are popping up specifically for those who are typically underrepresented in science, such as people of color, women, and English language learners. Some of the most effective efforts have taken place in after-school programs, where students are removed from stressful testing and grade expectations.</p>
 
<p>A recent study observed the effects that a hydroponic agriculture program had in increasing interest in science for underrepresented elementary school students. Hydroponics is a type of gardening where plants are grown in water instead of soil. For this reason, it can be done indoors year-round independent of the climate. On top of that, hydroponics incorporates all the elements of STEM; students have to use engineering to build the ecosystems, chemistry to regulate the plants’ pH levels, and math and science practices to design and implement experiments on the plants.</p>
 
<p>The study was carried out at three after-school programs in low-income areas involving a total of 234 children; all three primarily served people of color, and two primarily served non-native English speaking immigrants. The researchers administered pre- and post-program surveys that measure students’ attitudes toward science, including levels of anxiety, interest, and self-concept (e.g., students’ perceptions of themselves in relation to a particular topic). Educators and community members taught these programs; two were 13-week long afterschool programs, and one was a 4-week long summer school program.</p>

<p>The results showed significant effects on students’ attitudes toward science. In all three programs, students reported much lower levels of anxiety and much higher levels of interest regarding science. This was independent of a child’s first language or gender. In addition, the results showed that girls had significantly higher levels of self-concept after the program, signifying that this activity might have a greater impact on young girls than young boys. The study also showed that the programs had positive effects regardless of the instructor’s experience in science; some instructors had no experience with science and others had a lot.</p>
 
<p>This study demonstrates how one program successfully changed the attitudes of typically underrepresented elementary students in science. Because hydroponics gardening can be completed indoors without taking up much space, the researchers hope to create a hydroponics program that can be easily implemented at after-school programs around the country. If programs like this can make STEM more interesting and accessible to students of color, girls, and immigrants, perhaps they can pave the way to a more diverse set of scientists, engineers, and techies in the future.</p>
