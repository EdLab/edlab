<p><b>Title:</b> Scientific Habits of Mind in Virtual Worlds (2008)</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> Constance Steinkuehler & Sean Duncan</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41219449">Journal of Science Education and Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can we draw on empirical data to create games that promote scientific habits of mind?

<p><b>Study Design:</b> This study was designed to gather empirical data related to the theory that games could help do what inquiry activities in science classes could not, that is, foster scientific habits of the mind. The study defines scientific habits of mind as strategies for thinking such as sharing and debating hypotheses in light of evidence through the kind of discourse that mimics the methods used in scientific communities.</p>

<p>The authors examined data from <i>World of Warcraft</i> (WoW), which has over ten million users. The study focused on the forum discussion posts made in early November 2006 to analyze the habits of thinking evidenced by participants. The authors looked specifically at the "priest forum" (one of 31 forums on the WoW site with an aggregate of over 270,000 threads) and examined 1,984 posts made by over 1,087 unique WoW users. The researchers developed a set of codes based on scholarship in the field to allow them to categorize and analyze each post. Specifically, their codes where designed to allow them to identify argumentation and critical thinking in forum discourse. The posts were then evaluated based on the codes by four raters who had spent four months as participant observers on the platform.</p>
<p><b>Findings:</b> Patterns emerged from the analysis of the forum posts. There was no correlation between the level of expertise of a particular user and the scientific habits of mind demonstrated in their post. 86% of conversations on the discussion forums fit the studyâ€™s definition of "social knowledge construction" as opposed to "social banter." 50% of the posts demonstrated "systems based reasoning;" "model based reasoning", which they define as "using some form of model to understand a given system under consideration," was demonstrated by 10% of users, and 65% "displayed an evaluative epistemology in which knowledge is treated as an open-ended process of evaluation and argument."</p>
<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> This study examined the potential of games, specifically <i>World of Warcraft</i> to cultivate scientific habits of mind even though WoW was not designed for this purpose. In light of the findings that WoW did provide a platform for scientific discourse, could this be enhanced further in a game specifically aimed at cultivating scientific habits of mind? </p>
