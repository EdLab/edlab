<p>OpenStudy is a social network for study groups that aims to become the social glue that holds online learning together. Students participating in a MOOC or watching Khan Academy videos can’t simply turn and ask a question of the teacher’s pet seated in a neighboring desk. OpenStudy wants to provide the online equivalent of this helpful neighbor. It’s a good idea and it seems to be working as 75% of questions are answered within 5 minutes and the vibrant site has attracted a neat little community that helps over <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/02/openstudy-catapults-learning-with-cash/
">250,000</a> students per month.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
Being an online learning platform, the site is accessible 24/7 and relies on its active community to be online when there are questions to be answered. In addition to the Quora-style community questions, users can also chat with anyone online in their discipline and ask live questions. The site is heavily gamified, with users ascending from "neophytes" to "legends" as they answer more questions and their answers attract accolades from the community. Individual users are also evaluated for teamwork, problem solving, and engagement, prompting deeper and better interactions over sheer quantity of answers. Users with the highest levels are literally head of the class: Their profile photos appear first on subject and course-centric pages and OpenStudy cherry picks users with good records to be moderators on the site.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
Despite the site’s code of conduct, it’s clear that there is a lot of misuse. The site’s popularity is dependent on the speed and ease of obtaining answers, so it is important to explore that fine line between facilitating help and making it easy to cheat if the site wants to encourage a healthy learning community. Students are using it because they can tool around in the constant subject-based chats and sometimes run into a straight answer for a school question. OpenStudy’s job is to ensure that they’re putting real learning in the way of users looking for an easy fix.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
OpenStudy’s <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/ocw-openstudy.html
">partnership</a> with continuing education MOOCs like Coursera and edX may help counterbalance the potential dangers of easy answers on the site. The communities around these courses are inspiring and they are putting the kind of users that engage in spontaneous, unrequired online learning in the same space with users that are after fast answers for uninspiring school assignments, which has intriguing potential. CEO Chris Sprague <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/openstudy-wants-to-turn-the-world-into-one-big-study-group/
">describes</a> OpenStudy as "a videogame where everyone is on the same team," and it certainly has this kind of feel. Community support is a major missing piece of most online learning and OpenStudy is helping to fill the gap. Diversifying the learning experience of answer-seeking students might be the unexpected reward.</p> 

<p><b> Bottom Line:</b><br>
OpenStudy has the potential to offer help and encourage community for online study.</p>
