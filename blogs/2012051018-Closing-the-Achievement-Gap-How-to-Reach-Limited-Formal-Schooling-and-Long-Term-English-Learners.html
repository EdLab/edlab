Struggling older English learners pose a real challenge for educators.  Some of these students are new arrivals with limited or interrupted  schooling. Others have been in and out of ESL and bilingual programs in  this country since kindergarten, but have never succeeded academically.  How can teachers help older students who lack academic content knowledge  and English language proficiency catch up with their classmates? Yvonne  and David Freeman provide four research-based keys for closing the  achievement gap. Three teachers have put this theory into practice to  reach their older English learners. These teachers organize curriculum  around themes, use predictable classroom routines, and scaffold  instruction in a variety of ways. The clear examples from their classes  will help other teachers implement effective practices for their older  English learners. For teachers and teacher educators, program directors,  resource personnel, and administrators, this book offers both the  research and practice schools need to develop effective programs to  educate struggling older English learners.
