<p>Effective learning requires a conversation between teachers and students; otherwise it’s impossible for teachers to confirm students’ understanding. Large university lectures severely limit student-teacher interaction, but technology provides new possibilities. Game-based student response systems have become a common way to engage and obtain feedback from students.</p>
 
<p>Researchers from the University of Florence and the Open University of Catalonia investigated the impact these systems have on learning outcomes and engagement in a university setting. The study was conducted in an educational technology undergraduate course at the University of Florence with 400 students. In three of the eight lessons provided during the course, the teacher used Kahoot!, a system that allows students to answer questions using their personal devices. Researchers conducted tests before and after these eight lessons to assess learning outcomes using questions that corresponded either to traditional lectures or to lessons that incorporated Kahoot!. They then drew comparisons between learning outcomes in the two conditions. </p>
 
<p>Results revealed that using a game-based response system led to modest improvements in learning outcomes, especially for more theoretical concepts. Despite occasional technical difficulties that occurred using the system, students indicated that the game-based response system was engaging and helped create a positive classroom environment.</p>

<p>A didactic approach to learning has its limitations, and technology seems to provide an avenue for more interaction. Although more investigation is needed, this study suggests that game-based response systems are an effective tool in supporting learning and engagement.  </p>
