            <div><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Given the connective power of mass media, heroism can transcend the limits of national barriers. Local inspiration can become an international affair. The incredible bravery of Aung San Suu Kyi, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Harriet Tubman, and so many others are not simply for the benefit of just their own people but all of humanity. Luckily their wonderful stories are shared in reverent tones across the globe giving hope to the world that is in desperate need of it. </span></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">But unfortunately not all local heroes are known across the world.</span><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/PHOTO-InfraredTerryFoxStatue-PHOTOSHOPPED.jpg" alt="PHOTO-InfraredTerryFoxStatue-PHOTOSHOPPED.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" /><br /></div>
<div><span style="font-style: italic;">Terry Fox Statue. Ottawa, ON</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Terry Fox entranced Canadians over the long warm summer of 1980. Fox was a 21-year-old who wanted to raise hope for cancer survivors. It made sense. He was one himself.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>A hyper-competitive athlete, Terry struggled to make his high school basketball team due to a lack of talent. He worked so hard that he even made his varsity team in college. But the resolve that assisted him at that tender age helped him with a bigger goal. A much bigger goal. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Terry decided to raise money for cancer research by running across Canada, approximately 5,000 miles from coast to coast. He planned to run 10 to 12 miles in the morning and another 10 in the afternoon. A marathon a day. Every day. Until he finished.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Running on one leg.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>During college, his right leg was amputated. <span style="line-height: 1.42857;">While recovering, his high school basketball coach informed him of a runner who ran the New York City marathon and this inspired Terry’s dream. A Marathon of Hope.</span></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Terry had a slow start after dipping his toe in Newfoundland, on the east coast of Canada. He collected a bottle of water from the Atlantic Ocean that he would pour into the Pacific Ocean when he finished. He stepped on to the road. Steeled himself against the harsh, unforgiving winds.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Then he was off.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><div style="line-height: 22.8571px;"><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/PHOTO-TerryFox-PHOTOSHOPPED%20copy.jpg" alt="PHOTO-TerryFox-PHOTOSHOPPED copy.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="line-height: 1.42857;" /><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="line-height: 22.8571px;"><span style="line-height: 1.42857; font-style: italic;">Terry Fox's shoes</span></div>
<div style="line-height: 22.8571px;"><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br /></span></div>
</div>
<div><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">For 143 days, Terry ran across his country. That's the equivalent of a marathon a day, every day, for almost five months straight. And as his journey started to make national headlines, Terry would also do promotional events to inspire his people. </span><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In addition to fundraising, Terry Fox raised hope for people everywhere, especially for young people fighting cancer. When he was in the hospital, Terry noticed that young kids diagnosed with cancer would just give up. And Terry thought his Marathon, the idea of struggling every day against the mightiest of odds, might give them hope.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Unfortunately, after running 3,339 miles and averaging over 23 miles per day, Terry was forced to stop. He had developed a hacking cough. The cancer had spread to his lungs. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>He died shortly after.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Every year, the Terry Fox Run invites people to run to raise money for cancer research. Although he may have passed away 35 years ago, Terry’s run still inspires people to push through their pain and keep on going. To dream of something bigger than yourself, to face your worst fears, and make steps to achieve it.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Toward the end of his Marathon, at the end of another endlessly wearying day, Terry once said, “I’ve done my best. That’s all I can say.”</span><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>That’s what heroes do.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="font-style: italic;">Terry Fox passed away on June 28th, 1981. <span style="line-height: 22.8571px;">The Terry Fox Foundation has raised $500 million dollars.</span></span></div>
