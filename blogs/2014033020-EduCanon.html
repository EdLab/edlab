<p><a href="http://www.eduCanon.com/">EduCanon</a> is an interactive video platform that lets educators insert questions or notes for students in videos. When students reach particular points in the video, the system will automatically stop for what eduCanon calls a <i>reflective pause</i>. During this pause, teachers can pose multiple choice questions and add notes or web content. The platform could be a great tool for teachers who flip their classrooms and use learning videos. Teachers can build videos with questions, assign them to students, and monitor student responses.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Teachers have access to many useful customization options for their video lessons. They are able to crop videos and edit the HTML source code in the questions for further customization. Teachers can also insert tables in the question design space. Images can be embedded into a question to make it more visually engaging. Users can record their own audio and add it to the video. Students can sign up for the site quickly and easily, with or without adding an email. This may be convenient for younger students without email addresses. Videos created in eduCanon can also be easily embedded on other sites and blogs.</p> 
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Videos can only be uploaded from Youtube, Vimeo, or TeacherTube. Teachers are not able to upload their own videos directly to the platform. Though videos can be shared publicly, only students who were assigned to the video will have their answers recorded. Some features can only be accessed by upgrading to the premium version for $48 a year. These features include free response questions and searching for lessons created by other users.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>EduCanon attempts to make video lessons a more active learning experience. The automatic pausing could encourage students to interact with the questions or the learning content along with the video. The platform has the potential to make videos more interactive. EduCanon is a great alternative for teachers who are not able to access Youtube because of school policy. Compared to Youtube and most video platforms, eduCanon provides a more interactive learning experience as well as fewer distractions. </p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>EduCanon gives students a reflective pause for an enhanced video learning experience. </p>
