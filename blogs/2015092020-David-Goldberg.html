David E. Goldberg is host of Big Beacon Radio—Transforming Higher Education on <a href="http://bit.ly/1G6SeJi">VoiceAmerica.com</a> and president of Big Beacon, A Movement to Transform Engineering Education. A trained leadership coach (Georgetown University), he is president of <a href="http://bit.ly/1eXWcLv">ThreeJoy Associates, Inc.</a>, a coaching, speaking, training, and change management consulting firm aimed at helping to transform higher education. Goldberg is also a noted computer scientist, civil engineer, and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Goldberg’s most recent publication is <a href="http://bit.ly/1eXWkL2">A Whole New Engineer: The Coming Revolution in Engineering Education</a>.</p>

<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
Even as an undergraduate student, I wondered why engineering was taught in a narrowly technical way with little or no cultural or historical context, and during my masters studies, I introduced such considerations in a lab course I assisted. Later as a professor, I continued in my own classroom to broaden engineering education away from the math-science death march of stimulus-response problem solving to a more fully reflective kind of thinking and practice. A particularly important early experience for me was my first job out of school at a small engineering software-consulting firm called Stoner Associates in Carlisle, PA. I thought when I hired on that I would mainly be programming four Fortran codes for fluid flow analysis in pipelines, but on my first day my boss, Mike Stoner, handed me manuals to the four programs and said, "There's a customer in Harrisburg that needs help. Help them." and "Next week you need to go to Chicago to work with our timesharing firm to help make a sale." Little in my education had prepared me for these pervasive social or business challenges of a startup. </p>

<p>As I've thought about this experience (1976-1980), it seems to me that it was a kind of forerunner to something that has become increasingly common. Students in engineering and other disciplines are increasingly challenged to be effective in the world sooner rather than later, and companies no longer have the patience or budgets to hold student hands over a longer apprenticeship as in times past. </p>

<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
I hope our work helps align education with what students need for a fulfilling life in the 21st century. Back in the cold war, we wanted students to shut up, sit down, and listen to teachers, and teachers stood at the front of class and told them a fairly compact and uniform body of knowledge that was believed to be essential to their success in this profession or that. Today, we want the next Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg, someone who is unleashed to create new products, services, and ways of working through their own initiative and creativity, but that's an enormous cultural shift and challenge. Our schools and teachers do well at "shut up and sit down." They do less well at unleashing. </p>

<p>In A Whole New Engineer we identified what we think the keys to an unleashing education are. Someone trusts a young person (teacher, parent, friend, or themselves). That trust leads to the young person having courage to take initiative, which leads to failure, success, and ultimately authentic learning.  This sounds pretty reasonable, but we have teachers who are more comfortable judging and distrusting than trusting. Moreover, education, particularly higher education, has become a place where only cognition need apply, but notice the words I am using here: trust, courage, initiative, authenticity. These are all words that have more to do with emotion and culture than cognition. Our work gives people permission to use the right words to bring about the kind of transformation that is needed more quickly and well. </p>

<p>In a certain sense, educators speak in code words that go to great lengths to avoid words of emotion or feeling, but education is best when it is deeply felt and passionate. </p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
I believe that this movement toward learning unleashed or courage-based learning will become a dominant theme in the near future. All the other trends (active learning, competency-based learning, flipped classrooms, MOOCs, ed tech, experiential learning, project-based learnings, all the X learnings and X-based learnings) are instrumental to this larger goal. For example, competency-based learning separates assessment from the classroom in interesting ways and is helpful to slicing the educational pie differently. In this sense, it is a nice tool, but it is not a fundamental reform. Moving from shut-up-based learning to courage-based learning is a fundamental reform aligned with how our economy has changed.  Things like MOOCs and ed tech are tools, not fundamental. These things can help us slice the pie differently, but they, by themselves are not a fundamental realignment. By shifting to the emotional and cultural core of 21st century education we will accelerate progress and adoption. </p>

<p>I also think there will be increasing attention paid to change process. When you read reports on ed reform, they address 'what" but rarely address "how." This is left to educators who then mistakenly try to use the existing bureaucracy to make change, which fails miserably.  The corporate world (and interestingly the for-profit education world) has used techniques of change management to make sweeping changes to industry over the last two decades or so. These ideas and practices can be adapted to the educational world as long as differences in culture and governance are understood and respected. </p>

<p>Another corporate trend that is moving to the educational world is <i><a href="http://huff.to/1Mi4ato">coaching</a></i>. Most CEOs have a coach, and the practice of coaching is a primary means of improving corporate leadership. These techniques are just now coming to the world of education, but presidents, provosts, deans, heads, and directors that want to attempt transformative change would do well to hire a good coach.  We don't call academic leaders "administrators" for nothing, and those leaders who choose to move beyond day-to-day administration can often use the noticing, deep listening, and reflective questions of a great coach. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> 
One of the key things I am working on is a set of courses and experiences for students and teachers that help with this shift from shut up to courage. It's surprising there is a remarkably small set of what I call sharp soft skills that can lead to more effective teachers and students, both. For teachers, learning skills around noticing, listening, and questioning, as well as speech acts, and story identification and reframing can be a very powerful set of tools to help teachers shift from expertise ("I know") to coach or mentor ("I trust"). For students, this same set of skills helps students reflect more effectively and deeply about who they are, their purpose, and how education can serve their purpose. I am working on a set of in-person and online courses to help spread these experiences. I am also working on a book around these themes. </p>

<p>Additionally, Big Beacon (a movement to transform engineering education) is rolling out a new website, starting a number of new initiatives, and building a global network of advocates for change.  These will become increasingly apparent in September when we launch the new site, but we have already started a student network, Students for a Whole New Education (SWNE), an innovators network, Educational Innovators Working Group (EIWG), and BB Media Network for Educational Transformation (BBMNET). As part of BBMNET, I have started a monthly radio program, BB Radio, Transforming Higher Education, and the first few shows are already available on <a href="http://bit.ly/1G6SeJi">VoiceAmerica.com</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I am working hard to connect with leaders in <a href="http://linkd.in/1JCZRK4">education on LinkedIn</a>. And people can connect with me there or by email at deg@threejoy.com. </p>
