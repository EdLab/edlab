Not only does New York City lay claim to being the nation's most populous city, it is also situated in one of the largest harbors in the world. Unfortunately, many residents never take full advantage of the wonderful economic, recreational, and educational opportunities that living in a port city provides. The <a href="http://waterfrontalliance.org/"> Waterfront Alliance </a> strives to protect, transform, and revitalize our harbor and waterfronts. For the last nine years, the organization has encouraged New Yorkers to get on the water through the free <a href="http://waterfrontalliance.org/what-we-do/city-of-water-day/
"> City of Water Day </a> festival; a day-long event taking place on Governors Island, Maxwell Place Park, New Jersey, and dozens of locations in neighborhoods around the five boroughs. One of the City of Water Dayâ€™s main hubs, Governors Island, opens its three piers for fishing lessons, kayak and paddleboard instruction, and narrated tours aboard historic ships, ferries, and fire boats while those remaining on dry land can immerse themselves in an activity fair and maritime information along Colonels Row. Any and all interested from coast guard personnel, to engineering firms, high school students, and families can register for and compete in the Con Edison Cardboard Kayak race at Pier 101. Twenty-five teams work against the clock to design and build a vessel out of nothing more than cardboard, tape, and their own creativity. When the 2 hours are up, cardboard creations are examined and awarded prizes by a panel of judges before being lowered in the embayment and raced around a buoy by two daring and hydrophilic team members. Many will sink, a select few make it back to the dock unscathed but all will leave with a strengthened relationship with the waters that surround us and deeper understanding of our role in its preservation.</p>
