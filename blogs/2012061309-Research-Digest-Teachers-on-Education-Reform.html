<a href="http://www.scholastic.com/primarysources/pdfs/Gates2012_full.pdf">Scholastic and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (2012). Primary Sources: America's Teachers on the Teaching Profession. New York: Scholastic Inc. </a>

Primary Sources 2012: America's Teachers on the Teaching Profession is a follow-up to the initial Primary Sources report released in 2009. <a href=”http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, in partnership with <a href=”http://www.scholastic.com/primarysources/download.asp>Scholastic</a> surveyed 10,000 K-12 public school teachers on the state of the teaching profession and compiled the results into a 129 page report. It is well known that <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2543">Bill Gates supports great teachers</a>, and the goal of the survey is “to place teachers' voices at the center of the conversation on education reform by sharing their thoughts and opinions with the public, the media, and education leaders.” While the future role of teachers remains to be seen, here is a brief summary of what the teachers had to say.

<b>Summary</b>

The report is divided into four sections. The first section, which explores how to raise student achievement, focuses on “the work of the many,” in which teachers share their opinions on the most important factors for improving academic achievement beyond the obvious, e.g., effective teachers. In order of importance, teachers say that 1) family involvement and support, 2) high expectations for all students, 3) engaged principals and school leaders, and 4) fewer students in each class would have a “strong” or “very strong” impact on student success.

The second section covers teachers' opinions on assessment, both for students and teachers. Basically, teachers believe that teaching and learning are too complex to be measured by any one test. While teachers value standardized testing, the majority believes that classroom performance is the most important measure of student achievement. As for the best way to measure their own performance, teachers overwhelmingly agree that student growth over the course of an academic year is the most important metric.

Section three considers significant and growing challenges facing students, particularly decreasing levels of student preparedness. For some reason, teachers see more students struggling with math and reading now than when they began teaching. There are other challenges related to demographics, including more students with “behavioral issues,” more students living in poverty, and more English Language Learners. Teachers say they need more training and resources to help address these student needs.

Finally, the fourth section looks at teacher retention and job satisfaction. As you know, many public school teachers quit after just three years on the job. In short, teachers need support from the leadership in their schools and communities. Most interesting, many of the factors that teachers cite as important for retention align with the same top factors they mentioned for improving student achievement.


<b>EdLab Relevance</b>

While EdLab tends to focus more on learning and less on teaching, teachers are some of the most important stakeholders in the education reform conversation. Plus, as this survey indicates, many teachers are interested in educational technology development. 

<blockquote>Teachers are clear that technology plays several key roles in classrooms–from help with differentiated instruction, to supporting student achievement, to increasing student engagement.
88% of veteran teachers say that technology that is well integrated into the classroom has a strong or very strong impact on student achievement.
59% of veteran teachers say they are seeing more students who require technology to keep them engaged. (p. 51)</blockquote>

While EdLab's ultimate vision is for a fundamentally different education sector, it would be valuable to explore how EdLab's projects can support teachers and, ultimately, good learning. I am curious to learn more about how EdLab products are marketed to current and future teachers. Also, in the bigger picture, how can we help train and support educators to understand ed tech as a boon for the teaching profession?
