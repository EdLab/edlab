<p><a href="http://www.rafter.com/">Rafter</a> wants to dramatically decrease the cost of book purchasing in college by attacking prices at key points in the textbook life cycle, from course adoption to buyback. The platform recommends cost-effective content for faculty members, helps the bookstore find the best deals on required books, and enables students to save with a rental program. The system is pro-digital and leads bookstores through the transition from physical to online while maximizing the power of existing campus vendors. Formerly called BookRenter, the system pivoted <a href="http://www.thetextbookguru.com/2012/02/28/1212/">last year</a> and has since partnered with over 300 colleges and universities.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Rafter’s dream of textbook transformation begins with transparency. The system utilizes data from its partners to provide statistics like adoption rate, price, and Amazon ranking so faculty members can make informed adoption decisions. Professors can keep track of their own adoptions across semesters and easily re-adopt for new courses. When they choose a book to assign, data is automatically and paperlessly transmitted to the bookstore for timely ordering. Academic publications have especially volatile pricing, so Rafter helps bookstores stay competitive with analytics from other retailers. All transactions in Rafter are done online, which streamlines inventory processes for onsite bookstores. Partner schools have reported <a href="http://www.rafter.com/easy-rent">increased profits</a>, particularly with students returning to school rentals from commercial rental vendors like Amazon and Chegg.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The academic community has <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/could-many-universities-follow-borders-bookstores-into-oblivion/35711?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">not been optimistic</a> when it comes to the future of bookstores. Short of closing all bookstores or doing away with textbooks altogether, it makes sense to keep book rental in learning institutions where concern for student costs will drive prices down. Rafter makes smart compromises to work with the current state of bookstores and gently compels them into a more organized, streamlined, and digital future.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Rafter’s goal is to help bookstores avoid privatization and enable students and faculty to make informed, efficient decisions. Showing adoption stats, Amazon ratings, and prices in the discovery platform may help push course adoptions towards student-side savings. Rafter’s <a href="http://www.rafter.com/management-team">leadership</a> is decidedly unschooled in publishing or higher education, with most members coming from other tech startups. This may explain the company’s refreshing and business-minded approach. Academia could use more of both and Rafter seems ready to prove its worth at the old college store.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Rafter is ready to span the void between publishers and students.</p>
