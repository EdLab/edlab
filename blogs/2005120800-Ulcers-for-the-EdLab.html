            I had read a <a href="http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/Pages/Ulcers.one.html">paper by Paul Thagard</a> a while back on the topic Brian brought up regarding ulcer causes.  Who knew this became such a big deal since â€˜97 ?
The paper discusses the research process in general and Marshall's predicament.  A lot of it may be relevant to our discussions but in particular I wanted to mention the idea of methodology being a source of legitimacy.  It's certainly true, but Marshall really had other problems.  The paper is fairly long so the following plagiarized snippets highlight the argument that Marshall's hypothesis was rejected not because he used a wacky methodology but because his hypothesis was revolutionary, with implications opposed to the contemporary knowledge of the field.  Is there hope for the EdLab afterall?

<cite>
Marshall's formation of the hypothesis that spiral bacteria cause ulcers thus depended on the following chain of associations:
- Bacteria are associated with gastritis (Warren).
- Gastritis is associated with ulcers (reading). 
- So maybe bacteria are associated with ulcers.
- Bacteria are associated with ulcers (experimental study).
- So maybe bacteria cause ulcers.
Could it be, on the other hand, that ulcers cause bacteria by virtue of a stomach ulcer providing a fertile environment for bacteria to grow?
<cite>
In fact, most people who have H. pylori infections do not get ulcers.
<cite>
The hypothesis that ulcers are caused by bacteria requires reclassification of the disease as an infectious disease, where previously it was viewed as caused by acid imbalance and was sometimes even classified as psychosomatic. Reclassification of ulcers as an infectious disease goes hand in hand with decision to treat them with antibiotics.
<cite>
Many gastroenterologists, however, found it much more difficult to consider a challenge to accepted views about the causes of peptic ulcers. By the early 1980s, it was widely believed that excess stomach acid is the main cause of peptic ulcers. People with increased amounts of acid were found to me more likely to get the disease, and cimetidine (brand name Tagamet) and ranitidine (brand name Zantac) were found to be effective antacid means of healing ulcers. Physicians thus had both an explanation in terms of excess acidity of why some people get ulcers, and an effective means of treating those people with Tagamet and Zantac, which remain among the most widely prescribed drugs. Hence hypothesis 2 that ulcers are caused by bacteria clashed with the hypothesis that acidity is the main culprit in peptic ulceration, and hypothesis 3 clashed with the effective standard treatment. It is not surprising, therefore, that many gastroenterologists rejected the new hypotheses as incoherent with what was already known (see section 4). Hence Marshall, a young, unknown Australian who put forward his new hypotheses with confidence amounting to brashness, was viewed as crazy.
<cite>
John Graham (1995) used the lack of fulfillment of Koch's postulates to cast doubt on the hypothesis that ulcers are caused by bacteria and contended that H. pylori is nothing more than an opportunist that accompanies ulcers. He maintained (p. 1096) that "as long as Koch's postulates remain unfulfilled for H. pylori as a cause of peptic ulcers or gastric malignancy, it is quite wrong for authoritative medical bodies to attempt to produce consensus documents that suggest that the eradication of H. pylori is an essential component of preventive or healing therapy."
<cite>
It shows that the hypothesis that ulcers are caused by gastric spiral bacteria was problematic for at least two reasons. First, it competed with the well-established hypothesis that peptic ulcers are caused by excess acidity. The most impressive evidence for this hypothesis was the healing of ulcers using drugs like Tagamet. Second, the hypothesis that gastric bacteria exist was incompatible with the accepted assumption that the stomach was too acidic for permanent bacterial growth. Since only a few researchers had observed the bacteria, and since there was only a small amount of evidence connecting ulcers and bacteria, it is not surprising that Marshall's hypothesis was greeted with incredulity. The bacteria that Warren observed could be explained as the result of contamination. Maximizing coherence, that is accepting and rejecting propositions in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of constraints, required rejecting the hypothesis that ulcers are caused by bacteria.
<cite>
Although figure 5 reflects the belief systems of many gastroenterologists at the time, the belief systems of Warren and Marshall were quite different. Warren's systematic observations made it clear to them that the stomach does contain gastric spiral bacteria and hence is not sterile; they knew that contamination was not a plausible explanation of Warren's results. Marshall was relatively new to gastroenterology but had a background in infectious diseases, so a bacteriological explanation of ulcers was less alien to him than to most gastroenterologists. But in 1983 their beliefs were at odds with accepted wisdom
