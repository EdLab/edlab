<a href="http://www.inanimatealice.com/">Inanimate Alice</a> is an exercise in digital media.  The website offers a series of episodes following the adventures of Alice, a young girl who travels across the world with her family.  Each episode is an interactive multi-media presentation that includes text, images, music, and video, and requires user interaction to advance the story.  It's designed to provide engaging narratives for the age of digital literacy.
<!--break-->
Pros:
Using a variety of tools, the episodes tell theirs stories in a fairly engaging manger.  As they progress, they grow in complexity, and eventually involve puzzles and interactive games.  The plots are age-appropriate (around 10-12 years), engaging, and dramatic.  The creators also provide an education packet to help teachers fully utilize the resource in their curriculum.  

Cons:
My questions have more to do with the goal than its execution.  The purpose is to teach digital literacy, but is this really something that needs to be taught in school?  I would guess that fairly often the students are more digitally literate than the teacher.  I am uncertain how much these new resources supplement, and how much they distract from, the central task of teaching reading and writing.  The games in particular don't seem to have much connection with the stories, or with reading.  The pictures, the music, the videos, all are emotionally effective, but take up space at the expense of the writing.  

Our Takeaway:
All the new digital tools that are now available certainly provide an opportunity to make engaging stories.  And traditional reading instruction, particularly for those who aren't big natural readers, is going to have to work hard to compete with movies and computer games.  But we should be careful to make sure that competing doesn't turn into surrendering.  I don't think “Inanimate Alice” goes that far, but occasionally it does skirt the line.


Edlab Relevance:
Certainly we should keep our eye on new developments in the “digital book” world, and there seems to be a lot of potential in this space for integrated media.  On the other hand, I think the educational potential needs to be made a lot clearer.  Otherwise, we may let the technology constrain our learning, and funnel it into undesirable areas.
