          <p>
            <a href="http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/"><strong>The 2010 Horizon Report</strong></a> is out.

Published by the New Media Consortium in collaboration with EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative, the 7th annual report is a qualitative research project that identifies and describes emerging technologies for the next five years.

(Personal pitch: This year's report is particularly more interesting than past reports because it is published using <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/">CommentPress</a>, a Wordpress blogging theme and plugin that allows readers to comment paragraph by paragraph in the margins of the original text.)

For a preview, check below six emerging technologies/practices that are "likely to have a large impact on teaching, learning, or creative inquiry on college and university campuses":

<strong>One Year or Less: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mobile Computing
</span></strong><em>The available choices for staying connected while on the go are many â€“ smart phones, netbooks, laptops, and a wide range of other devices access the Internet using cellular-based portable hotspots and mobile broadband cards, in addition to wi-fi that is increasingly available wherever people congregate. At the same time, the devices we carry are becoming ever more capable, and the boundaries between them more and more blurred.</em>

<strong>One Year or Less: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open Content</span></strong><em>
The movement toward open content reflects a growing shift in the way academics in many parts of the world are conceptualizing education to a view that is more about the process of learning than the information conveyed in their courses. Information is everywhere; the challenge is to make effective use of it.</em>

<strong>Two to Three Years: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Electronic Books
</span></strong><em>The convenience of carrying an entire library in a purse, pocket, or book bag appeals to readers who find time for a few pages in between appointments or while commuting. Already firmly established in the public sector, electronic books are gaining a foothold on campuses as well, where they serve as a cost-effective and portable alternative to heavy textbooks and supplemental reading selections.</em>

<strong>Two to Three Years: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Simple Augmented Reality</span></strong><em>
Advances in mobile devices as well as in the different technologies that combine the real world with virtual information have led to augmented reality applications that are as near to hand as any other application on a laptop or a smart phone. New uses for augmented reality are being explored and new experiments undertaken now that it is easy to do so. </em>

<strong>Four to Five Years: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gesture-Based Computing
</span></strong><em>The full realization of the potential of gesture-based computing is still several years away, especially for education; but we are moving ever closer to a time when our gestures will speak for us, even to our machines.</em>

<strong>Four to Five Years: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visual Data Analysis
</span></strong><em>Ultra high-resolution displays allow teams of researchers to zoom in to examine specific aspects of the renderings, or to navigate along interesting visual pathways, following their intuitions and even hunches to see where they may lead. New research is now beginning to apply these sorts of tools to the social sciences and humanities as well, and the techniques offer considerable promise in helping us understand complex social processes like learning, political and organizational change, and the diffusion of knowledge.</em>
