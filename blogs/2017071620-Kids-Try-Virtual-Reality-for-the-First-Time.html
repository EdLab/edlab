<p>When I was growing up, Gameboys were second nature, like an extension of my arm. For my nephews, it’s iPads. For the children born 5 years from now, maybe it will be virtual reality headsets. I remember the first time I tried virtual reality, as do the children in this video, but there might come a time where children experience VR so regularly that it’s hard to imagine life without it. Already we see how different generations react to trying out VR for the first time.</p>

<p>Most of the children in this video said that they liked VR, and most said they would want it in their own homes. Yet more interesting is that some kids stated that VR was just as real as the world around them. "Just like it’s called, virtual reality . . . it is reality," says one child. "It felt like I was in a totally different place that I’ve never been before, because I was," says another. Because these children experience VR as a real place, it may more seamlessly integrate into their lives than it has into mine. One thing seems sure: if a piece of new technology catches the interest of children, it’s likely here to stay, because in just a few years, they’ll be the ones developing it, VR included.</p>

<p>Do you think that VR will play a big part in children’s lives in the future? How do you think VR might be used, whether for entertainment, learning, or social purposes? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/38470/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:10 Francisco.Mendoza99154:</b> The VR should play a huge part in children's lives. It can teach "hands-on" sort of jobs without the risk of actually ruining any work in the process.</p>

<p><b>@01:13 Cinthia.Fabian:</b> I have a hard time buying into the idea that VR will completely substitute real-life experiences, i.e. field trips, travel, volunteering, etc. But I could see how it could make activities that would otherwise be by-the-book more interactive and engaging for students.</p>
