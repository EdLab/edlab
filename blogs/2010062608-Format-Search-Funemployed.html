Check out this new video series from Wong Fu and Kev Jumba with new episodes throughout the summer.  So far through Episode 3 the commentaries, bloopers, and outtakes taken together seem like a really useful format for sharing information about the making of the series.

I think that there are lessons for some projects that we have been contemplating.  Jeff and Erin have been developing plans for a video journal project that would be directed to schools of education to give them an outlet for ed school produced videos.  It seems that such a journal might also include materials on better ways to create videos, and the format being used with Funemployed illustrates how such materials might be more heavily video based than some other approaches we have considered that rely more on text presentations and related case materials.  

It would be interesting to consider ways to build some experiments into the new video journal project that would allow us to examine the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches (e.g., video, no text; heavy video, light text; video and text equally, etc.).  Outcome variables might include audience uptake, information transmission, subsequent action/utilization/engagement, etc.

The other take away is the idea of creating a series on some common learning tasks (e.g., how to write a term paper) that would be engaging and educational for students at various levels and that would integrate things that we often present in a disconnected dry way (e.g., how to use the library; how to find journal articles).
