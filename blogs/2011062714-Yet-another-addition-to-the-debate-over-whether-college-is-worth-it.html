          <p>
            For all of you loyal followers of the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5963">Schoolyard Brawl podcast</a>, I thought I'd mention <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/sunday-review/26leonhardt.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">David Leonhardt's article</a> published yesterday in the Sunday Times.  The article is an attempt to push back against the kind of anti-college rhetoric that Skanda and I, for instance, have been exhibiting on this blog..  Grounding his case in empirical research, Leonhardt claims that the lifetime income gains from a college education are so enormous as to make insignificant any of the minor arguments against going to college that have so far been marshaled.  
<!--break-->
From the data provided by one recent study he concludes that even in blue-collar fields (plumbing, construction) the gains from a college degree are fairly large.  He also takes on the "signaling" theory we've discussed (wherein college only benefits by demonstrating to people that you possess certain desirable personality traits) by arguing "Various natural experiments – like teenagers' proximity to a campus, which affects whether they enroll – have shown that people do acquire skills in college."

Although I have my doubts about the various claims he makes in the article (I believe he fails to adequately address questions about what the causal role of college in these income gains actually is), the most egregious argument in my view is his closing statement: "I don't doubt that the skeptics are well meaning. But, in the end, their case against college is an elitist one – for me and not for thee. And that's rarely good advice."  I recommend Leonhardt read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Masses-JosÃ©-Ortega-Gasset/dp/0393310957/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1309198037&sr=8-1">"The Revolt of the Masses,"</a> and discover his own, inner elitist.
