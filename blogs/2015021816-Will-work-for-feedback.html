            **Private**

I've heard from a number of users regarding <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/11536" target="_blank">their thoughts on NLT as a whole</a>, so it was time to break it down and concentrate on a smaller subset of the entire NLT experience: mobile onboarding. 

For the past couple weeks, Panisuan, Hui Soo, and I have been pining over one seemingly simple question, “How do we make the NLT mobile orientation and signup experience less painful?” It took several meetings, mockups, and memail exchanges (alliterate or obliterate!), but we finally came up with something we thought could work. 

One prominent piece of feedback I heard from users from previous testing sessions regarded the sign up wall. They weren't convinced why they should sign up (they needed to hear more benefits) and they all thought the wall popped up way too soon, before they could assess whether the content was worth signing up for. 

With that, we thought we could include a set of intro slides for users who are coming in hot to NLT mobile for the first time ever. You know the slides… the ones you see when first downloading Chrome on your phone, for example. These ones!
<img src="https://d2ba1wehz8pq9c.cloudfront.net/Vialogues/chromeintro5_0ae63c1c048a4044b0d62ff93ff2d1f8.gif"/ >

These slides could serve the purpose of more clearly identifying what NLT is and what readers would get out of reading it. Or so we hoped. 

The next idea we came up with was to essentially make it so that the mobile user would technically never have to sign up if they chose not to. We would accomplish this by having subtle messaging throughout the site (maybe appearing/disappearing at the top of articles, maybe staying constant in the footer), encouraging readers to create an account or log in. No presh. Do or don't. Or do. Or don't! 

So after all the discussions, Panisuan took a little javascript here, some <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/" target="_blank">Foundation for Apps</a> there,  mixed it all together and baked up a pretty spectacular working prototype. This would become the basis of what we tested on. (Bigups to my followers of lean/agile workflowsss what what.)

At this point, Panisuan and I were eager to get some feedback from “real” users to know if we are moving in the right direction. And so just yesterday we sought out that glorious mecca overflowing with ripe testers: the Test Tube usability meetup (for details on how the meetup itself works, see the first hyperlink in this post.)

(<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/11536" target="_blank">Oh fine, I'll just post it again, lazies.</a>). 

We received some great feedback on our current design. I'm going to share some of the main takeaways per feature now, but I realize this may be a little (or very) abstract to you, since you have not seen our mockups. Pretend? 

<b>Intro slides</b>
<ul>
<li>Messaging is clear, particularly the slide describing the concrete benefit (“All articles take less than 2 minutes to read”) but it may not be enough to compel people to sign up. “What kind of articles will I be reading?” they wondered.</li>
</ul>

<b>Signup process</b>
<ul>
<li>The amount of fields we ask users to fill out (we simplified to first/last name, username, email, password) is not taxing, but we may want to reconsider asking for first/last name and/or username, if possible. </li>
</ul>

<b>Social login (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.)</b>
<ul>
<li>Main sentiment: “I won't miss it if it's not there.” </li>
</ul>

<b>Footer</b>
<ul>
<li>Having a constant footer message (asking people to sign up) is not disruptive. ”</li>
</ul>

<b>Content teasers (showing only part of an article, forcing them to sign in to read the rest)</b>
<ul>
<li>People need to see more in order to be convinced that signing up is worth their time and effort. </li>
</ul>

Be on the lookout for a sneak peak at the new NLT designs!
