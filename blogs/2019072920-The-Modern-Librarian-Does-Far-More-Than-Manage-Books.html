<p>The old-school image of what a library is and does no longer fits with what many modern libraries have become. While books are still an important part of the library experience, learning and research tools have expanded in the digital age to include online resources. These resources connect learners to a variety of sources, people, and places, and open doors to an education that <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_library">Andrew Carnegie</a> could only have imagined.</p>

<p>Small-town librarian Karey Killian recognizes the importance of both books and digital tools in exposing children to the larger world around them. Whether learning is taking place through reading a picture book or asking questions of a researcher over Skype, Karey does everything within her power to prepare the children she serves for success in the future.</p>

<p>Why are books still such an important learning technology? In addition to books, what new learning tools and resources do you think libraries should start to offer? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50910">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:16 Cinthia Fabian: </b>"Books are windows to the world and my job is to introduce the world to students." My opinion on this has shifted slightly as an adult with a bit more life experience under my belt, but as a kid who often felt trapped in a hum-drum routine, I definitely relied on books as an escape and continue to cherish all the windows they opened for me!</p>

<p><b>@00:44 Sara Hardman: </b>I really like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5704/the-public-library-innovation-exchange">this collaboration</a> between MIT Media Lab and a public library in Akron, Ohio. The media lab helped bring makerspace tools to the Akron library so they could offer learners hands-on projects focused on creating and playing with technology.</p>
