Independent learning advocate, adjunct professor, and author of <a href="http://www.kiostark.com/dont-go-back-to-school/">"Don't Go Back to School,"</a> <a href="http://www.kiostark.com/">Kio Stark</a> has taken an unconventional road to the learning revolution.  Despite (or because of) her experiences at Yale and while teaching at both <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program</a> as well as at <a href="http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/">City College</a>, Stark hopes to increase awareness for, and legitimacy of, "DIY learning."  One of Stark’s ultimate goals is to provide "options in an age of debt and disappointment with higher educational experiences," and "...increase our culture’s respect for independent learning."  Stark has over 15 years experience in interactive advertising, having consulted for both startups and large companies.  She also has extensive experience with community field research for technology projects and online games, and speaks on relational technology at conferences around the world. Stark completed an undergraduate degree from UNC-Chapel Hill before going on to complete a portion of advanced doctoral work at Yale University’s American Studies program.  She chose to drop out and pursue her mission of helping other life-long learners to do the same.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I went to a non-traditional elementary school, and that really set my expectations for learning experiences in terms of autonomy, collaboration, contextual learning, and respect. I took that with me through my whole education and into the research for "Don’t Go Back to School," and thinking I do now about learning.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> Independent learning is a political issue as well as an educational movement. It’s about opening up institutions and changing culture. My first job, at <a href="http://www.thenation.com/#axzz2bOPpnRaP">the Nation magazine</a> made me very aware of the power of writing in the process of social change. I also taught classes at a part of City College called the Center for Worker Education, which at that time was evening college for working adults getting their BA. The women I taught—they were mostly women—had, for the most part, just put their kids through college. One summed up the common attitude among them as "Ok, it’s my turn, and I want knowledge." Their commitment to learning was amazing, and so different from even our most idealized image of a young, eager college student. Only 14% of college students in America are in residential schools; most are in community colleges or are older students. I am lucky that I got to see that from the inside when I was young. It’s important to know how the world works beyond our cherished images of the world, in this case beyond the residential college full of 18-22 year olds. And when I started working on Don’t Go Back to School, I was thinking of my adult students, about giving them options in an age of debt and disappointment with higher educational experiences.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I will have done my work well if my writing and activism help create greater openness on the part of educational institutions, enable the development of learning resources and technology that respond to actual needs and are developed with concrete knowledge about learning and teaching, and increase our culture’s respect for independent learning.
<p>

<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We live in a culture that increasingly values sharing and collaboration, and we’re pressuring institutions to open up. That is a huge social change and it’s going to have fantastic effects on learning experiences and opportunities. A lot of smart people are working on technologies to support those values and activities, and they have the potential to shake things up if they work from human-centered principles—which is to say, defining and designing their work based on knowledge of what people need. I also think that the amplified movement for social justice, including fighting income inequality, is a context in which free and independent learning is essential. On the negative side, right now we’re dealing with serious privacy issues as technology is brought into school systems, and given the current American climate of trampled civil liberties, that is especially worrisome.
<p>
I’m throwing a teach-in event for September 12 that will take place at <a href="http://www.arch.columbia.edu/studio-x-global">Studio-X</a>, working on a journalism education project with the Knight and Mozilla foundations, and planning a new book about curiosity.
