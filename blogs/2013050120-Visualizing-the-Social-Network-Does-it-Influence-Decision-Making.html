<p><b>Title:</b> Using Social Network Graphs as Visualization Tools to Influence Peer Selection Decision-Making Strategies to Access Information About Complex Socioscientific Issues (2011)<p>
<b>Author:</b> Susan A. Yoon<p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
The study <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2011.563655">Using Social Network Graphs as Visualization Tools to Influence Peer Selection Decision-Making Strategies to Access Information About Complex Socioscientific Issues</a> investigated how a visual representation of the social networks that account for individual and group-level dynamic processes could improve learning outcomes. The author was particularly interested in strategic decisions about the social channels students use when seeking information. For the study, 70+ 7th graders were asked to rate several controversial statements and provide rationales. Their positions on the statements were mapped onto a graph that each student was able to access via a handheld device. They were then instructed to pair up with other students and talk about their ratings and rationales, and these conversations were also mapped on the handheld graph.</p>

<p>Participants were encouraged to reflect on what they had heard and change their ratings on the statements if they became convinced by other students’ rationales. The social network graph computed these changes and was shown on the handheld device throughout the exercise. During the process students were not told how to structure their rationales, how to think strategically about choosing discussion partners, or how to provide more evidence or make their arguments more persuasive. The data was coded based on whether students paired up at random, based on different or similar ratings, with friends or familiar people, or for information seeking. In the survey that followed, students were asked to reflect on the way they chose conversation partners and who they would select as a conversation partner if the test was repeated. Data examined came from the post-exercise survey, the logs of the conversation period, transcriptions, researchers’ notes, and the rationales given by the students.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The majority of students said that they used graph data to plan their conversations. Several students suggested that the number of connections or ties certain students had on the graph would influence their choice in the second round. For instance, "I would like to talk to Rachel because it seems she only talked to two people which means the conversations were long which also means she had good ideas." Overall, the results showed that the nature of the strategies selected by students during their interactions in the exercise shifted from socially based to information based and this change was influenced by the use of social network visualization. The findings suggests that reflective and information-driven mechanisms are an important factor in the creation of collaborative learning connections and groups.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study showed that social network visualizations are valuable learning tools for students and that the visualization of complex phenomena through technological applications can improve student understanding. Data visualization is a contemporary trend, but this research suggests that it is an effective aid to decision making and understanding. More quantitative studies might help cement the role of visualizations as a tool for education, but this study implies that it has a promising future in K-12 classrooms.</p>
