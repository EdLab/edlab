<p>The filter bubble and echo chamber have come to raise concerns in recent years. The idea, first proposed by <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles">Eli Pariser</a>, is that although the internet was originally hailed as a great democratic tool, people with a narrow political leaning tend to surround themselves online with other like-minded people. This is particularly the case on social media sites such as Facebook. Although this is not a problem in and of itself, there is cause for democratic concern when people <i>only</i> hear like-minded opinions and ignore news articles from opposing positions; this is the filter bubble, and many believe it leads to greater political polarization.</p>
 
<p>The effect has been widely contested, with <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/04/filter_bubbles_revisited_the_internet_may_not_be_driving_political_polarization.html">several studies</a> suggesting that the filter bubble does not have a significant effect on polarization. Yet on the other side, research also continues to prove that the filter bubble is real and could be harmful to our democracy.</p>
 
<p>One such study was recently conducted with nearly 100 college students in the US. The researchers were interested in the connection between newsfeed customizability and the filter bubble effect. By customizability, they meant how the newsfeed adapted to fit the political preferences of the readers. Despite this, the participants in both the customizability group and the control group had access to news articles from both conservative and liberal perspectives.</p>
 
<p>The research found that the participants browsing the customized newsfeed were far more likely to read articles they already agreed with and far less likely to read articles from an opposing point of view than participants in the control group. Participants in the latter group were more likely to read articles they both agreed and disagreed with.</p>

<p>The researchers assert that this phenomenon poses a threat to democracy because it undermines one of the key democratic values: engaging with other voices and opinions rather than silencing them. The problem is most people aren’t even aware that the filter bubble exists, much less that they’re living in one. It is the responsibility of news and social media sites to lessen the potential for the filter bubble to exist. Otherwise, as the researchers note, our democratic values could be at stake.</p>
