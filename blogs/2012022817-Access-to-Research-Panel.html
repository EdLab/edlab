Today Jo and I attended the <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/news/libraries/2012/20120216_access_to_research_panel.html"><i>Panel to Consider Recent Developments in Access to Research</i></a> at Columbia University. The panel was meant to discuss the Elsevier boycott, the Research Works Act, and the Occupy movement as they relate to traditional and digital scholarly publishing. This article is a compilation of collaborative notes we took during the presentation. The panel included: 

<b>Allan Adler</b>, Vice President for Legal and Governmental Affairs in the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the Association of American Publishers
<b>Oona Schmid</b>, the Director of Publishing at the American Anthropological Association
<b>Peter Woit</b>, a <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/">blogger</a> and Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at Columbia University
<b>Gail Drakes</b>, a doctoral candidate in the Program in American Studies at New York University and Associate Faculty at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study
<b>Alex Golub</b>, an open access advocate and assistant professor of Anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa

The event began with brief presentations moving from traditional publishing models towards open access options. Allan Adler spoke of the necessary role for-profit publishers have played in the dissemination and preservation of information and Oona Schmid built on this argument to describe the costs of these services and the deeply interdependent relationship between commercial publishing, volunteer effort, and libraries. 

Peter Woit personalized this struggle by relating information from his own department surrounding the Elsevier boycott. The reasons that scholars, especially mathematicians, targeted Elsevier over other conglomerate publishers has been a source of speculation in the library community but he attributes it to the poor quality of Elsevier mathematics journals, the failure of the company to evolve with discipline demands, and the replication of its data in open access publications. Woit emphasized the disconnect between the publication of scholarly content and libraries as consumers as primarily an issue of misrepresentation by commercial publishing. As libraries increasingly respond to usage data with demand driven purchasing, “big deal” publishing packages like those offered by Elsevier will become less acceptable. 

Gail Drakes, who has a self-professed “love/love” relationship with libraries, spoke about the necessity of widespread access to scholarly content especially in the case of traditionally marginalized groups. Oona Schmid addressed this topic by explaining AAA's commitment to philanthropic endeavors in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, First Nation and Tribal Colleges, and developing countries though this application was far from the ideal explained by the final speaker, Alex Golub. Golub, also an anthropologist, suggested that the work and compensation issues that have traditionally surrounded scholarly production are void because digital communication has fundamentally altered the concept of scholarship. 

Despite Woit's talk of “global village idiots” and the quality control problems of online academic communities, Golub's point is valid and raises a number of related questions for institutions that mean to provide preservation services to emerging venues such as Twitter. A comment by Jim Jordan, President and Director of the Columbia University Press brought the conversation back to the bottom line. Publisher or library, some institution or alliance of institutions will have to support scholarship into the future and it's important to consider the resources required in both closed and open access publishing.
