<p><a href="https://diy.org/">DIY App – Creative Community for Kids</a> is an online learning and community app that’s targeted for students aged 6-16. Students can choose from a full range of individual skills under larger themes: art, athletics, building, business, citizenship, design, engineering, exploring, growing, hacking, philosophy, and science. To earn a badge, kids must complete three tasks and then upload proof of completion (either a video or photo). The community aspect of the app allows users to "follow" each other, like other posts, and write messages to the other learners. Teachers or parents can closely monitor the progress and interactions of their students or children. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The app offers an appealing and easy-to-use interface that is kid friendly and free to use. There are so many skills to choose from that there should be no problem satisfying young learners with diverse interests and from different backgrounds. For this review, I earned the "Meme Hackers" skill badge, which centered on creating and thinking about the concept of memes. Another amusing skill was the "Grown Up" badge, with challenges like "make coffee," "floss," and "take out a loan." I am happy to report that I successfully earned the "Grown Up" badge. </p>

</p>These courses are fairly simple to figure out and fun to explore. Kids will enjoy the ‘leveling up’ aspect that comes from completing tasks and earning badges. Also, the posts from community members are quite helpful. Seeing the other completed projects posted in the streams should be encouraging for children.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some of the tasks require pricey materials or other resources. For instance, the "Ornithologists" badge (for those who study birds) has challenges that require a telephoto lens or owl droppings. DIY is not selling these items, but they do expect learners to already have them. This issue could discourage less-privileged students from completing tasks. I also noticed that the DIY was a little buggy. At one point the app disappeared from my iPhone, videos would sometimes fail to load, and the entire app froze on several occasions. </p>
 
<p>A larger concern I have is with safety. Even though DIY is designed for kids only, an adult can simply sign up for the app to join the network. A small notification reminds them that the community is for children, yet they're given all the privileges of a minor user. I think the app might want to consider better controls to separate adult users from the kid community. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>DIY App – Creative Community for Kids is a fun learning app for elementary and young high school students. I think parents will especially like to utilize the app during summer or other school vacations. Even though some skill badges require materials, most badges have alternative routes for completion. So, students still should be able to earn most badges, even without too many extra items. Adults might also want to pay extra attention to community connections made through the app. But, overall this is a nice free app that makes learning fun and accessible to students with different interests. </p>
