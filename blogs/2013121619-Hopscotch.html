<p><a href="https://www.gethopscotch.com/">Hopscotch</a> is an iPad app that teaches the basic concepts of coding to younger students using colorful characters. Upon launching the app, users select a character to command. They are then directed to a dashboard where they can drag commands to a script space, select a starting position, rename the character, and add new characters. The app displays code as code blocks much like <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>’s coding app <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/868">Scratch</a>. One feature that sets Hopscotch apart is the ability to activate actions by shaking or tilting the iPad.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The controls of the app are easy to master and users can take command of multiple characters at once and move text around the screen. The app allows students full freedom to explore all commands and control their characters. The commands are presented with a visual representation of common lines of code that look like blocks. A line of code that seems to be popular among players gives characters the ability to leave a trail line. Students can try to draw shapes or any other figures by customizing the control for each character.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The game does not seem to have any goals or objectives. The purpose of the app is to introduce young students to programming logic, but it does not evaluate users’ learning. Some of the language on the programming blocks may be too advanced for younger players but it is possible to learn how every block functions through trial and error. The app is only available for iPad, which could exclude some players or classrooms. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Hopscotch gives students a way to explore basic programming and may inspire them to learn how to code in the future. The app takes full advantage of the iPad’s controls which enables users to shake or tilt the device to activate a command. This fun functionality sets Hopscotch apart from similar learning resources and websites. To help students become comfortable with programming, teachers and parents should provide a good variety of learning resources, like Scratch and Hopscotch. The app is a fun way to start exploring the world of coding and help students flex their creative muscles.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Hopscotch lets kids play with coding.</p>
