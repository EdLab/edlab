Ashley Bittner is a principal at <a href="http://www.owlvc.com/">Owl Ventures</a>, a Bay Area venture capital fund that invests in the world’s leading education technology companies. She previously served as a White House appointee where she worked in the Office of Innovation and Improvement to support the development and scaling of innovative approaches to improving student outcomes across the country. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Owl Ventures?</b><br>
<p>I became passionate about innovation in education from my experience teaching in the Bronx through Teach for America. I taught 7th and 8th grade Social Studies at a traditional public school and struggled to meaningfully meet the individual needs of over 130 students. I hoped that technology could improve outcomes and access for students across the education system. After I completed Teach for America, I pursued my MBA at The Wharton School and my MPA at the Harvard Kennedy School. I focused on social entrepreneurship and investing at Wharton, and social and urban policy at HKS. While in graduate school, I explored a variety of roles that all touched on an aspect of innovation in education: interning at NewSchools Venture Fund, at a charter school, at an education technology company, and at an education consultancy. I then joined the Boston Consulting Group in DC with the hopes of refining an analytical toolkit to bring to the education sector in the near future. I was asked to join the Obama Administration’s Office of Innovation, where I learned the government’s approach to scaling innovative practices and tiered-evidence systems. These experiences inform my perspective as an investor at Owl Ventures.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you decide which edtech companies to invest in?</b><br>
<p>Owl invests in companies that are addressing significant education challenges that translate to large market opportunities. We invest in companies that have demonstrated product-market fit, a path to scale, and evidence of effectiveness that will give the company a competitive advantage.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>We see many major technology trends being applied to the education sector. We see companies leveraging AI, VR/AR, distributed workforces, etc., to improve outcomes across the education spectrum.</p>
 
<p><b>What, if any, are upcoming or future plans for Owl Ventures?</b><br>
<p>Owl will continue to invest in education entrepreneurs across the education spectrum, from early learning to K-12 to post-secondary to career mobility, in both the US and abroad.</p>
