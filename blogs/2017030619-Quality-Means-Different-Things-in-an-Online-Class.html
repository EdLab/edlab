<p>We all want our online learning experiences to be high quality, but when it comes to higher education courses, there are differing opinions on what characteristics give a class value. In fact, when it comes to the most important elements in an online course, students, teachers, and administrators all seem to disagree. That’s not to say that groups do not value the top characteristics proposed by the others; rather there is no overlap in the qualities that they <i>value most</i>. In order to examine these values, researchers recently surveyed over 450 people at two mid-sized American universities.</p>
 
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, students most valued characteristics that contributed to learner support: course clarity, teacher availability, and feedback. In the courses students considered to be of highest quality, there are clear learning objectives, teachers make themselves available for student questions at set hours each week, and regular feedback is provided throughout the class.</p>
 
<p>Teachers, on the other hand, most valued characteristics that contributed to active engagement with and among their students. For instance, the top feature of a high quality online course for educators was interaction with their students; the second was having an engaging platform. This finding demonstrates that teachers highly value connecting with their students when teaching an online course, although many online learning platforms do not make these relationships easy to build.</p>
 
<p>Finally, administrators most valued characteristics that contributed to effective course design. For them, the most important features of a high-quality online course were that the class meets objectives and outcomes and that it is comparably rigorous to traditional in-person courses. These qualities suggest that administrators are mostly concerned that online courses live up to qualitative university standards, helping preserve the institutional value of their online programs.</p>
 
<p>Although this study demonstrates that students, teachers, and administrators most value different characteristics in an online course, none of the given features were <i>unimportant</i> to any other group. Clarity is an important feature for administrators, just as rigor is for students. Yet these differing priorities are important to acknowledge in online course design, teaching strategies, and student support in order to focus on the needs of a specific group.</p>
