<a href="https://diy.org/">DIY.org</a> encourages young users ages 6 and up to create materials, share self-produced pictures and video, and earn badges for every creation they share. The site lists a set of categories designed to appeal to K-8 users including astronomy, biology, hardware hacker, and solar engineer. Users can access a list of craft descriptions and instructions for each category. Each craft project includes creation instructions that seem to be curated by the site creators from outside sources. Three completed and shared crafts in a single category earns the user a badge for that category. The gamification elements help inspire users to produce more crafts and get creative. DIY creates community by encouraging users to post pictures and videos of their crafts and comment on other users’ creations. The social features of the site are enhanced by the ability to follow other users and receive updates on their new projects, badges, and comments.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>DIY is well organized and easy to navigate. Crafts are listed in order of complexity under each category. Users can also search finished products to get a better idea of the final result. DIY is both a web app and an iOS app; the latter enables makers to upload pictures and video instantly. Because the site is aimed towards younger users, a connected parental login lets parents view their child’s online activity and the creations in their online portfolio. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because the site creators import instructions from outside sources, they are often inconsistent. Some lack detailed instruction or merely feature a picture of the finished product without any text instruction. Since the site’s target users are ages 6 and up, they may need more direction for craft creation. DIY should work to moderate or add more crowdsourcing elements to improve incomplete directions.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Craft creation has long been a staple of K-8 education. DIY updates this to blended learning and encourages users to make things in real life and share them socially online. The site contains ideas for relevant, hands-on learning projects in science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Teachers could use the projects on DIY as a supplement to their curriculum to encourage peer reviewing and social sharing among class members. DIY could potentially increase user engagement by crowdsourcing instructions and allowing users to add tips and hints for crafts they have completed. Instruction could be in the form of text, video, or pictures showing each step of the creation process. Encouraging peer assistance and group resource curation and development could be essential web skills for DIY’s key audience.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>DIY allows users to learn, create, and share learning creations.</p>
