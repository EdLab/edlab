Gene Swank is the Chief Operating Officer of ScreenTime Solutions, an edtech company that utilizes a machine learning algorithm to limit and monitor children’s screen time. A senior executive, serial entrepreneur, consultant, thought leader, and engineer, Swank serves on the board of directors for Springs Charter Schools and the Plant A Seed Institute. He is also a contributor to the Huffington Post and mentors numerous business start-ups around the country.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at ScreenTime Solutions?</b><br>
<p>My education and work experiences were always centered on technology, specifically software engineering. I graduated from the University of Central Missouri with a degree in business and computer information systems and my career has closely paralleled my educational background. In my previous roles as a C-Suite executive, I built and launched numerous products, including disruptive technologies in the mobile and wireless industries. My role at ScreenTime Solutions is not limited to running a business; I love to immerse myself in the development of the technology and occasionally even call upon my previous experience as a software engineer.</p>
 
<p><b>What has been the response from parents who have used ScreenTime Solutions with their children?</b><br>
<p>To be quite honest, the response from parents has been phenomenal. Going all the way back to our beta program, parents have been a big fan of what we are doing. Over 90% of the participants said they would recommend the product to their friends and family. Since launching our product on the Google Play store, we have received a 4.4 star average rating. Parents have expressed to us how painful it is to convince their children to trade screen time for studying. We have found a way to use technology as the enforcer. The concept of a fully automated system that requires children to earn the time that they spend in front of an electronic device has gone over very well with our amazing customer base.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I personally believe that personalized learning is the future. What I mean by that is students will have a more intimate learning experience that is provided by advancements in technology. Applying technology such as artificial intelligence and adaptive learning engines to the education experience will help the students (and their educators) identify problem areas more rapidly. This allows students to learn at their own pace and focus on the problem areas. I believe AI will be utilized to provide valuable feedback and reinforce long-term retention.</p>

<p><b>What was the inspiration for starting ScreenTime Solutions?</b><br>
<p>The idea for the business came about out of pure necessity. My oldest son would sneak away to play video games instead of studying for his upcoming tests. I decided to dust off my software engineering cap and quickly came up with a prototype to enforce the concept of earned screen time by answering educational questions. The product has evolved immensely since the early days, with artificial intelligence and a dashboard for the parents, but the overall mission has stayed the same. We want to add value to children’s lives by applying the science of learning to mobile devices. We believe that we can have a positive influence on a child’s test scores and improve their confidence.</p>
