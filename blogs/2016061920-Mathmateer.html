<p>Space exploration takes an educational flight with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mathmateer-free/id408770902?mt=8">Mathmateer</a>. Ideal for students who need a bit more math practice outside school, this app allows kids to create their own rockets and fly them through atmospheres full of multiplication, shape sorting, and coin counting problems, to name a few. So it goes in Mathmateer: with one small step (downloading the app), kids may take one giant leap in math progress.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Mathmateer gives players many options: buy new parts for your rocket (and make sure it’s balanced!), do speed rounds of math to collect coins, and work your way through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems. The variety of challenges will likely keep children entertained as they work through various mathematical atmospheres. In addition, Mathmateer offers several levels of difficulty, meaning that as kids play, they can learn to master more challenging problems. Finally, the quirkiness of this game allows kids room to be silly; from decorating their rockets with coke cans to steering them through zigzags, kids will enjoy the humorous elements this app provides.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Several members of our team tested this product, and the consensus was that this app is not exactly intuitive. The directions are written in a font that is difficult to read and placed at the bottom of the screen, out of a person’s natural gaze. On top of that, the app does not have an intuitive flow, nor does it have an overarching goal to work toward. Moving around the different games can be confusing, and despite the variety, with no clear direction tying the games together, children might lose interest more quickly than they improve their math skills. Finally, although there is a free version of this app, it does not provide players with many game options. To make true math progress with Mathmateer, the $1.99 version is a person’s best bet. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Mathmateer can be a fun way for children to engage in mathematical drills outside the classroom. Its wide range of games provides kids with the extra practice they need at any level. Although the app could benefit from having clearer directions and a definite goal, when it does keeps kids entertained, they’ll be able to practice math and have fun at the same time. </p>
