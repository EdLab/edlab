<p>The history of educational apps shows an impressive upward trajectory in both production volume and consumer embrace. In 2008 Apple opened its online store with 552 apps. In 2015 the store created a special section targeting preschoolers with word games, basic counting and mathematical operations, number identification games, memory games, interactive books, card games, and puzzles, along with more sophisticated apps that use an open adaptive design so children can create their own content. In 2016 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reversed its position on apps for toddlers and advised parents to choose high-quality educational apps.</p>
 
<p>But a Greek study found the AAP advice is almost impossible to enact as most of the educational apps, which now number upwards of 100,000, were not created to be educational. The researchers investigated the content, types of knowledge, and design of 40 apps in the education or family categories for Greek preschoolers. They used the REVEAC scale (the rubric for the evaluation of educational apps for preschool children) to examine whether self-proclaimed educational apps had been designed in accordance with developmentally appropriate standards to contribute to the social, emotional, and cognitive development of children in formal and informal learning environments.</p>
 
<p>The study found that the apps in no way justified their educational claims because they did not meet the developmental needs of the target age group. Almost all the apps were based on behavioral theory and were either simple drill-and-practice, flash card-based, or game-based. They did not encourage authentic learning, but instead based their teaching on transmission models that stimulate rote learning rather than promote a deeper understanding of emerging concepts and complex processes. The authors have highlighted the need for a reliable and effective framework that monitors and evaluates mobile content so that parents and teachers can be confident in educational value when they download apps for preschoolers.</p>
