<p>The authors of this study were inspired by past research that links participation in online political groups to increased political involvement, but does not positively correlate engagement in such groups with increased political knowledge. The suggestion that online discussion promotes activism without increasing knowledge troubled the researchers, and prompted them to examine the impact of discussion groups in an academic setting. The researchers hypothesized that the disheartening results of past research on discussion forums might be due in part to the lack of a guiding teacher’s presence in the group. They developed a study to examine if and how an instructor’s guiding participation in an online discussion group could lead to enhanced learning.</p>
 
<p>This study compared the learning outcomes of two groups of 23 college students enrolled in different sections of the same computer programming course. The course was conducted half in-person and half online for both groups, but in one group, the instructor asked guiding questions in the online discussion forum, while in the other group, the discussion forum was entirely student-led. The results of a pre test showed that the two groups had comparable computer programing skills at the start of the class.</p>
 
<p>The researchers were interested in discovering how the instructor’s participation in the online discussion group would impact student performance. Specifically, they wanted to know whether instructor participation would promote critical thinking, which they defined as higher-order thinking through which the student analyzes, synthesizes, and evaluates concepts learned in order to apply them in a new context. The instructor who participated in the online group intentionally posted questions aimed at fostering this type of thinking. For example, he asked: "Why are Joe and Jill’s codes producing the same output although their codes are different?" This type of questioning was aimed at encouraging students to think more deeply about computer programming instead of relying on a trial-and-error approach. In this group, the instructor required students to give a rationale for their actions. Conversely, in the other group, students were only required to post the correct answer. </p>

<p>After completing the course, all students took a post test featuring both drill-and-practice questions that measured factual comprehension of concepts as well as questions that required critical thinking. While the group with the instructor-guided discussion forum performed slightly better on the test than the other group, the difference in overall scores was not significant. However, the instructor-led group did perform significantly better on the critical thinking questions than the student-led discussion group.</p>

<p>The researchers concluded that guided online discussion is beneficial for developing critical thinking skills. Online discussion without guidance, however, is less effective for learning. </p>
