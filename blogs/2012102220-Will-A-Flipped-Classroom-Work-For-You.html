<p>
Jonathan Bergmann is one of the pioneers of the flipped classroom movement, a new approach to teaching and learning. Flipped learning turns instruction upside down: simply put, it takes the attention away from the teacher and places it onto students. Under this approach, students attempt to study a topic by themselves at home (typically using a video assigned by their teacher) and then will apply the knowledge gained the next day in class by solving relevant problems and doing practical coursework.
<p>
Jonathan is a strong proponent of the mastery approach; that is, all of his students must achieve a minimum level of understanding by the end of each unit before being allowed to move on. The flipped classroom approach allows Jonathan to differentiate instruction among students; he can spend more time with those who are in need of extra help while students who have a good grasp of the topic can move on to the next lesson. 
<p>
"Every kid gets a different education," he said, explaining his instructional credo. "And I think thatâ€™s ok."
<p>
In this vialogue, Jonathan explains how he came to the decision to flip his classroom and what his experience (and that of his students) has been like thus far. 
<p>
<i>Would flipping your classroom work for you? Or, if you are not a teacher, would this approach have been interesting to you as a student? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2535">in the vialogue</a> to join the discussion. </i>
<p>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2535#time=68&comment_id=32840">@1:08</a> DianaLane: If students can't seem to reach mastery level on a topic, is there any point at which they can tap out and move on to the next one? What concerns me is what if it takes them so long to grasp a concept that they don't have a chance to hit all of the necessary topics by the end of the year?
<p>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2535#time=78&comment_id=32842">@1:18</a> Clark: Is there a maximum class size for flipped learning? I can imagine differentiating instruction will become mighty difficult as the class size grows. In fact, anything over 20 students would seem like a challenge.
<p>
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2535#time=106&comment_id=32845">@1:46</a> RemyV: I would definitely have loved this approach when I was in school. I could've used all the help I could get :)
