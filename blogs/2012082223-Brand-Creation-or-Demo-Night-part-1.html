            <b>Perceptions and misperceptions: Just what do we mean by "Branding"?</b>

Branding means, many things, and it's more than just the logo. As a designer, branding is the communication framework for "How to talk with our audience". 

<b>Branding is: Public Persona</b>

What 'creates' this public persona? (Or, what creates good branding?)

It's really about starting out with a very small set of rules. Colors and typefaces, images being handled a certain way, and creating consistent messaging that works across devices, platforms and physical forms. And creating a system that can be flexible enough to accommodate new needs as they arise. Branding is strongly rooted in consistency, so it's also a very good idea for us to approach it in systematic way. 

Now that we share a common understanding of the branding framework elements, I want to share our ongoing process with other EdLab teams for developing the branding of the upcoming "Demo Night" event. This is the first installment. Over the next few weeks, there will be a few connected blog entries that will follow, so that we all can share in the "Demo Night" branding story.

In thinking about an event, it's easy to be drawn right into specific items that may be needed, but you really need to start bigger picture, before getting caught up in the smaller detail. 

<b>Today's Meeting | 1st design meeting for "Demo Night"</b>
———————————————————————————————————————————————-----------
Daniel, Janice & Danielle

<b>Problem:</b>
How to "present" our new EdLab event, "Demo Night", to the public.

These decisions are not taken lightly, as good branding takes solid, methodical work.

<b>1.</b> We came up with "words" to <b>define: WHAT</b> is "Demo Night"?

Here's our list:

- networking
- technology
- education / learning
- exclusive
- social event
- ideas
- future
- dialogue / conversation
- innovation
- entrepreneur / business

As a designer, the challenge is always how to <b>connect</b> the many <b>WHAT</b> ideas into some presentable form.

<b>2.</b> We thought about <b>HOW</b> we would like to <b>present</b> "Demo Night".

Here's our list:

- elegant / fun
- clean / fun
- dark w/ accent (gray, black etc w/ pop color)
- juxtaposition
- single large image
- cool vs. warm

Personally, I always use a <b>MOOD BOARD</b> approach 
to connect the 1st and 2nd items above. 

<b>Our Mood Board challenge:</b>
How to present some kind of <b>abstract ideas</b> in various communicational forms.
How we can connect <b>abstract ideas</b> to the <b>look and feel</b>.

Results are in: We each personally created mood boards. 

<b>Can you tell what words / word combinations they are each representing?</b>

Today, we (Daniel, Janice & Danielle) started our process of sharing some abstract and visual ideas about our new event, "Demo Night". 

Next week, we'll meet again with some logos to share within our team, and then on to typography, color palette, etc. We ideally will develop some kind of consistent presentation style for our new event, "Demo Night".

A very good start toward solid branding development.

Check back for the next installment—
