A chant of "Girls on the Run is so much fun!" rises from a huddle of elementary school students following the completion of a 25 minute run. And while Girls on the Run is certainly a good time, the youth development programs offers its young female participants experiences and skills that last far beyond one fun-filled afternoon. Established by Molly Barker in 1996, Girls on the Run serves girls grades 3 through 8 and exists in schools and even homeless shelters in over 200 cities in North America including four of the five boroughs in NYC. Over the course of 24 sessions, girls meet in their small teams at their schools where they engage in dynamic Coach-led lessons as well as running training. Games and conversations promote a positive understanding of self while learning social competencies to foster stronger connections with others and harnessing their capacity to make a significant impact on their local and global communities. Training for a race requires the girls to develop mental models for setting and achieving goals both on and off the track. At the end of 12 weeks, 40 teams from around the area gather at Ichan Stadium for the culminating event: a 5K surrounded by supportive friends, families, Coaches, and Buddies. Every girl's race bib reads "#1" and regardless of time or place, everyone crosses the finish line stronger and more confident than before. Long after their days with Girls on the Run, studies prove that former participants demonstrate improved body image, higher levels of self-esteem, and a clear commitment to physical activity. The lessons learned through Girls on the Run last well beyond the culminating 5K and become an integral part of the marathon that is the rest of their lives.</p>
