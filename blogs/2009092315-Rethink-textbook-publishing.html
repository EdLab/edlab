            <i>...this is an extension of our group discussion in today's EdLab seminar as well as <a href='http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3298'>Jeannie</a> and <a href='http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3251'>Patrick's</a> blogposts.</i>

One major idea we discussed today is the innovative next-gen (text) books. As the novel ebook reader from Asus, Microsoft, Apple, and other manufacturers are coming out, ebooks will no longer be a collection of stiff texts and pictures, but will become more versatile and interactive. I interpret versatile as being capable of handling multiple media formats such as texts and images (PDF, DOC, JPG/GIF/PNG, HTML, ...), sounds, and videos. I interpret interactive as being capable of storing user inputs (e.g. notes, speech recording, picture taking, videotaping), and mediating online information exchange among users (e.g. instant message, voice/video conference, social networking websites). Such a gadget looks really like a personal computer/netbook. But it's more portable and devoted to reading.

Under this new concept, the next-gen ebook will integrate the multimedia and collaborative features of personal computers. How will this induce to the revolution in the publishing industry?

The scenario in our group discussion is to publish next-gen textbooks. Now TC professors and instructors have many channels to deliver course contents. They put syllabus and PDF readings on ClassWeb, upload videos to YouTube / VITAL, create social groups in <a href='http://www.ning.com/'>Ning</a> for classmates to share ideas, and of course deliver speeches in the face-to-face classroom session. Our idea is to provide a platform similar to a course management system where professors can integrate their course materials and class activities in a single package, which students can download to their tablet ebook reader or personal computer to "read". 

Many of the contents or activities (such as streaming videos, instant messaging, discussion forums) can be retrieved online rather than being physically included into the package since more and more online content/service providers are allowing embedding their products with HTML codes. And although everything is integrated into the same place, the instructor have the flexibility to choose what content to be physically included, what to be retrieved online, and which online service providers to be used.

I can think of many benefits to have such a platform of creating textbook/courseware. For example:

a) It specifies criteria for instructors in delivering course materials and organizing class activities.
b) Students feel easier to find and manage their course readings and notes, and participate in class activities.
c) It encourages professors to publish their comprehensive courseware as a multimedia, interactive, and collaborative e-textbook.
d) Portable and efficient for the students.
