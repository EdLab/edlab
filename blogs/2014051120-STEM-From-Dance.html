<i>"Literacy and proficiency in STEM are increasingly the currency for successful participation in modern society and the workplace." (<a href=" http://stemfromdance.wordpress.com">STEM From Dance</a> site) </i>.

<p><b>Uncovering the Roots of the STEM Problem</b><br>
Educators, entrepreneurs, and parents are getting creative in how they inspire students to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) studies. Yamilée Toussaint, a dancer and former Algebra teacher from Brooklyn, founded <a href=" http://stemfromdance.wordpress.com">STEM From Dance</a>, a unique program that combines math and science instruction with dance classes in hopes of increasing the number of under-represented minority girls from low-income communities who obtain a STEM degree. Despite discouraging statistics, the time is right for change: the rate of unemployment for African Americans in 2012 was 13.6% (compared to an overall national rate of 8.2%), but science and math occupations are projected to grow by 17% from 2008 to 2018. Yamilée and her founding board members recognize that young people are often dissuaded from pursuing such careers because they don’t feel adequately prepared in school, aren’t aware of opportunities in STEM fields, or feel it will be too challenging. They hope to reverse such perceptions, because they view these fields as representing a path to economic freedom and empowerment. </p>

<p><b>Lose Yourself to Dance</b><br>
The correlation between learning to dance and doing well in math may not be immediately obvious; however, the program’s founders value dance as a creative expression of emotions and ideas that increases confidence and self-efficacy and benefits skill development in other disciplines. Dance instruction has the potential to motivate, reinforce positive heritage, develop high-order thinking skills, and demonstrate the application of math and science concepts outside of the classroom. Volunteer coaches work with the students in intervals equally divided among the dance studio, learning lab, and STEM lab. In the studio, girls express their courage and fighting spirit through songs like Katy Perry’s <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8">ROAR</a>, in the learning lab they’re exercising algebra skills aligned with the <a href=http://www.corestandards.org/>Common Core</a>, and in the STEM lab they’re stretching their mechanical and electrical engineering and computer science skills by building robots. The reception from students has been positive in all areas, "I am here today because I love dance and I love math, so both of them together is very exciting."</p>

<b>Step Up</b><br>
STEM From Dance’s thoughtful incorporation of dance into math and science curriculum is receiving support from advocates who want STEM learning to include the arts (<a href=" http://www.steamedu.com/">STEAM</a>). This year the founders received sponsorship from the <a href=" http://www.brooklynartscouncil.org/">Brooklyn Arts Council</a> and won <a href=" http://www.teachforamerica.org/corps-member-and-alumni-resources/alumni-awards/social-innovation-award ">Teach for America’s 2013 Social Innovation Award</a>. They also represent an education trend that’s gathering momentum; with <a href=" http://www.sesamestreet.org/ ">Sesame Street</a>’s debut of <a href=" http://stemtosteam.org/case-studies/sesame-streets-s-t-e-a-m-curriculum/ ">"Elmo the Musical"</a>, which features Elmo teaching math skills in different musical situations and interactive online games, and cheerleaders like former Speaker of the House <a href=" http://pelosi.house.gov/">Nancy Pelosi</a> making an <a href=" http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2013/pelosi-attends-roundtable-at-risd/ ">economic case</a> for investing in STEAM, the arts seem poised to receive renewed attention and funding. This trend will likely help an initiative like STEM for Dance become even more of a successful pas de deux of art and science.
