<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> Attending a top flight boarding school called Georgetown Prep taught me to not only be wholly self sufficient but also how to compete in a really tough academically challenging environment.  It allowed me to develop a very strong work ethic that has carried over to the 18- hour workdays required of a technology startup C.E.O. if the business is going to be successful.  Attending Santa Clara University right here in the Silicon Valley, with a major in communications, was great as I got to learn video production inside and out and began to master the art of storytelling. The combination of these two learned talents helped me tackle the issue of effective message communication that has led directly to the establishment of my current company, engajer.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>


<b>Answer:</b> After college, I formed a production company called Millennial Productions. We were one of the early companies to bring the power of digital video to companies as a legitimate alternative communication device to the accepted printed format of the times. I quickly realized that even the state-of-the-art linear video opportunity left a great deal to be desired from a messaging point of view. It was through this company that I learned:<br>


<b>1.</b> I did not want to run a services business, that required a tremendous amount of client hand-holding.<br>
<b>2.</b> There was an inherent limitation with the execution of linear video, as its lack of interactivity never seemed that satisfying and productive to the end user.<br> 
<b>3.</b> How to treat people well.  I learned that it's far better to be generous than greedy; in the long run, the personal and financial rewards are far greater.<br> 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> engajer has the potential to change everything about learning.<br>
<b>1.</b> There are millions of children today who cannot afford a good education that can ultimately lead to a better life.  engajer allows anyone with an Internet connection and a computer access to the greatest educators both living and deceased at virtually no variable cost. engajer’s innate analytic ability to grade and enhance learning can provide teachers with a platform to focus on the individual student’s progress without slowing the class down.<br>  
<b>2.</b> Companies no longer have to send their employees to expensive long training sessions.  Now, virtual tools like engajer can teach employees "as they go" and in the context of what they are doing.  The days of the traditional corporate trainer dealing with small groups over-and-over are over. Now training executives can deal with the company as a whole.<br>
<b>3.</b> Learning will happen faster.  Video has shown to be at least 40% more effective than print when it comes to information retention.  Also, engajer interactive video is fun, productive and satisfying, while reading lots of print is tedious and boring.<br>  
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>


<b>Answer:</b> Interactive video, cloud computing, big data and analytics, faster Internet speeds, cheaper computers and tablets, access to Internet, and artificial intelligence. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We’re currently working on being able to embed engajer anywhere on the Internet, simply and productively.  
Next big project is completing the "build your own engajer" tool, which would allow anyone, anywhere to build his or her own engajer, 100% in the cloud, within minutes. This could make engajer the preeminent global training; marketing and sales communication platform that allows targeted viewers to choose their own pathway of interest for those things that matters most to them.
