            How can we evaluate the performances of our teachers?  While many might blame the public school system as a failure overall, others blame bad teaching and misbehaving students as the problem behind the failure of many schools in the public school system. In addition, grades are the most important standard in evaluating both students and teachers. This forces teachers to teach by the book and follow a curriculum that hardly allows them to incorporate their own ideologies into their teaching. On the contrary, students at private schools are not only evaluated on grades but also on their understanding of the materials. 

In a recent <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/walt_gardners_reality_check/2013/04/bill_gatess_panopticon.html">article</a>, Bill Gates plans an educational reform that will see $5 billion dollars invested in bringing video cameras that will be available in every classroom. Supporters of cameras in the classroom like the idea because it allows for no excuses from teachers who constantly blame student behavior as the primary reason behind their own shortcomings. Moreover, the cameras will underline and see the performances of both students and teachers in the classroom. The idea presented by Bill Gates is similar to that of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon of the late 18th century. Bentham believed that when those in an institutionalized environment such as schools and prisons are monitored through  video cameras throughout the day, they are forced to behave in the best manner possible because no one want others to see them acting up or misbehaving. Although this idea of cameras in the classroom might work, I feel the best way to evaluate teacher performance is through peer review or comparing a teacher with a colleague who is doing very well.
