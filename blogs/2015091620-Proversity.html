<p><a href="http://www.proversity.org/">Proversity</a> is a London-based technology service that partners with major businesses to turn their in-house employee training materials into freely accessible digital course content. Proversity courses operate simultaneously as professional development opportunities for seasoned employees of Proversity business partners; training tools for new employees; and recruiting tools for prospective employees who seek skills compatibility in one or another specialized field. Proversity touts how its LMS adapts business-created content into easily maneuverable units and modules that contain classic distance learning elements like video lectures, discussion boards, wikis, and assessments.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Proversity is free professional development. It's leader, Carl Dawson, has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ub-sxvQ6LM">vocal</a> about the service's commitment not only to improving the productivity of businesses in strengthening their employees, but also to bridging the specialized-training gap that often exists between recent graduates and the professional sites where they might hope to begin their careers. The sleekness of the Proversity LMS and its adaptability to a range of subject content is also a plus to this growing service.</p>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<p>Proversity business partners are currently confined to the UK. Their courses, while seemingly well put together, can also be very specialized and specific in content (e.g., "Earthing and Bonding on AC Electrified Lines") - which, from a potential recruitee's standpoint, may be less appealing than more generally useful courses. And given the small number of available courses (at present, 5), the idea of Proversity is perhaps at the moment much stronger than its reality. Though, in some ways, this narrowness is also the point of Proversity: letting specific businesses use specific courses to direct people and skills-training in a very specific way. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Though the service currently offers only a handful of courses, and mainly in engineering, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AHYL8ekpbk">promising work with eight UK-based businesses</a> (Network Rail, the Bank of England, and Royal Artillery among them) and serious aspirations to expand globally underpin what it communicates in its advertising: a commitment to providing access to employer-specific education in order to match today's workers with today's job market. This creative approach to a combination of training and recruiting seems like a win-win for employers and job-seekers - and you can't beat the price. It will be interesting to see if this service catches on in the business community.</p>
