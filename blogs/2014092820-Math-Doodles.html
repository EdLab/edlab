<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/math-doodles/id526959716">Math Doodles</a> is an iPad math-based puzzle game designed to illustrate the fun of mathematics. The app includes four full games—Sums Stacker, Connect Sums, Unknown Square, and Splat Go Round—and a prototype sketch called Pattern Twist. Connect Sums and Splat Go Round are fairly straightforward addition games, while Sums Stacker has an extra layer of problem-solving. Unknown Square requires more flexible thinking because players have to think about the missing numbers to solve the puzzle. The games have difficulty options from easy to hard, and several modes of play (race, solve, etc.). Math Doodles is currently only available for iOS, but a Windows/Mac downloadable software version is forthcoming.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p> 
<p>The hand-drawn artwork is whimsical and somewhat customizable: players can choose different numeric representations (e.g., dice, mahjong tiles, currency, roman numerals) to use in the game. The app also cedes more control than many learning games – players don’t have to "level up" in order to select different modes or difficulty levels. Additionally, the app doesn’t contain ads or external links, which is great for kids playing on their own.  The app also seems to be updated with additional games on a consistent basis, so there’s less of a risk for boredom to set in early.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p> 
<p>The instructions are only available as text, so younger players will need to figure out how to play without direction or have someone read them aloud to them. This is either a drawback or a feature—maybe the lack of narration is designed to involve parents. The app also doesn’t list any kind of high scores, so kids can’t try to beat their own scores (always a fun part of any game). Finally, the games are mostly based on addition – it would be nice to see other operations included.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p> 
<p>Math Doodles is not "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrK7VXCfsS0">chocolate covered broccoli</a>," and the game deliberately celebrates math and learning. If future games include other operations, it could be a fun all-around math-learning app; as is, it’s an enjoyable exploration of addition. At $2.99, the app includes four full games and one design "sketch" of a new game in progress. </p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>  
<p>Great multifaceted game for reinforcing addition concepts that doesn’t try to mask the math.</p>
