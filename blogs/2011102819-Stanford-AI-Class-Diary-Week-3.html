            <b>Week 3: 10/24-10/28</b>

<b>Updates:</b>
In the course announcement section the instructors continue to tweak their delivery based on learner feedback.  For example, this week the homework completion deadline has been delayed by a day.  I find it really helpful that the program, despite being pre-recorded can still remain receptive and adaptive to student needs. 

Also worth noting, is that if you were to go through the suggested readings (for the sake of time I am not!) from the correspondent textbook the instructors make the following refreshing caveat, "These suggested readings are taken from Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, but you are welcome to <b>review these topics from any source.</b>"  This simple disclaimer is a refreshing sign of the shifting textbook times as big publishers loose some of their business to online resources and platforms like <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">Flat World Knowledge</a>. 


<b>Pros:</b> 

-I continue to discover the benefits of this model of online learning!  I have learned more in the last three weeks about a subject about which I had no prior knowledge, than I have in many in-person courses over semesters. 

-Why?  I think this rapid learning has occurred due to the reinforcement of available explanatory support materials after each section or quiz.  Also, because information is delivered in small video-based chunks via low barrier-to-entry technology (website, YouTube videos, easy to understand interactions) the material can shine and is easy to digest and process.  

-The simple fact of being able to re-watch a section easily is highly re-enforcing.   


<b>Cons:</b> 

-Occasionally if the instructor's annunciation isn't perfect, I can see how learners for whom English isn't their first language might get confused and not have the opportunity to ask for clarification.  However, translations are available for most languages.  

-In a similar vein, I would like to be able to easily download transcripts of these lessons to review later. 

-Most of all, as I have stated previously, I wish these lessons were available and fully interactive on a smart phone! 

-I wish there were a way to "talk back" to & engage with other students - you do feel a bit isolated, which is why online learning like this may not be ready to COMPLETELY replace all in-person classes!


<b>The Week's Takeaways & thoughts:</b>
 
As I have mentioned above, I am both consistently impressed with and find valuable this format for learning and participating in a course.  I am curious to take other courses in this format and hope that eventually there will be more of a 2-way conversation possible!  Perhaps something like <a href="http://vyou.com/">VYou</a> could be added so that students can ask & answer questions in "real time?"  


<b>Screenshots:</b>

<b>The disclaimer at the bottom is a great way for instructors to add corrections to their previously recorded lessons...</b>
