            How Can We Be More Productive?

This is an age old question I find fascinating. Cal Newport's blog Study Hacks is dedicated to understanding this question.

A recent post offers the formula: Work Accomplished = Time Spent x Intensity

The formula is meant to capture the familiar concept that it doesn't matter how many hours you are sitting in a chair "studying," what matters is that you are intensely and effectively utilizing strategies to study. 

The post also highlights someone who is trying to integrate technology and social media in his effort to accomplish more: http://johnnybtruant.com/make-a-living-from-writing/ 

Cal Newport writes: "I recently interviewed a writer [Johnny Truant] who published 1.5 million words last year, all the while writing only around 3 hours a day, five days a week. His secret: he systematically increased his intensity levels during these sessions using fine-grained metrics, ascetic schedules/rules, and aggressive environment hacking. If you want to see him in action, check out his upcoming kickstarter project in which he plans to co-write a book publicly in 30 days: http://selfpublishingpodcast.com/fiction-unboxed.)"

Setting aside the quality vs. quantity concern, I am fascinated by the idea of developing the habit of being productive. It is less interesting to me that Johnny Truant wrote 1.5 million words, and more interesting to me that he effectively used his time in those 3 hours a day five days a week. I like this description of productive writing too because it allows me to do other things I find aid my in my productivity: day dreaming, long walks, time with others. 

What are your study techniques?
