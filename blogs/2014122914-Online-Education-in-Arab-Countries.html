            Online education has changed the way students have traditionally learned. Online education deliveries such as MOOCs has made education accessible to many people across the world. This is especially true for remote and impoverished regions where education remains nothing but a dream to most. Online education is also proving influential in breaking down social, economic and political barriers. Nowhere is this <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-arab-region-universities/articles/2014/11/25/online-programs-offer-new-opportunities-for-arab-students">more apparent that the Arab world.</a>

Universities in the region have been offering courses at a rapid rate. The online courses there are usually in three models: virtual (strictly online), blended (mixture of online and in-class), and supplemental (adding to in class sessions). A sizable college aged population in the region means tertiary education is not available to most. Additionally, the onset of conflict means there are also physical barriers to attending classes. 

Online education is also providing an avenue for women in what is a largely conservation region to obtain education. They can receive an education without leaving the confines of their homes. Though students are flocking to online offerings, there are some concerns it won't translate to labor market outcomes and improved economic conditions. Most employers are still wary of online education due to variety in quality and requirements. This is the problem facing many students who enroll in online classes. Though it serves a niche in reaching students who have the talent and drive, it is still a contentious debate when it comes to employment and assessment.
