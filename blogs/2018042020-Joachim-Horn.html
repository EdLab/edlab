Joachim Horn is the founder of <a href="https://www.samlabs.com/">SAM Labs</a>. A mechanical engineering graduate from Imperial College London and co-founder of the Imperial College Design Collective, Horn fused his passion for education, design, and tech to develop SAM Labs. Prior to his work with the Imperial College Design Collective and the founding of SAM Labs, he worked as a mechanical engineer at Eos Energy Storage and as a supply chain engineer with Cummins, Inc. He was also an Interaction Design researcher at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, where he spent time working with other engineers to focus on global issues. His desire to bond coding and creation led him to create SAM Labs.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at SAM Labs?</b><br>

<p>My education had a huge impact on the development of SAM Labs. It made me understand the power and influence of teachers and educators, especially those who were enabled to perform at their best. This heavily increased my focus on incorporating significant training and teacher support into the SAM Labs to empower educators with the confidence to teach coding, even if they hadn't received that training in the past.</p>

<p>Everyone who's had the privilege to go to school can look back and remember being directly inspired by a teacher; I'd say that family and teachers form the backbone of our evolution into adults. I am adamant about the need for well-resourced and accountable education; it's critical for all of us to support and enable teachers to do their best.</p>

<p>Although I studied engineering and love theory, I thought that electronic circuits were an absolute nightmare to understand in theory until I created my first Arduino circuit. It was then that I realized the true power of hands-on learning to flesh out abstract ideas. Learning can’t be all practice and it can’t be all theory. I feel people tend to support either one of the extremes in this debate, which is a shame in my opinion. SAM Labs incorporates theory but brings it to life with user-friendly hardware and software, partnered with lesson plans and materials. Its benefits lie in the balance of everything working together.</p>

<p>In addition to my education, my professional experience was also very important in helping me understand the importance of design and engineering working together. Having worked in the electronics and energy industries, I consistently saw the power of engineering but the absence of user-driven design. I also witnessed inefficiencies that could be created by over-engineering. SAM Labs was created to bond the two sides seamlessly and appeal to students with every interest.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from learners who have used the tools and technologies developed by SAM Labs?</b><br>

<p>We have seen a fantastic response from students and teachers using SAM Labs all over the world. Learning STEM is no longer about kids rushing to be in the group with the brightest students; everyone in the classroom engages. Teachers readily take on the new technology and make it their own. 

<p>After learners discover and cement their knowledge of coding, witnessing the excitement from kids interested in everything from biology to music to history to art has been really powerful. Learning coding has become as important as learning reading, writing or mathematics. It's been amazing to see students with every interest engage with SAM Labs and to see the incredible creations they come up with.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>

<p>I think that the impact of mobile devices on education will be significant. Students have access to an updated and interactive encyclopaedia in their pocket at all times and the continuous access to this information will be profound for learning. In addition, the need to learn coding is changing curricula all around the world, and this will only increase over time.</p>

<p><b>What are the future plans for SAM Labs?</b><br>

<p>We are creating the best project-based, coding-focused, creativity-stimulating education companion. We've got some exciting new SAM Labs products coming out next year and we are forever increasing our time spent with teachers to ensure that we are creating and evolving the best possible classroom solution.</p>
