<p>The college search is daunting, yet apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/schoold-college-search-admission/id990111320?mt=8">Schoold</a> make that process easier, efficient, and even enjoyable. Schoold is a new college-searching app that helps high school students skim through thousands of colleges while receiving some personalized guidance and plenty of interactive college guides.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Schoold has tried to create a personalized college search experience. Once you fill out a profile, you are able to ask questions to the app’s coaches via its messaging platform, and the coaches will message back within 48 hours. In addition, you receive personalized admissions chances based on your GPA and test scores. Users can also scan through colleges based on different qualifications, such as location, cost, campus aesthetics, and major. For many larger institutions, this information is presented as an interactive guide, incorporating text and images onto its digital pages.</p>
 
<p>Schoold has a lot of quality information for each college in the U.S., including majors, faculty to student ratio, school history, and social media sites. In addition, it lists the cost of attending, as well as its starting and mid-career salaries on a major-by-major basis. (I was pleasantly surprised to see the mid-career salary for English majors at my alma mater… have hope yet, Mom and Dad!)</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The app contains a good amount of information about general finances, grants, and loans, but it does not list any of the scholarships available at individual schools. Schoold would be improved if it listed the scholarships students could apply for and gave helpful hints for landing one. Also, there were a few pieces of information I noticed that were inaccurate. For instance, my undergrad school, Washington and Lee University, does not offer master’s degrees, yet the app lists that it does. In addition, when I searched for a small city in West Virginia where I knew a community college existed, nothing came up. While the vast amount of information on Schoold seems accurate and helpful, users might need to check some of the finer details as the app continues to grow and improve.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While Schoold could be a good place for high school students to begin their college search, some lapses in the app’s information will push them to collect additional data from other sites. The built-in personalization of the Schoold coach messaging system is a huge perk, especially for students who don’t have a close relationship with their college guidance counselor.</p>
