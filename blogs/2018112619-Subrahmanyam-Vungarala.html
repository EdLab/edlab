Subrahmanyam Vungarala is the founder of <a href="https://verzeo.in/">Verzeo</a>, an online platform that helps to bridge the gap between a student’s classroom environment and their work atmosphere through AI-based software. Prior to Verzeo, Vungarala founded Transtele, a startup that focused on rural area communication solutions.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Verzeo?</b><br>
<p>I dropped out of school [from the Manipal Institute of Technology] so I don’t have many educational experiences. However, when it comes to professional experiences, I have several that shape my work now. My first experience was with a startup, Transtele. I learned a lot through this experience. We would go to  rural areas in India to deploy wifi towers. I realized the residents did not need to know how to use a mobile device or have internet access. This made me understand the standard of learning in remote areas, so that experience helped me a lot in creating Verzeo and helping shape the way individuals learn for the better.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Verzeo will change the way students think about their future careers?</b><br>
<p>We try to customize the learning solutions through AI-based learning. Right now in India, the unemployment rate is 3.2%, so we definitely believe that using our customized learning solutions in skills development will help the employment rate.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>There are many technologies that are being implemented in the edtech space, like 3D printing, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality. There are many exciting things going on in the learning sphere for students. However, when it comes to a real trend, I believe AR and artificial intelligence (AI) provide the best experience for learning. </p> 

<p><b>What, if any, are future plans for Verzeo?</b><br>  
<p>We are working to implement real-time interactions with self-paced videos using AR, as most of the self-paced courses are not able to provide immediate support for the student questions and queries. We are working on a model which will interact with recorded videos using AR and AI and provide real-time experience and interactions with the tutor.</p>
