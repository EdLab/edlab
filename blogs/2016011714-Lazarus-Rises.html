<p>Not many artists produce work in their late 60s. Fewer still release a feature length album only days before they pass away.<br /></p>

<p>David Bowie died earlier this week. A perpetually elusive and restless artist, he was known by many names. The Thin White Duke, Ziggy Stardust, and Aladdin Sane were among his best known personae. Bowie’s ability to shape shift kept his work vital, allowing it to stay at the forefront of a constantly changing musical soundscape while many of his contemporaries latter contributions fell on unwelcome ears. It is difficult to climb to the peak of the music business, and even more complicated to stay there. The feat of remaining on top for close to forty years reaches a level of complexity that is difficult to fathom and speaks to his genius at reinvention. </p>

<p>Most will remember David Bowie for his music. Deservedly so, it’s difficult to argue against it. Changes, China Girl, Heroes, Jean Genie, Let’s Dance, The Man Who Sold the World, Young Americans, and Ziggy Stardust is a list that is as limited as it is imperfect, a sampling that is too small given the enormity of his catalog of excellent songs. Any attempt at a comprehensive accounting of Bowie’s work is futile, a testimony to a vibrant career that was long but also, somewhat paradoxically, too short. </p>

<p>But it is arguably David Bowie’s endless curiosity, dignity, and humanity that will perhaps be most deeply remembered by those who are his dearest fans and most devoted chroniclers of his cosmopolitan life. Many others also unwittingly benefitted from his efforts. </p>

<p>For example, Bowie was an internet pioneer. In an <a href="https://youtu.be/FiK7s_0tGsg">interview with the BBC’s iconic Jeremy Paxman</a>, Bowie articulated a rudimentary outline of social media and its impact on the artistic process. Specifically, the communicative nature of the internet allow artists to engage in direct relationship with their fans that were impossible beforehand. By engaging in this type of interaction, the inherent nature of the artistic act is left in doubt and becomes provisional—it needs the feedback of the community to be fully realized. Choose-your-own-adventure digital storytelling, crowd sourced artwork, and Tweeting during live television programming that is later incorporated into future episodes are just a few justifications for Bowie’s prescient vision of the internet’s impact on the arts. Further, the distributed nature of Wikipedia’s editorial process, curated Twitter feeds where users choose who to follow, and even the simple act of posting content to Facebook’s newsfeed are examples of less artistic, but more wildly popular, examples of Bowie vision of interactivity. The internet is an infinitely negotiable online community where people act in any way imaginable. And when did Bowie speak to Paxman about the staggering potential powers of the internet and face this television host’s palpable skepticism of the internet? In 2000. Think about it—social media wasn’t a concept, Mark Zuckerberg was still a pre-Harvard teen, and much of the U.S. was served by 56K modems. America Online anyone?  </p>

<p>David Bowie was also a pioneer in the public exploration of sexuality. Popular music, much like the listening public it aimed to entertain, was once an even more heteronormative space than it currently is. Hard to believe. For example, Elvis’s projection of overt sexuality was mostly forbidden in a previous era—his gyrating hips hidden from a more prudent America watching him for the first time on television. Musical sexuality of Bowie’s earlier days traded in more traditional forms of sexuality like the romantic love songs of Frank Sinatra, pure pop ballads of The Beatles, and the muscular power rock of Led Zeppelin, a few examples from an endless list. However, David Bowie was somewhere in between these more traditional forms. For uncertain youth looking for a role model that veered away from the majority, Bowie provided a middle ground that gave them permission to explore the complexities of sexuality in less binary terms. In short, Bowie’s presence gave them freedom and hope. </p>

<p>Bowie even advocated on behalf of racial equality. In an <a href="https://youtu.be/XZGiVzIr8Qg">interview on MTV</a>, Bowie pushed back against the nascent network powerhouse for its exclusive focus on white artists to the exclusion of tremendous black musicians who were largely ignored by television at the time. MTV was a combination trendsetter/star maker and his forthright comments could have put a dent in his career when video killed the radio star. But Bowie, was ahead of the curve as usual, advocating on behalf of essential causes that surpassed the importance of furthering his career.   </p>

<p>Finally, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-JqH1M4Ya8">Lazarus, one of Bowie’s final music videos</a>, to be a little unsettling. He reportedly battled cancer for 18 months prior to his demise. Given the pathology of the disease, he probably had some approximation of how much time he had left, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/david-bowie-planned-post-blackstar-album-thought-he-had-few-more-months-20160113">as imperfect as it may have turned out to be</a>. Given its release date and subject matter, the images of a gaunt Bowie rising from a hospital bed was just a little too raw for me to fully process. I watched the video shortly after news of his passing was released. Given this time frame, I was literally watching a person come back from the grave in media form. Once again, in his finest moments, including creating the artistic work he loved to make, David Bowie will continue to rise.</p>
