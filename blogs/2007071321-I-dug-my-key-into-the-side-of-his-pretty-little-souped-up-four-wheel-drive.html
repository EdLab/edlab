            There are dozens of urban legends and horror stories of the vengeful ex-girlfriend. Yeah, the one who slashed your car tires, or burned all of your stuff in your front yard and left the ashes on your doorstep. The one that called you outside your house and beat the living sass outta you in front of your friends and neighbors (she had to be hauled off of you by the police, remember?). The one that makes you break out into a cold sweat and check out your physical vicinity for escape routes— <i>just in case</i> <b>she's</b> there.  

As society evolves and upgrades itself (American Dream, Version 7.356!), so has the ex-girlfriend. Gone are the days when a girl would just sneak up to her ex-boyfriend's house at night and key his car and slash the living daylights out of his tires. Oh no, no, my friends. These days, they'll break in your <a href=http://cache.jalopnik.com/cars/images/bmw_revenge.jpg>windshield</a> and dump paint all over your car interior, as did this smart chick to a BMW M3: <a href=http://cache.jalopnik.com/cars/images/bmw_revenge_2.jpg>*moment of silence*</a> Ouch.  

When I was younger and had no idea what I was talking about, I thought that slashing tires would be a rather simple (and ineffective) feat, like popping balloons with a pin. Needless to say, I was greatly mistaken. Tires are a lot thicker than I imagined, and I can't really tell you how much strength would be needed to properly use a sharp object to puncture, yet alone <i>slash</i> them. So, if damaging tires can be difficult and cumbersome, why would some girls go to even further measures to ensure that their former beaus' cars are severely damaged? (Especially when these days, everyone is trigger-happy and just itching to slap each other with lawsuits?) 

For all you fellows who thumb your noses at these “psycho women”, would you prefer that she do that to your <i>car</i>, or to <b>you</b>? ‘Cause something tells me that she would be more than happy to demonstrate just exactly what she's capable of. Well? She may have damaged your private property, but it's better than your privates.  

I get it. Private property should be respected, and one shouldn't go around messing around with other people's belongings. But, can you honestly say that you deserve her respect after what you did? If you had been cheated on, can you honestly say that you took it with a smile on your face, and didn't want to kick a few puppies here and there? Cause from what I've been seeing fellas, you guys don't handle being the cuckolded person very well, either.  

Not to poke too much fun, but shouldn't breaking and destroying something be considered “manly”?? Like, “<i>argh, let's release all this pent up testosterone in me by being a boorish lout!!!</i>”  

No? Okay, that might explain why guys react the way they do when they're the ones that have been wronged.  

Silent crying in the shower, sullen passive-aggressiveness, random rants and bursts of angry tirades about “that bitch”, drunken voicemails at 3 in the morning alternatively cursing at her, then begging to get back together. The really weird and awkward phone call where he's sobbing and wails something to the effect of “<b>whyjidyadooeet???</b>” and sometimes in a few extreme cases, showing up at your doorway in the middle of the night and refusing to leave until you threaten to call the cops on him. And of course, the oldest tricks in the book: where he scoffs at you and snorts “I'm free!” and swaggers away in faux-machismo like he's got a poker up his arse. Mmhmmm... Real manly.  

Now don't get your boxers all in a twist — I'm only joking. Yes, I do realize that not all men react this way, and it's quite sexist of me to assign certain characteristics to a gender.  

And yes, I'm fully aware that real men cry. 

But you know what? If I can just vent myself in one act, however destructive and scary, I'd rather do that — at least I'd have had my say in one clean cut. Yeah, I think that blowing up a boyfriend's car is more dignified than calling him everyday crying to be taken back like some fledging sparrow that got pushed out of its nest.  

On second thought, screw that.  

I'd rather just jack his rims, make off with them, and sell them on <a href=www.ebay.com>Ebay</a>.
