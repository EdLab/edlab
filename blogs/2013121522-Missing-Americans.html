          <p>
            As I was reading this <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/13/new-york-times-cia-robert-levinson_n_4439330.html">article</a>, I was very shocked by how long a FBI agent has been missing. It was also interesting to see that he wasn't even missing to everyone because of the cover story they had planned. 

<blockquote>Levinson, a retired FBI agent, disappeared off the coast of Iran in March 2007. The U.S. government had maintained since then that Levinson was working as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling at the time of his disappearance.

But as the AP revealed Thursday, that "was just a cover story." In a deeply reported piece that could be turned into a plot on "Homeland," the AP described how Levinson was secretly paid to do intelligence gathering for the agency, an "extraordinary breach of the most basic CIA rules." Behind closed doors, several officials working with Levinson resigned or were reprimanded over the rogue mission.</blockquote> 

I assume that this can be expected when you apply for such a job. Would you rather have the truth or let government decide that and possibly hide the fact that you're missing?
