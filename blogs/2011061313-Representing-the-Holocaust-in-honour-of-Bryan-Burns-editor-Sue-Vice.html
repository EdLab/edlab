            <strong>Title</strong>: Representing the Holocaust : in honour of Bryan Burns
<strong>Editor</strong>: Sue Vice
<strong> Publisher</strong>: London, Portland, OR : <a href="http://www.vmbooks.com/">Vallentine Mitchell</a>, 2003
<strong> Check it out</strong>: <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/c?SEARCH=D804.3+.R474+2003&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">D804.3 .R474 2003</a>

<strong><a href="http://www.vmbooksusa.com/cgi-bin/sh000003.pl?REFPAGE=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2evmbooksusa%2ecom%2facatalog%2findex%2ehtml&amp;WD=holocaust%20representing&amp;PN=Search_More_Holocaust_Studies_Titles_7%2ehtml%23aVM0256#aVM0256">From the Publisher</a></strong>: This collection of essays by leading and new British scholars focuses on central issues in Holocaust studies. The topics discussed here include the history and work of the Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies in London; controversies over Holocaust Museums, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and 'the Holocaust industry'; a biography of the Scottish-Jewish playwright C.P. Taylor, whose best-known play, Good, is about Nazism; the representation of the Holocaust in diary, testimony, film and poetry; Primo Levi's work; and the scandal of Binjamin Wilkomirski's inauthentic testimony Fragments.

<strong><a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/english/staff/vice">About the editor</a></strong>: Sue Vice finished her DPhil on Malcolm Lowry´s <em>Under the Volcano</em> in 1988, and worked at the publishers Basil Blackwell during that time and for a year before coming to Sheffield in 1989.

More recently she has developed her enthusiasm for cinema-going into teaching film courses, and in 1993 completed an MA in Film Studies at the other university in Sheffield.

For several years she has taught a course on the films of Alfred Hitchcock, director of her "desert island" film <em>Marnie</em>. She has been interested in representations of the Holocaust for many years, and has developed this into teaching at undergraduate and graduate level, as well as several books on Holocaust literature and film.

Sue has been working on the drama scripts of the television playwright Jack Rosenthal, whose papers are held in Special Collections at the University Library, and her monograph on his work was published in 2009. Sue's next project will focus on false memory and deception in literary texts, including false memoirs (such as Binjamin Wilkomirski´s <em>Fragments</em> and James Frey´s <em>A Million Little Pieces</em>) as well as fictional works representing fakery (Peter Carey´s <em>My Life as a Fake</em> and Nella Larsen´s <em>Passing</em>).

Sue Vice is currently the Head of the School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics.
<h2>(From Sue's homepage) Research</h2>
I am influenced by the work of Mikhail Bakhtin and my research background is in the work of Malcolm Lowry. This interest has continued in my recent work and teaching, including the publication <em>Malcolm Lowry Eighty Years On</em> (1989).

My publications in the field of literary theory include <em>Psychoanalytic Criticism: A Reader</em> (1996) and <em>Introducing Bakhtin</em> (1997).

Being interested in representations of the Holocaust for many years, I have published a book on novels about the Holocaust, <em>Holocaust Fiction</em> (2000), and one on children´s perspectives, <em>Children Writing the Holocaust</em> (2004).
