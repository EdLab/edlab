<p>In today’s climate of prioritizing data-driven practices in education, it is usually teachers and administrators poring over student performance data; rarely is the focus ever on <i>students</i> using data to improve their learning. But recently, researchers conducted a study on two sixth grade science classes in the Midwest, hoping to answer the question of whether middle school students can think metacognitively about their learning and use data about their performance to seek appropriate supports in their learning.</p>
 
<p>The class setting was a blended learning environment, using an online chemistry unit that integrated science and literacy in a way that prompted students to collect and analyze data, as well as read and comprehend texts. Optional supports were available in various forms, including <i>hint</i> and <i>model answer</i> buttons, both of which were labeled as <i>resources</i> rather than <i>help</i> so that students would not see help support as a stigmatized negative choice. Students were also able to provide feedback for each question they responded to with a five-point scale based on the question’s difficulty level.</p>
 
<p>The researchers then collected data based on the students’ performance using their responses to the questions, their feedback on the questions’ difficulty level, and their usage of the available resources. When students were shown their data, they were asked: "Based on your own report, what advice would you give yourself the next time you use [this]?" Many students responded that they realized that they had not used some of the available supports during the lesson. Others reported that their successful performance meant that they should continue their support-seeking behavior, or that their below-par performance required more support-seeking choices.</p>

<p>Although some might fear that providing middle school students with a deluge of data might be overwhelming to the point of being unproductive, the researchers who conducted this study have shown that students can think metacognitively about their performance data and become more aware of where and how they can improve by seeking out the appropriate supports. Perhaps the data-driven movement in education, in all its fervor and momentum, can pivot to include students, too.</p>
