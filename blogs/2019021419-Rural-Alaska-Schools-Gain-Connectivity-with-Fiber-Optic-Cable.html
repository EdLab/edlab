<p>As of 2015, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/alaska-schools-internet/420648/">over 90% of Alaska’s K-12 schools</a> had internet speeds lower than the benchmark set by the Federal Communications Commission for in-school wifi. Connectivity was even lower in poor districts. In fact, the average speed of school connectivity across the state was 246 kbps (kilobits per second), which is one third of the connection it takes to stream a show on Netflix. With so many rural districts, some only reachable by plane or boat, it has been an enormous challenge to bring reliable internet access to all of Alaska’s schools.</p>

<p>In 2012, Anchorage-based company <a href="https://statescoop.com/in-rural-alaska-new-internet-service-is-set-to-transform-daily-life/">Quintillion pledged to increase connectivity</a> by building a network of underwater fiber-optic cables that could reach some of Alaska’s most remote districts, such as Nome, perched on the Bering Sea. In 2017, the cable was finally complete. Teachers hope that this increased connectivity can bring distance education and testing to their districts. In rural areas, schools could greatly benefit from online education, which would allow for many more learning opportunities than students might otherwise receive, such as computer science and coding.</p>

<p>What educational opportunities arise in classroom settings when students and teachers have better access to the internet? Do you think distance learning could be useful in this setting? Answer these questions and join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47748">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:12 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> In addition to distance learning, the internet allows both teachers and students to draw from the vast quantity of resources available online. One of the biggest benefits I see is using the internet to teach students how to research well and learn from thinkers in other parts of the world.</p>

<p><b>@01:15 Melanie Hering:</b> Alaska is one of those places where distance learning isn't a choice for many—if you live in remote areas without access to in-person teachers, you rely on elearning. If the internet doesn't work as well, you're cut off from formal education completely. I'm glad researchers are looking into solutions!</p>
