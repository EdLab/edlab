<p>Technological advances such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and programming software have propelled a new maker movement. Many young people enjoy making robots, electronic gadgets, video games, and apps with these new tools. While all these exciting developments might make people associate maker projects with investments in new technologies, the unbounded imagination of kids remains the core of any great maker project. In fact, it took only one kid's innovative idea to turn everyday recycled materials into a fun and influential maker project, and Caine demonstrates this to the world with the arcade he built in east L.A.</p>

<p>A then nine-year-old boy spending most of his summer at his dad's used auto parts store, Caine built an arcade out of cardboard and everyday objects. His creativity made the arcade a miniature of a real world arcade with fun passes, a variety of interesting game machines (e.g., basketball shootout, a soccer game, a claw machine) along with manually delivered score tickets from inside the game machines and prizes. His project went unnoticed until a film maker stopped into the auto shop and, amazed by Caineâ€™s arcade, made a short documentary film about it that went viral. This helped to turn a small maker project into a global movement of cardboard challenges that invites kids around the world to release their imagination and become cardboard arcade game makers.</p>

<p>This video documents the story of Caine's Arcade and how it went from a local maker project to a global phenomenon. Join other educators in a discussion of creativity, imagination, and this unique instance of the growing maker movement <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/14233">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<b>@02:20 Wang:</b> It is truly fantastic to see kids from all over the world use cardboards creatively and build their arcade game machines! <p>

<b>@06:08 welmar:</b> This is amazing. You never know what you can accomplish when you try. A cardboard box is all you need. <p>
