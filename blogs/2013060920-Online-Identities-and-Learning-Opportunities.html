<b> Title: </b>  ‘You have one identity’: performing the self on Facebook and LinkedIn (2013) <p>
<b>Author: </b> José van Dijck <p>
<b>Source: </b> <a href=" http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/35/2/199.abstract ">Media, Culture & Society</a> <p>

<b> Study Design: </b>Although most online social interaction takes place on non-educational platforms, for non-educational purposes, a great deal of information, relevant to the burgeoning online education world, can be gleaned from this wider world of online behavior.  In particular, the authors of this article note, we can learn a great deal about how an educational platform’s features inform personal presentation and connectivity from programs like Facebook and LinkedIn. <p>
This study focuses on the tension in social behavior between "self-expression" and "self-promotion."  The tension between Facebook, as a personal venue for self-expression, and Linkedin, as a more focused tool for self-promotion and networking, allows the authors to illustrate this distinction. In addition, the struggle, throughout the history of these programs, between users and platform owners over issues like privacy highlights the open, contested nature of online self-presentation.<p>
<b>Findings: </b> Recent interface changes on Facebook and LinkedIn offer a good opportunity to focus on how discrete features structure online behavior and engagement.  Facebook’s Timeline feature, introduced in 2011, by displaying a user’s history of activity as a life-story, has been a fairly successful attempt at "integrating self-expression and self-promotion, connectedness and connectivity …" <p> 
LinkedIn, although geared towards a sparser, more efficient method of self-presentation, offers a variety of tools to encourage connectivity, including user recommendations and Q&A’s, all of which, as with Timeline, steer users into a more uniform, public self-presentation.  <p>
For internal reasons, traditional social networking sites work hard to commit users to uniform online identities, which pushes against the user’s desire to achieve multiple social goals with multiple identities. Personal social networking often involves presenting a very different self from the one users want to display to potential employers and business contacts. <p>
<b>Moving Forward: </b> The paper itself offers little in the way of recommendations for the future. However, the concepts and issues it raises are relevant to many aspects of the online education world.  Most importantly, a focus on the multiple goals a student brings to the table should lead creators and managers of online education platforms to offer more options for students to display multiple identities in different contexts.  In this way, the platform can maximize engagement for each goal.  
<p>
Generally speaking, a platform that facilitates users’ pursuit of social goals, rather than working too hard to enforce an overall vision, stands a better chance of drawing in students and providing a robust educational experience.
