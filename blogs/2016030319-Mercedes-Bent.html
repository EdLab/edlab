<p>Mercedes Bent is the General Manager of University Programs and Partnerships at General Assembly (GA), a leading venture-backed education company that helps individuals pursue the work they love by teaching practical skills. In this position, she is responsible for building GA's revenue-generating line of business from scratch and forging GA's relationships with traditional higher education institutions.</p>

<p>Bent previously held positions at GA as the Head of New Ventures and Global Director of Immersive Programs, where she built the company's flagship product line to $20M in two years. Mercedes also launched General Assembly's first program to improve diversity in tech, the Opportunity Fund, in early 2014.</p> 

<p>Prior to GA, Bent worked at Goldman Sachs and earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard University, where she studied Economics and East Asian Studies. She grew up in the Bay Area and enjoys testing new business ideas, writing on her <a href="http://bit.ly/1Qx3vLu">blog</a>, traveling, watching soccer, and playing cards.</p> 

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>In college I was an economics major and earned a minor in East Asian studies, although I actually started college intending to be a computer science major. Given my switch to economics, my internships in college were in asset management and at the Federal Reserve. After college I went into finance and worked at Goldman Sachs for two years. Although I thoroughly enjoyed my time in finance, it wasn't my passion. I wanted to change the world. My background and innate preference for entrepreneurship and tech, coupled with my frustrations about the way I was taught computer science in college, led me to seek new opportunities. I found General Assembly, and instantly knew the educational format and focus on teaching practical skills was something I wanted to be part of.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>College is really expensive. Data shows that 40% of college graduates are not able to land jobs in their preferred field after graduation. The amount of student debt is skyrocketing and undergraduates, with increasingly grim job prospects, struggle to pay back these loans. The goal of my work at General Assembly is to help students receive a faster return on their educational investment. By partnering with universities to produce the best of both worlds by combining theoretical and research-based education with practical skills, we aim to equip students so they can hit the ground running after school. There are many colleges that already teach practical skills in an engaging manner, however, there is still a ways to go in preparing students up to the level employers need. I would love to see a future where more universities partner with nontraditional providers to supplement their curriculum, decrease cost, and improve student return on investment (ROI).</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Some of the biggest trends that will affect higher education in the coming years include competency based education and micro-credentialing. Employers will begin to pay more attention to the badges and credentials students have, and while a degree will still be meaningful, micro-credentials and badging will help decrease the opacity of a college education. Another large trend, though not necessarily new, is globalized education—the world is becoming more global. You have places like Minerva, where students spend years of their college education living abroad. At General Assembly, we’ve created travel programs specifically for undergraduates that emphasize not only cultural immersion but industry immersion and practical skills.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>We’re working on a lot of exciting projects, ranging from industry-immersion travel programs to weekend workshop series that run at universities. A long-term project I am really excited about is creating more bridge pathway programs that can help a student go from high school GED to community college to four-year degrees to a six-figure web development job within several years. While many GA programs are not inexpensive today, we are constantly thinking about how to expand access and help a wider audience.</p>
