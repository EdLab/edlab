Jay Kloppenberg grew up among education thought leaders in Boston. One of his parents was a tenured history professor at Harvard, and the other was a longstanding director of an esteemed early child development (ECD) center. Jay is a self-proclaimed black sheep for choosing business as a first career; the founding of <a href="http://bit.ly/1V9CGLb">African School for Excellence (ASE)</a> marks Kloppenberg’s eventual entry into the family business. While working in South Africa in 2010, he was moved by the tremendous accomplishments of many low-income South Africans and he came to understand the vast unrealized potential of township youth. He took advantage of his MBA classmates to help him devise a solution to provide replicable, elite-quality high school education to low-income scholars. They helped him run African School for Excellence’s (ASE) first pilot program in Accra, Ghana in August 2011. The pilot’s success spurred Kloppenberg to found a brick and mortar school in Tsakane, on the East Rand of Johannesburg, with co-founder Nonhlanhla Masina in January 2013. Prior to ASE, Kloppenberg worked at AfriCap Microfinance Investment Co. and McKinsey & Co. in Johannesburg, South Africa. He holds a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude from Amherst College and an MBA from INSEAD. His interests include basketball, traveling, and helping ASE scholars confound all expectations.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>It sometimes feels as if everything I've ever done in my life has led me to this project. Everyone in my family works in education: my first job was as an assistant teacher at my mother's ECD center, my father is a history professor, and my sister is a dance professor. Most of my friends are in education too. I was lucky enough to attend some of the best schools in the country in high school (Roxbury Latin in Boston) and in college (Amherst College). Throughout college, I planned to graduate and become a teacher.</p>

<p>Instead, I joined McKinsey and began to learn about structured problem-solving within a business context. With McKinsey, I was able to move to Johannesburg, and when I left the firm, I stayed in Jozi to work for a private equity fund investing in microfinance banks throughout Africa.</p>

<p>While there, I became frustrated at the lack of impact of the work we were doing on people's lives. It is now well established that microfinance does not generally take people out of poverty, but back then a lot of people still drank the Kool-Aid. I was frustrated that we were working so hard—and, on my weekends, I was working hard with specific microentrepreneurs in the Soweto township—and could not seem to get them to reach their potential.</p>

<p>I became convinced that there was incredible untapped potential in low-income communities throughout Africa, but that the way to access them was not through adult interventions, but through education. Imagine if the type of education I was lucky enough to receive was the norm instead of the exception? You would have an entire generation of leaders ready to transform the continent. I wondered whether that would be possible.</p>

<p>At that point, I met Nonhlanhla Masina, who would become my co-founder at ASE. She has that one-in-a-million Horatio Alger story: parents with a combined two years of education, attended failing schools, overcame tragedy after tragedy, and somehow worked her way to a Master's' degree in pharmaceutical research from one of the top universities in Africa. We decided to figure out if this dream was possible—could we create a school network so good that its graduates could compete with the best in the world, so inexpensive that the lowest-income Africans could afford it, and so scalable that we could put it in communities throughout the continent?</p>

<p>That's what we set out to do, and that's what has led to ASE.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>In most of the world, nearly every child attends school. Only a few, privileged children, however, receive an education that is worth getting. The others live a lie: told that their education will prepare them for the future, they discover sometime in their teen years that it has not taught them to communicate effectively in speech or in writing, it has not taught them to problem-solve, to reason, or to tackle complex challenges on their own and with their peers.</p>

<p>We accept this state of affairs because to provide a great education for poor children would be too expensive, and to do so at scale would be impossible. Besides, we tell ourselves, poor children only have so much ability. If we can teach them to read and write a little, we should pat ourselves on the back.</p>

<p>I want our work to change all of that. I want to live in a world where receiving a great education is normal, even in the poorest countries. A world where the lottery of birth does not determine one's ability to reach one's potential.</p>

<p>I can draw an analogy to <a href="http://www.kipp.org/">Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP)</a> in the U.S. While I don't agree with all of their methods, I do respect their boldness in rejecting conventional wisdom. When KIPP started, conventional wisdom said that while we could try to make inner-city schools functional, expecting graduates to routinely attend university was unrealistic: the challenges were too great; the limited resources, the "culture of poverty," and the innate limitations of poor black kids made that type of success a pipe dream. You can say what you want about KIPP, but you can no longer say that poor black kids aren't capable of regularly succeeding in university. The evidence has made that argument untenable.</p>

<p>Today, most people make literally the exact same sub-conscious argument when it comes to disadvantaged kids in the developing world. And they are just as wrong. We hope to provide the evidence to make these—often unconscious—beliefs untenable.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>My hope is that the "school" as we know it will transform into something far more effective: more nimble, more adaptable, less expensive, with higher-quality learning happening every day. Technology can support this change, but it will not drive it. As long as most educators believe that teachers and textbooks—or whatever vessel—are the main conduits of knowledge, and that facts and procedures constitute the sum-total of education, we will continue to fail most of our students.</p>

<p>The learning science is clear: facts, techniques and procedures are most effectively taught through direct instruction and dedicated practice. Concepts and ideas—the things that really matter—cannot be taught similarly. Teachers bang their heads against the wall teaching procedures (e.g., adding fractions) to students who do not understand concepts (e.g., proportional and multiplicative reasoning), and are beside themselves when the students can't apply this procedure to a new setting.</p>

<p>None of this is new. John Dewey said in <i>Democracy and Education</i>, "We never educate directly, but indirectly by means of the environment." And that was 100 years ago! We should have learned by now—and, to be fair, good teachers have. But our education system still rewards and punishes teachers based on procedural learning, so all but the most hard-headed teachers spend their time drilling students in these procedures—and thereby retarding their cognitive and character development, as well as boring them out of their minds.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>

<p>I am working on the next phase of ASE. We have had great success re-imagining the learning model: using fewer teachers, emphasizing peer-learning and problem-solving, and training high-school graduates into the next generation of teachers through problem-solving alongside middle-schoolers.</p>

<p>Still, our basic concept of the "school" has not changed. Our scholars in our flagship school in the Tsakane township of Johannesburg are still in a school with 400+ students, in a large building, with teachers for each subject, a principal, an administrative school manager, etc. We're questioning all of these things now.</p>

<p>Instead, we're experimenting with an "educational web" that we feel will provide even higher-quality learning at a lower cost, with less friction in the system. We'll see how it goes, but I hope this will take us to the next level.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I don't use Twitter very often, so I can't really say who is active on there. My favorite educators to read are generally math teachers like <a href="http://bit.ly/1Qc7aaX">Steven Stogrotz</a>, Paul Lockhart, <a href="http://bit.ly/241o4Ug">Dan Meyer</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1PRUc6w">Jo Boaler</a>.</p>
