<p><a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a> is a teacherâ€™s best friend. Previously a clicker system called <i>Top Hat Monocle</i>, Top Hat has been spruced up to make it easy for students and teachers to access their classes on tablets, Android, and iPhones, as well as via laptops and desktops. Top Hat combines everything a teacher needs to run a class in this digital platform. Teachers can keep track of attendance, student grades, assignments, and post attachments, text docs, and various content to help students study. In order to preserve precious class time for students to practice applying what they have learned, teachers can record and assign lectures to Top Hat and create notifications for students so they know what they are required to complete and when it is due. Top Hat allows for seamless interaction between students and teachers as well as among classmates.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Top Hat is packed with cool features. Teachers can create different types of questions, including multiple choice, short answer, and matching. The instructor also has the ability to allow multiple correct responses and to assign partial credit. If outside of a WiFi network, students can text in answers, freeing them from the constraints of internet access so that they can work on their assignments whenever and wherever they want. Attendance is also taken by text, since students text in unique codes to confirm their presence. Top Hat provides teachers with the option to save their lessons by creating Course Packs, so that they may share their lessons with other instructors or import questions to other classes. Finally, instructors can view charts that track student progress, with the option to explore overall class grades, student trends in responding to particular questions, and more!</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Top Hat is free in most cases, K-12 classes that have 30 or more students are required to pay a fee. Although free for professors, college students must pay $24 for a single term, $36 for one year, or $72 for lifetime access. Student fees might deter professors from using Top Hat to save their classes from having to pay out of pocket.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Top Hat is a good teaching companion. Instructors can use it to keep track of all of their classes, so that everything is kept in a single, easily accessible location. It is also a great tool for encouraging educators and students to become comfortable with digital platforms, and to work collaboratively to explore just about any subject. The variety teachers can add, including student competitions and visual media, has the potential to deeply engage students and maintain their attention, pushing them to learn more deeply. Top Hat is a hot tip for face-to-face and online educators.</p>
