<p>No one wants to be caught in the Uncanny Valley. Or at least that’s what designers try to avoid. In animatronics and robotics, the Uncanny Valley theory suggests that people like bots to have human characteristics <i>up to a certain point</i>, beyond which it becomes creepy. For instance, while we think Wall-E’s human mannerisms are charming, we find talking dolls creepy because they're just a little <i>too real</i>.</p>
 
<p>While this theory generally applies to animatronics and robotics, new research hypothesizes that it can also be used in simulations, such as those used for training scenarios. Researchers proposed that there are two factors in simulations that could contribute to the Uncanny Valley effect: environment and control. Environment refers to the simulation’s setting, and control refers to the number of options a user has in moving their avatar.</p>
 
<p>Participants of the study were placed in a virtual environment where they watched a TED talk. To test the Uncanny Valley effect, there were four variables to the experience: the virtual environment was either high realism or low realism, and the amount of control was either high or low. Overall, there were four different scenarios: high-realism environment with high control, high-realism environment with low control, low-realism with high control, and low-realism with low control.</p>
 
<p>According to the Uncanny Valley theory, participants would feel comfortable with either a high-realism environment and high control or low-realism environment and low control, but not with a mixed pair of high and low, and the results of the study confirmed this. Participants who experienced low-realism/low control or high-realism/high control retained information significantly better than those who were in a mixed low-realism/high control or high-realism/low control scenario.</p>
 
<p>This study finds that even in digital simulations, the Uncanny Valley effect could be at play, and more than that, it could hinder learning outcomes. As more fields are using digital simulations for training, such as the healthcare and business professions, this finding could be significant for designers of such courses. When environment and control don’t match up, things are just slightly too uncanny to feel comfortable while learning.</p>
