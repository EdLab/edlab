<p><a href="http://careerosity.com/">Careerosity</a> began in an effort to bring college career services online, though the tool has recently pivoted towards greater inclusivity and now includes information for mid-career changes and new professionals. The site connects users to their alumni network and gives them personalized resources outside of their network to help them embark on a first or new career. Most of these resources are in the form of transition stories from professionals, but the site is expanding to include in-person events, online discussion, and other resources.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The site is quite new, but has managed to attract a diverse network. Most current activity focuses on technology and education. The Q&A portion of the site is growing quickly and operates like a career <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> to let users ask and answer questions while building clout through upvotes and networking. The story portion of the site contains mini-interviews, each with a professional who has experienced career transition(s). The interviews follow a set template and explore career fit, preparing for a new field, and advice for users on a similar path. Apart from their work as a career change resource, these stories are an interesting digital artifact describing the changing nature of work in the 21st century. The site is free and already quite active.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It may be too soon to tell, but the site mission may benefit from a bit more field specificity. Low-change fields like homemaking or agriculture have a place in the tags and categories, but the resources on the site seem better suited to dynamic, high-turnover professions like tech and media. Current use of the site seems to reflect this pattern. The networking opportunities on the site could turn it into a powerful rally point for professionals looking to start businesses or break into the startup scene.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Career transitions are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millenials-should-be-job-hopping-2013-5">becoming more common</a>, especially among young people. Networks and mentor relationships are more essential as educational expectations change and new jobs are created. Careerosity, as a networking space and research center, will be able to move at the speed of 21st century jobs and serve as a place to develop soft skills, define role expectations, and inspire professional evolution.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Careerosity facilitates career change for the digital transition.</p>
