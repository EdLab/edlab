          <p>
            The 9th Columbia University Libraries Symposium took place on Friday, March 16th, 2012 in Uris Hall on the Columbia campus, and was titled "New Models of Academic Collaboration."  For some reason, "Reference Services" was dropped from the meeting name this year, even though it's been titled the Columbia Reference Services Symposium since its inception in 2001.  As a reference <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2012/03/1295389525990.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-15752" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/03/1295389525990-300x79.gif" alt="" width="300" height="79" /></a>librarian of long standing, I could take exception to this omission, but have decided not to, since what would be the point?  It may well be that, though reference service was pretty much pioneered at Columbia, the concept (or at the least the terminology) has become outmoded (though I seriously doubt that this is actually the case).  The reality is that a number of the participants are not in fact reference librarians, though all are involved in service provision.  The point, I think, is the increasing degree of shared vision and mission among librarians, scholars, and students, as well as cooperative efforts between academic institutions; and though reference people are significantly involved in many of the endeavors described during the symposium, participants also included administrators, archivists, and collection curators of various kinds.
