          <p>
            Could hunger still really be one of the most important issues facing educators and students?  

While this concept may seem a bit overly simplistic, we often forget that there are still over <a href="http://www.strength.org/">17 million kids</a> in America struggling with hunger.  As we know all to well, if a student is hungry, learning is the last thing on their mind.      

Historically, this idea of first satisfying basic human requirements for students to function optimally is not new, and has been explored at length through the lens of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</a>.   This hierarchy was first introduced in the early 1940's and interestingly, the USDA first addressed this issue around the same time through the <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/programhistory_11.htm">National School Lunch Program</a>.  

Here are recent stats for this program from the USDA's <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/AboutLunch/NSLPFactSheet.pdf#xml=http://65.216.150.153/texis/search/pdfhi.txt?query=National+School+Lunch+Program+&pr=FNS&prox=page&rorder=500&rprox=500&rdfreq=500&rwfreq=500&rlead=500&rdepth=0&sufs=0&order=r&cq=&id=4d9cfac82f">site</a>:

<i>About 7.1 million children were participating in the National School Lunch Program by the end of its first year, 1946â€47. By 1970, 22 million children were participating, and by 1980 the figure was nearly 27 million. In 1990, over 24 million children ate school lunch every day. In Fiscal Year 2009, more than 31.3 million children each day got their lunch through the National School Lunch Program. Since the modern program began, more than 219 billion lunches have been served.</i>

On January 13, 2011 The U.S. Department of Agriculture published a proposed rule to update the nutrition standards for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs as part of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/12/13/president-obama-signs-healthy-hunger-free-kids-act-2010-law">Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010</a>, which was signed into law by Obama last year.  This was the first time in over 15 years that these requirements had been revisited and revamped. 

While legislation is a crucial step in the right direction, educators and education shareholders need to more seriously revisit this issue.  We must remember that even though <a href="ttp://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/NSLPFactSheet.pdf">over 31 million kids</a> receive free lunches every day, <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/why-were-fasting/">1 in 4</a> still go to bed hungry.  

As we explore education, technology and entrepreneurship, is there a place for this issue to live?  Are there any start-ups that are focused on this issue?   What are your thoughts about hunger and learning?  Is this really an important issue worth examining more seriously?

I just created a <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/664"> vialogue</a> to further explore this issue.
