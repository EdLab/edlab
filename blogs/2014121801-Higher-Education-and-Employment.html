          <p>
            According to this <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_329108/lang--en/index.htm" target = "blank">study</a> by the International Labor Organization (ILO), higher education attainment is a necessity towards earning a formal Job. Education is widely viewed as the leading factor towards economic development. In many developing countries, <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201412171329.html" target = "blank">higher education is shaping</a> the labor market for young adults and thus improving their lives and the growth of the country. In order to push for greater success, it is important that there are effective policies and investments in the education sector. These investments will be geared towards improving the education system starting from primary school and leading towards post secondary school. 83% of young adults with post secondary school in developing countries do not have to deal with the difficulties of vulnerable jobs. Young people with lower incomes can now improve their lives because educated people are needed in the labor market to improve efficiency and growth. Pushing under skilled youth in the labor market is not efficient for both the economy and the worker.
<p>
Primary school is the foundation that shapes much of educational attainments in life. Investing in a better primary school system will push young children to learn and understand the power of education. This influence will allow further development to achieve higher education. The government should support education with infrastructure and jobs to help facilitate the economy. This will solve most of the problems of having mismatches in the labor market. This is usually the case in developing countries. Not having a higher education attainment only creates higher poverty rates by pushing a lot of unskilled workers into the labor market.
