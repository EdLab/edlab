<p><a href="http://light-bot.com/">Light-Bot</a> puts gamers in control of a little robot who lights up to teach young users about basic programming logic. The game is available on mobile devices with a web version that showcases the first three levels. Daniel Yaroslavski, the creator of the app, is an undergraduate student who learned how to program at a young age.</p>
<p>Players must direct the robot to blue squares on a board while overcoming obstacles and light them all up. The goal is to teach users the fundamentals of coding through solving puzzles. Users move the robot around a board by arranging block commands in a linear order. The advanced levels provide a challenge in that players are restricted to using a limited number of commands. To overcome this, players will need to use basic coding logic like looping, recalling functions, and conditionals.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game has a short learning curve, which makes it easy for kids to pick up and play. Each level covers a specific coding topic. The last level has the most challenging puzzles in which players will need to apply everything they have learned to win. The Light-Bot website provides <a href="http://light-bot.com/hoclearn.html"> learning content </a> that players should view after playing the game. It may help users learn how different components translate into actual code. Each explanation is followed by an activity in which kids translate a scenario in the game to actual code. Also on the site is a link to a certificate for completing an hour of code from <a href="http://code.org/">Code.org</a>. Along with the certificate there are links to more learning resources for anyone who wants to learn more about coding.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The full version of the app has a one time cost. Although the web version is free, it only has a few levels to play.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Light-Bot is a fun game for young students and a great way for kids to learn about the basics of programming at an early age. The most interesting aspect of this game is that it provides an explanation for how the coding logic in the game translates to actual programming language. This is something that is lacking in similar games (i.e. <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1192">CargoBot</a>). It could be beneficial for learners if Light-Bot expands this curriculum. One idea for expanding in this area could involve users viewing a screenshot of the level, translating it to written code on the site, and having it automatically evaluated. This fun game with its robot mascot can teach students to transition from learning programming logic to writing code.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Light-Bot shines a lot of light on programming logic and a little bit on coding language.</p>
