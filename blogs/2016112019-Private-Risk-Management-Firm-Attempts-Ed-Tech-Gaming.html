<p>A game built to help you discover all the risky situations around you might seem like an advertising ploy that can only appeal to a paranoiac. However, the gaming app, <a href="http://www.discoverrisk.co.uk">Discover Risk</a>, was designed by an insurance company with a mission to help people discover if they have a future career in risk. In this game, players are able to assess situations for risk and develop solutions for customers.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>Discover Risk has a user-friendly interface with a simple, colorful design filled with instructions. The game operates by taking users through different scenarios. Players review situations on virtual cards and then assess the risk factors on two scales: the potential for them to occur and their impact on the project.  Users may have never encountered the situations posed to them, but must think critically about how to respond. This game offers the chance for university students to merge metacognitive thinking skills with real industry events. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>As one might expect, this game is not highly entertaining as it forces users to do a lot of reading for a small reward. In addition, the various options for card placement in the game make it difficult to gain points (or perhaps my future calling is not in the risk analysis business). It would be helpful if the designers made users conduct a demo activity before jumping directly into the game because even with the instructions there were a few unintuitive experiences and usability issues. In the end, the game was short with only 5 scenarios, cumulating in a push to share results on social media. This made the game feel more like a cheap advertising ploy than anything truly beneficial to the players.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p>The Discover Risk app, for all its industry potential, seems to lack significant substance and entertainment quality. However it will be interesting to see how companies begin designing their own tools to address specific needs in their fields. Though educators may be wary of for-profit companies diving into the Ed Tech sector, apps like this one could teach professional and life skills that aren't covered in traditional learning environments. </p>
