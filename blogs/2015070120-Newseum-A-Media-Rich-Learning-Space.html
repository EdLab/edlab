The <a href="http://www.newseum.org">Newseum</a> is an interactive museum of news and journalism in Washington D.C. Through partnerships with corporate sponsors in the media industry, it has developed a robust set of interactive, media-rich galleries dedicated to teaching visitors of all ages and backgrounds about the history of news in America and the history of America through the news. All media is controlled through a central nerve center, which looks like a broadcast control room and is an exhibit in and of itself. Through iterative design and extensive learning research, each space is designed to engage the visitors on multiple levels, no matter what their comfort level with technology. The physical space itself is augmented by online learning tools and <a href="http://www.newseum.org/education/">media literacy workshops</a> for teachers and students that adhere to common core standards.

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<b>@01:13 PG.Williamson:</b> This was really interesting, specifically the way in which they developed the 3 types of learners: surfers, swimmers, and divers. It is exciting to see the way in which user interaction is at the core of their business plan, because personalization has proven to be effective in personal devices like iPhones and computers, but creating an environment within a whole museum that takes this into account is a whole other level of innovation! </p>

<p><b>@02:05 CTerracino:</b> This is so cool! The old and fragile items are completely protected while still being viewable to the visitor, and the interactive touch screen lets them delve into it. This is perfect solution for allowing visitors to touch and examine the exhibits without worrying about any damage to the collections.</p>

<p><b>@04:01 abagigah92:</b> Having a personal or an emotional interaction with what you are learning tend to generate positive outcomes. </p>
