Knewton is making waves in the adaptive learning industry. Its customizable learning platform not only offers online test prep courses for the GMATs, SATs, and LSATs  (“50X+ number of points improvement guaranteed, or your money back!”), but it also serves as a template for paying customers (which currently include ASU, Penn State, and <a href=" http://www.fastcompany.com/1760309/knewtons-adaptive-learning-technology-spreads-to-tens-of-thousands-of-students-at-asu-penn-s">more</a>) so they can create their own courses, using their own content, with Knewton's increasingly-popular adaptive twist. In addition to universities, the company also markets its product to high schools, publishers, organizations (for training and assessments), and developers (for course creation).

This review focuses on my experience with Knewton's College Math Readiness online course.
<!--break-->
<b>Pros</b>
1. Easy to navigate. The dashboard is marvelously designed. At the top: your recommended “Next Activity,” so you never have to waffle over what to do next. But if you don't feel like working on “Real world algebra” at the moment, you can click on any of the (expandable/collapsible) units and see what else you can work on. There are progress bars next to each unit name, badges that indicate when a unit has been completed, and apple icons to signify whether a lesson is locked, not started, in progress, or completed. Once you click, Knewton takes over: first, you show them what you know, and from there Knewton decides at what level you should proceed. At any point during a lesson, you can return to your dashboard (and your work will be saved.)

2. Detailed explanations for each problem. During the “workshop” section of a lesson, each solution is accompanied by either a detailed text-based explanation or a video explanation. These explanations not only include a step-by-step solution, but offer common mistakes, reminders, and tips.

3. Adaptability. This is an obvious one. The course is completely thorough, but if it knows you've got long division down pat, it's not going waste your time. If you want to review long division anyways, you're free to do so. But when Knewton knows that you have to spend more time with the area and circumference of circles, it won't let you finish the course until you've got that unit down pat, too. Smart, simple, and efficient.

<b>Cons</b>		
Knewton is a fine-tuned, sleek, and sophisticated product. The following are not quite criticisms, just uncertainties:

- Knewton claims to make their learning platform highly personable, right down to your preferred learning style. It's unclear, though, whether this math course took my “preferred learning style” under consideration. Either I adapted well to Knewton's default style of teaching, or I simply didn't notice a change in teaching style. It did feel as though many of the videos I watched had a great deal of overlapping information, which isn't necessarily a bad thing — repetition and building upon older concepts is undoubtedly a key part to learning math. But it made me more inclined to skip the videos altogether.

- Suppose the way Knewton is explaining a mathematical concept just doesn't click with a student. There is an option (in tiny, tiny print at the bottom) for students to contact their professors with questions. Will Knewton instructors be available to students for one-on-one text chats or live conversations? 

- Each lesson only has so many Workshops, Wrap Up, and Test questions. Suppose Knewton tells a student that he has mastered the subject, but the student isn't so sure about that. Shouldn't he be able to continue answering practice questions at the end of each session? 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
Although the concept has been around for decades, adaptive learning is the next big thing in ed tech. Companies such as Carnegie Learning (“The Cognitive Learning Company”), LoudCloud (“Welcome to the learning platform of the 2010s”), and even traditional publishers like McGraw Hill and Pearson are riding the coattails of Knewton's success as an adaptive learning system. EdLab is going to want to watch these companies carefully to see what works, who's using these systems, how they're making money, and what technologies are most effective when creating an adaptive LMS. 

<b>The Takeaway</b>
It's been over 8 years since I've done any math of this kind, but the warm-up questions and videos quickly helped bring me up to speed. I appreciated that the option to switch between lessons or units was present but limited — most lessons were “locked.” Knewton's College Math Readiness course did its job with simple, utilitarian elegance. When studies show that Knewton's college prep courses indeed increase the average graduation rate for undergrads, I won't be surprised in the least.
