When a student begins their mathematical academic career, they learn about numbers, and basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Most students can understand these topics without much trouble. I believe that most students start having problems with the Mathematics when they come to the subject of algebra. They get confused by the sudden inclusion of letters in the equations, and the fact that they're unknown variables. When students get frustrated with algebra, the common complaint is that “it's hard and I'll never have to use it in the real world.” What most students do not realized is that algebra is not just equations with letters, it is a way of solving real life problems, and some teachers do not emphasize this enough to their students. We need to start showing students how they will use algebra to solve problems in the real world to keep them better engaged in the classroom.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> When students start learning algebra, instead of bombarding them with hundreds of algebra problems from a text book, we should be using example problems that are relevant to the students themselves. When students can relate to the problem, they'll be more engaged and open to learning more. Teachers will need to get creative when coming up with these examples but it is very important to start showing our students how math is used in our day-to-day lives, and how professionals use math in their careers. When you asked a student their reason for their favorite subject the answer, most of the time, will be “because I'll use this in real life”. So let's show students how we use STEM topics like algebra in the real world and they will hopefully be interested enough to continue down the road of STEM. Let's keep solving problems everyone.
