<i>The mix of concentrated developer knowledge, product sneak-peeks, and enthusiastic user community continues to inspire new ideas for my work </i> <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/2012/">(Past attendee, listed on Wolfram conference site</a>).
<p>
Held a laptop’s throw away from Wolfram Alpha’s headquarters in Champaign, Illinois, the <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/2012/">Wolfram Technology Conference</a>, is now in its second year and slated to be held this October 17th-19th.  This conference is unique in that it is organized to support learning and development around Wolfram’s <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica computation platform</a> and is sponsored in part by <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/">Pearson</a>.  This might not sound unique, but the conference is both informative and meant to inspire new innovations in computational software and discover new ways to integrate these tools into education and into learning experiences.  The three day event will feature a mix of live demos, workshops, "developer kitchens" (hack sessions) and a wide variety of both pre & post conference learning opportunities including training sessions, in-person demos, small group tutorials, and informal opportunities for peer-to-peer learning. Through topical meet-ups the organizers hope to customize the conference experience further to meet attendee interests and facilitate open-ended discussion and development.  As conference goers will explore at length in the opportunities listed above, Wolfram’s Mathematica platform was the first to allow users to add symbolic versus numeric models to their projects, allowing both professionals and students to compute higher-order math and easily integrate these computations into real-world work. Conference goers will also have a chance to explore additional ways for educators and learners to use Mathematica and new ways to create interactive Computable Document Format (CDF) e-textbooks and reports based on Mathematica-generated visualizations.

<b>Conference Dashboards informing Education</b> 
<br>
Beyond exploring an existing platform, Mathematica, and its many education-related applications, the conference organizers have built their own <a href="http://wtc12.crowdvine.com/">proprietary scheduling and social networking platform</a> specifically to support this event. This platform allows attendees to create a secure profile, only viewable by other attendees, schedule conference sessions, request meetings with Wolfram staff, rate sessions and more.  This personalized, conference "dashboard" is a prime example of technology facilitating and fueling the experience of attending and learning at a conference.   Perhaps one of the developments that comes out of this conference is a way to apply a similar proprietary conferencing technology to schools, or simply a better learning dashboard.  Imagine if students were able to plan their school or online learning experience, access secure, proprietary social networks, rate classes and even schedule appointments with teachers and staff.  There are a few startups attempting to do this in the CMS realm, but it would be amazing if the leader in computational platforms, Wolfram Alpha, that recently <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8277">launched a dashboard for visualizing your Facebook stats</a>, launched a dashboard for students.  This would truly take Wolfram’s conference catchphrase, "Apply Computation Everywhere" beyond just tracking your conference experience, or social graph and into the schoolyard.
