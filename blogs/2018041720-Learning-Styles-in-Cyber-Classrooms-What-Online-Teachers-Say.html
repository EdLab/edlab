<p>Differentiation refers to how teachers tailor instruction to individual needs. Research has shown that it positively impacts achievement and keeps high-ability students challenged in heterogeneous face-to-face classrooms. In this study, online teachers were asked to define what differentiation looked like in full-time online schools. It turns out that online teachers see it from two distinct perspectives: why a student needs differentiation, and what a student needs differentiated. And this is surprising because the finding is inconsistent with studies in face-to-face classrooms, and it doesn't support research about what is known to impact student achievement.<p>
 
<p>The study was conducted with 118 state certified teachers from two cyber schools, who answered a 32-question survey that included both Likert Scale and open-ended questions. Both schools serve diverse populations in the northeast, where around 28,000 students attend virtual charter schools. Classes are offered through a Moodle-based learning management system where students can log on Monday through Friday to complete assignments, and materials are accessible 24/7.</p>
 
<p>Three primary findings identified differences and similarities that could benefit from further research into how online teachers (OTs) uncover, then meet, the needs of students in an online classroom:</p>

<p><b>Finding 1: Falling for the myth of learning styles as a key to differentiation</b>. Despite contrary evidence, OTs focused efforts on ineffective learning styles rather than best practices. </p>
<b>Finding 2: Needing to differentiate content, product, and process</b>. Future research is needed to explore what OTs mean by content, product, and process to see how they align with face-to-face definitions and practices.</p>
<b>Finding 3: Using assessment to inform differentiation</b>. Only one participant stated that differentiation was "meeting the needs of the individual learners based on formative assessment," a surprise given the wide use of data for assessment by online school leaders.</p>
