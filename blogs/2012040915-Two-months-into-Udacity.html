          <p>
            When I first heard of Udacity in Kate's nice talk some days back, Udacity seemed like an interesting idea but I must admit I had reservations about its success. Since then, it seems to be popping up on every news and blogging site, including our own blog <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7159">here</a>, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7322">here</a> and <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7304">here</a>. But the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/ff_aiclass/all/1">recent review</a> by wired inspired me to do a status update on Udacity.

<b>A brief history</b>
Prof. Thrun was apparently inspired by Khan academy. Even before Khan Academy, he had tried to found a for-profit online courseware company. This time around, he went ahead and actually set up the course for a fall term. His main marketing strategy seems to have been to write a simple email to a well known AI mailing list.
Prof. Thrun expected around 500 people, but soon the registration blew up to 14,000. A news article in the New York Times made the course go viral, with registrations reaching 160,000. I knew that the Internet loved cat videos. I didn't know the Internet was also into artificial intelligence.

<b>Viral marketing or the future of education</b>
For one, there have been similar <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">open online courses</a> for quite some time now, but none have been as successful as Udacity. In fact, the success has prompted the founders to coin the rather pompous acronym: MOOC. ('Massive' open online learning). Why do you think this was vastly more successful compared to the other online courseware?
<ul>
<li>All the right people and names: One of the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/">largest courses taught at Stanford</a>, co-taught by the author of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Edition/dp/0137903952/ref=pd_sim_b_6">de-facto AI textbook</a>, and by the inventor of <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_google_s_driverless_car.html">self driving cars</a> and the icing: an introduction by Sergey brin.
<li> Internet penetration: The set of people interested in artificial intelligence has a big intersection with the set of people having fast internet.
<li> Its free, as in free beer.
</ul>
Can we get enough content generators to pitch in? Can free education be sustained? Will preus ads in AI driverless car lectures be profitable?

My own feeling is that of excitement, at this trasformative period of todays education, and the big impact that EdLab is poised to make.
