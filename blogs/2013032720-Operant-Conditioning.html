            Hi Everyone,

Today, I have decided to share an interesting topic I learned in my psychology class. The topic is called Operant Conditioning, and it is defined as the process by which a response becomes more likely to occur or less so, depending on its consequences. Under Operant Conditioning, behaviors can either receive reinforcement or punishment.

The part that amuses me the most in Operant Conditioning is positive and negative reinforces and punishers. This portion of this studying is very tricky, something that I struggled to comprehend. A positive reinforcer simply means doing something pleasant, which makes the response of your action more likely to occur. For instance, if a person receives an A+ after studying for an exam, the person is more likely to increase the time he/she spend studying because of the good grade. However, negative reinforcer on the other hand is avoiding something bad. That is, if a child's parent nags him/her to go study, the child will comply and this will increase the time the child spend studying to avoid the parent from nagging.

In punishment, positive punishment is receiving something unpleasant. For example, if a person gets ridiculed by friends when he/she studies, this will cause the person to decrease the amount of time he/she spend studying because of the unpleasant feeling. On the contrary, negative punishment is losing something pleasant. In this case, people who spend more time studying don't have enough time to spend with friends. As a result, the time they spend studying will decrease because of the pleasant thing they are losing. Most of the times, we perform these conditions in our lives without noticing. But from now on, I hope that you will remember this whenever you do something that results in reinforcement or punishment.
