          <p>
            As some of you may already know, I am preparing a pilot study for Critter which will be launched in about two weeks. This study on one hand will collect more feedbacks for the Critter application in terms of the design, usability, and user motivation, and on the other hand will address a research topic that I am interested in: how Critter can scaffold teacher development by offering thought-provoking videos related to teaching and an active community of practice (CoP) that is conductive to efficient discussions and critiques among teachers. 

In specific, the research question I will explore is how social contexts affect video-driven discussions among teachers. The rationale for this question is that, as I discovered during the literature review, many existing research on video technologies for teacher development neglect the social and instructional contexts of using the video technologies. In Critter where social context is a significant feature, I am interested in seeing how interaction patterns differ throughout the learning process in a close versus loose teacher community. By close community, I mean a group of teachers who are familiar with each other. And a loose community refers to a group of teachers who are unfamiliar with each other. The rationale of investigating this question is that Critter, unlike most existing video-discussion applications that only have loose user communities, allows users to form close communities with groups of friends or colleagues imported from popular social networking websites such as Facebook. My conjecture is that this particular feature in Critter will make video-driven discussions among teacher CoP especially effective.

Currently I am working on the questionnaires and video materials that will be used in the pilot study. Based on the feedback from EdLab colleagues and professors, I have revised my experiment design several times in the past month. But it will be most helpful if I could receive more feedbacks before making the final version of the experiment design. Please find the experiment design doc in the attachment and provide your valuable suggestions. Thank you very much!
