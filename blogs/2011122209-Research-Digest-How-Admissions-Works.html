<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00284.x/full">Espenshade, T. J., Chung, C. Y. and Walling, J. L. (2004), Admission Preferences for Minority Students, Athletes, and Legacies at Elite Universities. <i>Social Science Quarterly</i>, 85: 1422—1446. </a>

In the light of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/285943/applying-while-asian-rich-lowry">some media attention</a> on the issue of how our higher education admissions process actually works, I thought it might be worthwhile to revisit the Espenshade article that seems to form the backbone of the burgeoning critique.  
<!--break-->
<b>Description:</b> 
Espenshade, Chung, and Walling took data provided by 10 selective colleges and universities that included, along with whether or not the student was admitted, a variety of information on their characteristics going in to the admissions process.  They had access to a total of 124,000 admissions profiles. They then looked at which applicant attributes were strong predictors (in either direction) of being admitted.  

The big variables are: SAT scores, ethnicity, legacy status, and being an athlete.  Helpfully, the authors give you the magnitude of the impacts of each of these variables in terms of SAT scores (how much of a gain or loss in points on the SAT each other variable is equivalent to). They conclude “the bonus for African-American applicants is roughly equivalent to an extra 230 SAT points (on a 1600-point scale), to 185 points for Hispanics, 200 points for athletes, and 160 points for children of alumni. The Asian disadvantage is comparable to a loss of 50 SAT points.”

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b>
Although everybody knows about preferences for legacies, athletes, and black or Hispanic applicants, I find the bias against Asian applicants to be fairly under-discussed, the link with which I opened notwithstanding.  Granted, it's not a huge effect, but this does indicate (barring the possibility that Asians are systematically better at “gaming” the admissions system so that this policy merely corrects for such practices) that there must be a population of qualified candidates underserved by our current higher education system, and both willing and able to take advantage of a more open environment.
