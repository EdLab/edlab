            NYTimes has featured <a href="http://www.piazza.com/?gclid=CKLu7pXL7akCFaZd5Qod3FxsYQ">Piazza </a> in one of their stories.  For the full article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/technology/04piazza.html">refer here</a>. Below is the summary on Piazza and some major points from the article :

<b>What is Piazza? </b>

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/Screen shot 2011-07-06 at 4.52.32 PM.png"/>

Piazza is an online social Q&A platform which helps students in their school courses. The emphasis is on being real time and cutting down the response time of any question.  (Average response time on Piazza is 14 minutes)

<b> How does it do that? </b>

Students post questions to their course page, which peers and educators can then respond to. Instructors moderate the discussion, endorse the best responses and track the popularity of questions in real time. Responses are also color-coded, so students can easily identify the instructor's comments.

<b>Who's to benefit? </b>

Instructors & TA - since it cuts down office hours and they can respond to student questions faster.

Students - since they can now get a faster response to their queries, help other students and possibly get extra credit in their course.

<b>Several simple & important takeaways from the article.</b>

1. Help is most meaningful when offered at the right time. Further, getting help from peers in the same room can be most immediate and effective. Piazza focused on both these key elements when constructing their platform. For them, notification alerts led to cutting down the response time of any question. 

2. Marketing: The close knit nature of the college campus can accelerate the adoption of your tool. Piazza's first users came from Stanford, where it was also first created. But, an early success does not mean that the product will be readily adopted by everyone. The focus should be on building users and keeping higher retention rates and not making money.

3. Initial fears: Instructors are always wary of using new technology

4. Incentivizing the community: Piazza uses participation as a way to reward the most helpful students. The teachers can choose to give extra credit at the end of the course to the most helpful students.


As we continue ideating on building a discussion component for <b>Edfluences</b> and thinking of <b>Edfluences</b> to be a more open, social and dynamic course delivery system, how do we imagine building a community of people willing to help each other in our environment which could at times be self directed?
