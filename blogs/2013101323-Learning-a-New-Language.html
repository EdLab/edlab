          <p>
            Learning to speak a new language is often a difficult task for anyone. However, there are some people who are naturally good with languages, while others inevitably struggle. There are <a href="http://www.teachthought.com/learning/4-key-factors-language-acquisition/">several ways</a> one can best learn how to master a new language. Most adults have more difficulties learning new languages than young people because the latter tends to be more curious about other languages and cultures, which motivates them more in the learning process. People usually have their own ways and different techniques of learning a new language. Some people prefer listening to other people while others prefer to watch documentaries or videos and practice along. The most important thing is, even if you don't have your own techniques, is that you can practice in the way that best suits your learning style.

Trying to learn a language by using books and computers is different than living in a country and learning the language. Most people who try to earn a language usually tend to use translators, which leads different mistakes likes grammar usage or pronunciations, than have a conversation with other people. Conversations are usually better because you can hear the right pronunciations and the correct grammar and it also helps you build more confidence in your speaking skills. For example, as a kid I moved from Ghana to Italy and I had to learn Italian so I can communicate with my classmates and neighbors easily. Although it wasn't easy, I managed to learn it quickly because I used different techniques like watching movies or television shows in Italian and practicing every new word I learned. The best and most effective way for was engaging in conversations with people so I can practice more on listening and speaking.
