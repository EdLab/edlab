A year in New York City could mean a lot of things. It could mean late nights in curious bars, early sunrises over magnificent bridges, stargazing over the city, unpredictable culinary experiences, mind-blowing concerts, mind-boggling cultural exhibitions, and endless chances to learn something new.

Over the past year, we've been lucky enough to document these learning experiences, most of which take place in the classroom of the city: in museums, parks, community spaces, beaches, gardens, bars, streets... and even on a steamship floating on the Hudson river. They were created by New Yorkers for New Yorkers: to share skills, artistic talents, technological and scientific resources, music, dialogue, historical and international perspectives, and most importantly, original frameworks for thinking about life and education. 

Each episode was filmed in a different borough on a different day, but the founders and learners who attend the programs featured share one thing: a belief that education can take place anywhere, and everyone should have access to it in whichever way is truest to them.

Which reminds us of these lines from Walt Whitman's classic poem, <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/crossing-brooklyn-ferry">Crossing Brooklyn Ferry</a>:

<i>Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta!--stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!</i>

Whitman, perhaps the original lover of New York City, was continuously amazed at the intersection of cultures and scenes across the city's boroughs and how a shared space could foster dynamic learning. So are we.

Thank you all for suggesting spaces for us to cover, for your feedback on our productions, and for helping us make Seen in NY night happen this fall! This year-end recap of SiNY will air on NLT during the holiday break, but we'd like to share it with you now. Enjoy & feel free to share with your friends, family and fellow New Yorkers :)

Happy Holidays!  -EdLab Studios
