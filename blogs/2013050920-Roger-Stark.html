Roger Stark is an entrepreneur on a mission to increase learners’ "mental fitness" through engagement with cognitive development programs in the form of interactive video games.  Stark accomplishes this goal through his company, <a href="http://www.mybrainware.com/about-us/company">Learning Enhancement Corporation</a>, which unites the work of educators, learners and neuroscientists through their award-winning suite of software, <a href="http://www.mybrainware.com/">BrainWare SAFARI</a>.  It is through this utilization of both game mechanics and the latest understanding of neuroscience, that Stark provides a unique contribution to the learning landscape.  Prior to founding Learning Enhancement Corporation, Stark has held leadership roles in international interactive marketing, e-commerce, interactive design and new media.  Stark holds degrees from both Anderson University and Ball State University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory affect your current work?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> In terms of my personal education, I grew up in a very poor community and was able to see a lot of kids struggling.   Many years later, after I had run my own business, I was sensing my mortality and wanted to leave a legacy.  It became clear to me that education was the single biggest challenge of our society and there didn’t seem to be any good answers for our most challenged populations.  Developing students’ cognitive skills seemed to address the real issues that I saw standing in the way of so many challenged children.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> When I started this business, I didn’t have anything invested in traditional education, so it didn’t matter if what I was working on was disruptive.  I was seeking the truth of finding a way to make a big difference.  Because I had been an entrepreneur, I knew how difficult it is to take a concept and make it work.  Bringing a new idea to the market is fraught with failure and success both.  You can’t get too high and you can’t get too low.  When it gets tough, you can’t give up.  There is one difference between a winner and a loser.  One quits!
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> We believe that neuroscience will soon become a permanent fixture in the learning landscape.  The power of learning has to begin with the student.  We’re bringing cognitive skill development out of the clinical setting, where it was too expensive, to a point where it is engaging, scalable and affordable.  If we don’t address the individual student, we won’t be able to close the achievement gap.  Cognitive skill development appears to me to be the most promising way to broadly impact student learning and make a real dent in the achievement gap.
<p>
This also means that science and education will have to collaborate.  When the education and scientific communities are working together in a routine matter, the big winner is the student.  And ultimately our whole economy is the biggest winner.
<p> 

<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> One trend is clearly the incorporation of neuroscience in the practice of education, turning it from a folklore profession into a science-based profession, to quote Dr. Patricia Wolfe, who wrote the book <i> Brain Matters</i>.  The second trend is the impact of online learning.  I believe that this will enable teachers to be paid like professional athletes.  The best teaching will be able to be accessed online with great teachers who will be rewarded in direct correlations to what they are worth and how they help students.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Right now, we are focused on rolling out brain-compatible lesson design.  BrainWare Safari allows the student to reach the teacher.  When teachers deliver lessons in a brain-compatible matter, they can reach the students.  We like to talk about the "empowered learning zone" when the two come together.  Longer term, we see the incorporation of solid neuroscience into other facets of education and the rapidly expanding ability to capture and utilize data to analyze and expand best practices of the teaching and learning process.
