Too often the casualties of the STEM movement and budget cuts currently sweeping our nation’s schools are arts education and culturally relevant pedagogy. This is especially true in inner city communities where arts programs offer at-risk students a chance to express their creativity and stay in school. An arts-focused education opens doors and opportunities for students to explore the world outside their immediate surroundings. It is in this spirit that the OS Kuduristas Youth Program operates. <i>Kuduro</i> is a special form of dancing and lifestyle in former Portuguese colonies in Africa, especially Angola. </p>

<p>The program uses <i>kuduro</i> as the platform to connect students in Brooklyn with their peers in Luanda, Angola’s capital city. Built on the idea that arts and music transcend borders, the program focuses on introducing cultures through music and dance; it is in its essence a unique cultural exchange program. In addition to learning about different cultures, the students also create their own <i>kuduro</i> music using digital software. This offers educational opportunities for the students, as creating music requires some use of math and other subjects. </p>

<p>Do we need to revive arts education in our schools? How important is cultural exchange to students’ educational development? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/22158/">Join this lively discussion on Vialogues.</a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>00:54 AbdulMalik:</b> This is a great initiative because it brings students from different backgrounds together. The program indicates that cultural difference is not a barrier to learning. Learning is a universal language that can be understood by everyone.

<p><b>02:24 abagigah:</b> I love how the program goes beyond creating music. Its combination of education, theater and the arts makes it unique and hence why the students are super excited about this.

<p><b>02:30 Nantwi:</b> The focus on STEM has led many to lament the lost of student creativity in the classroom. It is interesting to see this educator infuse some mathematical concepts to music, one of the more creative subjects. This affirms my belief that we can teach STEM while keeping students engaged and creative.
