Sunny Washington is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.becauselearning.com/">Because Learning</a>, a company that aims to inspire more students to pursue STEM degrees. Founded in August 2014, Because Learning provides schools with a complete STEM solution that includes an interactive data platform, curriculum, and sensors to run experiments in the classroom and also in space through an exclusive partnership they have with a satellite company in the Bay Area. Washington has spent over 15 years working in the edtech industry, most recently coming from Instructure, where she was one of their first employees. During her time at Instructure, she assisted in building the sales, business development, account management, and marketing teams. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Because Learning?</b><br>
<p>I started working in edtech in 2001. Prior to that I didn't really have a passion for education other than my parents instilling in me how important education was to secure my future. A lot of that came from my parents immigrating to the US in the 1970s from South Korea and recognizing how fortunate we were to live in the US.</p>

<p>As I started to work in edtech, I was able to witness products that I helped to build actually have a positive impact on people’s lives. I'll never forget witnessing the gratitude of a group of adult women who we taught to use a computer. Their confidence and their employability skyrocketed. That was an amazing moment for me and fueled my desire to continue working in edtech. As we've built our product line at Because Learning, I often think about the end-user (teachers and students) and how we can teach them necessary and complex skills in an easy, fun, and approachable way.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from learners who have used Because Learning?</b><br>
<p>My favorite part of the job is being in the classroom with students when they're using our product. We frequently hear "this is the best day of the year!" It's always rewarding to hear that from students. I also hear from teachers that they aren't "technical" and by the end of a workshop, they're wiring electronics, coding, and collecting sensor data. That transformation from being intimidated to being hands-on and excited is why we do what we do at Because Learning.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think that we'll continue to see openness and adoption of technology in the classrooms. I believe that STEM will continue to grow as a big focus for schools. I also believe that we'll see more girls and students of color getting into STEM as well.</p>

<p><b>What can we expect from Because Learning next?</b><br>
<p>We're growing! We'll continue to add great lesson content every month, more experiments, and more tools to run your experiments. We'll also be expanding our product outside the US. STEM is a focus for many countries outside the US as well.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MandelaSH">Mandela Schumacher-Hodge Dixon</a>, edtech entrepreneur, former VC, and now co-founder of Founder Gym;<a href="https://twitter.com/flippyfeets">Lindsey Henderson</a>, our Director of Learning at Because Learning who’s always posting about the experiments she's building for our customers; and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOnion">The Onion</a>, just because it's funny and we need more humor in our lives.</p>
