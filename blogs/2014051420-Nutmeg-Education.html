<p><a href="http://nutmegeducation.com/">Nutmeg Education</a> offers software that allows teachers to easily build customized assessments, based on the Common Core curricula. Nutmeg features a test bank of over 100,000 questions, covering all levels of Common Core English and math. Students can easily access these assessments through the computer or via Nutmeg’s app for Apple and Android devices. Instructors receive detailed, graphical data pinpointing the areas of mastery and weakness for the students in their class.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Ease of use is one of the key benefits of Nutmeg. Teachers can either manually build their own assessments or they can use the auto-build function to draw from Nutmeg’s test bank. Teachers select the topic that they are currently teaching and Nutmeg provides a comprehensive list of questions to choose from. Once they are finished, Nutmeg alerts students that a new assessment is waiting for them. Teachers can send assessments to the entire class or just a select group of students. In addition to providing graphical data about student progress, Nutmeg also gives teachers better insight into how well their students are meeting the Common Core learning standards. Students also receive a detailed progress report on their performance and they have access to additional practice problems and learning resources through YouTube for Schools, Khan Academy, and Creative Commons.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>Nutmeg does not explicitly publish its pricing structure. Early adopters have the opportunity to use Nutmeg free for the first year. In the coming months, Nutmeg will begin charging users to sign up for the site. For the moment, new users are limited in the number of assessments that they can create per month.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>The Nutmeg software is much more than just an online test creator. Teachers can choose from a variety of question types, such as multiple choice, true or false, or free response. They can see how often these questions are used by other instructors and how they are rated. Nutmeg is versatile enough to be used by any K-12 instructor who is teaching a Common Core subject. Teachers can also attach videos, games, worksheets, or other learning resources to each assessment. Additionally, if certain students do not have access to the Nutmeg software or app, teachers can still print out the assessments for them.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Test-taking and student evaluation for the data-driven, digital era.</p>
