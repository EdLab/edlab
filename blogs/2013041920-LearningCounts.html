<p><a href="http://www.learningcounts.org/">LearningCounts</a> helps learners map out what they have learned through their work experience, compile that experience in a portfolio, and gain college credit for their work to use towards earning a degree. This system could be beneficial for non-traditional learners because it uses work knowledge to avoid unnecessary courses and save time and money. LearningCounts was developed by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) a non-profit organization specializing in prior learning assessment (PLA). The site’s mission shares some similarities with websites like <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/196">Degreed</a> in that they both compile evidence of all learning whether it is from traditional or non-traditional education.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Users can either get guidance from the site, which is part of an instructor-led 6 week course, or they can construct their own portfolio at their own pace. The instructor-led course challenges users to <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/354">reflect on learning</a> from past experiences, approach learning with both practical and theoretical understanding, be able to express their learning experience through college level writing, <a href="http://www.learningcounts.org/faqs/what-are-the-outcomes-of-cael-100/">and more</a>.  </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There is a cost to using this site. Though using the do-it-yourself method is cheaper and can be done at one’s own pace, it does not award college credits to users. Not all colleges accept the credits that this program produces, so students need to be aware of the amount of PLA credits that their college of choice would accept.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Though there is a cost to using LearningCounts to earn some credits, in the end it would still save users money as an alternative to enrolling in redundant traditional classes. When users skip courses similar to their work experience, they can concentrate on learning new ideas and concepts. The idea that learning can happen almost anywhere especially in the workplace where skills must be learned to perform a job or task is very forward thinking. Until now, educational institutions were the only ones who kept records of individual learning. LearningCounts and similar sites are starting to enable learners to record what they have learned in or out of school. This process may also help learners keep a better record of what they have learned to make better decisions about what they will learn next.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>LearningCounts makes past work experience count towards a degree.</p>
