<p><b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>

<p><b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
I studied computer science and political science in my undergrad and masters degree. It’s not at all clear to me that the content of what I studied is at all relevant to my day-to-day work now. So much has changed in the world from when I went to high school a couple of decades ago. The process of having to think through scenarios, deliver papers, and understand conventional wisdom was useful but the experience of trying a LOT of different things outside of school and learning by doing has been a far greater contribution to who I am than my traditional education.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
I have always wondered how we can shift our systems to create a culture of innovation, health, and wealth across society. I don’t think I consciously designed my path but looking back I’ve had the enormous good fortune to work across all sectors which has helped me form a holistic view of the world and a deep understanding of how to get things done.</p>

<p> Being in Prague right after the Berlin wall fell down had a huge impact on me. It’s where I literally woke up to the freedom that I had. My mindset completely changed in an instant. Everyone was dreaming about what they were going to do now that they were free and I thought, "oh my, I’m free too! What am I going to do?" That’s where I became an entrepreneur and started my first business.</p>

<p>Working in government helped me to understand the political process and get a sense of the limitations and challenges that government faces when trying to innovate and serve its various constituencies. One of my favorite government bureaucrats blew my mind one day by drawing a line on a piece of paper with age zero at one end and age 99 at the other. Then he looked at me and said "where do I need to intervene, with what intervention" to create a culture of innovation." Oh my god, I thought, now there’s a question to ponder for a lifetime. It gave me a great appreciation for the challenge of the job of government.</p>

<p>Working within the largest K-12 educational institution in Canada at one of the most innovative and creative times, in the mid 90’s, I met brilliant educators Veronica Lacey and Wally Beaver who gave me space and lots of support to play and try new things. I created the first international internship for high school students with a whole new curriculum that was based on entrepreneurship, communications, and global issues. Students did a domestic internship then went off to do an international component working for the company – 10 students went to 10 different countries – and the teacher monitored their progress over the internet, in 1995. That was definitely ahead of it’s time. I funded the whole program through corporate and government sponsorships.</p>

<p>Working with big corporations like Walmart, Coca-Cola, RBC and Xerox helped me to understand the structure, politics and cultural impact on teams of people working towards common goals. I created a company called KidsNRG that hired teams of 14-24 year olds to work on innovation challenges that no one else could figure out. We had offices inside RBC and Xerox with teams of blue-haired students with nose rings. It’s a miracle that we ever got inside these companies and most of it was due to a pioneering leader who got the impact of our work and was always surprised by the results of teams of young people who didn’t know that what they were working on was impossible. </p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
The work I am doing is all about helping people to shift their mindset to believe that anything is possible. I’ve written a book called <i>Think Like a SheEO: Succeeding in the Age of Creators, Makers and Entrepreneurs</i> which summarizes the wisdom I have gathered through my 20 years of being an entrepreneur and building new models and new solutions for a better world.  I know that we are in a highly evolving time on the planet with many significant environment and social crises that require us to think differently than we have in the past.  We created this world with our assumptions and our narratives and it’s time to change them. I know that bringing meaning and humanity back into all our interactions will drive significant change toward a better world. Some of my favorite questions are; what is the highest and best use of your leadership? What impact do you want to have?  If I can get people to think about what matters for them and then to follow their heart, we will have a much better world that works for all of us. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
I think that student-directed learning is amazing. I’m so excited to see people embracing this idea, and just in time. I watch my nephews and nieces learn, at their own pace, because the tools and resources are all on the web. They can find whatever excites them and follow it as deeply as they want and they don’t have to ask for permission or wait for someone to tell them it’s ok.  What a dreamtime! It’s so exciting.</p>

<p>Hackathons are also one of my favorite things. Industries, governments, and companies can throw down the gauntlet on big problems they have and a sea of creators, makers and entrepreneurs will show up to create solutions together. It’s a totally amazing thing to behold. People want to create, to hone their skills and develop their mastery. As my husband, the award-winning Canadian educator, Richard Ford has repeatedly shown me, the bar is far too low. When the bar is raised, you create energy, you build opportunities and you give people a chance to surprise themselves by going beyond what they thought was possible. Hackathons are a way to call us to be our best selves and come up with innovative solutions.  Imagine classrooms full of students hacking their way through the challenges we are facing on the planet instead of working on projects that are made up with no real world connection. </p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
I’m working on a company called <a href="http://www.iamasheeo.com/">SheEO</a> and my goal is to dramatically transform how we support, finance and celebrate women creators, makers and entrepreneurs. Women make up 50% of the world’s population but are under-represented in leadership positions in almost every field.  If women were financed to the same degree as their male counterparts we’d create 6 million jobs in the US in the next 5 years. Wow! I think that this is the most untapped market on the planet and I’m here to do whatever it takes to change the numbers, by building new models of finance, education and media.  This project is big enough to keep me busy for the rest of my life. </p>
