<p>Created by BBC Earth, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbc.lifeinvr01">Life in VR: California Coast</a> is a VR experience that allows users to explore and learn about life in the Pacific, from the coastal waters to the deep ocean. The app is free on Google Play and optimized for Daydream headsets.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I’d describe Life in VR as half immersive nature documentary, half scavenger hunt, with the two elements nicely balanced. While two of the four chapters are narrated and guided, focusing on specific natural phenomena, the other two set you lose in an ecosystem to explore and find "discoveries" which are hidden throughout the game. This combination allows for both active participation in gamified content as well as more passive, but awe-inspiring, engagement in a classic VR experience.</p>

<p>I really appreciated the fact that Life in VR provides a variety of experiences for a more holistic view of different, overlapping ecosystems. The player is able to dive with sea otters as they forage for food, travel through the kelp forest, become microscopic to learn about the importance of zooplankton, and even hunt with a sperm whale in the ocean depths. For me, the attention to detail is what makes a digital experience, and Life in VR did a pretty good job of delivering. From fish scattering whenever your controller gets too close to them to a Garibaldi fish swimming right up in your face after the narrator explains its aggressive tendencies, the surprises in this app added a little extra magic.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>My one concern with Life in VR is that it’s a one-and-done experience; it lasts long enough, and it’s impressive in scope, but it’s not the sort of experience you’re going to do again and again. Perhaps adding additional chapters as time goes on would help retain users. Honestly, I was left wanting more, and would definitely be excited if additional content were released.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The BBC Earth’s Life in VR: California Coast experience is a great combination of education and entertainment, and its beautiful design can be enjoyed by players of all ages.</p>
