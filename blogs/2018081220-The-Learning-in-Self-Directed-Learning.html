            In one of my previous posts, I looked at the <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/995/georgenantwi1/trust-the-process" target="_blank">self-directed learning process wheel</a> by Virginia Ricard. For this blog, I am taking a closer look at D.L. Garrison’s (1997) conceptualization of self-directed learning. Garrison argues that most of the literature on self-directed learning focuses on the process and less on the actual learning taking place. As a result, Garrison’s model focuses on the learning process. According to Garrison, self-directed learning is when learners are motivated to assume personal responsibility and collaborative control of the cognitive (self-monitoring) and contextual (self-management) processes in constructing and confirming meaningful and worthwhile learning outcomes. Garrison's model (see image below) includes three overlapping dimensions: self-management (task control), self-monitoring (cognitive responsibility), and motivation (entering/task).

<strong><img class=" wp-image-225 aligncenter" src="http://isdl.pressible.org/files/2018/08/garrison-300x186.png" alt="garrison" width="473" height="293" />
</strong>

Garrison notes that the self-management dimension concerns the enactment of learning goals and the management of learning resources and support. This model requires the learner to question, negotiate, and assess learning goals and methods, support, and outcomes. Self-monitoring focuses on the cognitive process: the process in which the learner takes ultimate responsibility and integrate new ideas with previous knowledge. A commitment to this process ensures that existing and new learning knowledge are integrated in a meaningful manner and learning goals are met. This process is essential to the quality of learning outcomes and to shaping strategies for further learning activities. Motivation plays a very significant role in this process. It reflects perceived value and anticipated success of learning goals at the time learning is initiated and mediates between context (control) and cognition (responsibility).

What are some other self-directed learning processes? How does it differ from Ricard and Garrison's models?
