<b>Bringing News to Children</b><br>
<a href=" http://indykids.net/main/">IndyKids</a> is a newspaper that is for kids, written by kids.  Formed in June 2005, this non-profit organization focuses on bringing current news and world events to students around the world. While it is targeted towards students in grades 4-7, readers vary from elementary school to high school students.  Currently, IndyKids produces ten thousand copies of each printed issue, which go to kids in thirty-six states across the country.  There are three ways to access content: getting a paper copy delivered, downloading articles off the website, or picking up a copy at a variety of locations in New York and New Jersey. IndyKids news has facilitated lively debate in hundreds of classrooms in an effort to facilitate understanding and ultimately social change.

<p>
<b>Workshop Opportunities</b><br>
An additional noteworthy feature of IndyKids is the three hour-long <a href="http://indykids.net/main/get-involved/kid-reporter-program/">workshop sessions</a> offered in New York City that help train children ages 9-13 to become IndyKids reporters.  Not only do kids get to see their own writings published, they also learn many valuable writing, researching, and interviewing skills in the workshops.  While the online publication is free, the workshops are not. With most workshop sessions running upwards of $100, this may become an obstacle for students who live outside the city or cannot afford the cost.
<p>
<b>From Website to Classroom</b><br>
While IndyKids news may have the potential to be more widely used in classrooms around the world, one concern that teachers have with it is the amount of bias seen within their articles.  One solution to this problem may be to use IndyKids articles along with articles from other publications to achieve more balance.  Another solution would be to broaden the set of students making contributions. Teachers from around the country might encourage their students to submit original articles to IndyKids and become a part of the movement toward greater awareness of learner-generated local and world news.  IndyKids is a part of a growing movement to unite the classrooms of the world into one networked global classroom.
