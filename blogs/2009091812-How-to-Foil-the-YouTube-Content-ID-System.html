          <p>
            We've already had one Media Show video taken down by YouTube because of a request from the National Organization for Marriage. But I was surprised the other day when I noticed we had also gotten a note from YouTube saying "The following episode may contain someone else's content." Not a cease and desist, not a takedown, just a little FYI note implying that at some point a copyright holder could come after us.

I was surprised, as it's certainly not the only video in which we have made FAIR USE (thank you very much) of other video clips. So I brought this up with some hacker friends, asking how YouTube knew and why it hadn't found our other videos. The consensus has been that it's because this video had music along with it -- part of "William Wants A Doll" from the musical Free To Be You And Me.

Someone pointed us to one guy's <a href="http://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/youtube-audio-content-id">experiments seeing what could actually fool YouTube's music auto-detection system.</a> This is a must-read for anyone who geeks out on audio. It's really pretty neat -- the guy tried slowing music down, speeding it up, pitch-shifting, using white noise, reversing the audio, making it stereo out-of-phase, all kinds of things. The verdict is that the least disruptive thing to do is speed the music up by at least 4% -- YouTube doesn't catch it that way. Pretty cool stuff!
