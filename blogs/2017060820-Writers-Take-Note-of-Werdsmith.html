<p>Have you ever been on a subway, bus, or plane and suddenly had a flash of inspiration that you had to jot down immediately or risk losing? <a href="https://werdsmith.com">Werdsmith</a> is intended not only to catch those moments, but also to help you finish extensive projects and publish pieces all on the app.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Werdsmith is an app for writers to jot down ideas and create writing projects no matter where they are. Whether you’re typing up a brief idea or working on a project, you can change the formatting to meet your needs. To me, this was the aspect that separated Werdsmith from a normal notepad app. You can choose among markup, novel, or screenplay formats. The latter two come with readymade suggestions that guide you through the formatting. For instance, when creating a screenplay, the app automatically places characters’ names in all caps in the middle of the page, as they are found on a real script.</p>
 
<p>Werdsmith also helps writers set daily word count writing goals and tracks their progress throughout the day. You can even sync the app to your Apple watch and receive word count updates directly on your wrist. In addition, you can publish your projects directly from the app to an online portfolio or share it with friends over social media.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Werdsmith allows you to bold and italicize text as well as to place it in quotes, these commands are less simple and efficient to use than they are on other note taking apps. For example, I couldn’t find a way to both bold and italicize text. Whether or not that is within the realm of possibility for the app, it should be more intuitive.</p>
 
<p>Additionally, Werdsmith includes some free features, but users have to pay to receive access to the entirety of the app. This includes being able to access the platform on a computer in addition to your smartphone or tablet. The fee is $4.99 per month, which is well worth it for fastidious users, but perhaps not so much for only casual subway writers (like me).</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Werdsmith could help writers-on-the-go get their words to flow regardless of where they are. The provided formatting options guide even inexperienced writers through basic stylistic choices, and the word count goal could encourage more writing each day. While it may not be worth the price to the casual writer, Werdsmith could help serious writers finally finish that project without ever leaving the app.</p>
