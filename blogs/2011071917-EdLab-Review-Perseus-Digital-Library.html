The <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">Perseus Digital Library</a> is an online open-access collection of texts curated by Tufts University.  The focus and flagship of the collection is the Greek and Roman classics section, although the amount of 19th century Americana available is nothing to scoff at.  Although I realize that most don't share my (unfortunately unrequited; I have no skill with foreign languages) love for ancient Greek, Perseus is such a useful study tool that I think it might be informative to take a look at it.
<!--break-->
<b>Pros:</b>
The quite extensive digitized and indexed collection is entirely searchable.  For non-english materials, Perseus makes available block translations in a widget on the right-hand side, and will also provide complete grammatical information and a translation of any word you click on.  As Greek can be quite a tricky language, where the same spelling can, depending on the context, indicate fairly different words, they base this service on a statistical method that does an automatic analysis of the context to try to provide an answer, but seems largely dependent on user votes (and there is a nifty little button to cast your own vote).  Perseus also provides a list for references elsewhere in the primary or secondary literature to the text block it is currently displaying.  

<b>Cons:</b> 
I can't think of anything intrinsic to its mission that Perseus is neglecting.  One thing they could think about would be, instead of just listing the available materials by collection, offering different methods of organizing/browsing, like the "tags" in Pocket Knowledge.

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b>
Something like Perseus would be a marvelous tool for any language-instruction course (and Perseus can, I think, be mirrored or linked to at will), but, more than that, I'm impressed by the way they've combined “crowd-sourcing” with automated algorithms to provide a seamless learning experience.  One possible goal for the archives on Pocket Knowledge would be accessibility similar to that provided by Perseus.  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
The Perseus Digital Library is a fantastic resource in its own right, as well as an instructive model for making vast quantities of esoteric information accessible and comprehensible.
