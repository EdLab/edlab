Teaching and providing opportunities for underprivileged students using STEM lies at the heart of the work Dr. Yohanes Surya does in his native Indonesia. Surya, a physicist, trains <a href="http://www.tofi.or.id/en.php?mod=profile&read=aboutus">Indonesiaâ€™s Physics Olympiad Team (IPOT)</a>, an initiative he started over two decades ago. The IOPT competes annually at the <a href="http://apho.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/">Asian Physics Olympiad (APhO)</a> and the <a href="http://ipho.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/">International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)</a>. His years in training the IPOT encouraged him to develop a learning method he dubbed "GASING", an acronym for words meaning "easy, fun and effective". The GASING Method has spread to science teachers across Indonesia to help them teach effectively in class. In addition to being the founder and Chairman of the <a href="http://www.suryainstitute.org/en/index.php">Surya Institute</a>, Surya founded the Surya School of Education (STKIP Surya). He sits on the Board of various international competitions, including the <a href="http://isechallenge.com/">International Science Enterprise Challenge (ISEC)</a> (formerly the Asian Science Enterprise Challenge (ASEC)), the <a href="http://apcys.suryainstitute.org/">Asia Pacific Conference of Young Scientists (APCYS)</a>, and the Asian Science and Math Olympiad for Primary School (SMOPS). He is also founder and Steering Committee Member for the <a href="http://www.wopho.org/">World Physics Olympiad (WoPhO)</a>, Vice President for the First Step to Nobel Prize in Physics, and represents Indonesia at the <a href="http://icys14.com/">International Conference of Young Scientists (ICYS)</a>. A graduate of the University of Indonesia, Dr. Surya holds a Ph.D in Physics from the College of William and Mary.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am a physicist by education, and I love to teach.  So when I started training Indonesian students to compete in the <a href="http://ipho.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/">International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)</a>, in the process of selecting potential students to compete, I discovered that the majority of students did not understand the basic concepts of physics.  Most of them would just memorize formulas, not understanding the workings of the particular system, and reorganizing the formulas would just confuse them to death. The teachers were even worse off; they just did not know how to teach Physics to their students effectively and in a fun manner!  
<p>
So I started to develop a teachers' training module for high school physics. Then I discovered that in fact, most of the problems in teaching physics also arose from a very low competency in math skills amongst elementary school graduates! The fear of math since a very young age had resulted in students shying away from physics, and the exact sciences in general. With the education system in Indonesia, in which upon completing 10th grade, students must choose between studying hard sciences or social sciences, and those with low competency in math skills thus also low competency in science were "driven" to social sciences, very few students manage to graduate skilled in hard sciences, thus constraining the number of future scientists to help develop the country.
<p>
That is when I realized that what students and teachers need from the very beginning is a learning method of math that is easy, fun and enjoyable and effective at the same time.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Again, with my love to teach, I worked in the education sector before founding my own organization. As the late Steve Jobs once mentioned, "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."
<p>
My journey training students to compete in the Physics Olympiad actually trained me to understand how to deal with regional governments and all kinds of schools, private and public, religious-based from all kinds of religions, in all parts of Indonesia. This was a great influence in the founding and development of the Surya School of Education, a teachers' institute (undergraduate and graduate studies), which works very closely with regional governments of less-developed areas in Indonesia. It was also instrumental in the founding and development of Surya University, which works very closely with high schools from all over Indonesia.
<p>
My first ten years working in Indonesia upon my return from the USA also prepared me to work with all these scientists currently conducting research and teaching at Surya University.  Without the experience and the achievements in the past Physics Olympiads, I would encounter great difficulties in managing all these different types of scientists.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I hope with more and more teachers, students and even members of the society (mothers, parents, the armed forces, the police, the general public, etc.) exposed to learning and teaching methods of math, particularly Math Gasing (the method I developed to make math learning easy, fun, and enjoyable, thus effective), students will not fear math any longer, they will make choices based on what they love, and will not be forced to make choices in life because they were incompetent in math and science (remember previously I mentioned about the education system here...those incompetent in math and sciences cannot enter the hard sciences during high school and thus are forced to enter the social sciences, thus decreasing their choices of higher education fields over half! Thus people study language or culture or political science etc., because they are forced to, not because they want to.).
<p>
Actually, learning should be a fun and fruitful experience. Children should enjoy their schooling experience, and not face each morning with dread or laziness because they do not like the subjects they are learning (which is usually because of the way it is being taught), worse, because they feel so incompetent in learning the subject.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Continuing advancements in technology are actually providing educators with more and more effective ways of enhancing the learning experience.  We are also currently working on a pilot project called "School in a Box", where we are introducing tablets to younger students at the elementary school level with our learning software material.  In the school we are trying it out, the students are actually fast learners, and even the teachers become excited in this interactive learning method.  
<p>
Technology in education does need an investment, so the implementation of a program like this would need a new paradigm of thinking amongst policy makers/government/etc. A new wave of thinking that no matter where you are, these advances in IT can actually enhance and increase the effectiveness of the learning process at all levels. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> After founding Surya College of Education, a teachers' institute (undergraduate and graduate programs) where we educate high school graduates from less developed regions to become teachers particularly in the area of math and science and IT, and upon graduation return to their respective regions to teach (Indonesia has a huge shortage of competent teachers particularly in remote regions and less developed regions), we opened Surya University last year.
<p>
Surya University is the first research-based university in our country, and is supported by over 80 research and education centers in various fields, ranging from life sciences to the arts. This marks the beginning of an innovative higher education in Indonesia where science, technology and entrepreneurship intersect.
<p>
I have dreams that through research-based education at all levels, and through learning math and science effectively in a fun manner since the early years, Indonesia will give birth to many future world-class scientists, inventors, innovators, who will all contribute to our vision of Indonesia Jaya, or Great Indonesia (can't find an English word to explain it!).
<p>   
We are also currently at the pilot project stage of developing a school with a program geared particularly to serve the needs of gifted and talented children, who, in regular schools seem to be branded as troublemakers/kids asking too much/hyperactive, you name it. Some parents have moved their children as many as 8x in 2 years of school!!! We will see how it goes, our first batch of 11-12 year olds, a class of 6-10 students, will commence this July, grade 7. This will be an extremely challenging project. The program is an accelerated and enriched one, with full psychological backup from our National Center for the Gifted and Talented.
