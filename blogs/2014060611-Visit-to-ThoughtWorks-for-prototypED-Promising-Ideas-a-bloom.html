          <p>
            Last night, Chris, Dana, Laura and I headed down to ThoughtWorks to check out 4.0 Schools and EDesign Labs' Prototyping Bootcamp Showcase. The teaser promised: "Meet, Drink, Try, Play, Build."

We arrived just on time, and were given a profile of the four groups presenting their ideas; four post-it notes we could write feedback on and post at each group's station; a nametag which we then tagged with colored dots coded with different descriptors (e.g. all around bad-ass and educator); and lastly a orange headband (events with swag are always the best!)

Armed with these things, we explored the tables. The vibe was chatty, relaxed and excited. We discovered that all the presenters had engaged in a 12-week bootcamp during which they met each other, discussed ideas, prototyped ideas, broke into teams, and designed the four prototyped program on display. All groups developed education-based apps. The apps were pretty far along, and the visits to each table were more "presentation" than "play," but we loved the experience any way. Our favorite? We were particularly one over by a program called Codr, which was basically a Scratch 2.0 to help students taking coding to the next level.

The format of the event was nice, with mingling and exploring first; then a brief presentation by Cambria, the event's organizer; then brief presentations by each of the four groups followed by two questions; and lastly more mingling and exploring. We're curious to find out what the next steps are for these four groups!
