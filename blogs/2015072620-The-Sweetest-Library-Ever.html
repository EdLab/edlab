Each day when you wake up and head to your job, are you excited about what is there waiting for you? Probably not. Who gets pumped about going to work? If your office had a library as cute as this one, you would! <p>

<p>Animals are often called upon to give companionship to those who need a pick-me-up, so why shouldn’t that include people who work their hardest, day after day? <a href=" http://www.academia.edu/1449356/Studies_Confirm_Health_Benefits_of_Having_a_Cat">Studies have shown</a> that petting a cat decreases stress and improves mood, which can only be beneficial for workers trying to be productive and efficient. Taking time to bond with a sweet and fuzzy kitten puts smiles on the faces of library patrons at the Doña Ana government office in New Mexico. It provides them with a morale boost and gives them something to look forward to each workday. As their spirits are lifted, their positive attitude is reflected in their work. As the saying goes, happy workers work harder! </p>

<p>The kitties benefit from being ‘checked out’ too. Some love and affection is exactly what they need to break up their time spent in a relatively confined space, as they wait for someone to adopt them and bring them to their permanent home. Many of the cats have actually found their new owners through this little library program, turning this situation into a total win-win for all involved. It’s hard not to be jealous of the sweet setup this office has. Here’s to bringing pet libraries into offices all across the country! </p>

<p>Would you take advantage of a kitty or puppy library at work? Share your stories about pets and the workplace <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23142/">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:41 Beckieb:</b> I knew that there were new and unique repositories & libraries for odd and modern things, but kittens? This seems too good to be true! </p>

<p><b>@01:13 jacob.albert4:</b> I wonder what sort of feedback this office is collecting on short-term versus long-term productivity. Maybe the pleasure of pets is beneficial to employers and workers, in the long run. </p>

<p><b>@02:11 Beckieb:</b> This takes animal therapy to a new level. How sweet! </p>
