<p>Fake news is not a new phenomenon, but it has become a pressing, even dangerous issue. More schools now incorporate digital literacy lessons into their curriculum in order to combat this issue and equip their students with the tools to spot true from false online.</p>

<p>For ten years, the <a href="http://www.thenewsliteracyproject.org">News Literacy Project</a> has been helping teachers of grades 6–12 teach their students digital literacy with curriculum and lesson plans dedicated to the mission. Over 3,000 teachers across more than 60 countries have used the News Literacy Project’s lessons to teach their students digital literacy skills. David Hong, a middle school English teacher in NYC, folded this curriculum into his class, knowing that online literacy today means learning critical thinking skills. As Damaso Reyes from the News Literacy Project says, "In order to be literate in the 21st century, you need to be digitally literate, and in order to be digitally literate, you have to be news literate."</p>

<p>What risk does fake news pose to children, adults, and society at large? What particular skills do students need to be able to spot fake news online? Answer these and other pressing questions <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/42068">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:19 Ryan Allen:</b> We always criticize the upcoming generation (see all the "Millennials are Killing X" articles), but perhaps this new Gen Z is/will be a lot more media savvy than any other. They are inundated with social media, messaging, and fake news, plus they are actually being educated on this stuff. Perhaps they will be able to spot it more easily than us and the Boomers.</p>

<p><b>@02:46 Dallas Milanovich:</b> This is a great way to encourage critical thinking in a very practical sense. I think perhaps this is one good thing that has come out of this awful political climate: the next generation is going to be armed with the tools to repair what we have so damaged.</p>
