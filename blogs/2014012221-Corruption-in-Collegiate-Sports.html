          <p>
            There is a perceived notion by most people that collegiate sports, especially basketball and football, is very corrupt and doesn't look out for the best interests of the student athletes. This <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/07/us/ncaa-athletes-reading-scores/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">CNN article</a> reveals findings from a research on student athlete learning at major institutions such as University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The findings, according to CNN, included but were not limited to the claim that, most student athletes were performing below average in terms of their reading abilities but managed to have equal or better grades than most of the students of that school. 

As a student athlete (mens soccer) at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC), the claims in the article sounded a bit bizarre because I have never encountered anything that has to do with corruption or even being favored for grades as a result of being a student athlete. I was recruited to play soccer at BMCC mainly due to my good high school grades. Even though this might not be the case at other schools, I believe other student athletes who also work hard for their academic grades should also be acknowledged. As a student athlete, I am aware of the fact that combining schoolwork with sports is very challenging and requires a lot of dedication.
Below is a Vialogue from the CNN report on the research findings.
