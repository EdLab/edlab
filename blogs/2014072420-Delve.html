<p><a href="http://delve.tv/">Delve</a> makes educational and narrative-based videos with an emphasis on the humanities, specifically philosophy and history. For example, many of the videos look at the inventions that led to the technology we have today. Delve takes complex ideas and makes them colorfully comprehensible in a short video. The films fall into three categories: video essays, longer videos (~5 minutes), and Instagram videos (~ 15 seconds). The short videos give users just enough information to feel curious to learn more, ask questions, research, and especially click to watch another video. The longer videos are often aimed at problematizing something thought to be common sense, sharing the historical background for why something is the way it is, or challenging assumptions.</p> 

<p>Delve is a new initiative founded in January 2014. Adam Westbrook, the founder, has a background as an independent digital producer and publisher. He is based in Europe and driven by a passion to make quality videos that inspire people to learn more. Donâ€™t underestimate the budding company: according to his website, his video essays have been used on <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brainpickings</a> and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a> and viewed almost a quarter of a million times.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The videos are addictive and informative. The information is cleverly laid out, colorful, and factual. The videos find the balance between teaching new content, knowledge, and entertainment. Adam makes all the videos on the site. As a digital producer, his videos have more of an emphasis on artistry and experience as a way of communicating information over factual presentation. This makes for pithy and enjoyable movies that perk interest rather than providing a full lesson plan.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The nascent site currently has few videos; there are three longer video essays and 22 short Instagram videos. As Delve expands its repertoire, the site will become more useful to students and teachers.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Delve holds promise. The videos are worth seeing and the collection should grow over time. To expand the collection more quickly, Delve might consider having contests for students and teachers to make videos in the Adam Westbrook style to convey interesting pieces of information.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Delve into complex learning.</p>
