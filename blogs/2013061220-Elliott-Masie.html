Known as a leading expert in the field of learning, workplace performance, business collaboration and emerging technologies, Elliott Masie was one of the first to coin the term "e-Learning."  While not a new term now, "e-Learning" was a revolutionary concept in the mid-nineties and, thanks to scholarship from researchers like Masie, has since extended beyond formal learning and into workplace training of all sorts.  Masie is also the founder of the <a href="http://masie.com/">MASIE Center</a>, a think tank devoted to studying how businesses and organizations can best learn together and share knowledge.  A prolific author, public speaker (he has presented courses and talks to over 1,700,000 professionals) and editor of the <a href="http://trends.masie.com/">Learning TRENDS by Elliott Masie newsletter</a> which reaches over 52,000 people worldwide, Masie is constantly contributing new scholarship and resources to the field.  
<p>
Masie is also the leader of the <a href="http://masie.com/MASIE-Information/the-learning-consortium.html">Learning CONSORTIUM</a>, a global coalition of over 230 organizations devoted to furthering the learning strategies employed by their teams and has both contributed research focused on emerging technologies within workplace learning and created new models for increasing learning and collaboration within groups and institutions.  Masie has also served in a variety of advisory roles including on the Board of Trustees of Skidmore College, the Board of FIRST Robotics and the CIA University Board of Visitors.  In addition, Masie has provided advice to a number of non-profit and government agencies, including the Department of Defense and the White House Advisory Council on Expanding Learning Opportunities.  Masie’s diverse range of disciplines and expertise extends beyond learning and workplace performance and into the performing arts through his work as a producer and investor in a variety of award-winning Broadway shows ranging from Macbeth to Kinky Boots.  Masie holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology and Business from SUNY Binghampton.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> My background included being a young "nerd" and "geek" at a special Science High School in NYC (Stuyvesant High School).  Then, I was a sociology major and student activist in college.  The combination of science and the curiosity of liberal arts and the drive of an activist helped shape my work as a learning analyst and curator.


<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I have had a very rich set of experiences, including work as a volunteer for the Central Intelligence Agency University, efforts in Africa to reduce malaria, serving on a White House Task Force and spending thousands of hours in various corporate settings.  These have shaped my passion for better understanding how we create and deliver learning experiences to massive audiences of workers.
<p>


<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I hope my work yields three things:  Curiosity about Learning, Evidence Based Experimentation and a Resistance to the Hype Factor.  We must be curious – always responding to curiosity as a key driver for personal and professional development.  We must be evidence based – looking for real and direct data based evidence about the impact of learning efforts.  And, we must beware of the "Hype" monster that will declare a cool trend as a continuing trend.  Hey, what happened to 2nd Life?


<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Personalization is the biggest driver.  People will want and demand to have an ever more personalized learning and work experience.  I also think that we will continue to memorize less – with greater agility in looking up information rather than retaining it in our heads as memorization.  And, the growth of video as a storytelling medium is one of the largest trends that will continue to impact learning.
<p>


<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am working on PERSONALIZATION.  I am looking at how we can give learners the same type of "ads" that Amazon sends us – letting us know that, based on our experiences and schedules, it would be great to watch this 4 minute video before our meeting on Thursday.   I believe Personalization is the greatest driver and disrupter for learning. <p>
