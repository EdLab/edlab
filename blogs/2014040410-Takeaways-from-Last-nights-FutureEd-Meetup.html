Last night I attended a Meetup organized by Be Social Change and hosted at Knewton (see <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/10712">this EdLab blog post</a> with more details). While the panel itself was largely disappointing, I did find value in the speakers as potential Profilees for NLT and gathered a few takeaways for future events (see below). 

<b>Why was the panel so disappointing?</b> 
-There was a lack of clear focus on the topic #FutureEd, it was more lets reminisce re: our lives and past experiences in school 
-Despite my comment below, the ice breaker activity was not explained in a clear, succinct way & many audience members misunderstood the instructions 
-It seemed as if the event was just a chance for the 3 presenters and moderator to talk about their work with no clear opportunity for the audience to engage in real debate (we were allowed about 3 questions per presenter) 
-Only 40 people attended (which could explain the previous point)
-$15 was a steep cost for so little return (plus, you had to get tap water if you didn't want wine) 
-There was only one mic for the whole event... which was passed from moderator to presenter in an awkward "hot potato"-like manner 

<b>Positive elements:</b>
-Name tags had a subtly fun twist (see pic in my tweets below), but NO RIBBONS (hard to top our model! ;)) 
-The intro ice breaker activity (draw a positive memory from your childhood education & ask your neighbor to add their own spin) was truly "outside the box" and a fun way for the audience to bond with one-another  
-The presenter's passion for their work was immediately apparent & will hopefully lead to future NLT content
