Last-night's <a href="http://entrepreneurship.columbia.edu/posts/news/columbia-engineering-entrepreneurship-night-featuring-bill-campbell-and-ben-horowitz-next-month/">Columbia University Engineering Entrepreneurship night</a> was a packed event featuring both <a href="http://portal.seas.columbia.edu/seas/alumni/dec6_bios.html">startup "titans"</a> and budding student entrepreneurs.  

<b>Here is a run-down of my event highlights:</b> 
-@bhorowitz: "If you dont know Bill Campbell you are screwed" 

-The company landscape is changing so quickly... move away from physically located co's like Borders etc. 

-Software playing an even bigger role and allows the est. of co's like Air BnB - Rap Genius!!! 

<b>-Surprising takeaways from @bhorowitz for young entrepreneurs:</b> Managing your own psych is the most important thing.  You will potentially have to both ask the person you most admire in your life to work for you & on the "dark-side" Everyone who believed in the Co might possibly loose their job... if you can stop yourself from freaking out you can make it. 

-Bill Campbell share fun, funny and inspiring quips & stories from a wide range of Silicon Valley luminaries... mostly known - but surprisingly negative re: working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a>, who he described as "very difficult." 

-It was funny to hear @bhorowitz quote rap lyrics throughout the night... but cool and "admirable" as he really is walking the walk of his new venture, <a href="http://rapgenius.com/">Rap Genius</a>. (see <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-01/the-entire-internet-may-soon-be-annotated">this BusinessWeek Article</a>) 

-Speaking of Rap Genius, see the tweet below linking the annotation platform to <a href="https://vialogues.com/">Vialogues</a>. (See <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8549">my EdLab blog post</a>)  

-Finally, the student entrepreneurs were behind "booths" in the space and felt like "science fair" participants in the set-up.  However, the substance of their ventures was impressive.  From a device to help stop hemmoraging during childbirth and <a href="http://www.lumiode.com/">"light engines"</a> to "data-driven character development" for K-12, the budding entrepreneurs were certainly impressive.  

<b>A note to the organizers</b>... not allowing photography or filming is one thing, but no open WiFi is completely ridiculous in the age of networked communication and esp. sad at a "tech-focused" event.  On a positive note: the sign-in process was seamless and it was great to have a beautiful pre-printed name badge to keep after the event.  

<b>Here are a few "contraband" pics:</b>

We almost attended about three different holiday parties by mistake!

Social media is encouraged, but not supported with WiFi...

a bit of entrepreneurial humor...

Edtech represented!  (they are very alpha with no site yet... but describe their platform as "data-driven character development")
