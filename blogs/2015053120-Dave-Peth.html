<p> Dave Peth, founder of Symbolic Studio, is exploring the intersection of art, education, and technology and helping people to learn the design process through media. With degrees from Harvard and Cornell Universities and an Emmy under his belt, Peth has been a Senior Producer of Interactive Media at <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/">WGBH</a> where he worked on numerous projects including Curious George, NOVA, Martha Speaks, Medal Quest, and Design Squad Nation.</p>

<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work? </b><br>
It all started back in elementary school. . . (cue harp music and wavy line transition). . . My district had a compendium of creative student work that they published every year. I submitted a drawing that was accepted and I remember being so excited when I got to hold that book in my hands and see something I made in print!</p>

<p>That feeling stuck with me—that I can make something that other people might want to see or read. It really is exciting and humbling to get to be a part of <i>making culture</i> in a positive way. In the projects that I work on now, I want to make media that encourages people, especially kids, to develop their natural creativity and talents and to find ways to share it with others. </p>

<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape? </b><br>
I’m less interested in changing the "learning landscape" than I am in changing peoples' minds—how they think about themselves and their abilities. A first grade boy might start to dislike reading because it seems too difficult, or a high-school girl might decide that engineering isn’t something for people like her. We need to change these negative self-stories, because our sense of our identity can shape what we think we can learn. The projects I work on try to break through those false assumptions and help kids to feel confident and excited to learn new things. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
It will probably be a socially gamified flipped classroom MOOC cloud app for low-cost tablets. Did I hit all the buzzwords? Actually, I think the one area of impact might be had where we address the emotional and physical aspects of learning alongside the cognitive ones. It’s not enough to present the concepts to be learned in ever-more efficient or entertaining ways. Educators also have to meet the emotional, social, and physical needs of their students. That’s a lot to take on. We need more creative ways to support educators and learners in all these areas. </p>

<p><b> What are you currently working on and what is your next big project? </b><br>
I’m currently working on new games for Peg + Cat and Odd Squad, two PBS KIDS shows produced by The Fred Rogers Company. In a totally different area, I’ve also been inspired recently by research in the use of VR games to help people manage pain, for example, during treatments for burns. Media-use gets a lot of negative attention, but there's also exciting opportunities to use digital media to improve people's wellbeing. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter </b><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/genekoo">@genekoo</a> is a friend who’s done a lot of thinking about using games for social good. <a href="https://twitter.com/DesignSquad ">@DesignSquad</a> is the twitter feed for the Design Squad PBS series and online community that gets kids excited about engineering. I worked on this project in the past, and it’s still inspiring. I also follow John Quincy Adams (<a href="https://twitter.com/JQAdams_MHS ">@JQAdams_MHS</a>) account, which tweets his diary entries from the early 1800’s. It’s a little reminder not to get too preoccupied with the present moment; history is longer than our twitter feeds suggest. </p>
