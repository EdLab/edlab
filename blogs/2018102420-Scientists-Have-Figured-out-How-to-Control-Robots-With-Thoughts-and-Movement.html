<p>Scientists at MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have pioneered a technique that allows users to control a robotic arm via brain patterns and muscle signals. Research participants were first fitted with a brain scanning cap and muscle sensors. Users were then able to correct a robot doing simple tasks just by thinking about it and with a flick of the wrist.</p> 

<p>The researchers referred to this breakthrough as "supervising" because the robot still operates autonomously if the human does not witness a mistake in the task. As this technology is still in its infancy stage, it does not yet allow for full control. But in the future, the technique should move beyond simple supervision, and into more advanced functionalities.</p> 

<p>This technology is already easy to use with little training. Anyone can be hooked up to the equipment and begin supervising. Given its ease, how do you think this innovation could be adapted for people who have disabilities?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:18 RuthS: </b>I don't want any machine like this hooked up to my brain. I think it's a danger to so intimately connect brain with machine. When robots are too closely connected to humans, we are more concerned about efficiency rather than morality.</p>

<p><b>@01:09 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>This innovation seems very promising, especially for people with limited mobility. I wonder if the technology could be adapted for use in devices directly connected to humans such as prosthetic limbs.</p>
