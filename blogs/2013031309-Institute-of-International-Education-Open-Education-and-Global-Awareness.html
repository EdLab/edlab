Last night I attended a panel at IIE called, "Global Awareness, Foreign Policy, and Education: Preparing American Students for Life and Work in the 21st Century." The panel included Honor Moorman, Associate Director of Professional Development and Curriculum, Asia Society, Daniel Hirsh, alumni Fulbright Classroom Teacher Exchange, Shamil Idriss, Chief Executive Officer of Soliya, and Kristin Nolan, Programs Manager of News Deeply.   

In thinking about the necessary skills for the 21st century, the panel emphasized the importance of global awareness in light of a growing trend toward networked learning and collaborative problem solving. 

I was particularly excited about Soliya, an organization engaged in the growing movement of <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Virtual-Exchange-Program/125601/"> virtual international exchange</a>. What struck me immediately about this digital exchange program was that it is grounded in thoughtful  pedagogy aimed at encouraging intercultural understanding and empathy. Online facilitators go through an intensive training program so that they can foster trust and productive conversations around contentious international topics that ultimately encourage empathy and intercultural understanding. Also Incorporated into their program was an assessment plan to understand its impact. 

Shamil spoke eloquently about preparing students for the 21st century. Specifically, considering that the nature of problems are more urgent than ever before, they demand multilateral cooperation to resolve them. That said, he believes we need to prepare the next generation to be able to work effectively together in an international context.
