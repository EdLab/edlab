<p>While many might not see Facebook as having a place in the classroom, research finds that it may have a legitimate place outside the classroom when utilized properly. In one recent study, researchers set out to determine high schoolers’ perspectives regarding the use of social networks for educational purposes. In learning their needs, expectations, and experiences in participating in Chemistry Learning Facebook Groups (CLFG), researchers hoped to understand how social media could contribute to science education and provide teachers with a better understanding of how to facilitate learning.</p>
 
<p>The study focused on 707 students between the ages of 16 and 17 enrolled in high school chemistry courses in Israel. Throughout two years students were given questionnaires before and after participating in a CLFG assessing their attitudes towards Facebook in general, how they felt about utilizing it as an educational tool, and what preferences they had towards a CLFG’s function and member contributions. Additionally, researchers assessed and grouped students based on how much learning was demonstrated throughout the course of a year. </p>
 
<p>After one year, researchers found that there was a significant increase in positive attitudes among students regarding the use of Facebook as an academic tool. Not surprisingly, those students who demonstrated extensive chemistry learning perceived CLFG’s much more positively than students who demonstrated little to no learning. According to the data collected from student questionnaires, chemistry learning is best facilitated by Facebook groups where instructors post important and useful information, encourage contribution and question-asking, and encourage a supportive social climate while remaining professional. </p>
 
<p>For a Facebook group to function as a useful, positively perceived learning tool by students, it needs to function as a safe and nurturing social space as well as a productive learning environment. In compiling student responses, the researchers of this study created a "10 Commandments of don’ts" list for teachers utilizing CLFGs. Overall, this list reflects the importance of teachers maintaining a professional classroom presence, not forcing contribution, and ensuring Facebook is not detracting from class itself or functioning as the only mode of communication. If educational instructors are trained on how best to engage a class and facilitate learning on a social media platform, it’s possible that they can increase student learning and comprehension while also making the experience more interactive, communal, and enjoyable.</p>
