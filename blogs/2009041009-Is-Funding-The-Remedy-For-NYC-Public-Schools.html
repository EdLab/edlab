          <p>
            At the heart of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity (CFE) debate is the funding formulas for the New York City Public School System. During the initial hearings, New York State's Court of Appeals (the highest court in the state)ruled they would consider the CFE's case if it could show that students in the NYC public schools were being denied a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2526">“basic sound education."</a> 

During subsequent hearings, the CFE were able to show that NYC public school students were being denied a basic sound education. So on November 26, 2006, New York State's Court of Appeals rendered its “implementation” decision on the case it decided in 2003. This decision has had and will continue to significantly impact the future of public schools not only in NYC but the state.

In his opinion for the court, Associate Judge Eugene Piggot declared:

<blockquote>Accordingly we directed the State to ensure, by means of [r]eforms to the current system of financing school funding and managing chools that every school in New York City would have the resources necessary for providing the opportunity for a sound basic education. Nothing that "the political process allocates to City schools a share of state aid that does not bear a perceptible relation to the needs of City students," we instructed the State to ascertain the actual cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City, rather than the state as a whole.
</blockquote>

There are more specific aspects of the implementation decision I will touch upon in later posts. For this post, I want to hear comments and concerns about whether the lack of financing is the root of the problems facing New York CityÂ¹s public schools (bear in mind that the City's proposed budget cuts will have an affect on its public schools)?
