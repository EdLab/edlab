Hi Everyone!  

Embedded below are 2 vialogues covering almost all of the four demos from the NYC EdTech Meetup "Gotham City Summer Startup Showcase" this past Tuesday at AlleyNYC (Formerly The Hatchery) from 7-9:30 PM.  Lets try adding our comments in regard to what works & doesn't from the event so that we can learn from this experience for our own demo night on Oct. 30th.  Note the intro, ratio & length of demos to questions and additional details like projection technology, seating etc.  

<b>In the meantime, here are my thoughts...</b> 
-The intro was nice in that the focus was on the startups & attendees and not the "sponsors"

-The times ratios were off... 20 mins to demo & 5 mins to ask questions is skewed and felt tedious. 

-The snacks were terrible (Pearson was the "snack sponsor") and included dried fruit & nuts, crackers, popcorn, bottles of water and cans of beer. 

-The seating was nice... comfy soft chairs that were flexible & mobile. 

-Projector was an improvement... last-time they used a tiny screen. 

-Participants were only given 20 mins to "network" in the space & then they were invited to go to a nearby bar.  It seemed this was a ridiculous request & no-one went to the bar & instead stayed later in the same space while they cleaned-up. 

-Overall a "nice" casual demo... however, I would have improved the snacks, shortened the demos and lengthened the Q&A.

<b>Note the subtle (if badly delivered) intro... there is a very, very "undercover" plug for the College Board who is the sponsor:</b>

<b>At the every end I do a "stand-up" for the EdLab and our upcoming digital publication... and have since gotten about 3 emails from people I met who want to learn more! Go NLT! ;)</b>  This vialogue is taking a bit of time to process so stay-tuned!
