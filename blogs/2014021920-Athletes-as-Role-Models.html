          <p>
            I am sure most of us had individuals we looked up to as role models when we were children. These role models often probably included a celebrity (e.g. athlete, singer, actor). Since my theme has been focusing on sports and its impact on education and students, I will focus specifically on athletes as role models. Athletes (e.g. Aaron Hernandez, Darren Sharper, Ray Rice) have been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Children pick athletes as their role models based on their achievements on the field. However, there is a need for children who choose athletes as their idols to be guided because of their off the field behavior. 

Athletes have their lifestyles off the field just like any other person but their celebrity means their every move is watched and analyzed. This <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/969596-athletes-role-an-investigation-on-why-not-all-athletes-make-good-role-models">article in the Bleacher Report</a> gives several instances where top rated athletes were involved in acts considered unethical by most people. In contrast, I think children should be allowed to choose athletes as their role models because there are good values and qualities that athletes display on the field, which includes but is not limited to tolerance, teamwork and determination. 

Who were you role models as children? Should a celebrity's off camera behavior have any effect on whether they can serve as role models?
