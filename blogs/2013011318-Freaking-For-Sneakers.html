          <p>
            Now-a-days, it seems a lot of people would do anything for sneakers. In this <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1169903-2,00.html">
piece from TIME, aptly titled Freaking for Sneakers </a>, the author looks at this phenomenon. The phenomenon in question is when people, mostly young men in urban cities, wait in long lines-sometimes over 24 hours-to ensure they have a shot of obtaining a limited release pair of sneakers, usually by Nike. For them, obtaining a pair of a limited release is part of their lifestyle and speaks to an exclusivity since most of the new sneaker releases are limited and are only up for sale for one day to make the sneaker more exclusive. 

There are contrasting reasons for why so many people lined up for countless hours for sneakers. For some, it is the thrill of being part of the chase while some are avid sneaker collectors. For others, it serves as a business opportunity as there are currently a lot of resellers-people who buy the sneakers and sell it for a much higher price. As a sneaker collector myself, this is very frustrating. I would like for people to buy the item because they will use it, and not to take advantage of others who really want to collect sneakers, but aren't able to spend a night in front of a store waiting for its release. 

What are your thoughts on camping for sneakers and what does it say about our culture?
