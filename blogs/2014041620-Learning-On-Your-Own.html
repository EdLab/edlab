<b>Title:</b> Towards Designing Cognitively-Enriched Project-Oriented Courses Within a Blended Problem-Based Learning Context
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Efthimios Tambouris, Maria Zotou, & Konstantinos Tarabanis
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10639-012-9209-9/fulltext.html">Education and Information Technologies</a>
<p>
<b> Research Question:</b> How can cognitive technologies be effectively incorporated into project-oriented courses?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> Problem-based learning allows students to develop domain specific knowledge through hands-on experience. However, implementing problem-based learning raises its own set of challenges. Students may be unwilling to shoulder additional responsibilities, and an exclusive focus on student work may get in the way of necessary lecture time. 
<p>
After a literature review, the authors of this study implemented a test program with a group of 12 students in a postgraduate program in Information Systems at the University of Macedonia. The coursework included student-developed projects and a final exam. To investigate whether blended learning might help in managing the issues involved with problem-based learning, they included an online learning management system in the course to allow students to collaborate and build knowledge outside of the classroom. 
<p>
<b>Findings:</b> To evaluate the usefulness of this blended learning technology, the authors had the students evaluate the course along 13 different axes in a post-course questionnaire. They supplemented these findings with personal interviews and classroom observation. They found that the students had difficulty adjusting to the self-directed learning required by the blended learning arrangements. Although many students enjoyed the challenge, some were reluctant to take an active role, either in challenging the thinking of others or in using the discussion and information-sharing tools provided.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The small sample size and lack of rigorous evaluation make this study more suggestive than conclusive. However, the authors are able to offer a few suggestions, including frameworks for implementing blended learning in project-based contexts, and scaffolding tools to guide students even in self-directed learning.
