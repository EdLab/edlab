<p><a href="http://www.springaccelerator.org">Spring Accelerator</a> wants to change the fact that 250 million adolescent girls are living in poverty worldwide by funding businesses that create educational and career opportunities in East Africa and South Asia. Currently in nine countries throughout these areas of the world, the accelerator program hopes to reach 200,000 girls by 2019. They are built on the philosophy of the <a href="http://www.girleffect.org/our-purpose/">Girl Effect</a>, or the idea that intergenerational poverty and related problems can significantly decrease when girls are better educated. When girls have more opportunities, families tend to become stronger economically, student numbers increase, and disease and child marriages decrease.</p>

<p>This London-based accelerator program works with businesses for nine months in an intense design prototyping program to ensure that they are best able to provide innovative solutions needed in order to make real impact in countries where girls often have fewer professional opportunities. Instead of creating an expensive concept only to find it doesnâ€™t work, Spring Accelerator requires its businesses to prototype human-centered models based on the people they are designed to help. The prototype process relies on listening and empathizing with people, and could provide businesses with a stronger foundation upon which to grow. </p>

<p>Why do you think the ability to prototype is so important in accelerator projects? What kind of businesses do you think will best achieve the social missions of uplifting girls in East Africa and South Asia?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:12 Dyranda:</b> It's so good to see innovations that apply an evidence base to their projects and take the time make sure they will be acceptable or are workable; not enough entrepreneurs consider the impact of a technology failure on the market, or in this case, vulnerable girls. Great initiative</p>

<p><b>@01:15 RuthS:</b> Prototyping allows for the ability to really connect with the people who will be affected by these businesses. It demands research and conversations, then testing its actual effects and returning to the drawing board if necessary. It's the only way to really build a business that is human-centered.</p>
