          <p>
            I have mostly written blogs on technologies so this time around I thought why not try and write about something different like health, which might turn out to be informational and useful.

My trip to India this winter has been more hectic than I had thought. Due to some personal reasons, I found myself spending a lot hours in hospitals than shopping or being connected to the outside world.

I realized there is an emerging market in India for medical tourism where people not only from India but abroad come for operations or treatment which might cost thousands of US dollars.  Gurgaon has turned out to be not only the third silicon valley of India but also for its renowned hospitals, which offers world class services like heart bypass surgery ~ 5000$ which is a fraction of what one would pay in US. One of the hospitals I felt offered one of the best services was <a href="http://www.medanta.org/specialities.html">Medicity(Medanta)</a>, which offers different specialty groups like heart, neuro, orthopedics, etc.

However some of the hindrances which turn out to be biggest obstacles are:- 
1) Infrastructure (transportation) 
2) Communication (WiFi is still very much limited in elite hotels and would still take time to emerge like US).

When and how these limitations are overcome, only time can testify.
