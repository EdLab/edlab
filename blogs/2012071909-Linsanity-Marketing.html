          <p>
            Two of the most talked about athletes of the past year has undoubtedly been<a href=”http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/18/jeremy-lin-2/?iid=HP_River”>Jeremy Lin and Tim Tebow</a>. Their meteoric rise to superstardom, celebrity and mainstream America made them marketing gems. Tebow, a much heralded all-American during four outstanding years at University of Florida, has been in the spotlight since his freshman year in college while Lin, an unknown of point guard from Harvard, rose to prominence to lead the then slumping Knicks to an unexpected playoff berth last spring before injury cut his season and ultimately Knick career short. 

Unlike Tebow, who played in the relatively small market of Denver, Lin, by virtue of been point guard for the New York Knicks, became a cultural phenomenon that spawned the now famous Linsanity movement. His performances became front and back page news and couple that with the fact he was one of the few Asian Americans to ever play in the NBA and you couldn't have scripted a better story. His appeal on and off the court generated about $600 million in market capitalization to the Madison Square Garden Company (MSG). His jersey outsold his more established teammates such as including Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire and several top players in the NBA. Lin will ply his trade this coming season with the Houston Rockets after the Knicks refused to match the Rockets' contract offer. Though the Rockets had the last major Asian athlete in North American sports, Yao Ming, Lin presents a different challenge for the Rockets in terms of his appeal and how they can potentially use his name and considerable hype to generate income in Houston, which is by no means close to New York in terms of branding and marketing.
