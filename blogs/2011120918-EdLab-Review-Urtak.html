Yes. No. Don't Care. Urtak brings simplicity to online surveys. The idea is that with only three possible responses, surveys will be hard not to finish. Urtak also relies on crowd power to evolve and improve surveys. Survey takers can add their own questions and answer questions asked by their peers. The result is a simple, growing way to survey and engage readership.

<b>Pros:</b>
Urtak is dead simple and very intuitive. As soon as users answer a question, the responses appear in the form of a pie chart. There is instant gratification built in to the process. As soon as you choose one of three options, color coded results appear in their place. 4% of survey takers like the smell of dirty socks? Extremely addictive. I suggest a try of the General Interest survey. As the first Urtak endeavor, it's snowballed into a massive 17,000+ survey that's endearingly erratic. The survey curates itself. The more survey takers that “don't care” about a question, the fewer times it will be asked to others. 

<b>Cons:</b>
Urtak saves all your question responses as searchable and sortable data in your dashboard. This is probably a good feature, but it's a little disturbing. In the process of writing this article, I apparently answered 150 questions. I'd actually prefer not to know. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
I love revivals and I'm thinking about Survey Sidekick. We may not be able to replicate Urtak's signature simplicity, but the instant gratification is something we could try to emulate. Urtak has also been functioning as a marketing tool because of its dedicated (addicted?) user community. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Urtak makes static surveying look old-fashioned.
