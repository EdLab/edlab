<p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but what if that first step is so daunting that you don’t want to take it? For beginning readers who struggle, the dizzying world of words can cause them to become mute; keeping quiet might be the easiest way to save face in front of peers who read more fluently.<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sight-words-for-reading-hd/id461887237?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8r">
Sight Words for Reading</a> is an iPad literacy app that attempts to make letters less scary for those who might do their best to avoid books. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Sight Words for Reading has firm pedagogical roots; it uses words covered in both Fry and Dolch lists of the most commonly encountered vocabulary. The app uses a two-pronged approach to improve reading: fun videos present challenging words in a playful context complete with dazzling cartoon sets, genial animated friends, and music; and a flash card quiz corroborates learning. A randomized display of words makes quizzes different every time. Sight Words aims to make reading a fun, playful, and enjoyable process, and largely succeeds in doing so. </p>
 
<p>The animations introducing new concepts in Sight Words for Reading are of the highest quality—they zoom and dolly, and pan and truck across outlandish sets. The characters are distinct from one another, and have fun, happy, and encouraging voices. There is no nagging or brow beating here. The vibe is super positive and should appeal to hesitant readers and help muster their courage to give reading another go. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Sight Words for Reading bets all its money on tunes—if your children don’t like music that is perpetually upbeat, this song list is going to quickly drop off your toddler’s personal Billboard charts, and this app will collect dust. Although I imagine most children would like the music offered because of its persistent perkiness, its unholy mashup of new age synth punctuated by electric guitar riffs may lead to a lot of adult headaches. Adding your child’s off-key, but wildly enthusiastic, vocals to the mix may cause even the most even-keeled parent to go wobbly. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Sight Words for Reading is a fun musical app that will consistently encourage even the most resistant readers to return to the books they normally neglect after they put down their iPad. For parents with any musical taste, I would suggest nudging your kids to play this app in a noise insulated room where they can happily sing along word-by-word.</p>
