          <p>
            Earlier this year, California passed a school reform law, dubbed the “trigger law”, which allowed parents of schools which had failed to make adequate annual progress for four years to effectively “trigger” a change through various means. If 51% or more of parents at a particular school, one which has failed to meet the requirements of the trigger law, sign a petition requesting a change, they can shut the school down, change its entire administration or have a charter take the school over. The charter must accept all the students from the original school.  Though it has been on the books for close to a year now, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704156304576003322286342928.html">the first case of “parent trigger” is currently underway at Compton's McKinley Elementary School</a>, where parents have the necessary number of petitioners to force a change. Parents want an independent charter program to run the school.

The “trigger law” has the support of prominent politicians, including Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson and Chicago mayoral candidate Rahm Emanuel as well as school reformist Michelle Rhee. Though the law is only applicable in California, several states including New Jersey, Georgia, and Indiana, are considering enacting similar versions of it early next year. With reform high on the education agenda in most every state, some teacher unions see California's trigger law as a step too far. It will be interesting to see the impact that the trigger law will have on public schools nationwide, should it become a full-fledge movement and whether it represents a radical but yet significant approach to school reform.
