Author:</strong> Bill Smoot<strong>
Publisher: </strong>Bloomington : Indiana University Press, c2010<strong>
Check it out!</strong> <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/asmoot/asmoot/1%2C2%2C4%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=asmoot+bill&amp;1%2C1%2C/indexsort=-">LA2311 .S56 2010</a> <strong>
Press release:</strong> In the tradition of the late Studs Terkel's oral histories, Bill Smoot's <em>Conversations with Great Teachers</em> interviews teachers in all walks of life. There are classroom teachers and university professors, teachers in medical schools and culinary institutes and ballet schools. There are corporate and political mentors, teachers of plumbers and carpenters, acting teachers, coaches to twelve year-olds and major league infielders. There are even an exotic dance teacher and an instructor in alligator wrestling. Among those interviewed are the neurosurgeon who operated on Senator Kennedy, former Secretary of State George Shultz, major league manger Ron Washington, and Emil Jones, political mentor to Barack Obama.

At a time of building consensus that the most important ingredient in educational success is teacher quality, this book contributes to the discourse with vividly painted verbal pictures of fifty-one great American teachers. It offers insight into what great teachers have in common as well as how greatly they differ from another.
