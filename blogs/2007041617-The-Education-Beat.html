            The Journalism School at Columbia University offered a course in education reporting for the first time this spring as part of their new focused MA program. I spoke with three students in the course this weekend at the Journalism Job Fair, all of whom seemed interested in continuing their work in education.

It seems the Journalism School had two institutional partners this time around, including <a href="http://www.jrec.org/">The Julia Richman Education Complex</a>, their partner school on Manhattan's East Side, and the <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/hechinger/">Hechinger Institute on Media and Education</a>, TC's own professional development organization for education journalists. <i>(read more)</i>

Here is a description of the class from their website:

<blockquote>
Covering Education, Prof. LynNell Hancock, Mondays: 10 a.m.-3 p.m.

Education is a primary beat in every American news outlet, from the small town paper to the local television station to the metropolitan news conglomerate. The federal No Child Left Behind Act has boosted this traditionally local issue into the national spotlight. It is a growing beat, desperate for writers and reporters with the skills and knowledge to tackle an increasingly complex landscape.

Covering Education is a new course designed to offer students a foundation for making sense of it all. One unique feature includes a partnership with a New York City public school complex housing five separate schools for pre-k through twelfth graders. Each student will intern in one these schools one day a week, learning about its every idiosyncrasy from boiler room to classroom. Seminar time will be devoted to providing the history of public education, examining a sampler of pressing issues confronting educators and children, and offering students basic tools required to assess the nation's classrooms. Students should emerge at semester's end able to cut through polemics and write compelling, clear stories on any topic in the area of urban affairs or social services. The course will link to resources at Teachers College Hechinger Institute on Media and Education, and will include intensive training in investigative, narrative, explanatory features, and journal writing.
</blockquote>

I am hopeful that there will be some fruitful connections for our <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/1286">Channel</a> to come from these activities.
