          <p>
            Listed below are my thoughts, observations and take-aways from the first week of <a href="http://www.ai-class.com/home/">Stanford Engineering's record-breaking online artificial intelligence class</a>.  I will record my observations every Friday both here and through an embedded vialogue at the end of these posts.  I look forward to your thoughts and sharing ideas both here and on the vialogue regarding the future of online course delivery! 


<b>Week 1: 10/10-10/14</b>

<b>Basic Elements of the Course Include:</b>

<b>Prep work suggested by Instructors on Site</b>... 
List of suggested Khan Academy videos on probability & linear algebra.   I enjoyed learning this support material thought Khan, as a visual learner, this format is perfect!  If only Khan A had existed as I struggled through math classes throughout my life.  Also, I really like that the teachers are open to other instructor's delivering material to support their lessons.  Great example of the benefits of “flipping the classroom” at work.  This is the polar opposite of this instructors' insistence that you should only use material in the classroom that you create yourself.  

<b>Intro videos from the instructors</b>... 
I like the “up-close & personal” approach of the video shots. 

<b>Tracks</b>: Very interesting that there are 2 tracks for the course - Advanced (hw & tests are graded & count towards your class rank) & basic (you can still complete the hw & tests but there is no grade and basic track students cannot complete the tests until after the advanced track has completed them & received their grades.  This is an interesting feature that almost creates a “differentiated” class experience.  Almost, b/c the material is exactly the same for both tracks.  

<b>Support Groups</b>: Students are encouraged to create & attend <a href="http://stanford-artificial-intelligence-course-cs-221.meetup.com/">meet-ups</a> and support groups to assist in understanding the course material.  

<b>Initial lessons & homework:</b>  I like how the lessons are delivered in a digital format via embedded videos - but the screen becomes “clickable” when you answer multiple-choice questions at the end of each section.  See screen shot below.  

<b>Initial Take-aways & observations as I move through the Unit 1 Sub-units (see screen capture below for how these subunits are laid-out)</b>  


<b>Pros:</b> 

<b>-Main course hub:</b> Despite set-bacs with the technology - servers were over capacity, tests were graded inaccurately etc. the online platform developed in partnership with KnowLabs is easy-to-use and creates a great “hub” around which all class activity can buzz.  I like this centralized grouping of both support & “in-class” resources, course material, quizes etc.  It is great that windows open & all lesson videos play within this hub site & you are not navigated away.  

-<b>Course unit videos:</b> I also like the “auto advance” feature that continually takes you through the lesson subset videos - almost an autopilot feature.  I really like that I can pause a video and look-up a term through my laptop's dictionary, thus making the lessons truly adaptive to my needs and pacing.  I like that if you get an answer wrong (or right and want reinforcement) you can then click to see an additional (seamlessly integrated) video to provide remedial information about the problem & an explanation of the right answer.   

-<b>Interactive Quizes:</b> All of the videos become clickable when it is time to take a teacher generated quiz, allowing students to select the right answer from highlighted, clickable options that appear on the video screen (see image below).  Also, if students select the wrong answer the video then advances to the instructor selecting the correct answer and an optional additional video explaining the correct response.  You can go-back & take a quiz again, but your first response is what is stored as your score.  I really like the “graphical/text/interactive clicks” program that the UI of the AI course employs!  Both fun & easy to use!  The instructor also summarizes key terms from the sub-unit at the end of each video. 


<b>Cons:</b> 

<b>-Mobile limitations:</b> My only criticism would be that I want to download all the video lessons to my smartphone to watch as I commute.  However, this would, I believe remove the interactive components?  Is this true UI/UX experts?  It is kind of a pain for busy professionals/students to have to sit in-front of their computers for all lesson delivery, I want mobile delivery as well!  Spoiled yes.  Unreasonable no.  However, compared to being tied to a classroom, the computer only delivery is a tremendous boon. 

<b>-Advanced vs Basic Tracks:</b> I don't like that you can't “audit” the course and take the tests and do the homework at the same time as the advanced track, you can go through all teh other support materials, just not the independent work, until the advanced track has completed this additional work (you can switch tracks at any time). 


<b>Potential Opportunities for EdLab Tools/Platforms:</b>  

<a href="https://vialogues.com/">Vialogues</a> in particular rises to the top for me as an initial student in this environment.  I keep wanting to add comments for other learners to answer as I watch the videos, in particular, in the video for lesson 1W “Examples of AI in Practice.”  I want to comment & add thoughts... this is such a perfect place to do so, but because the videos are from YouTube but embedded in the main course hub page there is no option or space for comments.  We will see what other needs rise to the top as I go through this course!
