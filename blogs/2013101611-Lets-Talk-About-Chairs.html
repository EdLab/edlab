            I've never really thought much about chairs, but recently, in ruminating on the 4th floor redesign, I've been noticing them more often. A functional and appropriate place to sit is an important feature of almost every library throughout history and especially aligned with the core mission of space in modern libraries. Here are some intriguing chair resources and ideas I've encountered recently:

<td>The Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford are <a href=”http://www.fastcodesign.com/3019559/oxford-debuts-a-library-chair-to-last-for-centuries?partner=rss”>serious about their chairs</a>. In fact, in the 400-year history of the library, they have only had three types of chairs on the floor. The design of these chairs is very important because they must be robust enough to withstand decades of use, comfortable enough for seriously long study sessions, and totally silent so as not to disrupt other patrons. Oxford recently commissioned their newest style of chair, considering pre-made options (the Aeron chairs we use here were considered), but eventually settling on a simple custom design by Barber and Osgerby.</td></tr>

<td>I'm currently reading <i>The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease</i> by Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman and in the book he makes the (somewhat controversial) case that the move to bipedalism was central to the cultural development of hominids. Reading this book has made me extremely conscious of the way humans prefer to sit, walk, and stand. One of the drawbacks of bipedalism is increased joint strain and the evolution of the sitting place, between standing and sitting on the ground, seems to somewhat mirror our own.</td></tr>

<td>In fact, there is an entire book devoted to the evolution of the chair. <i>The Chair: Rethinking Culture, Body, and Design</i> by Galen Cranz, a professor of architecture at Berkeley, explores the history and politics of chairs from ancient societies to the modern office. The chair, far from being a static and standard sitting space, has developed for many different uses and its interaction with the human form has not always been understood in the same way. Current <a href=”http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/why-sitting-is-killing-you.html”>popular thinking</a> seems to suggest that long periods of sitting are linked to health problems, but the chair, with its illustrious history, is unlikely to ever completely fade from favor.</td></tr></table>
