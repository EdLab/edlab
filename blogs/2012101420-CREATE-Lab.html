<i>The CREATE Lab is both a technology breeding ground and a community partner. It is this unique combination that enables a new form of local change: one that empowers the citizens to chart their technology future and, most important of all, their community's prospects for quality of life. </i><a href="http://www.cmucreatelab.org/about"> CREATE Lab</a>

<b>Uniting Academic Research with Community-Focused Development</b><br>
 
Universities ranging from MIT to Stanford University have "labs" for technology-focused innovation across a wide range of disciplines. What sets <a href="http://www.cmucreatelab.org/">Carnegie Mellon’s Community Robotics, Education and Technology Empowerment Lab (CREATE Lab)</a> apart is an emphasis on forming partnerships with the surrounding community. From a "satellite" project that reaches over 4,000 students and educators in rural Appalachia to "Message from Me," a program developed to allow children to share their classroom experience via an audio recording sent to their guardian’s mobile phone as a text message, the lab is constantly experimenting and pushing the boundaries of "public" and "private" engagement.  This emphasis outside the lab is evidenced on a global scale with, <a href="http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Finch">"Finch,"</a> a small, programmable robot designed to help increase interest in and retention of students in college-level computer science courses.  "Finch" was developed by CREATE over a four-year period and is available through commercial partners to educators and learners around the world. Beyond ideation and development, the CREATE team places great importance on training local educators to pilot and assess their work.  From data gathering and curriculum development to teacher training, the CREATE team works to ensure that the communities of practice they are ultimately designing for are involved and engaged every step of the way.
 <p>
<b>How can Lessons from CREATE be applied to other Higher Ed Innovation "labs"?</b><br>

The CREATE model goes beyond what is sometimes seen in academia as an internally "narrow" or strictly "domain-specific" focus that only serves the needs of the "parent" institution’s agenda or other similarly focused groups. Instead, CREATE focuses on building relationships with the immediate Pittsburgh community (projects like "Message from Me" are available on-site), as well as the needs of a global population (in Finch’s case). Through this emphasis on becoming a true "community lab" the group is able to develop unique strategic partnerships and alliances that serve everyone involved in new ways.  For example, The Harless CREATE Satellite Project supports rural populations through grants, technology and project-based lesson plans. These "satellites" serve the "mother lab" by adding feedback, new ideas, and evidence, and shifting the development focus from a narrow institutional close-up to a wider and more inclusive community long-shot. Sometimes game-changing ideas arrive disguised as distractions.
