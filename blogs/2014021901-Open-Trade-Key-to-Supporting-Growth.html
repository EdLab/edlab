          <p>
            Trade in a free open market has been the leading contributor towards economic recovery following the crisis of 2009. There is an emergence of new ways of trading online and banks have been mitigating most of the financial transactions while taking the risk off trading. This <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2010/11/12/more-open-trade-and-well-designed-employment-policies-key-to-supporting-growth">report</a> sheds more light on the potential of free trade. It has become increasingly easy to buy and sell goods and services from any corner of the world. An open market system means that governments must design policies to help both consumers and businesses keep trade credibility and avoid another economic collapse. The economic crisis of 2009 showed how open economies could be exposed to crisis due to lack of regulations. However, openness to trade also helps economies recover more quickly as they are more adaptable and less dependent on limited domestic demand. The global market presents bigger and better competition and products, which satisfy both producers and consumers.

Open trade can boost growth and create jobs regularly so long as sound policies are created and implemented. These policies will address many problems such as banks taking risks to make bigger profits. Policies are also needed to ensure the protection of consumers in case of an emergency or disaster. An open market frees countries from being limited just to their local economies, and it also promotes greater efficiency and helps to develop and spread technological progress around the world.
