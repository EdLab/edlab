            Day in and day out, students attend class with the mindset of learning something new or gaining some sort of understanding from our professors. But how much are we really picking up? The method of teaching has been relatively the same for many years but is this an effective method? A lot of the time, students study as hard as they can and still do not receive the grades their study warrants. The problem with our current method of teaching is that it often fails to address that students learn differently. Some learn through observation and thinking while others learn by actively applying the concepts taught to them. Then there are those who learn by reflecting on what they had previously learned. 

Due to the increasing awareness of this phenomenon, new <a href="http://www.articleswave.com/educational/effective-learning-techniques-methods.html">approaches</a> in learning psychology have been developed to tackle this issue. One is the use of different strategies for different learner types. Hopefully these strategies will be utilized in future classrooms. As a student, although I am taught something new every year, it feels as if I am learning the same thing over again simply because it's being taught the same way as everything else I've learned since elementary school. Changing the strategy of teaching every once in a while can be very beneficial thing to students' learning.
