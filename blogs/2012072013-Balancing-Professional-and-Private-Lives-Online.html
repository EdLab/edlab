            A New York City public school teacher was recently fired for making what was deemed inappropriate comments about her students on her Facebook page. The teacher, Christine Rubino, is now under a two-year suspension after a judge deemed her punishment too harsh. In resentencing her, the judge noted the comments were made out of school and was meant for an adult audience and reassigned the case back to her the NYC Board of Ed. The teacher has expressed remorse for the comments.

 There have been several cases lately where an employee has been fired because of their activities online. I am of the opinion that people have lives outside of their professional ones and have a right to live and say what they want. If one does not have a professional colleague as a “friend” on their social networks but yet someway their employer finds out, then it essentially amounts to invasion of privacy. Online has become a platform for many to express their views, however crazy or appropriate they are and most often don't think of the potential professional and personal consequences of those posts. 

 
Is it fair to be fired or reprimanded for something you posted online while you were out of work?
