          <p>
            I was thrilled to receive an invite to <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/"><i>Scientific American's (SA)</i></a> recent <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sciamlearning&src=typd">#sciamlearning</a> Summit held in conjunction with Macmillan Science and Education at Google's NYC headquarters.  The event was organized into panel discussions, intimate 1 on 1 interviews and intermittent break-out sessions.  

Speakers ranged from Danielle Carnival from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">White House OSTP</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda">Alan Alda,</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Knewton_Jose">Jose Ferreira</a> and <a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>. All in all, a rockstar assortment of viewpoints and opportunities to think more carefully about #STEM education and digital learning.  

<b>Initial Takeaways:</b>

-EdX and HarvardX are moving in an interesting direction... away from the standard MOOC and more toward a blended "OLA" (Online Learning Activity) model.

-Professor Robert Lue from Harvard made the point re: the MOOC/OLA distinction that online learning does not need to be "massive" or "open" necessarily, and makes a nice case for the more blended (in class/in-person & online) OLA mentioned above. 

-Professor Norvig made many interesting points including introducing the "bus stop" model of online learning in which cohorts form and disband as needed... allowing learners to jump-on and off the learning experience (Look-out for Dr. Norvig's <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/section/Profiles/"><i>New Learning Times</i> Profile</a> piece soon!). 

-Norvig also questioned the need for "Massive" scale in MOOCs... especially interesting since his pioneering MOOC focused on AI was such a revolutionary online course (check-out <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6992">my EdLab blog post</a> re: completing the course).

-MacMillan New Ventures', Mike Berlin, made an interesting/apt point re: our current digital learning landscape being at a "Napster Moment"... this sparked many interesting discussion points re: the iTunes model of an edtech marketplace vs. the need for alternatives.

-Interactive break-out sessions were a great way to solidify both participant and speaker thoughts and was a welcome break from the usual, sadly ironic, pulpit-to-pew style of content delivery at these events 

-It was wonderful to see Alan Alda, who received a lifetime achievement award from SA, and learn more about his fascinating, admirable career both on the stage/screen and in the early #STEM learning trenches.  He mentioned that he liked to teach scientists to do "improv" and that his regret was that he was not able to study more science in his life.  Learn more about his "Flame Challenge" <a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/the-flame-challenge-2/">here</a>.

-SA SVP and Editor in Chief, <a href="https://twitter.com/mdichristina">Mariette DiChristina</a>, did a masterful, effective job of moderating and leading the conference.  I was impressed with both her humility and tact as a facilitator... and am excited to email her (if approved) re: participating in a Profile for NewLearningTimes.com!
