<p>Cell phone use in class has long been a point of pain and annoyance for teachers. Concerns over the potential for phones to invite distraction and cheating plague teachers and administrators alike, but one fear that perhaps unites most is the fear that cell phones are negatively affecting studentsâ€™ academic performance. So, is it true?</p>

</p>A group of researchers recently conducted a survey confirming that not only do students perform worse when their cell phones are on their desks, simply having a phone in their respective bags can keep them from doing their best. The study found that when asked to perform math problems, the students who performed the best were those who had their cell phones taken away from them and stored in another room. While many feel that mobile devices can play an important role in learning, this research shows that they can also be a major detriment to it.</p>

<p>What do you think of the findings of this study? Do you think smartphones should have a place in the classroom or not? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50841">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:35 RuthS: </b>These are really alarming findings, especially considering that even tucked away in a bag, smartphones still distract. We all basically carry our phones with us all the time. Does that mean that we're all just perpetually semi-distracted now?</p> 

<p><b>@01:57 Anna Curry: </b>I think school should prepare students for the world they will enter once they graduate. And that world depends on smartphones. Instead of banning and vilifying phones, schools need to teach kids how to responsibly use their phones and develop their intrinsic motivation to monitor their use.</p>

<p><b>@01:57 Betsy Harrington: </b>To allow phones in the classroom is like turning a TV on behind the teacher and saying that it's a reflection of the real world and that it's students' choice whether they are distracted by the TV or not. Humans are distractable. We are impacted by our environment. As educators, we need to wake up and stop purposefully hindering our kids' ability to learn in the name of a warped conception of autonomy.</p>
