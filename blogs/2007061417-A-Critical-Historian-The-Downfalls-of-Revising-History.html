          <p>
            Last semester I took a Core course for <a href="http://www.bu.edu/history/homepage.html"> History majors </a> at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</a>. It was called Critical Reading and Writing in History and was determinedly the worst experience of my life. Despite the hardships, I got through the course and learned to read history critically. In other words, don't believe everything you read. We were asked: What makes history legitimate? Shouldn't history be constantly revised? This is where historical revisionism comes in.
<P>
Historical revisionism is defined as a critical reassessment of historical facts, with the idea of rewriting histories with newly discovered information. From this pretty little thought grows the deviant forms of <a href=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/denial.html> Holocaust denials </a>, <a href=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/61/148.html> “Positive” French Colonialist history </a>, and the rewriting of <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=vIsacMkj3uIC&pg=PR15&lpg=PR15&dq=soviet+historical+revisionism&source=web&ots=hh4Qegc7fb&sig=lwvKLPmXK7PhgAxBOvRSJhJ0-Sc#PPP1,M1”> Soviet Russia's “history”</a>. Theoretically, historians should be in a constant process of revising the past. However, revisions on this scale become grossly offensive. 
<p>
In class, we discussed the issue of legitimating Holocaust deniers by giving them a voice.  Should one confront deniers in an attempt to disprove them? Should they be granted freedom of speech? However, the question I have is more about the study of history itself. What makes any kind of history legitimate? Is history only legitimate if it's on your side? Maybe that's what historical revisionism is getting at. Ideally, historical revisionism should be a way at making sure that the victors' history is not completely one sided. However, history has become a source for the negative and often radical forms of “revisionists.”
<p>
We read Deborah Lipstadt's <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Denying-Holocaust-Growing-Assault-Memory/dp/0452272742> Denying the Holocaust </a>, a verbose rant pinpointing the wrongs of various historians in their denial of the Holocaust. One in particular, David Irving, even sued her for libel (because, you know, the reputation of a Holocaust denier, I mean, “historian,” is crucial). Despite Lipstadt's attempt at ridiculing Holocaust deniers, she managed to shine light on the importance of not ignoring pseudo-historians who can often through conspiracy theories and wordy euphemisms, coax readers into believing their case.
<p>
A prime example of historical revisionism in a very negative form is in the publications of Russian History in post-soviet Russia. President Vladimir Putin has been known to discourage liberal history textbooks, such as Igor Dolutskii's National History, 20th Century, which presented facts within a post-soviet mindset. The textbook was replaced by Nikita Zagladin's History of Russia and the World in the 20th Century in 2004. Seeking a more patriotic history textbook, Putin embraced Zagladin's book, which as <a href=http://www.chechentimes.org/en/press/?id=29301> this article</a> explains, overtly omitted dark topics of Russian history such as gulags and the conflict with Chechnya. <a href=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/01/99c4ce8a-a6ae-4ac7-aeee-d276b5a31cad.html> This article </a> further explains this controversy.
<p>
Historical revisionism has also been found in French history with the 2005 <a href=http://www.admi.net/jo/20050224/DEFX0300218L.html> law </a> passed by French parliament that imposed teachers to “acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa.” This statement as part of article 4 of law 2005-158 outraged Algerians who gained independence from the French in 1962. The article implied a blind eye to the horrors of colonialism experienced by North Africans. Due to its typically revisionist negativity, the article was repealed in 2006. 
<p>
Historical revisionism is typically known in the field of Holocaust studies. The most widely known Holocaust revisionist organization is the <a href=http://www.ihr.org/> Institute for Historical Review </a>, known as the largest database dedicated to Holocaust denial in the world. Historians that make part of the <a href=http://www.ihr.org/main/about.shtml> IHR </a> claim that “Detractors of the IHR have often mischaracterized it as a “Holocaust denial” organization. This smear is completely at variance with the facts. The Institute does not “deny the Holocaust.” All the same, the IHR has over the years published detailed books and numerous probing essays that call into question aspects of the orthodox Holocaust extermination story, and highlight specific Holocaust exaggerations and falsehoods.” Their main publication source, <a href=http://www.ihr.org/journal/jhrarticles.shtml> The Journal for Historical Review </a>, has been known to publish pseudo-historical articles disclaiming the existence of gas chambers, a thoroughly researched aspect of the Holocaust which has been proved by historians all across the globe. 
<p>
As a history major, it was difficult to understand the true logic behind these radical revisionists other than political and moral ideologies which were adverse to the norm. However, historical revisionism is in theory a positive branch of history that works to keep tabs on what has been written about our past. Perhaps this should be part of the creed of history and historians rather than a branch that strays into the unwelcome territories of anti-Semitism, and political manipulation.
