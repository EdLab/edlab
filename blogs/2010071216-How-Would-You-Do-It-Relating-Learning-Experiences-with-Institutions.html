          <p>
            One of the new features we are thinking about for the Teaching and Learning Network (see: http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4567) is a system for managing and delivering learning experiences. These can range from a traditional "course" where there are numbered lessons that a cohort of students must go thorugh, to delivering a non-traditional experience (such as collaborative editing/creation of an artifact) that serves a learning purpose. 

A big challenge we face is in identifying the role of academic institutions in such an online environment and we are trying to figure out a stance that is ideal. Ultimately, we want to involve institutions in the learning network because they may help create valuable content (through paid faculty) and may also serve as a filter for identifying high-quality content (especially in esoteric subject areas like particle physics). However, we also don't want to have an environment completely run by institutions - so having restricted, college-specific installations of Moodle or Blackboard may not be ideal. This environment is intended to be a wide open marketplace for learning, with institutions playing an important role in vetting and organizing content, but not necessarily being the only option on the network or being able to restrict all content produced by members of the institution. 

One idea we're considering is an "affiliate relationship". The basic idea is to allow instructors of any learning experience to "affiliate" the experience with some institutions. Affiliation would work like "friend requests" in social networks, but they would be approved by the institution only if it is comfortable with the instructor (eg. it is a faculty member) and the learning experience being offered. 

Do others have ideas on how institutions can be integrated in to an open learning environment? Should we not even worry because you want to ban institutions from all online learning :)? Is the affiliate relationship solution above adequate, or does it have minor/major tweaking needed? If you can suggest specific improvements or a new model to consider, that would be great.
