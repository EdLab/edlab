            <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/10/Ab0_CalCEAAt6Y11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13500" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/10/Ab0_CalCEAAt6Y11-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>I  was reading “the news” on Facebook from “friends” of mine whose  thoughts I “subscribe to” when I encountered an article about a woman  who was fired from her job because a <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/28/how-occupy-wall-street-cost-me-my-job.html">photo of her holding a protest sign </a>on  Occupy Wall Street got leaked on the internet.  We’ve all heard  stories, some threatening, some practical, about managing one’s internet  identity, usually reminding us that future employers (or non-future, as  the case may be) will google your name before an interview, so you  might consider the kinds of searchable items your name brings up.  But  this story has a different angle to it, because it was her protest sign  that cost her her job, not party photos, and because she was  specifically fired for violating the journalistic standards where she  worked (at The Takeaway, a radio news program on NPR).  In other words,  through a media furor instigated by photographers and bloggers, she was  seen as being part of the news her employer usually reports, and  therefore a violation of ethical standards.  But this particular type of  conflict-of-interest can only happen in an internet-news world, one  where ordinary folks are readers and creators of the news  simultaneously, the same world that enables a movement like Occupy Wall  Street to gather steam in the first place.

Here’s  the short history: writer Conor Friedersdorf wrote a piece for <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/10/occupy-wall-streets-greatest-strength-is-neutering-it/246671/">The  Atlantic</a> critiquing Occupy Wall Street. Caitlin Curran, a freelance  web-producer for The Takeaway, found one particular sentence in the  article particularly moving and used the sentence as a slogan in her  protest sign. Actually, she took part of his sentence--the part she  resonated with--and put it on her sign. “Mild-mannered law student” Ben  Furnas took a photo and posted it to his Twitter feed, which then got  picked up by other bloggers: for instance, this post on <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/15/occupywallst-sign-of-the-day-its-wrong.html">boing-boing</a> calling it the sign of the day. Conor Friedersdorf caught wind of it and wrote a new piece about the sign, discussing how the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/10/how-occupy-wall-street-is-like-the-internet/246759/">protests are like the internet</a>:  fast, sprawling, decentralized, but inter-connected.  Curran asked her  employer if they might do a segment on the speed of travel from the  piece to the sign to the blogs, whereupon she was promptly fired for  violating the show’s editorial standards by making herself part of the  news story.  (She wrote a piece about being fired on <a href="http://gawker.com/5854118/how-occupy-wall-street-cost-me-my-job">Gawker</a>, which is the main reason I know about it). As Curran points out, Friedersdorf was later interviewed by <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/10/18/pm-from-blog-post-to-protest-sign-on-occupy-wall-street/">Marketplace</a> about the sentence, the sign, and the weirdness of it all.  My interest  in the story is less about sign and more about the speed of the  internet, the cross pollination of news stories, the fact that reporters  use twitter, and the fact that Facebook is now treating its users as  though we are all personal publishers unto ourselves.  As Friedersdorf’s  interviewer at The Marketplace Kai Ryssdal commented, “It's very, very  whoa.”

It  reminds me of that (extremely old in internet time) story about the  misquoted MLK jr line that floated the internet after Osama Bin Laden  died (revealed as a misquote at <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/05/anatomy-of-a-fake-quotation/238257/">The Atlantic</a>).  The short story there is that a non-famous woman named Jessica Dovey  posted a thoughtful MLK Jr quote about loving one’s enemies, along with  her own thoughts, on Facebook.  In the reposting that ensued, someone stripped the  comment of it’s quotation marks so it looked like a sentence of her own  was part of MLK Jr.’s quote.  Then Penn Jillette of Penn and Teller  posted Dovey’s sentence as an MLK Jr quote, which it was not, to his 1.6  million followers, and the accidental quote went viral. (He later apologized for the accident.) Of course, this  situation is different from the previous because in the misquote case  there were way fewer layers of journalistic cross-pollinating than the  protest sign; it’s more a story of how a journalist uncovered an error  in a viral tweet.  But in both cases a "regular" individual’s statement  made the internet rounds, both examples involve a changed quote  (intentionally or not), and both are instances where journalists  reported the story of a story being made... as a news story.  And so  perhaps Facebook is right to treat us, as users of their software, as  creators of news. We live in a new world where social media platforms,  blogs, and journalism intersect, borrow from one another, and co-mingle.  Are we all really co-creators of the news?  It seems like the answer is  yes.  Should I subscribe to you? Should you subscribe to me?
