          <p>
            In the Nation, the journalist Chris Hayes has <a href="http://www.thenation.com/print/article/168265/why-elites-fail">published an excerpt</a> from his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Elites-America-After-Meritocracy/dp/0307720454/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340115177&sr=8-1&keywords=twilight+of+the+elites">"Twilight of the Elites"</a> that takes a strong stand against the burgeoning test prep industry.  The elite Hunter College High School (which Chris Hayes attended) determines admission by performance on one test usually administered in 6th grade.  Working towards a larger argument about the failures of our "meritocratic" system of elite selection, Hayes claims:

"[T]he problem with my alma mater is that over time, the mechanisms of meritocracy have broken down. In 1995, when I was a student at Hunter, the student body was 12 percent black and 6 percent Hispanic. Not coincidentally, there was no test-prep industry for the Hunter entrance exam. That's no longer the case. Now, so-called cram schools like Elite Academy in Queens can charge thousands of dollars for after-school and weekend courses where sixth graders memorize vocabulary words and learn advanced math. Meanwhile, in the wealthier precincts of Manhattan, parents can hire $90-an-hour private tutors for one-on-one sessions with their children... With the rise of a sophisticated and expensive test-preparation industry, the means of selecting entrants to Hunter has grown less independent of the social and economic hierarchies in New York at large. The pyramid of merit has come to mirror the pyramid of wealth and cultural capital."

My understanding is that the power of these test prep courses to improve your score is above negligible but still fairly minor, which might push against his narrative.   Does anybody have a more well-researched opinion?
