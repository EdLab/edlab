<p>Ask me a question, I can give you an answer, or I can direct to you an app that can help you solve your problem. There seems to be an app for almost everything, and the education sector is no different. However, the developers of <a href="http://21teach.com">21Teach</a> are trying to make the app market a little easier to navigate. The app is a digital catalog of educational apps, ebooks, games, videos, lesson plans, and assessments sorted by grade, subject, type, and rating.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The intuitive interface makes 21Teach easy to use. It is also easy to set your preferences and search. Once you have chosen your app, you are able to see the descriptions, ratings, reviews, and Common Core alignments. The download button takes you directly to the app store. This design makes it simple to capture exactly what educators are looking for, narrowing the library from the millions of apps in traditional app stores.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>In spite of the great intentions surrounding the design, there are a lot of places where 21Teach falls short of expectations. First, the app graphics are simply underwhelming. There is little visual appeal to the pixelated icons and images. When I went to search for apps based on my former teaching position, a fourth grade ESL teacher, I was disappointed to see that there were no apps that met my preferences. It was immediately apparent to me that I was on a crowdsourcing app that had no crowd.</p> 

<p>This lack of a user base seems to be a chronic issue for a lot of education apps. Developers using the crowdsourcing model often make fatal assumptions about incentives and usage rates. Putting an app on the market that requires educators to crowdsource information on it without having the crowd requires incentives for the group to gather. Unfortunately for 21Teach, the crowd is not available and the reviews that are on the app lack both substance and clarity, setting a negative precedent for reviews that follow. In addition, with the Common Core no longer as common as some might think, other standards alignments might be worth adding. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>21Teach has a promising concept, as there is clearly a need for more thorough assessments for education apps. Even the <a href="https://edtechrce.org">U.S. Department of Education</a> has launched an edtech app reviewer for educators. However, when I do my own app analysis and sort between useful and space-taking apps, I have to categorize 21Teach under space-taking.</p>
