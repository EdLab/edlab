<i>Academy of You</i>

Provided by Udemy, Inc., Udemy is a beta website that provides free content creation tools for educators. With over 600 academic courses ranging from computer science to art to chemistry to philosophy, there are course offerings to appeal to the gamut of online learners. 

Provided by leading universities such as Columbia, MIT, and Stanford, a catalog of Udemy courses is available <a href="http://www.udemy.com/courses?refCode=SlFTAgEMAT5eH2IlTFhXDgEQTyUZX0huHVFTFB0HBwVVURF3WlRDYBMeSigCNgw8VFERYxkHGS9eHk5jEw==&utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=email">here</a>. Udemy is a start-up venture located in Palo Alto, CA, headed by co-founder <a href="http://www.udemy.com/user/14/gagan-biyani.html">Gagan Biyani</a>. Biyani grew up in the Silicon Valley and graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Economics. In addition to his work with Udemy, he also writes part-time for TechCrunch's mobile site, MobileCrunch.
 
<b><a href="http://www.udemy.com/">www.udemy.com</a></b>

<b>Price:</b> Activities such as joining the website, browsing for courses and publishing content is offered at no cost to the user. Educators may, at their discretion, determine a fee for their course offerings. Udemy charges a commission on every completed transaction using the website.

<b>Prop points:</b> Udemy is an open platform that enables anyone to teach and learn online by posting videos, presentations, writing blog posts, or hosting live virtual classroom sessions. As an additional offering from Udemy, Udemy Live is a free video conferencing tool built on component architecture that allows users to share videos, display presentations, write on a virtual whiteboard, and chat with participants. Experts in a particular field can easily <a href="http://www.udemy.com/course/create.html?refCode=SlFTAgEMAT5eH2IlTFhXDgEQTyUZX0huHVFTFB0HBwVVURF3WlRDYBMeSigCNgw8VFERYxkHGS9eHk5jEw==&utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=email">create a course</a> and start teaching via Udemy.  As an additional feature, the Udemy course catalog page recommends courses to users based keyword searches and user preferences. 

<b>Drop points:</b> Udemy does not hire, employ, or vet the educators on its website, and specifically disclaims all liability for the interactions involved between the educators and the educators' respective clients. The level of quality control, if any, that Udemy performs with respect to course content, is unclear. In addition, while it is free to join the website, browse for courses and publish content; educators may determine a fee for a course and charge the user for course subscription. From a technical standpoint, Udemy uses an internal API so third party developers can build components in conjunction with  Udemy's virtual conferencing tool, however the API is not currently public.
 
<b>Final score:</b> Self-described as "a marketplace of educators, students, parents, schools and other interested organizations," the Udemy website provides an outlet to formal and informal teachers to create content and share ideas in a collaborative manner.

<b>Recommended uses:</b> Udemy has many formidable uses, both in and out of the classroom. From the educators' perspective, Udemy could be utilized to supplement formal course offerings, provide no or low-cost prerequisites for advanced-level coursework, and act as prescreening tool for in-demand courses with limited enrollment space. From the students' perspective, Udemy can provide general primers for advanced-level coursework and electives, as well as a cost-conscious alternative to formal coursework.
