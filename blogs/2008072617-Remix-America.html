            This came down the pike on the AoIR research email list quite some time ago... I kept meaning to post it here, but haven't had time. Maybe AfterEd should participate in this!

The email read:

<blockquote>Dear fellow nurds,

We at RemixAmerica.org are beta launching a rockin new site that is
the new home for remixers and video remixes. As a non-partisan, non-
profit project of Declare Yourself, our goal is to push the limits of
this digital medium and highlight the best video remixes and mashups.
Not only can you use our software to easily create your own remixes!
BUT you can join the global conversation using your webcam to "talk
back."

Unlike other video hubs, our focus is on YOUR ability to speak freely
though the interconnected digital medium we call the Internet. Since
we launched a few weeks ago, we've been documenting the best political
remixes and profiling the most interesting remixers on the web. Check
out our blog at < http://blog.remixamerica.org >

Through our ?American Playlist,? we make it easy for you to combine
today?s political debate with America's great ideas and historical
speeches -- everything from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to Kennedy's
Inaugural, to Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have a Dream," to the latest
speeches from John McCain and Barack Obama -- we give you the power to
remix America's greatest moments. Check out our blog for highlights, http://blog.remixamerica.org<!--break-->

If you are a remixer, we want to feature your work. If you are a
citizen journalist, vlogger, cultural producer, community organizer,
activist, volunteer, campaign worker, etc... We want to hear your
voice and see your thoughts. Upload to http://RemixAmerica.org today,
and we promise you an informed and engaged community.

Also, we have noticed that there is no global discussion list for
remixers. SO we have set up a google group at < http://groups.google.com/group/videoremix
 >. We hope that you join the mix and help us develop a global
network of creators.

In short, we are ready to see your creativity. If you think we need to
change ANYTHING, please email me < noel@remixamerica.org > and I will
make sure your questions, comments, complaints, or problems are
addressed.

We look forward to seeing you and we really look forward to your
comments.
