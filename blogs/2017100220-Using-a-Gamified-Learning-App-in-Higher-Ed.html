<p>As the demand for personalized learning grows in higher education, there is an increasing need for out-of-class learning opportunities to help keep students engaged in course materials. One solution to this problem could be the use of a gamified mobile app created from specific course content for students to use on their own time.</p>
 
<p>Researchers developed such an app and examined how it affected university student performance over the course of one semester. They completed the study in multiple first-year accounting and science classes at an Australian university, giving students the choice to opt into the mobile app experience. Out of 711 total students, 394 used the mobile app. Before the term began, the researchers worked with each lecturer to ensure they were able to create questions for the app relevant to the subject material.</p>
 
<p>Every day, the app would send students a push notification directly to their phones, reminding them to answer a quiz question related to the subject material. There was one question given each day that expired at midnight. The app also contained a leaderboard where students could see how their performance compared to others in the class, and it gave participants digital badges for completing various learning tasks, such as answering five consecutive questions correctly.</p>
 
<p>At the end of the semester, the researchers compared retention rates and academic performance between students who used the app and those who didnâ€™t. They found a significant improvement in retention rates after implanting the app: a whopping 12% more students stuck out the term. In addition, students who used the app had an average final class score 7% higher than their non-app peers.</p>
 
<p>Based on these results, the researchers think that a gamified app could be a great learning tool for higher education. Not only did it improve retention rates among first-year students; it also enhanced their academic performance. Moreover, it provided students with a personalized learning opportunity that gave them a greater sense of control over their education.</p>
