<p>The fear that their children's lives could be "ruined forever" by poor decisions made on social media is one that plagues many parents today. Since digital literacy is a topic that is new both to adolescents and many parents, knowing how to navigate privacy, reliable sources, safety, and relationships online can be overwhelming, and can result in many parents depriving their kids of the valuable learning opportunities social media can provide.</p>

<p>Author and counselor Ana Homayoun aims to help parents understand what moves they might make to protect their children and open up opportunities for them to benefit from these platforms. Featured in The Atlantic’s series of videos, Home School, she explains how parents can teach their kids to be more intentional about how they spend time online to ensure their decisions are in line with their values.</p>

<p>What role do you think social media should play in students’ lives and education? How, practically speaking, can parents teach their kids to be empowered by "opting in and out of experiences" like this video suggests?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:37 Christine Odenath: </b>I like the idea of being intentional with our online time... Too often I find myself mindlessly browsing sites or apps, only to remember I opened my phone or computer to do some specific task that still hasn't been accomplished.</p>

<p><b>@01:28 Toland Lawrence: </b>I agree with this approach. It's so easy to demonize social media and simply bar your kids from using it. But this is a critical part of their reality, and they will use it whether or not they have parental permission. The better way is to help kids be more mindful of what they are doing online and how it affects themselves and others.</p>

<p><b>@02:47 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>To be able to opt in or out of experiences, kids first need to reflect on and define their personal values. Social media can be a catalyst for conversations between parents and children about what is important to them.</p>
