<a href="http://www.haikulearning.com/">Haiku Learning Management System</a> is a new cloud-based platform of learning management tools that allows educators to "embed the web" for enriched online learning in the classroom, as well as manage all aspects of the student experience from grading to <a href="http://www.haikulearning.com/">annotating DropBox files</a>.  School districts can sign-up for a membership as a group or their are free accounts available for teachers to pilot the program in their classrooms (with limited features and storage).  New to the mix is an easy import system for institutions who want to switch-over from <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>.    

The full feature-set is extensive and can be found <a href="http://www.haikulearning.com/features/all">here</a> what stands-out for me is that this system seems to meet modern learners and teachers closer to where they actually live on the web & using tools that communicate in a similar way.  For example, DropBox integration & annotation for homework assignments is a stand-out feature.  Additionally, wiki collaborative project spaces, e portfolios and Google App integration seem to really be LMS game-changers.  

<b>Pros:</b>  
The feature list seems extensive with an emphasis on open-source tools and seamless integration with existent platforms teachers spend time on.  Upon first signing-up you are taken on a guided tour of features.  One in particular that stood-out is the ability to make classes "active" or put them in "storage" allowing educators to prepare classes for the future that are then made active later.  Also, the ability to create & save templates seems like a major time-save when setting-up future classes.  The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/haiku-lms/">Google Forum</a> provides an effective way for teachers to connect and share tips re: the platform.  A fun bonus of the system, & in addition to being extremely easy to use, teachers can choose "skins" to customize the look & feel of their class portals, this level of customization feels very fresh & modern.  Finally, the "Embed the Web" interface is extremely easy to use to embed web-based content in your lessons... as a bous, it was one of the fastest upload times I have ever experienced!  Overall, the "zen" simplicity and intuitive design really shine, somehow the platform manages to offer more with a less-steep learning curve. 

<b>Cons:</b>
The whole system has many slick bells & whistles, features and enhancements that may actually overwhelm and even turn-off a more traditionally focused teacher who is not web/ed tech savvy.  However, as digital literacy and professional development converge these instructors will move into the minority (for more on this digital divide check-out this article).  So far, this is my only concern/complaint as I test continue to test the system. 

<b>EdLab Relevance & Takeaways:</b>:
As we think about future LMS and course management tools it is important to take the Haiku Learning lesson to heart, offer more with less barriers to user entry & adoption through a simplified, intuitive interface.  Design matters, even in the classroom, and this is more evident than ever when you compare the Haiku Learning experience to other existent platforms like Moodle or <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard</a>.
