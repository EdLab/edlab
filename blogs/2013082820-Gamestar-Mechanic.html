<p>
<a href="http://gamestarmechanic.com/">Gamestar Mechanic</a> is a platform that provides a framework for <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/537 ">creating online games</a>. It also allows users to publish their games and share them with other users. Gamestar Mechanic has an active community of game designers who provide reviews and feedback on ways to improve each game. When users first sign up for the site they have the option of playing through five game quests. Playing through these initial games unlocks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)">sprites</a> that users can employ when they create their games. The site also provides lesson samples for teachers to integrate in their curriculums. Gamestar Mechanic teaches users 21st century skills, systems thinking, and creative problem solving.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The platform encourages users to flex their creative muscles and create their own games while learning useful skills for modern jobs including design, collaboration, and programming logic. The process of creating games uses basic programming logic which makes the platform a stepping stone to more advanced development. Gamestar Mechanic includes a few resources for teachers interested in using <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/703 ">game-based learning</a> in their classrooms.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>When users first sign up for the platform, they have a limited supply of tools to customize their games. To unlock more tools and sprites for customization, users need to play through the games in each quest. This step helps familiarize new users with the types of games they can create on the platform and gives users ideas and inspirations for creating their own games.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Gamestar Mechanics is a learning platform that teaches users skills like design, collaboration, and programming for 21st century jobs and <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/8798 ">STEM careers</a>. Building games requires students to think systematically and solve problems during game creation. These skills are similar to the way programmers write code. The platform could serve as a prerequisite for young students who might develop an interest in programming. Students who want to learn more about programming to create games can move on to more sophisticated game development platforms like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/868">Scratch</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Gamestar Mechanic lets you play and create 2-D games.</p>
