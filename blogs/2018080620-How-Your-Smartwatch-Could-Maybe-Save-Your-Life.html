<p>With the growing popularity of smartwatches and other wearable technology, the interest in monitoring the health of those who wear them has increased greatly. What if an Apple Watch could detect medical conditions in a wearer and prevent lethal emergencies from occurring? In order to explore this possibility, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a study that analyzed data from thousands of individuals wearing smartwatches to test the validity of these devices in detecting atrial fibrillation.</p>
 
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition in which the beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, with blood not flowing as well as it should. AF affects up to 34 million people worldwide, is often asymptomatic, and is a leading cause of stroke. Therefore, researchers felt that it would be a particularly important condition to study.</p> 

<p>In order to train a deep neural network to detect atrial fibrillation, researchers collected daily step counts and heart rates of nearly 10,000 participants over the course of a year through the publicly available Cardiogram app on Apple Watches. If participants were in standby mode, heart rates were obtained every five minutes, but if they were in workout mode, heart rates were recorded continuously as 5-second averages. To validate the neural network, patients with AF were given an Apple Watch and monitored for at least 20 minutes in workout mode to see if the network could correctly diagnose their condition.</p>

<p>After collecting 139 million heart rate measurements, researchers determined the mobile app using the deep neural network they trained could detect AF with 97% accuracy. While the accuracy of self-diagnosis by those simply wearing the Apple Watch and following their heart rate was less accurate, at 72%, these findings still show that commercial smartwatches can play a huge role in detecting and potentially monitoring medical conditions. Beyond atrial fibrillation, this method could help us learn more about conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. The ability to gather critical real-time data in a non-invasive way could have huge repercussions for how we treat and diagnose medical conditions.</p>
