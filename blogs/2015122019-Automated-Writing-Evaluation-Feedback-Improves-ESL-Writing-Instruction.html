<p>Improving writing has been an ongoing concern for educators ever since the inception of formal schooling. New teachers normally read and write with such a high degree of proficiency that assisting young students who lack this fluency can be difficult to address in a formal classroom setting. Fortunately, technology is starting to play a role in addressing this gap. Massive developments in machine-enabled language processing as well as advanced statistical methods have opened up a rapidly developing world where we can quickly provide feedback on both writing content and written language in an effective manner. More specifically, automated writing evaluation systems (AWE) give feedback on language and content, as well as provide automated scores. A recent study adopted a mixed-methods approach to investigate how one of these systems—the Criterion AWE system—affected writing instruction and performance. </p>

<p>Researching technology-assisted literacy is important because research has been inconclusive regarding the value of AWE systems in instruction and assessment. This study focused on a number of key issues regarding Criterion’s corrective feedback feature. It centered on instructor use of this feedback, student views, as well as its impact on student writing practices. The study was conducted in a major midwestern U.S. university, involving two academic ESL writing courses that lasted 15 weeks. Half of the 141 eligible students decided to participate. </p>

<p>This study revealed that Criterion increased revisions and that its corrective feedback improved writer accuracy from rough to final drafts. Instructors confirmed Criterion's potential benefits through formal interviews; however, student opinions were more mixed. On a similar note, student response patterns seemed to be connected to their instructor’s views. The Criterion AWE seemed to encourage student engagement in writing, but additional factors may have also been influential, such as setting a minimum prerequisite score for submission. Finally, English as a Second Language (ESL) students found the corrective feedback useful in terms of improving their linguistic accuracy. </p>
 
<p>With an increasing influx of foreign language students in the U.S., they may overwhelm regular instructors who have limited training and lack the ability to meet their needs. As such, AWE systems could prove instrumental in addressing this learning gap. On a related note, due to the rapid development of language processing technologies, AWE systems could start playing an increasingly important role in writing instruction and learning at all levels. </p>
