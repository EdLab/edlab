          <p>
            I came across this funny (if somewhat cynical) <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/8443/1/ba90001a.pdf">argument that universities today are a “thinly disguised feudal society as existed in Europe during the 11th or 12th century” (Houck, 1991, p. 1)</a>.  In his argument, Houck assigns University employee roles into feudal roles (barons, squires, peasants, knights and the king).  Most troubling of all, he places the undergraduates into the role of “the flocks and herds which graze on the common pastures of the kingdom” (p. 8).  

Is this a fair argument?  It is certainly a bit overblown, and the argument is part-jest and part-seriousness no doubt, but I do often hear people using metaphors to describe their experience that share commonalities with the feudal argument.  For example, in yesterday's discussion of TC 101, a member of my discussion group remarked that during the orientation experience, the new cohort of incoming students “were herded around like cattle and yelled at.”  This isn't what he or she expected of graduate study.  However, using the feudalistic metaphor, and considering that TC is a graduate-only institution, being treated like cattle isn't unusual but rather what is to be expected if we are to use this metaphor.  Similarly, the different rites of passage, such as the presidential inauguration, were in half-jest and half-seriousness referred to by some individuals as the “coronation” rather than the “inauguration.”  It would seem that on occasion people use this metaphor to apprehend their experiences within university environments.  

However, it seems that pressures from the outside world (government and business) are starting to put pressure on the system from changing.  <a href="http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i43/43b00601.htm">An article in the Chronicle of Higher Education</a> discusses how the protection of students (think Kent State and Virginia Tech) are forcing higher education institutions to place more emphasis on the protection of students. The author notes that higher education “frequently operates in ways reminiscent of its feudal past: Our institutions were designed to preserve and protect knowledge, not students.”  This would seem to be a very simple and basic protection from physical harm or injury.  However, what will force higher education to provide more subtle protections, such as the experience of humiliation from being treated like cattle?  It would seem to me that as citizens continue to allocate more substantial portions of their income to education, and as financial pressures continue to grow, they are going to necessarily demand far greater protection beyond fear of personal injury.
