<b>Igniting the passion of "Girl Geeks"</b><br>
Started by a self-proclaimed, "Girl Geek,"<a href="http://igniteherny.com/"> IGNITEHer </a>(formerly Venus Meets Isis) is a NYC-based mentorship program focused on empowering young women through media and technology.   Comprised of summer workshops, mentorship, internship and networking opportunities, the program hopes to not only inspire young women to pursue STEM careers, but also to feel that the field, which is overwhelmingly male-dominant, is in fact a viable option.  For example, over the summer of 2013 the program hosted a four week series of sequential, in-person courses in lower Manhattan.  This four week program included a curriculum grounded in web/app development, digital marketing, and data science.  The programâ€™s founder, Tiffany Crawford, describes the curriculum as follows, "The curriculum is entrepreneurial, teaching practical and applicable skills coupled with theory and personal development. The exercises and assignments integrate media and tech in a way that feeds the creativity and passion of today's teens in a results-oriented manner."  
<p>
Graduates are expected to not only leave the program with a basic level of programming, web app development and data analysis, but also with a network of peers and mentors on which they can rely to gain further inspiration and career opportunities.  Young women who complete the program will also be exposed to the field of "community engagement" and develop their own media site and digital portfolio to showcase their learning from the program.  A 2012 participant had the following to say about her experience with IGNITEHer, "What's great about this program is that it doesn't end when your 'classes' end in the summer. You create lifelong friendships and you gain experience that you wouldn't get anywhere else."  
<p>

<b>Founder as Mentor</b><br>
IGNITEHer was started by Crawford, with the guiding vision of providing young women with inspiring mentors and woman-friendly tech-focused instruction. Crawford, who holds an MS in Electrical Engineering from UC Berkeley and a BS from Howard University, has proven herself to be an ideal example for young women who might excel in STEM subjects, but lack the role models necessary to inspire further study and illustrate the career opportunities in these often male-dominant fields.  The White House recently launched programs to support their <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/educate-innovate">Educate to Innovate campaign</a> and provide additional funding to STEM training programs for young girls.  IGNITEHer aims to advance this mission and agenda in the NYC area.  Similar programs exist (see <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/653">this NL Sector article on Hackbright Academy</a>), but IGNITEHer stands out with their approach to "mentor matching" and ensuring that participants have long-term contact with their mentors and a lifetime of connections through the digital IGNITEHer community network.
