Increasingly, employers find diplomas are not good enough indicators of readiness for productive work, and many college graduates are frustrated with the few opportunities they allow them to access.  Some propose<a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1301"> post-college exams</a> as a remedy, while others would like to see new approaches or additions to the existing credential system. The online open badge movement aims to unlock new possibilities for learners.<p>

A badge is a symbol that represents one's skill, achievement, or interest. As learning now happens anywhere anytime, a flexible system that documents and demonstrates skills, capacities, and knowledge has become more important. Although badges are popular in gaming and online communities, they have not been widely applied to learning environments. What infrastructure is needed to make them work and what are some challenges? This video provides a concise overview of the advantages of badges for education and potential career connections, current infrastructure development, and new directions for the development of badges for learning. <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12690"> Join the discussion on Vialogues</a> and share your thoughts on using badges for the future of education.<p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:31 Carla:</b> Yeah, I think the badge-issuing institutions would get a lot of scrutiny. I don't think just anyone could hand them out; they would need to come from a reputable, respected source. <p>

<b>@02:04 johnlee: </b>  "(online) badges give everyone recognitions for the learning that happens anywhere and share them in places that matter"<p>

<b>@03:36 johnlee:</b> These all sound great. One question I have, though, is that when you get many badges, how do you organize them in a manner that makes the representation effective and efficient? <p>
