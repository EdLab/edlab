            As the study of the motivations behind historical events, <a href=http://webster.com/dictionary/psychohistory> psychohistory </a> has become a widely debated branch of history. Often, it is simply portrayed as a branch of psychology; and that, since it is largely based on analyses in psychotherapy, it is basically psychology applied upon monumental historical figures and events. Psychohistorians believe that historical personalities are produced by the effects of childbirth, parenting practice, and abuse. They assert that historical social behavior is primarily shaped by effects in childhood formation and experiences rather than the rational, fact-oriented explanations given by other historians (on a very large tangent read Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's <i> <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Mother-Nature-Maternal-Instincts-Species/dp/0345408934> Mother Nature </a> </i>for interesting insight into the effects of different child rearing styles on human behavioral patterns). In this manner, psychohistorians are often discredited in the field of history (those obsessively fact-prone grounds of academia).
<p>
The most studied area of psychohistory is psychobiography, that is to say, the research of the significance of particular historical figures through the study of their psychological development in childhood and society. This field is most widely known for the study of tragic or feared individuals in history such as Adolph Hitler, Abraham Lincoln, and Richard Nixon. The focus of psychobiography and psychohistory is mainly on the history of childhood and its effect on the developmental characteristics of an individual. It is then in adulthood that said individual affects historical social behaviors and events (such as Hitler and World War II, not that he was solely responsible, of course). 
<p>
The ideologue behind psychohistory is Lloyd deMause, an American social thinker who developed the idea of psychohistory in 1974. As a Columbia University alumnus, deMause's psychoanalytical research led to his theories and to the groundwork of the <i> <a href=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/01_journal.html> Journal of Psychohistory </a> </i>. In publishing his book <i> <a href=http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/contents.htm>Foundations of Psychohistory</a> </i>, he states that unlike other branches of the social sciences, the “method of psychohistory is to establish causes of motivational patterns in prior personal events and their restructuring within the adult group.” deMause lists psychogenic modes (types of mentality that result from childhood) in the following categories: Infanticidal, Abandoning, Ambivalent, Intrusive, Socializing and Helping. Most of these categories have been related to severe psychiatric disorders that inevitably affect adulthood. 
<p>
The validity of psychohistory as a historical field is difficult to affirm. With abundant psychological methods and resources, psychohistory seems to be a simple psychological analysis of historical figures. Since events are often brought about (if not completely caused) by individuals or groups of individuals, then history is indeed the history of individuals, of man (or woman). In any case, concrete historical methodologies incorporate extensive psychoanalysis when it comes to the history of individuals (like Hitler, boy did HE have a messed up childhood). Therefore, the separate field of psychohistory seems redundant. The field is so minute that even a <a href=http://www.google.com/search?q=psychohistory&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a> Google search </a> of “psychohistory” will yield very little substantial result. Nevertheless, the field is extremely interesting and perhaps its expansion may give insight to the repetitive patterns in human history.
