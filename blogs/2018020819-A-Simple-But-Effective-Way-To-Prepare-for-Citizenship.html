<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/us-citizenship-2018-test-audio/id1103037173?mt=8">US Citizenship 2018 Test Audio</a> is a free app for individuals who would like to study for their USCIS Civics Test, a prerequisite to becoming a U.S. citizen. The app includes audio for the 100 questions and answers on the current test, covering U.S. government, politics, culture, history, and geography.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I appreciated the way in which this app could be used as a helpful tool at all stages of test preparation. For beginners, the "view all questions" section allows you to search through the 100 possibilities you could be faced with on test day and all accepted answers. For those who already have a general understanding of the content, the multiple choice "practice test" section can help assess your knowledge level. The ability to adjust the number of questions asked and view statistics on your overall performance is also very helpful. Finally, the "flashcards" section allows users to try their hand at short-response questions when they’re feeling confident.</p>

<p>One of the tool's main marketing features is that unlike other citizenship test prep apps, it allows you to select your state and answer questions about local representatives as well. I found this to be a nice touch, as it personalizes the test and encourages future citizens to be active members in their local political scene.</p>

<p>I also believe it is important to stress how effective the audio is on this app. For any non-native English speaker utilizing US Citizenship 2018 Test Audio, having the questions read clearly and at a moderate speed is extremely helpful, and this is something the app does quite well.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>My biggest complaint is that the ads are extremely obnoxious. This is the price one pays for a free app, however, and ads can be eliminated with an in-app payment of $2.99. If you plan to utilize this app for an extended period of time, I would suggest making this payment so as to avoid distraction and increase productivity.</p>

<p>This clearly isn’t a high-production app. While its basic design and format doesn’t have a negative impact on the app’s purpose, it does mean that US Citizenship 2018 Test Audio might not attract or keep as many users as it could.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>US Citizenship 2018 Test Audio is a very simple, but effective app. There’s nothing flashy about it, but it achieves its singular purpose of providing effective test prep for the USCIS Citizenship exam, and therefore deserves a solid recommendation. </p>
