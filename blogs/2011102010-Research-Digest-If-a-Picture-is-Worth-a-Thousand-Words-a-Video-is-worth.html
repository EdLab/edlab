            <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/wu1400v51p3k2u54/fulltext.pdf">Yadav, L. et al (2011), If a picture is worth a thousand words is video worth a million? Differences in affective and cognitive processing of video and text cases. Journal of Computing in Higher Education, 23: 15-37.</a>

Given the ever-changing nature of educational media, I figured it was time to channel my inner David Hume in determining the efficacy of video in educational settings.

<b>Description:</b>
The researchers in this study measured the abilities of thirty undergraduate students to recall and engage with a set of cases of people diagnosed with HIV or AIDS. The content was held virtually constant between three mediums: video, video + text, and text. Minor adjustments were made in the translation of video content into text-only content (e.g. removing 'um's and 'like's). All of the students engaged in each of the three formats, with the order in which the students engaged with the material randomly assigned. The students were also trained to give their feedback and reactions when they were reading or watching the video. Using ANOVA and factor analysis, the researchers came to the conclusion that video and video+text led to greater engagement and recollection than did text only. The researchers posit that this is probably due to the ability for video to better reach students on an emotional level.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> While hardly the most elegant study, the study does result in findings that are still important and worth noting. As we continue to reach out to schools, individual teachers, and producers of video content, we can be more confident in our belief that Vialogues has the power to improve education. The power of video in the educational setting should be emphasized, especially given the surge in video content made available for public use.
