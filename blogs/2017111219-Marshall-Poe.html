Marshall Poe is the founder and editor of the <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com">New Books Network</a>, a consortium of 81 subject-specific, author-interview podcasts. He has taught at Harvard University, the University of Iowa, and currently teaches at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He also served as an editor and writer at The Atlantic. Poe is the author of several books, including the forthcoming title How to read a history book. He received his BA from Grinnell College and his Ph.D. from UC, Berkeley. </p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at New Books Network?</b><br>
<p>I went to a liberal arts school, Grinnell College, and drank the Kool-Aid; to wit, I was taught and continue to believe that open, informed dialogue about import issues can make us all better. I'm a big fan of John Stuart Mill. He said (and I paraphrase) that we've got to get all the ideas out and deliberate about them in a friendly way if we want to find the way forward. I went to grad school with this in mind and discovered that professing (as in, "what professors do") was really more about producing narrow (though very good) research than "open, informed dialogue about important issues." Nothing wrong with that, really, but after being a professor and doing that research for about 20 years I knew it was no longer for me. The information in the books I wrote and my colleagues wrote was just not reaching the public; it was "trapped" paradoxically in books. So I went to work for The Atlantic Monthly hoping that it might serve as a bridge between serious research and the public. And it did, in a way. But still, The Atlantic is a magazine, and magazines are print. The fact of the matter is people don't really like to read very much. They like to watch and listen. So I turned to watching and especially to listening as a means of "translating" serious research into a form people would find convenient.</p>
 
<p><b>What inspired you to start New Books Network?</b><br>
<p>As I said, it was really the realization that people don't like to read very much. Late in my academic career, I wrote an academic history of communications. One of its basic findings was that people have a very strong preference for watching/listening over reading. After all, we have inborn watching and listening organs eyes and ears; we have no reading organs. So, I reasoned, if I was going to get people to pay attention to serious research, I had find a way to appeal to their natural predilections for watching and listening. I experimented with video, but the trouble with it is that it, like reading, takes up all of your attention; you can't drive to work and watch a video, at least not without killing yourself. So it came down to audio. Podcasting had just become a "thing," so I taught myself how to do it. I launched "New Books in History" in 2008 and ran it for three years. I then used the "New Books" model to create the New Books Network in 2011.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think audio and video are becoming the way most people are introduced to subjects. When I want to learn something, especially of the "how-to" variety, I instantly look for an instructional video. I taught myself to play pretty effectively with computers in this way. If it's something more esoteric, and not of the "how-to" variety, I usually look at the Wikipedia entry and then try to find a podcast by some expert. Now, all this is just an introduction. Eventually, you're going to find your way into a class with a live person, though that person may have designed a really good online course that you are going to watch. But as an introduction, it's hard to beat *free* video and audio produced by people who generally know what they are talking about.</p>
 
<p><b>In addition to New Books Network, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>I still write the occasional article and book. I have a book coming out in January, 2017 called How to read a history book. I also wrote a narrative history of the My Lai Massacre, scheduled to be out March, 2017.</p>
