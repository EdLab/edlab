<p><b>Title:</b> When Is Practice Testing Most Effective for Improving the Durability and Efficiency of Student Learning? (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Katherine A. Rawson & John Dunlosky</p>
<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Testing is commonly used to evaluate student progress at the end of a lesson, but the feedback students receive from testing is valuable and often underused in learning. <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-012-9203-1">When Is Practice Testing Most Effective for Improving the Durability and Efficiency of Student Learning?</a> seeks to reinforce the idea that the retrieval and feedback from practice testing is an effective strategy for learning. This study assessed practice testing as a means for improving retention and efficiency throughout a lesson, and the findings suggest that testing is too valuable to be left until the last day.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The literature review showed that engaging in multiple testing and re-learning sessions was beneficial for both short-term and long-term retention in learning. The authors found that combining practice tests with repetition of the material was typically more effective than either testing or repetition alone. Test questions that required the retrieval of information from long-term memory, like short answer or essay, were more effective than recognition-based multiple choice questions. The authors also found that tests spread over time with longer intervals between each test were much more effective than tests in quick succession.</p>

<p>The combination of testing and re-learning also made students more efficient learners. The authors found that the time it took for students to re-learn the information decreased with every repetition, even when a large amount of time had passed since the initial learning. Students became more efficient each time they re-learned forgotten information. The authors conducted a survey of student attitudes towards re-learning and found that because the process was so quick and felt easy, it was unlikely to produce boredom, fatigue, or frustration. The study concluded that teachers and students should more regularly put practice testing to work in the classroom and in self-regulated learning.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This paper presented practice testing as a strategy for learning and presented ideal conditions for success. The idea of assessment and re-learning is deeply tied to the development of adaptive learning strategies. Developing a formula to maximize the use of re-study and minimize time spent might reveal that student time spent re-learning is a good investment toward efficiency and re-acquisition of information. Individualized online learning will present more opportunities to administer tests and encourage re-learning at ideal points for each learner. Testing is more than simply a strategy for assessment and in combination with feedback, it can be an effective strategy for learning.</p>
