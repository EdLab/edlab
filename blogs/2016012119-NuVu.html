<p><i>"NuVu is a full-time innovation school for middle and high school students. NuVuâ€™s pedagogy is based on the architectural Studio model and geared around multi-disciplinary, collaborative projects. We teach students how to navigate the messiness of the creative process, from inception to completion."</i> (<a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/about/">About NuVu</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Studio Model</b></p>

<p>Learning models like design-based and project-based learning have recently grown in popularity at plenty of schools across the U.S., and <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/">NuVu</a> is one organization that has entered the scene with this type of pedagogy to engage middle and high schoolers. Based out of Cambridge, Massachusetts, NuVu was founded by an MIT alumnus who did his doctoral research on creativity and how it relates to learning. Students have the option of enrolling for a trimester, semester, or full year through NuVu or a partner school. Students are in groups of ten and matched with a coach in the NuVu studio, and together, they work through what NuVu calls an <i>iterative process</i> to develop a project-based solution to a real-world problem, such as global warming.</p>

<p><b>Engaging in Projects</b></p>
 
<p>When enrolling, students are asked to register for a studio centered around a specific topic like <i>Science Fiction</i> or <i>Smarter Planet</i> and for the duration for the program, they will work with their coach to come up with various solutions. At the end of the term, they are evaluated on the portfolio they developed during their studio time.</p>
 
<p>The types of products and concepts that have been developed through NuVu vary greatly, and can focus on anything from medical devices to robotics to furniture. Projects that have been created in the past include wheelchairs engineered to feature storage space, kinetic clocks, and reimagined high heels. The diversity of available studio topics allows students to pursue their own particular interests.</p>
