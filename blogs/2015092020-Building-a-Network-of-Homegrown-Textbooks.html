<p>A school in Italy is making sure that everyone is a part of the educational content creation process. Forgoing the usual system of purchasing textbooks from big publishing companies and curriculum through mass-produced networks, ITIS Majorana di Brindisi invests its money in developing and printing its own textbooks. Its national network of teachers works together to create teaching content amidst evolving curricula and lessons in schools across the country.</p>

<p>But it’s not just this textbook creation process that makes ITIS Majorana di Brindisi unique. The school also provides an array of technology options to its students so that they can create interactive and multimedia books in class. The classrooms are set up with wheeled chairs that students use to circulate around the room so that they can shuffle their groups around with ease.</p>

<p>ITIS Majorana di Brindisi emphasizes the rejection of a traditional curriculum model in favor of one that allows students and teachers to produce their own books, individualize their learning, and keep the curriculum from becoming stagnant through their "Book in Progress" program. Chime in with your take on these "homegrown textbooks" <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23415/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:01 Oumar:</b>@melAlL8 For students that are able to follow directions, moving around in a fast pace can help them stay focus and keep up with the ongoing in the classroom. However, this becomes a distraction when everyone starts bumping into each other in the process of switching tables groups.</p>

<p><b>@01:27 Kafou:</b> It’s a good idea that the contents of the book is produced by the teachers and students. Instead of focusing on contents that were created years ago, this program allows student experience something unique by creating their own book other rather focusing on historical facts.</p>

<p><b>@03:16 abagigah92:</b> I like how these schools are creating their own curriculum that they think will fit their students. The goal is to get the students educated not to educated them using the same principles and guidelines.</p>
