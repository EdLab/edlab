<p>What do Dell, Starbucks, Muji, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have in common? They all use online crowdsourcing to generate ideas either for goods and services, or to find solutions to societal needs and ecological problems. Crowdsourcing, or the use of online idea calls, invites external knowledge and creative thinking from people outside the company. It also attracts a diverse cohort of ideators who generate large volumes of ideas. But detecting the most promising idea can be tough for the idea-seeker. While literature has explored why some suggestions do better than others, few studies have looked at the online behavior of ideators.</p>
 
<p>This study used data from an online idea call at the municipality of Munich to understand those aspects of ideator behavior that contributed to the successful implementation of a proposed idea. The initiative ran on the non-profit platform adhocracy.de, where citizens were invited to suggest new or improved digital services for Munich residents. Participants (or ideators) could register with a fictitious user name and access ideas, read comments, and monitor positive or negative voting on ideas over a three-month period.</p>
 
<p>Researchers controlled for individual technical knowledge, the point in time individual participation was initiated, and the volume of ideas per participant, as more ideas lead to a greater chance of implementation. Then they tested the final dataset (72 ideators suggested 128 ideas, voted 859 times, and wrote 307 comments on other ideators' ideas) against two general hypotheses around ideator motivation and curiosity.</p>

<p>The findings suggested that ideators who were likely to come up with a useful or novel idea shared common characteristics including paying positive attention to other ideas, stating needs, identifying problems, and suggesting solutions. Researchers argue that knowledge of online behaviors has practical and managerial implications for organizations concerned about the fuzzy front end of crowdsourcing innovation, which is highly informal and often produces erratic outcomes.</p>
