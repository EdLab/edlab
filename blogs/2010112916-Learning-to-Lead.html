Leadership gives them a sense that they have something to offer, and that their experiences can be useful and helpful to others. Even the most disruptive, difficult student is showing leadership qualities – it’s just not in the right direction, yet. This book contains 50 activities for building confidence and skills in students for leading themselves, others and their communities. It also includes online resources detailing a plan on 10 workshops incorporating and adapting the activities in the book to fit a mix of learning styles. Incorporating leadership learning into the curriculum in both primary and secondary schools will challenge students to take responsibility for themselves and others, build their self-esteem and improve the lives of others in the school and local community. Incorporating leadership learning into the curriculum in both primary and secondary schools, will challenge students to take responsibility for themselves and others, build their self-esteem and improve the lives of others in the school and local community.  -<em>from <a href="http://www.continuumbooks.com/books/detail.aspx?BookId=136295&amp;SubjectId=940&amp;Subject2Id=1437" target="_blank">Continuum Books</a></em>
