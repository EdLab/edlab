Book review:

"Until we understand the powerful learning, collaborating, and producing that teenagers do with their cell phones, mp3 players, laptops, and the Internet, we won’t understand how we can best utilize those technologies in our classrooms. Whether you’re a digital native new to the classroom or a veteran teacher struggling to learn your students’ Internet lingo, this book is your guide to 21st-century teenagers, literacy, and learning. After 17 years teaching middle school English, I know that I can’t teach literacy today without this book."<em></em>
