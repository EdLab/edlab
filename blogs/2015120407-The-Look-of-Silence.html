            <b>Looking at… <i>The Look of Silence</i></b>
<i>Mesmerizing follow-up to Academy Award-nominated film focuses on the victims of violence</i>

<p>How do we manage our emotions? Teachers constantly struggle with helping students mediate their emotional response to difficult situations, oftentimes of their own doing, the authors of their own misfortune. Whether they are the perpetrators of conflict, or simply the hapless victims, sometimes makes no difference—emotional responses can be difficult to reconcile on either side of a bitter dispute. And in the aftermath of student conflict, how do these young people let go of any toxic emotions so they can move on to some semblance of peace, prosperity, and deliverance?  </p>

<p>The Look of Silence is director Joshua Oppenheimer’s poignant follow-up to his masterwork The Act of Killing, his Oscar-nominated debut. The former film dealt with the perpetrators involved in the massive Communist purge that swept Indonesia during the mid-1960s. In that remarkable documentary, Oppenheimer filmed surreal scenes where killings were reenacted by the murderers years later. These vicious acts were produced in the style of the perpetrator’s favorite movie genre, sometimes even in the exact same locations where they originally occurred. </p>

<p>In The Look of Silence, Oppenheimer shifts his focus to the victims of these crimes, people struggling decades later with profound losses that continue to haunt them, who find it impossible to move on from the nightmares leaving a residue from a different, more difficult, time. Oppenheimer follows an optometrist named Adi Rukun and his quest for resolution—his older brother Ramli was brutally murdered by killing squads. Not only is Adi’s family still reeling from the effects of Ramli’s sadistic death, they continue to live among the murderers. The tension caused by this intimate proximity, where the perpetrators are their neighbors and still hold power, somberly resonates throughout the film, casting a dark, foreboding pall. </p>

<p>Oppenheimer has a deft ability at invoking mood in a measured pace that reflects Indonesian life. He captures the ebbs and flows of North Sumatra—both in the public places where the characters live, but also the private family dynamic within the home. The central characters include Adi as well as his parents. His mother is incredibly tough. She rules the roost, clearly the family’s anchor, her strength providing ballast during the stormy period following Ramli’s death. Her abundant spirit has allowed them to sustain themselves. Adi’s father has literally shriveled away, unable to care for himself, and is nearing the end of his life. He suffers from blindness, deafness, and the onset of dementia. Due to Oppenheimer’s respectful treatment, these stories are not portrayed as pitiful or sad, they are just facts of life. When you reach a certain age, life presents you with a new set of challenges. Coping is what you must do. </p>

<p>The most challenging scenes are arranged meetings between Adi and a litany of elderly men responsible for his brother’s murder, who were involved in various capacities in this senseless act. Even his uncle, a guard at the prison where Ramli was held before being dragged away to his persecution, is taken to task by Adi’s earnest, persistent, and mostly respectful questioning. Adi has a desperate need to make resolution with his past—not only for himself and his parents, but also his young daughter. He wants the long festering bile inflicted by Ramli’s death to drain away from his family’s still open wound. In a question and answer period following a screening of his film, Oppenheimer spoke of his doubt that Adi would attain what he so desperately wanted—a sincere display of regret by the murderers regarding their actions, and an apology for the atrocities they perpetrated. As The Act of Killing so clearly showed, a human’s moral compass can become irreparably broken and lose its innate sense of humanity after committing unforgivable acts like mass murder. In The Look of Silence, this still holds true even when the victim is a young innocent neighbor, and the weak excuse of doing your duty to protect the state against an anonymous evil embodied in someone you know becomes compromised. </p>

<p>Oppenheimer is at his best by resisting painting these murderers as caricatures of evil. Their boasting about killing is the clearest indictment against any claim they may have to be moral agents who once acted unequivocally to protect their beloved motherland. Any normal person with a functioning emotional response mechanism would betray a sense of shame, guilt, or remorse for these heinous actions. For human beings, even the smallest deeds of misbehavior can trigger a sense of embarrassment following the subtlest violation of societal norms. As a couple of murderers state, several members of their mass killing squad climbed trees in crazed states. They had become overwhelmed with the reality of their horrific acts, unable to cope with the tragic aftermath of slaughtering their countrymen. These killers who survived may have evaded death or escaped imprisonment for their actions, but they have essentially trapped themselves within an inescapable purgatory formed by their own unconscionable behavior. </p>

<p>Children have the potential to behave poorly, and as this documentary so clearly demonstrates, young adults certainly can too. There is, at minimum, a karmic cost for misbehavior, the price becoming increasingly dear depending on the egregiousness of the misdeed. You may be able to temporarily fool yourself with boasts of bravado, or make yourself feel better by intimidating survivors, and reasserting your machismo and powers of dominance, but we all must face ourselves in the mirror, either in its literal or metaphorical forms. The horrific act of killing may not be penalized in kind, but as The Look of Silence so clearly portrays, its negative personal impacts endure for survivors like Adi, his family, and the murderers. Mustering the will for forgiveness, achieving acceptance, and asking for an apology, no matter how remote the possibility, may be our only hope for moving on from conflicts that still plague us. </p>
