            “Omg is that Professor _______?! That's so <i><b>weirrdddd</i></b> seeing him in the dining hall! He actually <b>eats</b>!!”

These are some of the comments you hear on campus when you suddenly see your professor walking around in broad daylight, bicycling to class, or doing things like, gasp, <i>eating</i>. It's unfathomable to even imagine your teachers and professors going home to families, personal lives and doing things other than grading papers, issuing assignments, and sitting in their offices scheming how to make your GPA sink just a bit more.

They're human, but they can't possibly be <i>human</i>, can they? 

I took an African Colonialism History class last semester. My professor hailed from Trinidad and Tobago, but could trace her roots to modern day Angola. Even though not directly from Africa herself, she still had connections and ties to it. Personal ties. 

One need only to look at the course title to know that the material we'd be learning would be interesting, but grim, heavy, and depressing. Nonetheless some of the things that transpired in that classroom were unexpected. Though in retrospect, it shouldn't have been that surprising. 

We were discussing the <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War>Boer War</a> in class, and my Professor began to tell of her personal experience. Her grandmother, whose mind had started to wander when my professor was a child, would often touch her face and repeat “BoerWar, BoerWar”, which she didn't understand back then. 

She learned that her grandfather had fought for the British in the Boer War, only later to be denied both recognition and proper reward from the British government. As she recounted this, I noted with growing alarm that not only was she growing misty-eyed, but her chest was heaving with suppressed emotion. When I snuck peeks at my classmates, they too were squirming uncomfortably in their seats, unsure of what to do, what to say, or how to react. 

What <i>do</i> you do? Do you nod and listen? Do you look away and hope that the person before you regains composure? Do you applaud her passion and join in her outrage? Do you lean forward and pat her sympathetically? 

It was not the first, nor the last instance of such raw emotion I witnessed from that particular professor. When touching on subjects that hit too close to home, I learned to anticipate elevated pitch and volume, heaving shoulders and clenched fists, and a cracking, trembling voice. 

I spoke about the awkwardness of it all to my roommate one day, who happened to be taking a Critical Reading and Writing in History course. She told me that her professor, who also taught her History of Germany (1914 to present) class, had actually <b>wept</b> shamelessly in front of her <u>entire lecture</u> on various occasions when speaking of the Holocaust. 

Adults don't cry. Professors do not step off their pedestal as objective instructors to actually reach out on an <i>emotional</i> and deeply intimate level. Especially to the students that have been entrusted to them. 

Were these professors wrong to cry? No. They are completely justified and have every right to feel the way they feel, and express their feelings, so long as it does not intrude upon other people. 

Then why is it so awkward for us as students, to accept their emotions and actually interact and respond back on the same level? 

For starters, in this age of narcissism and skin-deep intimacies, it's startling for people to discover that the everyday, mundane people about them have lives, personalities, secrets, regrets, wishes and desires - <i>just. like. them</i>. 

To admit that the bum on the street or the girl that always sits near you in the dining hall have histories is to admit that they're human. And to admit that they're human would be allying yourself with them and empathizing — and coming too close. Which is frightening. 

Nevertheless, admitting that professors have a wider range of emotions than teaspoons can be healthy. 

Albeit, sometimes (most of the time) it can be depressing, like when professors weep because of personal ties with the subjects they teach. 

Or it can be refreshingly amusing, like the time my friends went to an end of the year celebration banquet for their class and saw their Humanities professor drunkenly mingling with his students and unabashedly hitting on the girls. 

Or just plain creepy, depending on your sense of humor.
