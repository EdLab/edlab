<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/katelyndonnelly">Katelyn Donnelly</a> is a Senior Vice President at Pearson where she leads the <a href="http://www.affordable-learning.com/#sthash.C2e75ish.dpbs">Affordable Learning Fund</a>, a venture fund that invests in early-stage companies serving low-cost schools and services to schools and learners in the developing world.  Katelyn is also an active advisor on Pearson’s global strategy and research and innovation agenda, as well as a consultant to governments on education system transformation and delivery.  She serves as a non-executive director and strategic advisor for several startups across Europe, Asia and Africa.  Additionally, she has co-authored several thought leadership papers on education including "<a href="http://www.newschools.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Nesta_NewSchools_Alive_in_the_Swamp.pdf">Alive in the Swamp: Assessing Digital Innovations in Education</a>", "<a href="http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/10432/an-avalanche-is-coming-higher-education-and-the-revolution-ahead">An Avalanche is Coming: Higher Education and the Revolution Ahead</a>" and "<a href="http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/9543/oceans-of-innovation-the-atlantic-the-pacific-global-leadership-and-the-future-of-education">Oceans of Innovation: the Atlantic, the Pacific, Global Leadership and the Future of Education</a>."  Previously Katelyn was a consultant at McKinsey and Company and graduated with Honors from Duke University with a degree in Political Science and Economics.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>   I studied economics in university with an emphasis on international financial capital markets.  I am deeply interested in how capital markets and investment have the power to catalyze action and shape economies and how entire systems function and what drives them.  This makes me think systemically from the beginning and drives my desire to make research and insight practical and action-oriented.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> Immediately before joining Pearson I lived in Lahore working with the Government of Pakistan to reform its education system.  I was able to truly partner with officials and felt like one of the team working through how to implement a large-scale education reform program. I worked primarily with the central agency, data and monitoring unit and the professional development and teacher-training institute.  This was incredibly valuable experience, as I understood the pressures on government and system leaders from a first person perspective.  I can now see how different political and bureaucratic incentives play out and how even the most well meaning NGO or exciting new innovation can seem like more hassle than it’s worth.  This was incredibly important for me both at the Affordable Learning Fund and when thinking about how digital innovations can create systemic change in outcomes.  There is an important role for the private sector in education, however, the pathways to partnership need be forged with mutual respect and understanding to optimize impact. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I hope to illuminate and catalyze better decision making around what will make the largest learning impact.  Too often we see technology solutions layered clumsily on top of learning and a real lack of embeddedness.  I hope my work can help close the technology-practice gap and help balance emphasis more evenly between tools and implementation.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> In the developing world, I think the trends toward increasing public-private partnership, particularly in the form of vouchers will allow for greater innovation in the direct delivery of schools. 
<p>
I also think we will necessarily see an increase in emphasis on pedagogy and implementation support in digital innovations.  We will need a few failures first but these first attempts will pave the way for a much stronger suite of education technology products to come.
<p>
I also think the "student as consumer" trend will strengthen.  Learners will need to take greater ownership and responsibility over their learning and will have to navigate a suite of options to personalize their own path.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> I’m currently working on a couple of investments for the Affordable Learning Fund in India and South Africa.  I’m also running an incubator for education startups in India.  My next big project is taking the ideas from "Alive in the Swamp" and "An Avalanche is Coming" and putting them into practice.
