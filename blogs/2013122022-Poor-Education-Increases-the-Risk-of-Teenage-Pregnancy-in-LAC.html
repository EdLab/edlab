            LAC is the acronym used for nations in Latin America and the Caribbean. Recent research by the World Bank in regards to LAC notes that the risk of teenage pregnancy is enormous in this region. According to this <a href:"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/12/12/lac-poverty-education-teenage-pregnancy>article</a>, female teenagers in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Ecuador are prone to early motherhood due to "lower educational, economic and job opportunities." Most teenagers in LAC are vulnerable to teenage fertility because they are not enrolled in school. Moreover, teenagers are likely to become pregnant due to peer pressure and lack of negotiating power to convince their partners into using some sort of contraceptive.

According to reports, the way to go about solving this challenge is to reduce inequality and create greater opportunities for females in the LAC regions. Additionally, evidence from the findings of this report suggests that the more hours a teenager spends in class; the less likely she is to become pregnant. In other words, she will not be wandering around in the streets, but in class doing something valuable with her time and life. This case has been one of the toughest challenges facing policymakers and NGOs in the LAC region. Intuitively, one of the best solutions is to put the females in school and present them with opportunities as to eliminate gender inequality.
