<b>Title:</b> Design and Implementation of Intelligent Systems With LEGO Mindstorms for Undergraduate Computer Engineers
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> M. P. Cuéllar & M. C. Pegalajar
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href ="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cae.20541/full">Computer Applications in Engineering Education</a>
<p>
<b>Research Question:</b> How will college students respond to a series of engineering and programming challenges built around the LEGO Mindstorm system?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
The LEGO Mindstorm platform is composed of a processor with a native programming language (along with a few open-source add-ons), a variety of sensors, and modules that can be hooked up to the processor. Its complexity and modularity provide enormous scope for student creativity, making it a useful learning tool.
<p>
This paper describes a college engineering course in which students were tasked with fulfilling certain project goals using the LEGO Mindstorm equipment. By giving students the opportunity to work through programming and engineering challenges with a physical system that responds to their programming changes, engineering students get hands-on experience that may be more instructive than rote memorization and testing. The class was divided into groups of two or three students, and set to work on projects that included designing a robot that can find its way out of a maze, or follow a set track on a race course.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
The authors report that student motivation and engagement was very high, particularly in comparison to past courses. Moreover, grades in the course improved by an average of 20%.  Although no attempt was made to quantify the effectiveness of this learning platform in terms of student knowledge gains, it seems clear that, despite several technical hiccups (difficulties in calibrating the sensors, imprecise motor behavior), the course was successful.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
In an increasingly digital learning world, it’s helpful to remember that physical experimentation can play a useful role in the classroom, particularly for students developing engineering skills. Further investigations both into the effectiveness of this particular tool-set, and alternative products, should help us develop a better understanding of when and how they can be best used.
