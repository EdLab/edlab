<a href="http://liber.library.uu.nl/index.php/lq/article/view/8006">Juan, B., Campos, J., Vila, M., & GÃ¡lvez, A. (2011). The Handheld Library: Developments at the Rector Gabriel FerratÃ© Library, UPC. LIBER Quarterly, 21(1), 23-47.</a>

Mobile library services might be one of the more urgent emerging technologies under consideration at the moment. For some librarians, building mobile library services might seem foreboding, for other early adopters it might seem passÃ©. Whatever the context, the conversation is still very relevant since many libraries are in the process of deciding how to go mobile, while others are exploring ways to enhance already existing services with new and better features. As evidenced by a recent report from the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7907">Pew Internet & American Life Project</a>, smartphones and other mobile devices are becoming a more integrated part of many people's online lives, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/06/30/smartphones-college-students-infographic/">especially college students</a>. 

Recognizing the potential for delivering library services by "the preferred means of communication of a new generation of students and teachers," four librarians at Rector Gabriel FerratÃ© Library (BRGF) at UPC-Barcelona Tech in Spain provide an interesting case study, thoughtfully sharing each successive step in the process of building their mobile services portfolio.


<b>Summary</b>

Rather than building an app, BRGF decided to build a mobile website. Several factors combined to influence this decision. Juan et al. explain that they did not want their mobile library services limited to a single operating system, and they could not afford universal compatibility. In the end, they chose maximum dissemination over a sleeker interface. Also, since several members of the library had web development experience, they were able to produce their service platform on a mobile website for a lower cost in a shorter amount of time. It is worth noting that this decision was initially made in the first half of 2009, and the app ecology has changed significantly over the past three years.

The authors explain each element of BRGF's mobile service portfolio, consisting of the mobile website, mobile institutional repository, mobile OPAC, mobile access to "u-win" (the library's video game service), QR codes, and text message notifications. Their mobile website includes the same major sections as their traditional website, such as news, services, collection, information about the library, contact information, and help. It also provides information about equipment availability - laptops, e-readers, USB sticks, calculators, and video game consoles for loan, plus desktop computers currently available in the library - as well as the ability to reserve group study rooms. Towards the end of the article, there is a long list of possible future developments, both for enhancing current products and developing new applications, from redesigning interfaces to augmented reality projects.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>

As EdLab considers the future of libraries, and specifically explores the possibilities for <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6135">taking Gottesman Libraries mobile</a>, this article might offer some helpful insight into the process of DIY mobile library access. For example, Roomer should definitely be incorporated into a mobile library app. 

We all know that many libraries (and other educational institutions) tend to be late adopters of new technology, since it feels risky to invest limited time and resources into what might only be market trends. I think the BRGF case study shows that libraries can take calculated risks without breaking the bank. Libraries can be information technology pioneers!

There is another more subtle takeaway for EdLab. In short, image matters. 

<blockquote>At present, the commitment to mobile services is valued not so much in terms of the immediate use made of them – which, in any event, seems likely – as in terms of the positioning that such services imply.</blockquote>

It's a win-win situation, because users receive better access to information, and the library looks great in the process. I have no doubt that EdLab's fresh approach towards mobile library apps (& etc.) will result in some very exciting and attractive products. Go team!
