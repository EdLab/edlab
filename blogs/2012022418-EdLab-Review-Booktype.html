Booktype is a social book creation platform which allows users to seamlessly collaborate and edit e-books. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The books are organized hierarchically by chapter, but in practice the titles are organized more like a website than a book perhaps because of the constantly available sidebar navigation. This makes for reference book-esque content, a refreshing born-digital departure. The group capability seems very useful too, especially for editor control of collaborative projects. It could make a very slick long group paper in a classroom setting and it doesn't hurt that it's free and endlessly cross-formattable. 

<b>Cons:</b>
Booktype's UI is extremely simple, perhaps even plain. That's not necessarily a bad thing in a book creation platform, but it looks like an antique next to the lush, media-heavy offerings from Apple and Inkling. They also don't seem to have attracted a very active user base; many people have signed up for the site but very few are actively creating books or groups. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
There's no question that the book reinvention wheels are turning. It's nice to see this manifested in a subtler way. Just because we can stuff books full of videos doesn't mean we necessarily should, but in any case it's going to take a multitude of models to arrive at a good digital destination for textbooks. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
The grouping feature is a heck of a good idea and it's done successfully, but the same feature added to a flashier site might tempt away the core users.
