          <p>
            While working on mSchool today, we ran into this feature where we wanted to show some kind of a notification on the page for a fleeting amount of time to signal to the user that their stuff was being saved. Think of it, like Gmail, which shows the "saved" thing, every once in a while to let you know your draft is being saved. How would you implement it?

On the surface, it looks pretty straight-forward but when you get to actually coding it out, you realize it's not. Here's how the rough algorithm would look:

  - Wait for the user to start typing something
  - Wait for them to stop
  - If some amount of time has elapsed (say half a second) show the "saved" message and actually save it.

The tricky part is, how would you know someone has "stopped" typing. Javascript has a "keyup" event that you can hook into, whenever a key is released and you could hook into that. But... that is not the same as what we think of someone "stopping" typing. For example, if I type the words "hey there" -- I have fired about 9 keyups (one for each letter).

Here's one solution around this. 
<ol>
<li>Take a timestamp whenever someone does a "keyup".
<li>Create a deferred function, i.e. a function that will run after sometime (say 2 seconds). This function will do the actual saving.
<li>Whenever the deferred function runs, check to see if the timestamp from Step 1 is less than what you would think of as "not stopping" (say 1 second). That is, it's common sense to assume that if someone takes less than one second between the typing of two characters, they haven't actually stopped typing.
</ol>
Most languages, would have a really hard time capturing this, but Javascript does a pretty good job of wrangling this out. 

Anways, less talk, more code..

<code>
function stoppedTyping() {
  deferredFunction = setTimeout(function() {
    var firedTooSoon = (Date.now() - Session.get('lastSaveTime')) > 1 * 1000;
    if(firedTooSoon) {
      console.error(arTimeout(deferredFunction);
    } else {
      alert("hey there");
    }
  }, 1000);
}

$("#field-input").keyup(stoppedTyping);

</code>

The fact that this just works, is awesome! That *deferredFunction* is actually in scope inside the anonymous function in setTimeout, is really really amazing and a testament to what Javascript got absolutely right, stealing closures from <a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/" target="_blank">Scheme</a>.
