            Division one colleges and universities are spending more on their athletes than on education. According to a report by the Delta Cost Project at the American Institutes for Research, colleges and universities spend three to six times as much on each student athlete than on other students. Athletic costs increased at least twice as fast as academic spending at institutions with top-tier athletic programs between 2005 and 2010. The money is divided into salaries and providing students with scholarships and also to facilities and equipment. Also money is needed to recruit new players and provide scholarships, marketing costs, sports camps and spirit groups. Supporters of college athletics claim that costs are worth it for students as a winning season can really lift a school. Colleges are responsible for their own budget and dictate where the money goes. 

Is it fair for colleges to devote a large chunk of their budget on sports teams? This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/education/top-public-colleges-in-ncaa-favor-sports-over-academics.html?src=recg&_r=1&">article</a> shares more light on this growing problem at colleges with large sports teams.
