          <p>
            Several members at Development & Research team have worked on the TC Asset project for a while and think that some of the products created by EdLab could be part of the TC 101 resources. Basically, we select topics of our interest and/or that relates to TC history (e.g. scientific inquiry, refugee education, citizenship education, media literacy, political climate and American curriculum, TC history, design-based learning), search resources owned by TC (TCR, Pocketknowledge, AfterEd, TC press, iTune U@TC), and organize them in a thematic way that make them effective resources for TC students' self learning, and potentially innovative online teaching and learning modes for continuous education at TC. 

We recently started to organize our content into various online platforms. Some of the platforms are designed specifically for online learning (e.g. Moodle,<a href="http://sclipo.com/frontpage" target="blank"> Sclipo </a>), while others such as <a href="http://pbworks.com/" target="blank"> PBWorks </a>, <a href=" http://www.ning.com/" target="blank"> Ning </a>, and <a href=" http://www.netvibes.com/#General" target="blank"> Netvibes </a> have great potential and various features for effective online learning but are not mature online learning systems. Our projects are still a work-in-progress, but we would like your feedback on how these online learning resources work for you. Here are some aspects we would like to hear from you: 

-	Does the learning platform seem intuitive for you as a learner to navigate? What features of online learning you would like to add or delete on the learning platform?
-	Can you think of other TC resources and activities that we could incorporate into these online courses? 
-	Aside from credit and certificate for these mini courses, what are some other mechanisms that can provide incentives for students to enroll in these online courses?

Here is my <a href=" http://civicedtc.pbworks.com/" target="blank"> mini course </a> about citizenship education and a <a href=" http://civicedtc.pbworks.com/Section-4-Democratic-Dialogue" target="blank"> lesson example </a> that incorporate various TC resources.
