<p>As blended learning becomes more popular, instructors are continuously experimenting with different online platforms that create their preferred classroom community. Two of the most prominent platforms used by instructors are forums and wikis. A recent study examined the types of cognitive and social aspects that each platform exercises, as well as students’ perspectives of using both of them.</p>
 
<p>To clarify these terms, forums are internet discussion pages on which users start threads and respond to one another within a particular topic. Wikis are akin to blog sites that any user can edit and add information to. In forums, there is a greater conversational element; in wikis, there is sense of collaborative project building. This study focused on 87 students at an Italian University who had 19 sessions each on forums and wikis during their 5-week online course.</p>
 
<p>The researchers were not trying to identify which platform was better; rather, they were studying the specific benefits each provided participants. They found that forums were tools mainly used for expressing opinions, sharing and responding to ideas, and evaluating perspectives. Conversely, wikis were mainly used for collaborative writing and producing a class project. In light of this, the participants said that they had a deeper understanding of the topic and a better sense of community when participating in forums because they became a space for dialogue. Wikis, on the other hand, garnered less communication overall.</p>
 
<p>The results of this study could be useful for anyone who is designing a collaborative blended or online course. Again, the researchers stressed that neither wikis nor forums are inherently better than the other, but that each brings different qualities to a learning community. In fact, the researchers suggest using these tools to complement each other in a class. While instructors might choose to dive more deeply into just one of these platforms, based on the findings of this study, using both in conjunction could help generate both the dialogical community product of the forums and the collaborative project-building product of the wikis. </p>
