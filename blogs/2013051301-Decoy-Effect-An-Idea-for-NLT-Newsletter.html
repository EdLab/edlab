            Since I learn that on average, 25% of NLT article clicks are derived from newsletters, I couldn't stop thinking about DOING something about it. 

I'm sure some of you know about the <b>Decoy Effect</b>. It's a well known marketing strategy, and also a phenomenon in behavioral economics called asymmetric dominance effect. If you have read Professor Dan Ariely's book, <i>Predictably Irrational</i>, you probably are familiar with the example of the Economist pricing strategy. 

<blockquote>
Web subscription	        $59
Print	                                $125
Print + Web subscription	$125
</blockquote>

You would think, if it's the same price for Print + Web  and Print ($125), why would I subscribe to print? You are right! That's the decoy. People will be drawn and elevate more value of the combination of Print + Web, and actually pay $125 for this option and disregard of the cheapest web subscription. Once you remove the Print (the decoy), people will tend to spend less money on the cheaper item. 

Such strategy (or trick) has also been explained in recommender systems. It helps to explain the recommendation algorithm by controlling such decoy effects and also offers the possibility of increasing the probability of selection of certain items.

What does it have to do with NLT? 
I think potentially we can try the recommendation on the newsletters. 
<b>Pros</b>: study to figure out the recommendation algorithm for personalized news. This way will allow us test new approaches without engineering current system. In addition to that, boost up more article views.
<b>Cons</b>: to set it up might require <i>some</i> labor work. 

If that's still too much? I think it is still worth a shot to add pure text to the newsletter and links of other articles, such as Research Digest :) I think we can position the pure boring text and links as decoy, versus to colorful, imagery three featured articles. I'd anticipate the article views bump up and up!
