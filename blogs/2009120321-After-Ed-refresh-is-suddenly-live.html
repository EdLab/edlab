          <p>
            Just wanted to bring your attention to the brand new <a href="http://aftered.tv/">After Ed</a>! Um, normally we might not have launched it in quite this fashion (even folks on the video team might not have seen it yet), but we ended up signing a new (less expensive) contract with our video streaming provider (Brightcove) that went into effect on December 1st, and it forced our hand a bit. Here's a little more detail from the homepage:

<blockquote>
If you've visited After Ed before, you may have noticed our site has changed. We've abandoned multi-video players, for example, in favor of a more modular platform. We've grown from a blog-like archive to a moderated community site, where you can use YouTube to contribute to After Ed shows and themes. We think changes like these will make it easier to find, bookmark, and share videos, playlists, and shows. Please email us if you have feedback or suggestions, and please bear with us as we continue to add new features in early 2010. Enjoy!
</blockquote>

So, to make a long story short, the publishing team would love to hear your thoughts about the new site. The "features" that we refer to that will come in 2010 are likely editorial additions -- we'll be experimenting with the homepage on a development site for the next two months, and trying to create a stronger editorial presence for After Ed.

But, still, we've come a long way from our beloved(?) 1.0 site that went live in November 2007... thanks especially to Josh and Erin who've collaborated to create a powerful, elegant site that we hope will play a growing roll in our "publishing network" strategy (that we began articulating at the 11/16 seminar, but that we plan to continue to define more clearly and publicly as we build out potential elements).

Oh, and if you find buggy things, let us know:)
