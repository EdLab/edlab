            <strong>Title: </strong>Towards dialogic teaching : rethinking classroom talk

<strong>Author:</strong> Robin Alexander

<strong>Publisher:</strong> Cambridge, UK : Dialogos, 2009

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

<em> Towards        Dialogic Teaching </em> surveys        research evidence on the role of talk in learning and teaching from        different disciplines and countries and shows how it converges on and        sustains the idea of dialogic teaching. Dialogic teaching exploits the        potential of classroom talk for cognitive as well as social empowerment,        but only when such talk is a good deal more rigorous and reciprocal than        is traditionally the case. The booklet sets out the necessary oral and        organisational repertoires for effective dialogic teaching and the        principles by which it is informed, and proposes classroom indicators to        guide the evaluation and development of dialogic practice. The        publication, whose earlier editions are now in widespread use in schools        and on teacher training courses in Britain and several other countries, is        extensively referenced, but also includes a section specifically for        teachers which lists suggestions for further reading and support. The        fourth edition is longer than its predecessors and contains significant new        material.
