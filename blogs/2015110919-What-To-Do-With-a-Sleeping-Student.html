<p>Professor Michael Wesch notices a student sleeping in his class. What should he do? Fail him? Call him out? No. Michael invites him to lunch. </p>

<p>During their meal, Michael finds some interesting details about "the sleeper." As a budding developer, this student is really excited about video games as well as creative, meaningful projects. However, he is intensely frustrated by the narrow pursuits normally associated with formal schooling. How should Michael respond to this discouraging news?  </p>

<p>Instead of punishing the student or blaming him for being tired, Michael invited him to a different kind of class. He changed his teaching—threw out the textbooks, shut off the PowerPoint, made the class more hands-on. Michael even reached out to work with David, the sleeper, on a video game together. This encounter reinvigorated the professor’s teaching. After waking David, Michael also woke to realize new things about his identity as an educator and how he sees other people—to sleep, perchance to dream. </p>

<p>Have you ever turned around a situation that started off poorly? Have you misidentified a person based off a bad first impression? Tell us about a negative educational experience that later ended up improving in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25003/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:12 Nantwi:</b> I personally appreciate educators who cater their class and activities towards getting a reaction out of their students. If a student is not engaged in the classroom, they will not learn.</p>

<p><b>@00:36 bizapp:</b> Only a few teachers will demonstrate this kind of care. This proves that there is more to being a teacher other than standing in a classroom and talking until your mouth is dry. </p>
