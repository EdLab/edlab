Post Spring break and the semester moving in full swing  - is no better time to blog about procrastination at its best. True to college students especially as a bad habit,  new research shows that procrastination just maybe a psychological/biological problem in adults. For anyone interested "Procrastination and task avoidance: theory, research and treatment" (http://www.amazon.com/Procrastination-Task-Avoidance-Treatment-Psychology/dp/0306448424/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1301072367&amp;sr=1-1) offers a thorough scientific diagnosis of how, what and why of procrastination. In psychology, <strong>procrastination</strong> refers to the act of replacing  high-priority actions with tasks of low-priority, and thus putting off  important tasks to a later time. According to good ol' Wikipedia:<a title="Psychologist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist"> Psychologists</a> often cite such <a title="Human behavior" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior">behavior</a> as a <a title="Coping mechanism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_mechanism">mechanism for coping</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety">anxiety</a> associated with starting or completing any task or decision.Schraw, Pinard, Wadkins, and Olafson have proposed three criteria for a  behavior to be classified as procrastination: it must be  counterproductive, needless, and delaying (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination). Historically it was found that procrastination was first used by Reverend Walker in the 17th century to depict sin as it became closely associated with the harmful effects of laziness and other forms of evil. I should think about that every time I delay doing necessary tasks , but I can not help imagine 17th century graduate students  having the same painfully long list of "Goals" or "Stuff to do today" or "Finish !!!" as we do here at Teachers College. Further, the origins of the word also show that it is all not a necessary evil, the Egyptians actually had two meanings for the word and one of them was the useful habit of avoiding unnecessary work. I think in today's world that is more a function of work hard and work smart or better yet high priority multi-tasking. I personally have found myself procrastinating more and more with the discovery of how fantastic online shopping can be ... embarrassingly facebook games have also been a recent addiction adding to this. I find myself getting the majority of my work done in environments that therefore, do not have internet access or limited internet access to focus on my work. I also found congratulating myself on work well done - often leads to attack the work more efficiently piece by piece. However, i have yet to find a reasonable cure to the procrastination that hits after a week of Spring break .. any ideas anyone ?
