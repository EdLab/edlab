            <b> What kinds of data should we be collecting to understand how library resources and sites are used?</b>

<img src="http://jmezei.pressible.org/files/2010/04/libpg.dataF09-copy.jpg"idth="525" height="351" /> <i> Respective percentages of user hits on the various categories of the library website during the academic year. Fall '09 Report </i>

Today during the D&R meeting we held  brainstorming sessions around the data collection and reporting services the Edlab provides to different sectors of the library. The featured reports today included the <i>Teacher's College Record Report (TCRR)</i> and <i>The Library Website Report (LWR)</i>.  

The session was comprised of focussed discussions addressing questions such as, (a)What would you like to know? in relation to collecting data and reporting results from these sites, (b)What are the current reports comprised of?, and (c)How can we connect a and b moving forward to with the reports?  

<b>(a) What to Collect? </b>
Ideas from what data to collect for these sites included having specific questions to use data collected to answer (not just a broad summary), including optional surveys about user satisfaction, visualizations of ratings that represent the most popular things on each site, user data, new feature effects and the reports should reflect a longitudinal trend approach. 
<body>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
function toggleVis( elemID )
{    var elem = document.getElementById( elemID );
    if( elem.style.display != 'none' )
        {        elem.style.display = 'none';
        }
        else
        {        elem.style.display = 'block';
        }
}
</script>
</body>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example');"><b>The Library Website Report</b></a>
<div id="example" style="display:none">
<li>Survey of user satisfaction</li>
<li>Focus on what is uses beyond library searches and library services the 'other stuff' on the site</li>
<li>Popular search trends- create resources on them
Advertisements and affect on enrollment or popularity</li>
<li>Longitudinal approach: trends over time
What do twitter and facebook do? how many people connect using them are they useful?
</li>
</div>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example1');"><b>Teachers College Record Report</b></a>
<div id="example1" style="display:none">
<li>Trackable additions to website: purpose of the design of website connected to data </li>
<li>New features and how they interact? (the voice, discussion board)</li>
<li>User information connected to subscription data who uses it and how, activity by role </li>
<li>Link information to newsletters</li> 
<li>Financial data </li>
<li>Optional survey user satisfaction </li>
<li>Emails to direct traffic to the site</li>
<li>Search feature what people look for
rating (what's worth looking at)</li>
</div>

<b>(c)How to enhance reports? </b> 
We split into two teams, to discuss each report as it currently exists and then potential ways to change or develop such reports. This discussion though were independent from each other seemed to touch upon similar aspect for future areas of data collection. These themes included transparency and user personalization as future directions or areas to improve upon. For more specific information suggested toward each click below. 

<a onclick="toggleVis('example2');"><b>Teachers College Record Report</b></a>
<div id="example2" style="display:none">
Newsletter 
Normative way to analyze: Count traffic for first month v. long time lasting
Macro, not micro
Differentiate by user (data mining)
Click hot spots
Service to authors: stats on article (how many times cited)
Voice
Related 
Movement: from where to where?
Unlogged in readers: buy, login or leave
When do people login? 


Share analytics data 
Sell data to authors
When they login
Differentiate by user role
Search trends

Transparent data: trends
User personalization

<a onclick="toggleVis('example3');"><b>The Library Website Report</b></a>
<div id="example3" style="display:none">

Time frame- more than a snapshot, it should be longitudinal overtime and compared overtime.

Personalization 
- Where people come from- How do they get to the site, is it from a search engine / direct/ bookmark etc. 
- Collect how they use the site, difficult because need people to login (may be annoying), can it connect to TC classweb or use data from this, or collect data from the Single Sign on Project. 

Most Popular areas in detail, or what others are doing? possibly section in classweb that compares your library data usage to the normal amount

Edlab projects: How can library advertisements affect projects, such as Critter/TCRF/Pressible use?

Accessibility
-Where do the reports live? Reports could  be published to Edlab tab or site. 
-Data could be accessible with permissions on access, drop down menus to select specific pieces of data so can have more specialized reports (have a long list of all data that can be collected but a page that people can pick and choose what is relevant to their question)
-Have tab on edlab site that makes reports public
-Have D&R meetings or seminars that summarize and share out this data to get feedback and always have a cycle for improvement and current questions to be addressed.
 
- Use data for more scholarly publications - looking at longitudinal trends of the library or specific data that is new or could suggest trend. 
 
- Website/Cost breakdowns

Also attached are example reports, that if interested you can view to get a sense of the data currently collected and if you have further suggestions or ideas in this area please comment.
