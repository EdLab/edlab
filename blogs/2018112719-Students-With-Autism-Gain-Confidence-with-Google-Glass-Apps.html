<p><a href="http://www.brain-power.com">Brain Power</a>, a Boston-based edtech startup, helps kids on the autism spectrum learn how to engage with the world and interact with others. One of Brain Power’s most popular products uses Google Glass and an original app to teach children how to recognize emotional expressions. The app, called Emotion Charades, places two different emojis on either side of a human face, and users must choose which emotion matches the actual expression. This game can help people feel more socially literate and confident in interactions.</p>

<p>Brain Power’s products are based on neuroscience and technology research from MIT and Harvard, and each has been crafted with a user-centered design that includes brainstorming and testing with people on the autism spectrum. One big difference between Brain Power and other tech products for kids with autism is that using Google Glass allows children to both receive training and pay attention to the world around them. Using smartphones or tablets, children constantly look down at a screen and disconnect from their surroundings.</p>

<p>When do you think students could use Google Glass and Brain Power in the classroom? Do you think this technology could become mainstream for people on the autism spectrum? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/45432">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:07 Dallas Milanovich:</b> I can see how Brain Power and Google Glass could be used to more effectively engage students with autism in the class, but I don't understand how exactly it would make them feel more included. It seems like it might just give teachers a reason to believe they no longer have to help them out—the reliance on technology might give them a false sense that these kids are now 100% engaged.</p>

<p><b>@02:04 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> These technologies open many possibilities, as long as they remain learning tools and don't become exhaustive explanations of or prescriptions for education. For instance, tracking students' eyes might afford the teacher some insight about his students' attention, but it could never fully track student engagement, which is a much more complex and internal process.</p>
