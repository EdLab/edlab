          <p>
                  Nowadays, more and more wealthy Chinese family begin to send their kids to study in America. You will not only find a large group of Chinese students in USA's reputable college, but also plenty of middle school students from China studying in USA. It is not surprising to see Chinese parents spending a lot of money on their children's English education before sending them to the US. 
      However, it is very sad to find the general English education quality is very low. Most of the English teachers are not native speakers so that they are not quite proficient in English. The motivation for students in school to study English is for passing the compulsory English test. It makes you see the need of the private English training institute with high educational quality, like Wall Street English, EF, Webster, you can name it.  As a reputable college on education, TC will find a role in English education market in China, and I believe it will have a strong capacities to compete with the local key players in this field. 
      The idea of my project is to initiate a private English training Institute in China authorized and involved by Teacher's College. Chinese people believe the big name and reputation which will be much easier for us to do marketing, and get large subsidy from Chinese government. Let me know what you think. I'm very interested in  hearing your feedback.
