<p><a href="http://www.membean.com">Membean</a> is an online program designed to make vocabulary learning for students ages 6 to 16 an effective, encoded experience. I used this program with a former student, and I cannot help but feel inspired by its ability to reach a multitude of learners. Membean is dedicated not just to rote memorization of words, but rather to committing them to memory with unforgettable associations. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Are you a whiz at quizzes? Membean starts your process with a quiz. Maybe you find yourself intrigued by the origin of words. Membean has an extensive word web that leads you to connections you may have never considered. Perhaps you prefer a more visual approach to vocab gab. A word theater puts a word in a situational context through theatrical performance that is both entertaining and memorable. Whatever your learning style, Membean has a learning strategy developed to suit each individual. </p>

<p>In Membean, each word expands with its own profile page. Within the interface, a word constellation shows the web of synonyms and antonyms. There is a memory hook center where each word is creatively illustrated by mnemonic sentences. The memory hook is one of the better and more open-ended features. If the existing memory hook is not scintillating your memory bank, you can make your own. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Membean is very text heavy. In my personal experience with a student whose strengths were more developed in science and math, I noticed that she was less enthusiastic about the interface. The program is a dream if words are your thing, but a screen scattered with text did not promote inquiry from my student. Although the platform is designed to accommodate every learner, the interface could be overkill for many students. One element that I would have found useful is the ability to pause the quiz in order to guide my student through breaking words down that she didnâ€™t know. The quiz is the first exposure students have to new words, so a nice pause could help avoid a hasty selection. Maximizing this learning opportunity could increase use of this app and foster an even better vocab education.   </p>
 
 <p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>For word enthusiasts infatuated with etymology, this program has done the research to provide diverse learning experiences for all types of students. The features are intentional and fun. Membean is structured to activate a unique understanding of words that goes beyond traditional definition matching. The program does a fantastic job integrating every angle and approach to learning a word through pictures, videos, audio, and the web. For some students, the interface may register as multimedia overload. However, students may find that they only ever use a few of these strategies in their learning, which seems to be the intention of the program anyway. The history of words is as long as humanity. Membean can help young learners reach back to the origins of any word, allowing them to develop their own unique love of language. </p>
