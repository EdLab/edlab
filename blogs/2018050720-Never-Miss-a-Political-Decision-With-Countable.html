<p> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/countable-contact-congress/id893853823?mt=8">Countable</a> is designed to help citizens stay informed and get involved in politics by providing up-to-date information on government news and the voting processes of bills in Congress. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The app has three feeds: news, bills, and notifications. The news feed offers stories related to government leaders and information that could affect lawmaking. At the top of each article is a button labeled <i>take action</i> that connects you to your representatives. The feed displays recent bills with a summary, reasons why people would vote yea or nay on the issue, the representative who sponsored the bill, and the bill’s path from the moment it was proposed to when it was voted on. You can also see how each lawmaker, including your own, voted.</p>
 
<p>The information is remarkably unbiased, and I found it helpful that the summary and reasons for voting yea or nay were presented before the political party the bill was sponsored by; I was more encouraged to read and critically evaluate each bill for myself rather than siding with my political party from the beginning. I learned so much about legislative processes just from using the app for a few days.</p>
 
<p>One of the best features of the app is how it streamlines the process of contacting your representatives. The three biggest buttons on the screen are <i>call, message</i>, and <i>video message</i>. With one click, I’m on the phone with Senator Gillibrand’s office. Or, if I’m not ready for a conversation, I can send a written message, or comment on the post to start a dialogue with other app users.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The only negative feature of this app is that the back information seems to be a bit murky. When I search for bills pertaining to education, a long list appears, but the dates seem inaccurate, and I’m unsure whether they appear chronologically or randomly. I would like to see Countable’s older entries as organized and precise as their newest stories.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Countable is a fantastic tool to: learn about legislative processes, stay informed of current issues, and take action and make sure your representatives hear your voice. I would highly recommend this app for older high school students, college students, and adults.</p>
