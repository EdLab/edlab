          <p>
            In high school and throughout college, one of my biggest problems when working was finding a good balance between working and distractions.  For me, two of my biggest problems were:

1) Getting distracted during work, e.g. Facebook / Chatting / Youtube'ing, etc.

or

2) Working continuously for too long.  While this may not seem like a problem, I realized that I would reach a point where no matter how much I would continue to read and study material, the words would not stick.  I essentially would be burnt out and while I could force myself to "study" the material, the words would just echo meaninglessly in my head.  Even realizing this I would force myself to study, which would result in very inefficient studying, and also myself feeling very tired and miserable.

Recently I came across two sites which have helped me maintain better focus while working.    

<a href="http://www.simplynoise.com">Simplynoise</a>:
Simplynoise is a site which plays various forms of white noise in order to help one focus better. They have several different background noises that you can choose from which broadcasts at different frequencies so you can choose one which suits you. I feel that sometimes listening to music can be distracting, so I use Simplynoise when I really want to focus. 

<a href="http://www.pomodoro.me/">Pomodoro.me</a>:
Pomodoro.me basically is a website built with several timers so you can better schedule your working time.  The website was derived from the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method.  The most basic Pomodoro schedule involves working in 25 minute intervals, with 5 minute breaks in between.  Every four 25 minute intervals, you take a longer break (15 minutes).  Using this site helped me maintain focus; the things that would usually distract me such as responding to an email, I would delegate to my break times.  Furthermore, this system forced me to take breaks and saved me from burning myself out.  The actual Pomodoro Technique is a little more sophisticated than I described, but for me following the 25, 5, 15 rule was much better than what I had before; unplanned, undisciplined studying and work.  

Please share any study / work tips you might have and/or let me know if any of these sites have worked for you!
