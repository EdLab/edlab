<p>A recent study looked into how early episodes of the TV series <i>Sesame Street</i> affected the education of preschool age children. In 1969 when the show began PBS was broadcast mainly on UHF (ultra-high frequency). UHF signals were not consistent across the country and many areas were too far away from TV stations for the UHF transmission to reach them. This study looks at whether kids under the age of six who were able to tune into Sesame Street were more educationally advanced than those located in places where they were not able to watch the show. To investigate the show’s impact, the researchers compared U.S. census data from the years 1980, 1990 and 2000 to grade level progression, school graduation rates, and employment data. Researchers were interested in finding out how important <i>Sesame Street</i> was when it first started and how crucial was it in terms of educational impact to have a strong broadcast signal?</p>

<p>The Brookings Institute, (where one of the study’s authors, Melissa Kearney, is a Senior Fellow) concisely stated the study’s results: "Preschool age children living in counties with good access to the show were 1.5 to 2.0 percent more likely to remain at the appropriate grade throughout their school years. That positive effect was particularly pronounced for boys, black non-Hispanic children, and those living in economically disadvantaged areas." In terms of long range effects, the study’s data was inconclusive but the census data did show small wage increases which reflected the positive impact of the show, consistent with previous studies that looked at how the show impacted test scores.</p>

<p>As massive open online learning models develop, this study suggests that there are lessons to be learned by looking at past models, such as <i>Sesame Street,</i> to understand and improve what students can might gain from these new methods.</p>
