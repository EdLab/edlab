How many times have students complained about being bored in the classroom? What about teachers who wished their students were more excited about and engaged in learning? The Stanford Mobile Inquiry-Based Learning Environment (SMILE) aims to address these issues by using technology to transform the traditional classroom into a highly interactive mobile-based learning environment. <p>

In traditional classrooms, teachers usually ask students questions. But with SMILE, students are given cell phones so that they can take pictures, make videos, and access information on the internet in order to develop questions and share with classmates.  The idea is to improve the learning experience of students by encouraging them to make inquiries freely and to find answers independently. Early adopters have boasted about how previously timid students are flourishing with this inquiry-based mobile approach. <p>

Currently, the only tools necessary for SMILE are mobile phones, a laptop, and a router.  It was designed with underserved communities in mind so that it can work anywhere, including under extreme conditions around the globe. In other words, there is much potential for scaling up. <p>
