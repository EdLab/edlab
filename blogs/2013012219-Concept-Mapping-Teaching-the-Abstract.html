<p><b>Title:</b> Learning How to Use a Computer-Based Concept-Mapping Tool: Self-Explaining Examples Helps (2009)<br>
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Tatjana S. Hilbert & Alexander Renkl</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Concept mapping uses graphical representation to describe the relationships between concepts. It can be a useful organizational strategy, as in Khan Academy’s <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard">Knowledge Map</a>, but the creation of these organizational maps is a challenging and abstract process. The creation of a concept map relies on a sophisticated understanding of the represented discipline and it is a difficult skill to teach to novices. In more concrete domains (like proof-finding in math,) it has been shown that example-based learning typically leads to better learning outcomes than learning by doing. In this study, the authors applied <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">Cognitive Load Theory</a></i> to explain that example-based learning allows students to more easily study principles without getting distracted by the incidentals of problem-solving.  </p>

<p> 
In <i>Learning How to Use a Computer-Based Concept-Mapping Tool: Self-Explaining Examples Helps</i>, the authors experimented with different strategies for teaching concept mapping. Two experiments were run on instructional strategies for concept maps. The first pitted individual learners studying example-based materials against those who learned by practicing concept mapping. The second experiment introduced another group of subjects who used examples but were also given self-serve explanation "hints." Participants were judged on their use of concept mapping and application of the discipline tested and were also asked to take a questionaire to assess method and cognitive load during the exercise. </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results confirmed that example-based learning clearly outperformed practice-based learning and examples with hints had the best learning outcomes. With respect to Cognitive Load Theory, the authors found that examples without prompts put less strain on working memory and the addition of prompts resulted in a greater cognitive load for participants. Though examples with prompts required more cognitive energy than examples without prompts, participants with prompts were more successful at cognitive map creation. In the method questionaire, the authors confirmed the idea that successful mappers engaged in planning, worked to construct coherent maps, and effectively controlled the development of their maps.
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> It was clear from the study that, just as in concrete subjects, example-based study trumps learning by practice for abstract disciplines. The discussion of successful concept mappers suggests that the differentiation between good and bad ones might be due to modeling of behaviors as a strategy for learning. Learning by example may include more contextual knowledge that helps learners create strategies for accomplishment. In teaching, as in writing, this idea may come down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell">"show, don’t tell."</a> Designing a curriculum that imparts sophisticated understanding of a subject relies on modeling behaviors with examples.</p>
