            **Private**

As of today, it's safe to say there is no one left in D&R who hasn't spent some time on mSchool. I know this because I had the chance to test them all as they sat a captive audience before me. [cue maniacal laughter.]

Before I reveal the results of the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey I administered, let me just have a private word with mSchool. 

<i>Listen, don't let these scores bring you down. There's really not much lower you can go, anyway. They are prrettyyy low. Hey, don't leave. I mean, are you leaving? I can't tell what's your front and what's your back. I'm not used to talking to websites like this. Which part of you do I look at? Look, the point is, there is nowhere to go but up. And that's what will happen. Chin up, mSchool, and let's hug it out. Oh God, what did I just touch? </i>

Hey I'm back. That was weird. 

About that survey… the SUS is a tried-and-true 10-question usability survey that has been found reliable and valid over the course of almost 30 years. It weighs systems (or in our case, websites) based on ease of use, user confidence, and other factors. 

The average SUS score is 68. Anything over that is considered above average, anything under is below average. I scored each of the surveys and further converted these scores to percentile ranks and letter grades. 

SUS scores correlate positively with customer loyalty. The higher the SUS score, the more likely someone will tell their friend about the website. Users who give a site a score of 80 or above will likely spread the gospel of your site. On the other hand, users who give your site a score of 60 or below will likely go on to badmouth it. 

And now, the results!

Out of 20 people, half gave mSchool a failing grade (but one person apparently <i>loved</i> it!). 

The average SUS score is 51.5, putting it in the 14th percentile and giving it a D grade. This means that of all the systems tested (using this survey), mSchool rates higher than 14% of them. That's… not great, but it's good to have a baseline! 

Thanks to everyone for your help. If you noted that you'd be available for followup questions, I'll be coming after you. 

Thanks also to Carmen, Chingfu, and Ting for letting me disrupt their meeting yesterday.
