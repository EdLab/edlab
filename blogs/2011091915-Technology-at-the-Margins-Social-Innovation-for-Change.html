            Today I'll be attending a seminar by Akhtar Badshah, the senior director of Global Community Affairs at Microsoft. I'll be composing a review post for the blog later on, but I wanted to give the EdLab a chance to propose any questions for Mr. Badshah that might be relevant to our work. I imagine I'll probably ask about Microsoft's priorities for Tech-centered training and education in developing countries, but if anyone has any burning questions of their own, go ahead and leave them in the comments.

Read on for the official event description.

Akhtar Badshah is the senior director of Global Community Affairs at Microsoft Corporation, where he administers the company's global community investment and employee programs. Through monetary grants, software and curriculum donations, technology solutions, and employee volunteer hours, Microsoft supports programs and organizations that address the needs of communities worldwide.  Since 1983, Microsoft and its employees have provided over $4.6 billion in cash, services and software to nonprofits around the world through localized, company-sponsored giving and volunteer campaigns. 

Among his responsibilities, Badshah manages the Microsoft Unlimited Potential Community Technology Skills Program (CTSP), a global initiative that is designed to help narrow the technology skills gap; aid global work-force development; and create social and economic opportunity by providing technology training through community technology centers.  CTSP offers a comprehensive approach to broadening digital inclusion by bringing together critical components, including training grants, software donations, community learning curricula and a global support network.  Microsoft is working to broaden digital inclusion and to bring the benefits of technology to the next billion people by 2015.
