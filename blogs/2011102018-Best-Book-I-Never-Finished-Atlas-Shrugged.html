<h2><span style="color: #800000">Why "Atlas Shrugged"?</span></h2>
My classmate kept writing "Who is John Galt?" all over the student lounge in undergrad. This annoyed me. So, I looked up the reference and found it was from "Atlas Shrugged." I heard of the book and decided I would pick it up. Fortunately, my boss gave me his used copy the same month. So, I decided to tackle this beast of a novel (all 1200 pages) during my junior year. It was definitely interesting. I put it down for a couple of months while I traveled, worked, and read other books. Soon it was buried on my book shelf. I picked it up last year to discover it was still worth a read, only to put it down when I started a new job with a crazy, long commute. My motion sickness doesn't allow me to read during my travels, so I just set it back down...this time, in a box -- as I was moving, again. The book now resides in my favorite, interim storage unit -- my parent's house.  Sadly, my apartment doesn't permit much space for books (or anything else for that matter). Hopefully one day I will finish the book. If you would like to (attempt to) read it, the information is below!

<strong><span style="color: #000000">From The Publisher: </span></strong>

Ayn Rand's epochal novel, first published in 1957, has been a bestseller for more than four decades as well as an intellectual landmark. It is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world--and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators? Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies but against those who needed him most--and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world's motor--and the motive power of every man?

Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life--from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy...to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction...to the philosopher who becomes a pirate...to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad...to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels.

Peopled by larger-than-life heroes and villains, charged with towering questions of good and evil, Atlas Shrugged is Ayn Rand's masterpiece. It is a philosophical revolution told in the form of an action thriller.
