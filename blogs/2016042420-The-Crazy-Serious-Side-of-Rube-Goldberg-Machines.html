<p><i>Zip</i>, <i>zing</i>, and <i>zap</i>—these are just some of the noises you will hear at the annual Rube Goldberg Machine College National Competition. This may be the only DIY tournament that judges teams on their silliness just as much as on their technological innovation. </p>

<p>Inspired by the wacky inventions of cartoonist Rube Goldberg, these machines all have a simple task. At this competition, it was to erase a blackboard. Yet, as the college students in this vialogue demonstrate, a Rube Goldberg machine is about so much more than its conclusion. It’s about putting together an intricate system of moving parts that function in a chain reaction. The machines can have as many as seventy-five steps, and if even one goes wrong, the whole process halts.</p>

<p>Although these contraptions are as funny as they are complex, students are serious about making them. Some worked as many as 800 hours to perfect their creations. As the students presented their machines, it’s clear that all the hard work paid off. It’s likely that no other contraptions made of dominoes, marbles, and miniature catapults will <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25829/">keep you on your toes more</a>. </p>

<p>How can making a Rube Goldberg machine get students excited about mechanics? What sorts of funny and complex devices have your students made? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/28729/">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:39 Beckieb:</b> This is like the technology and engineering version of the science fair. What better way to share knowledge than having a contest like this?</p>

<p><b>@03:14 Jennyshen:</b> There's, of course, the engineering aspect, where students will have to consider laws of physics in order to ensure that their objects are interacting with one another properly. But I think there is also a lot of room for creativity, which you can clearly see in all the different models. Students can use an artistic touch and also gain a lot of satisfaction from seeing their machine work.</p>
