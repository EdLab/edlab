<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autocoach/id1255269724?mt=8">AutoCoach</a> is an app that teaches adults how to teach teenagers to drive, specifically, teens in the learner permit phase awaiting their full driver’s license. Though it was created by an Atlanta-based rehabilitation hospital, the Georgia Governor's Office of Highway Safety, and Cap Tech, this app can be used for road regulation guidelines in all 50 states. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app is singularly focused as a tool for parents or other adults to use when they are teaching teenagers who are in the learner permit phase how to drive. The app comes with ten targeted mini lessons to take some anxiety or pressures off of parents, such as Parking, Changing Lanes & Passing, Managing Intersections, and Defensive Driving. These lessons will help refresh specific road tips that long-time drivers may take for granted or have forgotten over the years. </p>

<p>When used on the road, the "Drive" feature logs driving time, miles driven, average speed, and weather for each student driving session. This was designed to help track the driving hour requirement for state licenses. The app also allows parents or guardians to rate each driving performance and to keep a checklist of skills learners have completed for their overall progress. The skills checklist corresponds to the mini lessons provided for parents. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It’s difficult to find negatives for AutoCoach. Perhaps, the app makers could add a feature just for students, so that they could track their progress on their own device. Some people might not want to register or have their data usage tracked by the app, but this is a small complaint, as registration and data tracking are standard features on most current apps. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>AutoCoach is a simple and specific app for adults teaching teenagers with their learner permits how to qualify for their license. Its functionality offers little to complain about, as it provides comprehensive, accessible support for a clear goal. The app is free, easy to use, and has driving regulations for every US state integrated into its programming. If you are teaching someone how to drive, you should consider downloading AutoCoach; because while parallel parking for the first time might be stressful, this handy app is not. </p>
