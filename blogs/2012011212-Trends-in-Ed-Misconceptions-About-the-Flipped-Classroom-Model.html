            The Chronicle recently had an <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/debating-the-flipped-classroom-at-stanford/34811">article</a> about how a student is sparking debate about the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6525">Flipped Classroom model</a>. This is a result of Stanford's increasing amount of online classes, including the ones that are free to anyone. Standford has an Applied Machine Learning course, which is taught completely online, and the student in the article has expressed his dissatisfaction on how the online class does not allow him to interact with other students and has no in-person lecturing, on a hacking website. It should be noted however that there is a traditional, in-person Applied Machine Learning course in addition to a one day a week optional in class session where students and professor practice applying the knowledge. It is time to start clearing the misconceptions about the Flipped Classroom model, since reading the article showed that people are starting to misunderstand the purpose of the model. 

First thing to clear up is that a Flipped Classroom is <b>NOT</b> when a class is completely online! Having students only watch lectures at home and solving online problems does <b>NOT</b> make the classroom flipped. It is a bit understandable to have some misunderstandings about the flipped classroom, since educators have different ways of interpreting the model, but everyone should understand the basic principles of the Flipped Classroom model. Below is the basic principle of the model based on deep, detailed research:

<b><i>The Flipped Classroom model is the shifting of the classroom paradigm, so that lectures can be seen at home, while homework activities are done in class. This is to allow more time for applying the knowledge and receiving more personal help from the educator. </b></i>

The online class described in the article does not shift the class paradigm completely, instead mostly all classroom activities are completely shifted at home. The optional one hour classroom session is not enough time for all students to get the individual help they might need. Flipped educators need to start clearing up this sort of misconception because it is very damaging to the model's reputation.
