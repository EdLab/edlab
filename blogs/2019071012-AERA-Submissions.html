            <p>Below are abstracts for our submissions to AERA this year.</p><p><br /></p><p>We look forward to your questions and feedback.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>In Demand: Use of E-Reserve Systems at University and Research Libraries (Anna) </strong></p><p>Abstract: An increase in technological advances has provided opportunities to improve course reserves systems at research libraries. In this paper, we explore the usage of the e-Reserve system during the course of a semester at the Gottesman Libraries at Teachers College, Columbia University. The results include the types of frequent requests and the number of courses with learning materials. The results revealed, among others, that requests were most frequent during the start of the semester and the system is used more by faculty than students. We also found that there is a greater demand for recently published items. The results indicate that e-Reserve systems should be designed with students’ needs at the forefront and research libraries should consider the publication year and accessibility they make purchasing decisions.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>The Application of Social Network Analysis to Support Collaborative E-Learning (Ameya) </strong></p><p>Abstract: The rise in the use of the internet has enabled the collection of various interactive data. Social Network data, has created numerous opportunities for analyzing different trends among the users. Moreover, creation of exponential amount of data and the continuous improvement in machine learning algorithms have helped identify latent user behavior. Social Network Analysis (SNA) can have phenomenal impact in the field of collaborative E-learning (e.g., user analysis and content recommendation) . In this paper, we review some of the SNA techniques and algorithms. We will also take an example of Vialogues, a collaborative E-learning platform and look at how different SNA techniques can be used to analyze Vialogues data.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Network Modeling Methods and Metadata Extraction for Library Access Records (Henry) </strong></p><p>Abstract: The adoption of digital library services which provide users access to library resources from anywhere has enabled the collection of data related to the use of such resources and the learning behavior of library patrons. Such Big Data can yield valuable insights into how learning happens and can be used to build applications to recommend educational resources to users. By their nature, such resources are interconnected by bibliometric metadata, and representing these connections computational is an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we develop and test a method for building graph representations of research corpora accessed by patrons through a library proxy server. We provide an open-source software for building and analyzing these representations and discuss the challenges of identifying and discovering metadata from sparse proxy server logs. In addition, we discuss the potential for further research in network modeling of library access records.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Measurement of Video-driven Discussion Engagement Using IRT mode (Yi) </strong></p><p>Abstract: In this study, we introduced a general methodology, three parameter Poisson (3PP) model, for online video-driven discussion (VDD) engagement measurement. To make the model more robust and apply the model in small sample size case, we improved Duplicate, Erase and Replace (DupER) Aug- mentation in 3PP model. Finally, we conducted behavioral analyses to gain insights into patterns of students comment interaction on a video-driven discussion platform, Vialogues, in a real class environment.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>A Text Mining Approach to Measuring Educational Scholarly Impact (Yi) </strong></p><p>Abstract: Identifying influential articles in a corpus is an important and challenging problem in educational research. Scholarly impact has typically been equated with the citation count. However, these methods do not pay enough attention to the context of articles. Continuous improvements in text mining techniques present new opportunities for measuring scholarly impact beyond citation-analysis. But few studies have been done applying these methods in educational research with real world data. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach to measuring educational scholarly impact based on text mining. About 2000 articles from the Teachers College Record from 1995 to 2016 have been analyzed. We also discuss the potential and the challenges of applying text mining in bibliometrics.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Designing an Online Library Archive for a Learning Ecosystem (George)</strong></p><p>Institutional repositories have made it possible for institutions to archive the intellectual work by members of the community. This has opened an array of opportunities for contributors, visitors, and the institutions to share their this work with a broader audience. However, there is a sense that institutional repositories remain empty, ineffective, and underutilized. In this paper, we explore the usage, content, and evolution of PocketKnowledge, the digital repository of a graduate school of education. Our findings offer a glimpse into how the evolution of an institutional repository, through sustained usage by members of the community can contribute a broader institutional learning system.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Challenges and Opportunities of Using Recommendation System in Self-directed Learning (Hui Soo) </strong></p><p>Abstract: In the wake of recent advances in educational technologies and the rapid growth of information, learners are exposed to self-directed learning opportunities that are more adaptive, personalized, and accessible. Such learning opportunities are more important than ever before in an era of accelerating change and increasing competition. Earlier research on self-directed learning has not considered the role of affordances made possible by Big Data techniques such as automated recommendation systems. While there has been considerable discussion of commercial recommendation systems, such discussions have not typically considered them in the context of education. In this paper we discuss recommendation systems and the role that they might play in self-directed learning. To illustrate we present case study of a hybrid recommendation system on an open library online publication and discuss the challenges and opportunities of using such systems to support self-directed learning.</p>
