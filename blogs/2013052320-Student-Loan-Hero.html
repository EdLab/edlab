<p>Part of the <a href="http://socraticlabs.com/Welcome.html">Socratic Labs</a> inaugural class, <a href="https://studentloanhero.com/">Student Loan Hero</a> was created to help students make sense of their loans and craft thoughtful plans for repayment. The calming, well-designed site offers befuddled former students information about types of loans, interest, and consolidation. Users can integrate their own borrowing information to research different repayment strategies and forge a unique path to debt freedom.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Over <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/03/01/student_debt_tripled_in_eight_years/">37 million Americans</a> have student debt and the delinquency rate on student loans <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/householdcredit/">recently surpassed</a> that of credit card debt. Student Loan Hero acknowledges this rising issue by including diverse repayment options in its educational resources, including detailed information about deferment and forbearance. When users upload personal loan information, the site becomes a repayment lab for experimenting with different payment styles and timelines. The interactive, highly visual interface seems calculated to appeal to digital-native debtors.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site’s individual data comes from the <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/">National Student Loan Data System</a> and does not include private loans unless users manually add them. This data does not update very quickly and will not reflect recent loan changes. The site works as an occasional education destination and place to make thoughtful decisions about strategy, but up-to-date loan information will still need to come from the provider.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Student loan debt is an increasingly common problem for the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2013/03/13/explore-the-role-of-underemployment-in-the-student-debt-crisis">underemployed</a> college-educated population and prospective students facing the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/a-truly-devastating-graph-on-state-higher-education-spending/274199/">rising costs</a> of traditional higher education. Efforts to educate prospective students, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/paying-for-college/">Paying for College</a> program  and the emerging development of low-cost online learning options are working to decrease student debt for those entering college, but sites like Student Loan Hero are helping to manage our real and problematic existing debt.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Student Loan Hero helps users visualize and strategize their way to a debt-free future.</p>
