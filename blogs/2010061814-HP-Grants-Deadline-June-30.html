            HP has some big grant deadlines coming up. Does anyone have a project in the works that could fit under one of these categories? 
<br>
<b>HP Catalyst Initiative</b>
<br>
 

Through the HP Catalyst Initiative, HP is building a global network of consortia that will explore more effective approaches to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. In 2010, each of 5 consortia will receive more than $1 million in technology, cash, and professional assistance. The goal is to create international collaborative “sandboxes” of innovation that will explore what the future of STEM education can look like–a future where students use their technical and creative ingenuity to address urgent social challenges in their communities and around the world. For 2010, this initiative is focused on 11 targeted countries - Brazil, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Kenya, India, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States. For more information, visit www.hp.com/go/hpcatalyst.
