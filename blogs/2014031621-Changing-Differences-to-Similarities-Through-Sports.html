            As true for most aspects of life, there are cultural and religious differences that are very obvious. However, sports is teaching a new generation to love and work together for a common goal despite obvious differences. This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/sports/hockey/harmony-in-a-land-of-milk-honey-and-pucks.html?smid=tw-nytimes&_r=1">article by the New York Times</a> highlights this situation. A youth program in Canada, with a host of members from different cultures and religions, is using hockey as a bridge to bring the members together. 

About 58% of members in the program are Jewish, and the remaining 42% consisting of Muslims, Christians and other religious groups. The young athletes do not consider their differences as barriers but rather as a strength since teamwork will lead to greater success on and off the ice. My team at BMCC consists of individuals from different countries and religious beliefs. Our differences has never been a barrier to my team but has rather strengthened us. I have learned a lot of conversational French phrases and vocabularies from my French teammates and they also learn my native language, Twi. After our season ended, we held a potluck team party where everyone was given the opportunity to share some aspect of their culture. My team has really become like a family because our differences in culture and religion only means similarities to us and urges as to work as a team to achieve a common goal. 

What are some ways and activities educators and coaches can create to make sure students are always learning about other cultures and religions, especially if their school is in a diverse setting?
