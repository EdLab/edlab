          <p>
            This past weekend I attended a really interesting series of lectures at the MIT Museum in Cambridge, MA. The event was called <a href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/forum/program-presenters.html">"Photons, Neurons and Bits: Holography for the 21st Century."</a> I thought it would be interesting to report back on this event as a way of starting a conversation about designing content for new forms of digital output. Specifically, I wonder how you envision the landscape of educational media evolving (if at all) as "3D ready" screens become more prominent on our desktops and in our living rooms. How might this new type of content inspire creativity, communication, and interaction? How might widely accessible 3D displays impact learning in the future?<!--break-->

So, what <b>IS</b> the future of 3D, you may ask?
Well, for one thing, with the large number of "3D ready" TVs coming onto the market, a lot of people are getting excited about the potential for the movie industry (and individuals) to create more material than ever before for viewing in stereo-vision (a different image is seen by each eye, giving the effect of depth). This distribution/display issue is perhaps the biggest hurdle to sharing 3D image content.

The presentations included overviews of current MIT research into imaging and displays. There was also a nice mix of old and new, so to speak, which made the MIT Museum the perfect host for the event. The MIT Museum has the world's largest holography collection, and it's also working to keep its collection current as new material is created within the 3D imaging field. MIT President Emeritus and current President of the US National Academy of Engineering, Charles Vest, gave an overview of the history of holographic imaging on Friday night. Saturday was filled with a combination of presentations by engineers and artists. I loved <a href="http://www.shadowyfigures.com/">Paula Dawson's</a> discussion of using a haptic stylus to draw in 3D. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/vlb/www/retina.html">Elizabeth Goldring</a> presented her creative work with retinal images, and she showed us the new portable camera (developed at the MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies) that allows her to see photographs as she takes them, despite her severly impaired vision. 

There were also a number of presentations on display-related work underway at MIT. Ankit Mohan presented the <a href="http://cameraculture.media.mit.edu/">Camera Culture Group</a> research - one of their best demos is a photograph that can be lit with real light. (Imagine a photograph whose reflections and shadows change as a real-world light source moves in front of the image.) I also enjoyed Mike Bove and Dan Smalley's update on Holographic Video research. This work has been underway for years at MIT, and they really are making exciting headway. The holovideo system that I knew when I was at MIT 5 years ago filled a room -- it was huge. It has been rebuilt now with pocket-sized components. Exciting stuff.

As I look around the EdLab, I see a lot of people thinking about how to present innovative screen-based media such as videos, motion graphics, computer games, and web sites. As we look forward to the library of the future, I'm excited to think about how we can harness three dimensionality and other techniques to promote possibilities for the future of learning.
