<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/read-me-stories-childrens/id362042422?mt=8#">Read Me Stories</a> provides young readers illustrated digital stories on their tablets. Youngsters can read along with highlighted text while the story is narrated by its cartoon protagonists. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Read Me Stories is a fun storytelling app. The stories have spunk, inviting readers into a brave new narrative world. The app offers a wide range of titles including <i>The Frogathon Games</i>, <i>Tales of Life</i>, <i>Animals 1</i>, and, you guessed it, <i>Animals 2</i>. Most kids should be able to pick the perfect tale from the growing library. </p>
 
<p>Read Me Stories shares a trove of age-appropriate morality tales. For example, <i>Tuffy’s First Adventure</i> whisks readers away with a mischievous young horse as he learns valuable life lessons after leaving his team and getting lost in a dark forest. The vocabulary is simple, direct, and easy to understand. To its credit, Read Me Stories tells uplifting tales to teach students reading with an underlying positive message. The stories challenge readers without being overwhelming. </p>

</p>The illustrations are detailed and immersive and sound effects like galloping hooves weave throughout stately tunes. The app is easily navigable; for example, you can replay story segments in a snap at the push of the rewind button. The text is bright white and shifts seamlessly to yellow to highlight what you are reading. Older users can turn off the audio and read on their own to scaffold learning at their own pace. As such, Read Me Stories could be a welcome companion for emerging readers. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The stories in this app might be too long for young readers who have short attention spans. As a result, unless a child is a deeply devoted reader, he or she may lose interest before reaching the end of a lengthy tale. On a similar note, the app’s simple interface allows struggling readers to flip through the stories without testing for comprehension. Having an adult discuss the story’s themes one-on-one afterwards might promote greater understanding. </p>

<p>The only other drawback is the inclusion of extra information that could over-complicate the user experience; each book section ends with glowing circles that hover over the characters depicted in each scene. Pressing the circle provides inner monologues presumably to develop empathy for each character’s plight, but it's easy to see how cutting this feature could simplify a sometimes busy app.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Although the jury is out on whether tablets improve reading, narrative apps widen parental options for struggling readers. Read Me Stories offers quality storytelling that helps kids enter the endlessly imaginative world of reading.</p>
