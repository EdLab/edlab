<strong>From the Publisher:</strong>

"If you’re thinking about choosing teaching as a career, read this book. Becoming a Win-Win Teacher gives you the courage to lead, the power to innovate, and the perspective to find joy and success in this satisfying, sometimes frustrating, always honorable career. Bluestein has coached thousands of teachers from all states and countries around the globe. She has listened to their questions and spoken with their supervisors and colleagues. In this book, she shows that she knows what it means when beginning teachers stand in front of students those first weeks, ‘curriculum smart’ yet ‘classroom shaky.’ This book is a keeper." (Leanna Landsmann, Author, A+ Advice for Parents )

"Going from being a student to being a teacher is a huge transition, and Bluestein's information helps bridge this gap. The chapter activities give the opportunity for personal reflection, which is essential for developing confidence in teaching skills. The quotes interspersed throughout the book are inspirational for all educators and help keep a positive attitude during those less-than-perfect days. Becoming a Win-Win Teacher gives a novice educator every tool to help develop a successful career and professional identity. It should be in the hands of every educator." (Suzanne Goodison, Principal )
