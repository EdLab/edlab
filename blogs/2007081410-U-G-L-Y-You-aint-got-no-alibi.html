            You ugg-lay. 

Chris Rock once said in a <a href=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/96/96emono.phtml>SNL monologue</a> “So, what's sexual harassment? When an ugly man wants some? ‘Oh, he ugly! Call the police! Call the authority!'” 

I once asked my girlfriends out of curiosity what their reactions would be if both an ugly man and a good looking man did something like, say, pinch their butt. All replied more or less, the same answer: dismember the ugly one for being a chauvinist pig, but flirt with the good looking one? Yeah. 

Upon seeing pictures of “actresses” and “singers” (have you <i>seen</i> the Jessica's [<a href= http://www.hollywoodtuna.com/?cat=33>Biel</a> and <a href= http://egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/jessica-alba/jessica-alba-is-super-sexy-in-gq-uk-002600>Alba</a>] in their respective GQ spreads? This is just to name a few, mind you) practically naked on magazine spreads or photos, my first reaction is “good lord, what on earth is she <i>wearing</i>??” Then, I shrug it off with a “damn, I don't blame her, if <i>I</i> looked like her, I'd probably wear that too!” 

Yeah, yeah, I know. 

In my freshman year, I took a Women's Studies course. The range and diversity of girls in that class varied greatly, as did our attitudes, especially when it came to physical beauty, chivalry, and how men reacted to us. One day, after a particularly drawn-out debate, our professor, with a twinkle in her eye, asked us to embark on a weeklong “experiment”; we were asked to dress and act in a manner completely different from the way we normally were. Hence, us unsuspecting lasses trotted out to face the bad, bad world for a week in skins that were not our own. 

We reported back the next week, baffled, bewildered, and properly traumatized. Several girls recanted, shuddering, of having had to “dress and act” like a man — no makeup, no skirts, no washed hair, and get this — <i>no shaving</i> (that particular girl nearly burst into hysterics when recalling that her boyfriend had tried to stroke her leg one night when he was feeling amorous). Others like myself, grit our teeth when recalling the humiliation we had suffered when walking around feeling like clowns in stiff makeup and too-short skirts. 

Both sides of girls reached the same consensus though; those who had gone “butch” said that there was a definite drop in chivalry and attention from men. For those who had gone “femme” reported that there had been an increased (and startling) amount of attention and flirtation. 

It's true. As opposed to my normal getup (blank face, grungy hoodies, and hands shoved in pockets), not only did men react more lively (and kindlier) to me when I approached them bright, smiling, all made up and in a pretty skirt, but <u><b>women</u></b> were also quicker to warm up to me as well (girls that I normally sat next to in lecture suddenly took notice and struck up conversations and friendly chitchat). Never mind what they say about “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” and all that shebang about beauty being only skin deep — no matter how much we try to downplay it and ignore it, appearances (and plastic surgery) play a factor in how people interact with each other. 

You often hear those silly news quips about studies finding that beauty has the same effect as cocaine on the male brain (yes, this was published), and how babies are more likely to stare at pretty people and ignore ugly people. But exactly how true is it? 

It happens all about us, we just don't take notice of it. When a friend announces that she/he has interest in someone, the first question shot at them is “is she/he hot?” When things go badly between them, you might console them by saying “seriously, you're better off - you're so much hotter than him/her,” or “her loss, she was ugly anyway, look at her (insert physical deformity or inadequacy here)”. 

When we first meet someone, we don't automatically think “wow, this person has amazing thoughts and ideas!” We're busy registering and memorizing their features and physical appearance — how they dress, how they gesture, how they wear their hair and their clothes (oh yeah, for some people, their shoes). It's only later, after we get to know them that we can see and appreciate their personalities and inner beauty. 

Beauty isn't everything in this world. Old age makes sure that in the end, we all look equally decrepit and saggy. And there is a saying that goes, “beauty may boil the blood, but not the kettle.” 

PS: This post made me think of a movie I watched earlier this summer, called "200 lbs of Beauty". It ties into the blog, seeing that it's about an overly obese girl who decides that plastic surgery will improve her life. I found the movie (however broken up and segmented) on youtube with subtitles. Enjoy.
