          <p>
            Literally.  I came across <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/111376/the-unschooled#">this blog post</a> while researching <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/section/High%20Five/">High Five leads</a> for <a href="http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/">New Learning Times</a>.  This post struck me for a number of reasons: 

<b>1)</b> The author's pompous language provides some of the best reasons NOT go to college.

<blockquote>
The only form of knowledge that can be adequately acquired without the help of a teacher, and without the humility of a student, is information, which is the lowest form of knowledge. 
</blockquote>

<b>2)</b> The author also provides some of the best arguments as to the value of teachers, learning the Humanities and reason TO go to the recently maligned "liberal arts" college.  

<blockquote>
Entrepreneurship is not a full human education, and living is never just succeeding, and the humanities are always pertinent. In pain or in sorrow, who needs a quant? There are enormities of experience, horrors, crimes, disasters, tragedies, which revive the appetite for wisdom, and for the old sources, however imprecise, of wisdomâ€“a massacre of schoolchildren, for example.
</blockquote>

<b>3)</b> I had just read <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/31/in-2013-heres-why-well-seriously-consider-alternatives-to-higher-ed/">this blog post</a> by the founder of the UnCollege movement (much maligned in the above post) and it provided a lovely case of cognitive dissonance. 

Here is what the former author wrote about the founder of this anti-college movement: 

<blockquote>
His head is not in the clouds. His head is in the cloud. Instead of spending money on college, he is making money on apps. In place of an education, he has entrepreneurship. This preference often comes with the assurance that entrepreneurship is itself an education.
</blockquote>

What do you think?  Could entrepreneurship be considered an "education?" After reading both of the blog posts listed above are you still adamantly "pro" or "Un" College?  

<b>EdLab Relevance...</b>
How can we apply this thinking to creating meaningful courses on "edupreneurship" for both LaunchPad and mSchool?
