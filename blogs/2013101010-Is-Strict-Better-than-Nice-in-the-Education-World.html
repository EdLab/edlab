            <p>Is strict better than nice? This op-ed article <a href= "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304213904579095303368899132.html?mod=WSJ_Books_LS_Books_5">Why Tough Teachers Get Good Grades</a> explores the importance of a "tough" teacher -- one who doesn't sugarcoat your failures or sacrifice criticism in fear of hurting your feelings. The author argues that we should "revive old-fashioned" educational techniques, encouraging repetition and moderately stressful scenarios which will make students stronger and more confident in the end. </p>

<p>Lipman even goes on to suggest that our current "praise-centered" teaching methods are to blame for the education crisis. I think there's definitely something to be said for old school teaching styles. When I was in 4th grade, I had a teacher that made us listen to multiplication problems on this old-fashioned record player, and every week he would increase the speed of the recording and we had to jot down the answers as quickly as we could. After a while, I didn't even have to think about the problem--the answer just came automatically. I definitely credit my success in grade-school math to that teacher's "drill and memorization" method. But I also think we shouldn't revert back to old techniques just because they "worked back then." </p>

<p>The main points in <a href= "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304213904579095303368899132.html?mod=WSJ_Books_LS_Books_5">Lipman's article </a>are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A little pain is good for you
<li>Drill
<li>Failure is an option
<li>Strict is better than nice
<li>Creativity can be learned
<li>Grit trumps talent
<li>Praise makes you weak
<li>Stress makes you strong
</ul>

<p>I don't think I agree with <i>all</i> of these points (nice is TOTALLY better than strict and praise is needed sometimes!) but she does raise some good information to consider...</p>
