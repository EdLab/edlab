          <p>
            There was an article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/business/more-young-americans-out-of-high-school-are-also-out-of-work.html?_r=1&ref=education">New York Times this morning about young adults who graduate from high school and have a hard time finding and holding onto work</a> Many students in the article mention that they had hoped they would go to college after high school, but they are unable to attend college due to financial constraints and family obligations. Without a college diploma they don't feel prepared for a career and they are struggling financially.

 I wonder where online learning and digital degrees come into play? In NYC there are many ads for online degrees on subways that are directed to high school graduates with young children and busy lives. Online degrees are marketed as affordable and flexible. But, are online degree courses fulfilling the need to educate high school graduates that are unable to attend traditional college courses? Are the programs that are targeting this population taken seriously? If not, I wonder how online learning could be shaped to help educate these young adults and be taken seriously?  

Recently online schools are trying to build up their reputation and gain academic respect. I think there is an important balance that must be aimed for with the future of online learning. Online degree courses must work hard to prove that the work they demand from students is legitimate and worthwhile, but the population of financially strapped high school graduates is a population that could benefit from online learning and must not be ignored.
