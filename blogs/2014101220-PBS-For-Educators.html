<p><i>"PBS LearningMedia is your destination for direct access to thousands of classroom-ready, curriculum-targeted digital resources. PBS LearningMedia builds on the strength of public media and is designed to improve teacher effectiveness and student achievement."</i> (from the <a href=" http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/">PBS LearningMedia site</a>)</p>

<p>If you are a teacher, student, or parent looking for exhaustive, vetted, creative and experience-based resources, then this recently created PBS <a href=" http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/">LearningMedia</a> site is for you. PBS has had a significant history of impact in news, art, and education since its start in the 1970s. This latest venture: developing educational resources for students, teachers, and families, is nothing short of comprehensive and filled with opportunities for discovery.</p>

<p><b>Teacher Resources</b><br>
PBS LearningMedia encourages sharing and resource collaboration among teachers. The site is free at its basic level, so recruiting educator colleagues to join the network is easy. The site features a bevy of tools for teachers to choose from, including "The Lesson Builder," the "Quiz Maker" and countless other resources, such as videos and documents that can be incorporated into ready made resources.</p>

<p>The site also has a portal for students and a page to give students access to teachers for homework support. Are you teaching in Spanish? Or an ESL class? The site boasts over seven hundred resources in Spanish. And for all teachers, the site has an interactive professional development page that teaches educators innovative practices through real life case studies. For example, one professional development opportunity instructs teachers in how to build self-paced lesson plans.</p>
 
<p><b>Standards</b><br>
Creativity is not the antithesis of standards. All of LearningMediaâ€™s resources are aligned with Common Core and national standards. These experience-based, high-quality, and interactive educational resources will help students stay engaged and meet Common Core standards. Resources include interactive videos, audio, documents, and in-depth lesson plans with quizzes for evaluation. Resources can be easily browsed by standard, as well as by grade-level and subject area.</p>

<p><b>Just the Beginning</b><br>
The LearningMedia site links to a host of other sites run by PBS, including the Point of View (POV) series that has videos geared towards high school students and a group called SCI girls that promotes STEM.</p>
