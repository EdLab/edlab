          <p>
            <p>Last weekend, I took the time to watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7681902/">"Won't You Be My Neighbor?"</a>, the 2018 documentary about Fred Rogers, host of the children's television show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which ran for 31 seasons on public television. In line with the documentary's almost ubiquitous raving reviews, I greatly enjoyed the film and was inspired by its protagonist. I was equally inspired, however, by the doctumentary's perceived relevance for diverse fields. A quick Google search led me to a Forbes' article entitled "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceweinstein/2018/07/02/how-mister-rogers-can-make-you-a-more-effective-leader/#6dbfc52257bf" target="_blank">How Mister Rogers Can Make You a More Effective Leader</a>" and a post by Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute naming "<a href="https://medium.com/@KPWaResearch/6-ideas-from-the-mister-rogers-movie-that-apply-to-health-care-af4c657fdfad" target="_blank">6 ideas from the Mister Rogers movie that apply to health care</a>." I did not, however, find an article referencing the film's relevance for education. But given that Fred Rogers was a pioneer of television education, "Mister Rogers' Advice for EdTech" seems warranted and welcome.</p><p><br /></p><p>While there are many messages for educators embedded in documentary, one stood out to me with special prominence. "When I look at the camera," Fred explains, "I imagine I'm talking with one person. Not a specific person, but one person." This single line, I think, explains the magnetic power of Fred Rogers both in person and on screen. He talks, not to children or people in general, but to me. His presence and manner communicates his deep appreciation of my personal dignity. It is this expression of dignity, I think, that reduces viewers from Forbes and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/movies/wont-you-be-my-neighbor-review-mister-rogers.html">New York Times</a> to tears. I admit, I cried too.</p><p><br /></p><p>It seems right to remember that no matter how mass-produced or accessible the technology and tools educators develop are, at the other end of the screen is a personâ€”one person.</p>
