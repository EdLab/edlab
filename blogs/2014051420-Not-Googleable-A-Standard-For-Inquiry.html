<p>If we can have all the information at our fingertips with Google, how can children learn to ask better questions? Join Stephanie Cerda, an elementary school teacher in Texas, as she discusses her project of using design thinking to help students learn to generate better questions. Cerda learned some surprising lessons along the way. "In terms of the biggest impact, I knew that our questioning would change. What I didn't account for was the social and emotional aspect."</p>

<p>The idea of a question that is not Googleable comes from the philosophy at NoTosh. Ewan McIntosh, founder of NoTosh, says that todayâ€™s students need to know how to problem solve the right problems. They need to know how to ask the right questions. These two things (asking questions and problem solving) are interrelated and for McIntosh, a good litmus test on whether a problem is worth solving or a question is worth asking is if it can be answered/ solved with a quick Google search. By teaching students to improve and refine their questions, more quality learning can take place. As the <a href= "http://notosh.com/">NoTosh website</a> says, the process of making questions explicit allows teachers to "cut to the higher order thinking so much quicker."</p>

<b>@02:51 welmer:</b> The only non googleable questions kids might have would be simple addition problems. The calculator on the computer is a separate...<p>
