          <p>
            I embarked on this quest for information in the course of preparing to meet with students in a mathematics education research seminar.  I wanted to find a good sample topic to explore in various databases and resources as a way of illustrating how best to find relevant materials for one’s research.  I remembered the concept of “thought problems” from somewhere in the recesses of my memory of my own (long-abandoned) math and science education, and I thought the subject might yield some valuable insights on the ins and outs of largely online searching.

I thought I’d start my search with ERIC, pretty much the standard resource in education, and I chose the version of it available through Ebsco (as opposed to the Proquest version on the top page of our website or the U.S. government version at <a href="http://eric.ed.gov/">http://eric.ed.gov</a>.   (You get to Ebsco ERIC from the secondary Databases page on the library’s website.)    I typed the phrase <em>thought problem*</em> in quotes (with an asterisk following problem to pick up singular or plural forms of the word) in the first search box, and the word <em>math*</em> (also truncated as with <em>problem*</em>) in the second box, to find the intersection of the two concepts.

The search yielded 10 pretty solid looking citations for both ERIC documents (non-journal, general unpublished works) and journal articles.  I found that what were presented as links to <strong>Full Text from ERIC </strong>didn’t in many cases lead to the actual full text of documents (that’s a story for another day), that the library’s Article Linker feature for journal articles in most cases didn’t directly to articles made available through our subscriptions, but that full text was ultimately found to be available through Columbia’s e-resources (also a story for another day).  This journey has most to do with the identification of relevant material pertaining to the subject matter, not so much with the actual retrieval of the documents (which is ultimately more and more possible, by one means or another).

I decided to experiment with increasing my retrieval in ERIC by removing the second search term <em>math*</em> and searching simply by <em>“thought problem*”</em>.  I found that this boosted my retrieval to 43 results, but at this point I realized that I was dealing with an unforeseen linguistic ambiguity in my search, i.e., I found that I was retrieving articles and documents concerned with <em>thinking</em> problems or disorders (i.e., problems <em>with</em> thought), and it was immediately clear how important in this case the modifying element <em>math*</em> was in keeping the focus on pedagogical strategies for promoting mathematical problem solving skills.

I next used a feature specific to Ebsco databases, the ability to select additional databases to search simultaneously with the initially chosen database, adding <em>Education Full Text</em>, <em>Education Index Retrospective</em>, <em>Education Research Complete</em>, and <em>Professional Development Collection</em> to the search:

Expanding the search in this way more than doubled the retrieval from ERIC alone, from 10 results to 24.  A fair number of these referred to a series titled “Food for Thought” problems that appeared in the journal <em>Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School</em>; these hadn’t been picked up by ERIC, and although the relevance of these articles borders on the tandential, they clearly still deal with the concept of thought problems, even if the adjacency of the words “thought” and “problem” is somewhat coincidental.

To throw the widest nets possible, I decided to try searching SuperSearch, the federated search option available through our library, and Find Articles, the one available through the Columbia University Libraries.  The SuperSearch search, shown below, turned up a total of 42 results, of which around 13 focused particularly on “though problems” as a concept:

The Find Articles search, show below, retrieved a total of 1,225 results, of which the first few pages seemed pretty much on target, though increasingly interspersed with articles dealing with disorders of thinking unrelated to mathematics or problem solving.

Finally, I tried a Google Scholar search, shown below, that yielded 993 results, the first few pages of which looked to be quite relevant to the topic:

In searching more and more inclusive bodies of literature, I found increasingly confirmation of the legitimacy of the concept I was searching, though I had some doubts at the initial stages of the search.  I found the absence of official subject terms or descriptors for this pedagogical approach a little surprising; I eventually stumbled on the ERIC descriptor <em>Word Problems (Mathematics)</em>, defined as “Mathematical problems expressed in narrative form – answered by conversion of the circumstances to equivalent computations or equations, which can be solved arithmetically, algebraically, or with symbolic logic.”  Interestingly, though, I found no coalescence between documents indexed under this term and ones specifically dealing with thought problems.  ERIC also uses the description Problem Sets, defined as “Tasks, exercises, or test questions dealing with a specified educational subject or content area,” but I found only a single case where the term intersected with an article dealing explicitly with thought problems.  It also crossed my mind that the term I really wanted was “thought experiments,” and I did find that combining this term with “math*” in ERIC yielded 25 documents, most of which appeared to be fairly germane to the concept I originally set out to explore.

Is this term or concept in reality, though, synonymous with the term or concept “thought problem”?  What would be the next step to determine the answer to this?  The journey continues.  What I find fascinating about this particular example is how well it epitomizes some of the natural pitfalls of database searching, to the extent that the language and its inherent ambiguities underlie everything, and that success in searching is almost always a matter of outsmarting the language.
