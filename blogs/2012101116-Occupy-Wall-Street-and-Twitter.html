          <p>
            The ever-increasing debate about user privacy and ownership of social media accounts recently took an interesting turn when <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/09/14/twitter-hands-over-records-in-occupy-wall-street-case/">Twitter agreed to turn over records</a> for an Occupy Wall Street protestor facing criminal charges. Prosecutors allege that Malcolm Harris, one of the leaders for the initial wave of protests that subsequently gained national and global attention, ignored police warnings and signs forbidding protestors to stay off the roadway. Prosecutors further allege Harris knowingly ignored police requests and his tweets reflected his blatant disregard for the law.
 
Since tweets are automatically removed from users' newsfeed after a certain time by Twitter and stored electronically, prosecutors requested Twitter to hand over Harris' tweets during the timeframe in question. After initially balking at the requested, Twitter finally agreed to hand it over Harris' tweets to the prosecutors after a judge threatened them with heavy fines. As expected, Harris is not too happy with the turn of events and argued that his free association rights and privacy were violated. Twitter, in its user agreement, informs users they own all content they post and as such, they argued Harris could have fought the subpoena on his own. Therein lies the problem: Twitter stores the records of user content yet user is owner of their content.
 
I think this case is the first of many that will be occurring as law enforcement agencies continue to monitor social sites to track suspects or generate evidence for prosecutions. What do you think of this case and its potential implications?
