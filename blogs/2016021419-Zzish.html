<p><i>"One of our missions at Zzish is to make it really easy for teachers to understand student strengths and weaknesses in real-time. This means you, the teacher, can deliver personalised and differentiated teaching instantly in the classroom. Isn’t that what teaching is all about?"</i> (<a href=" http://blog.zzish.com/ ">About Zzish</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Developing Competence</b></p>
 
<p>Have you always wanted to refine your edtech app but didn't know where to start? <a href=" https://www.zzish.com/ ">Zzish</a> provides an online infrastructure to develop your mobile app and add a dashboard so that teachers can see student work. Zzish hopes to make learning from mobile apps cheap and easy, democratizing education.</p>
 
<p><b>Many Parts, One Goal</b></p>
 
<p>Edtech abounds, but sophisticated edtech products are rare. Unfortunately, most of the approximately 100,000 educational apps in existence do not have a teacher dashboard. As a result, it is difficult for teachers to have an accurate sense of student progress especially when it comes to digital learning. To that end, the Zzish Learning Hub allows any developer to add a Zzish dashboard to their app quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>The Zzish team believes that creating meaningful relationships with teachers, students, and schools is the best way to develop products. To build community, they invite educational institutions to become Zzish Hub Schools. This lets these institutions have access to the most recently developed educational tools. It also provides collaborative opportunities with the best educational app developers.</p>
 
<p><b>Deploying Dashboards for Teachers</b></p>
 
<p>Zzish utilizes the power of dashboards to promote learning. Its "live dashboard" provides real-time feedback regarding student progress. Due to this functionality, teachers can easily identify students who are progressing as well as those who are experiencing difficulties. But this feedback isn’t exclusively for teachers. Teachers can display student progress on a classroom electronic whiteboard to promote engagement across the class.</p>
 
<p>On a similar note, Zzish also provides a "progress dashboard." This technology allows teachers to have an historical overview of student achievement. As a result, identifying students who need additional assistance to reach the same level as their peers is simplified. Pairing these dashboards with Zzish’s Quizalize quiz web app can help integrate testing and monitoring in a simple manner and improve digital learning. </p>
