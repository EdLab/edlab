<p><i>"We believe learning should be an enjoyable, social experience, so our courses offer the opportunity to discuss what you’re learning with others as you go, helping you make fresh discoveries and form new ideas."</i> (from the <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn site</a>)</p>

<p><b>Education is Infectious</b><br>
<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> is an online learning platform that offers a variety of free courses from leading institutions and universities around the globe. The private company has over 40 years of experience in distance learning and online education and has partnered with institutions in the UK, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Most classes range from six to ten weeks but can be as short as two weeks. Classes are organized into categories based on the topic and each class contains a detailed description of the material to be covered. Additionally, each course provides an estimated number of hours per week that should be dedicated as well as whether the class offers a certificate of mastery following its completion. All FutureLearn educators have a profile that details their expertise in the field and other courses they offer.</p>

<p><b>Learning Through Story-telling</b><br>
FutureLearn offerings are different than other mass open-access courses in that they do not contain recordings of lengthy lectures, but rather collections of high-quality videos and articles designed to keep learners interested and engaged. FutureLearn is a personalized and collaborative learning experience, where ideas are shared and discussed among learners on a conversational level. Each course comes with a checklist of concepts and materials, giving learners a visual representation of the items they’ve mastered and the ones they’ve yet to explore. Users create profiles and are encouraged to network with their fellow learners in order to develop a friendly, supportive community. FutureLearn relies on its learners to contribute to the community supported learning environment, assist fellow learners with advice and instruction and add to the overall knowledge base.</p>
