<p><b>Title:</b> The Effect of WebBlog Based Instruction on the Metacognition Levels of Preservice Teachers (2010)</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> Burhan Akpunar</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/906340905">International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do pre-service student teachers have increased levels of metacognition in an online course designed to develop metacognitive practices?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>  The study employed an online blog designed to develop metacognitive practices.  A sample of 152 student teachers from a pool of 1,370 were selected at Firat University Faculty of Education. The selected students participated in the four-week study (76 were in the control group and 76 in the experimental group) during the 2010-2011 academic year. The experimental group was taught using the online program and the control group was taught in a face-to-face classroom with teachers adhering to a lecture followed by opportunities for questions and answers. The data was collected and analyzed using a metacognitive inventory scale. </p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The study found that the experimental group had increased metacognitive ability.  The author attributes this to the fact that the online program fostered group interaction, which helps to develop metacognitive ability. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The study shows that an online program <i>designed</i> to increase metacognitive abilities is more effective in teaching metacognition than a traditional lecture followed by a Q & A format. A face-to-face course designed to increase metacognitive ability could have similar effects. The question may be more the design of the course rather than its medium. This seems to be the key take-away for digital teachers and curriculum designers: intentionally align desired outcomes with pedagogical practices. For the purposes of developing metacognitive practices, a collaborative space with built-in time for reflection seems key. Such a space will allow students to reap the benefits of metacognition.</p>
