I wanted to write a little on the the work Zhou, Pranav, Megha, Hui Soo and I have been doing for the Educational Data Mining conference. 

We are looking at usage patterns of Vialogues using Latent Semantic Analysis, a method we talked about at the D&R meeting a few weeks ago (reference attached). In short, LSA is a matrix method that analyzes relationships between documents and terms within the documents by determining a set of topics that represent the sample. LSA is based on the assumption that words that are close in meaning will occur close together in text. We first plan to show that LSA is an accurate method for identifying the topics discussed in both coordinated and un-coordinated discussion threads. We will then examine whether the time-coded comments are relevant to the appropriate parts of the video and how a discussion evolves in this environment. This should give us some idea of whether the time-coded comments are being used as designed. 

The procedure is to transcribe 10 Vialogues (thanks to George, Fred, Danny, Duncan, and Oumar) and run the transcripts along with the comments through LSA. We will compare the results with human coded designations of how closely the comment matches the topic of the video both overall and at the corresponding time. The level of similarity will be chosen on a Likert scale. This type of analysis can be the basis of a couple potentially neat applications including, but not limited to, a tool for moderators to monitor their vialogues, a dynamic method to recommend additional videos based on the current topic of discussion, and a grading system for the discussion. 

We are doing the analysis in R, as there is a nice LSA package available (and it's all free). After some wrestling, R has proven to be an incredibly powerful and flexible tool and I'm sure we'll be using it more going forward. We are still unsure the best way to display the results, as the resulting matrices will most certainly contain more that 3 dimensions, and slimming that down to something we can visualize might get rid of some important relationships.

If anyone has any thoughts on the procedure or other interesting things we might do with this, please let me know!
