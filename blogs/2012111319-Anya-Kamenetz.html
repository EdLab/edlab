<i>DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education is my new book about the future of higher education. It’s a story about the communities of visionaries who are tackling the enormous challenges of cost, access, and quality in higher ed, using new technologies to bring us a revolution in higher learning that is affordable, accessible, and learner-centered.</i> 

<p>
<b>From Debt to DIY-U</b>
<p>
Known most for her work raising awareness around the impact of student loan debt on Generation Y, Anya Kamenetz has now broadened her focus to include the Do-it-yourself education (DIY-U) movement.  This DIY-U trend criticizes the expense, inaccessibility and lack of "real-world" relevance of the modern, traditional post-secondary system.  DIY-U is often used interchangeably with the term "Edupunk" with both movements emphasizing credentialing and certification outside formal education settings.  Ironically, Kamenetz whose parents are both professors of English at Louisiana State University has taken a more traditional educational route herself, first, at a high school in Baton Rouge, then, at Yale University from which she graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2002.  Kamenetz is currently a Senior writer at Fast Company magazine and is the author of several books and e-books including Generation Debt (Riverhead, 2006), DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education (Chelsea Green, 2010) and a free e-book series.  Kamenetz was also nominated in 2006 for a Pulitzer Prize for her column in The Village Voice, "Generation Debt: The New Economics of Being Young," and she lectures and tours extensively in support of the DIY-U movement. 
<p>
<b>Higher Education Alternatives</b> 
<p>
Despite taking a relatively traditional educational route herself, Kamenetz, has been a leading proponent of cost-effective, alternative ways to go-beyond traditional postsecondary learning.   As she explores in Generation Debt, the need for cheap, accessible and "real-world" relevant alternative credentials is clear. Not only does Kamenetz outline the unique set of challenges facing Generation Y, but she also clearly makes a case for going outside a system that provides little return on student investment.  She suggests that these diminishing "returns" might be the final straw to push this and future generations towards more "alternative" routes.  Her most recent free ebook, <a href="http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/77938">The Edupunks’ Guide to DIY Credentialing</a>, outlines what this might involve and steps for individuals to take, including: engaging with open learning platforms, online courses and skill-specific certification programs.  In a recent <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4316">talk at Harvard’s Berkman Center</a> Kamenetz clearly described this new currency of "open accreditation" that employers might make use of to evaluate potential hires and their competency, including: "badges, portfolios, modular learning and learning tied to specific skills..."  In the same talk, Kamenetz cited research indicating that over 73% of "learning" beyond the secondary level is already happening outside traditional higher education programs."  If learning through non-traditional pathways is already occurring to such a high degree, then perhaps an alternative credentialing ecosystem will become accepted by main-stream employers in the not-to-distant future.   As a journalist and thought leader, she is calling  into question the "golden standard" of post-industrial education, the bachelors degree.  Instead of placing value on obtaining a rapidly devalued diploma, Kamenetz and other edupunks are helping to inspire change that might lead to a cheaper, more effective and less redundant educational system for everyone.
