<p>You’ve heard about flipping classrooms, but what about flipping video games? <a href="http://www.projectpixelpress.com/floors/">Pixel Press Floors</a> does just that by putting users in control of their gaming experience. Without any coding required, players create their own games published to common arcade space for others to play. There are ten glyphs players can use to create different objects in their levels. For instance, an <i>x</i> is a spike and a <i>+</i> is a coin. By drawing these symbols by hand or in the app, kids have free reign over where they want each object placed, meaning the levels can be as diverse as each child’s imagination.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This app gives players an incredible amount of freedom. First, there are three different ways to create levels: drawing by hand (on special graph paper printed from the app’s website), drawing in the app, or editing a pre-formed template. Players create their levels by strategically placing glyphs that become ladders, monkey bars, coins, water traps, and portals. Players also have control over the design elements like main characters, music, templates, coloring, and backgrounds, to name a few. With all of these choices, the app allows for unlimited creativity. This game could provide a platform for collaboration; whether drawing by hand or on an iPad, kids can work together to imagine and create new environments. </p>
 
<p>The arcade feature is also a great addition to the app. In addition to sharing their games with others, kids can keep track of how many people play and like them. Each game has a high-score board publicly displayed, which makes it feel like a true arcade.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although being able to transfer your on-paper designs to the app is an innovative idea, in practice it doesn’t work as well as it could. In order for the app to successfully scan the drawing, the iPad screen must line up perfectly with the image. This is challenging to do; only after several attempts did I finally get it to work. Also, once the app did read the drawing, some of the elements were incorrect. It was much easier to draw the levels in the app itself rather than transferring them from paper.</p>
 
<p>In addition, this app takes a lot of patience to master. The programming is not always intuitive; if you dive straight into the app like I did instead of exploring the online tutorials first, it will take a lot of guess-and-check work to figure things out. For this reason, unless a child is captivated by the app and ambitious to understand the details, she might lose interest quickly.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Pixel Press Floors is challenging, ambitious, and fun. It allows kids to get a different look at video games by creating them. Although no actual coding is involved, players get experience in critical thinking, design, prototyping, and collaboration. In addition, this app allows users to hone their sense of precision and their ability to think through challenging problems. Because the app fosters these skills, some teachers have already found a way to incorporate it into the classroom. Pixel Press Floors may just be the one video game that parents never feel guilty letting their kids play. </p>
