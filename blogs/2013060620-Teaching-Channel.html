<p>Teaching Channel is social video network focused on teacher development. Unlike <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/23">Teacher Wall</a>, the site’s video content primarily consists of classroom teaching demos and instructional strategies rather than asynchronous video conversations between teachers. The teacher communication element of Teaching Channel is its <a href="https://www.teachchannel.org/questions?default=1">Q/A section</a>, which gives educators a text-based space to discuss best practices. The nonprofit site, which is known to its users as "Tch,"  attracts over <a href="http://schedule.sxswedu.com/events/event_OEEDU0196">250,000 visitors</a> per month and features private, in-school networks at the institutional level. The site is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and is highly organized considering its multifaceted approach and proliferation of content.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Many teachers have already contributed videos to what has become an extremely specific database with a focus on teaching the Common Core Standards. Teachers are able to search for specific Common Core lessons and watch their peers’ instructional methods. The videos feature interactive elements like sharing and commenting. Teachers can also take time-stamped notes while watching videos that are saved to their personal profile. One of the most interesting things about Tch is its focus on curation and inspiring users to create quality videos. The site accomplishes this through a PBS television program that broadcasts some of the best videos each week and an email newsletter that highlights exciting content from the site.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Unlike many social sites for teachers, Tch seems to have little patience for anonymity; Teacher profiles feature an activity feed that shows when and which videos teachers have watched. The profiles are essentially publicly accessible and when teachers enter their school information, <a href="http://www.greatschools.org/">Greatschools</a> auto-populates their stats including population, annual spending, and percentage eligible for free lunch. This may be a con for some users, but the real world implications of this strategy may make for a better community on the site.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Teaching Channel is an example of a very teacher-oriented teaching technology. The system was based around DC’s <a href="http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/impact">IMPACT</a> strategy for teacher evaluation. Collaboration is a strong feature of the IMPACT system and Teaching Channel expands on the idea of working collectively towards improvement. Like all professionals, teachers need examples of exemplary peers, good mentors, and clear feedback so they can improve. Teaching Channel is harnessing the power of the web to deliver these materials to educators.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Teaching Channel is taking a diverse approach to educator development.</p>
