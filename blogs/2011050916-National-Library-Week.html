            Each April, the American Library Association promotes the celebration of National Library Week.  Officially, "it is a time to celebrate the contributions of our nation's libraries and librarians and to promote library use and support." (From <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/pio/mediarelationsa/factsheets/nationallibraryweek.cfm">ALA</a>)

Though we're technically a bit late on the recognition  (it was April 10-16th this year) I thought I'd attempt a belated celebration  by breaking librarian stereotype <em>and</em> sharing something librarians love.  (No, not cats or clever quotes about the importance of libraries--though I'll throw some of those in for good measure.)

<img class="alignleft" src="http://photo.goodreads.com/authors/1207678737p5/45539.jpg" alt="" width="102" height="67" />I'm talking information, information about libraries specifically. The twist: this information is posted in an  unlibrarian-ly way.  No peer-reviewed, scholarly or authoritative  sources have been used to verify any of what you'll read in this post, in fact,  I  don't even know if half this stuff is true!  Oh, and did I mention   Bruce Springsteen's involved? And Keith Richards?  Oh yeah. All at the  library. Go on, keep reading.

-Academic librarians answer 56.1 million reference questions each year—reaching almost 10 million more than attend college football games.

-College libraries receive just less than six cents of every dollar spent on higher education.

-There are 542 students enrolled for every librarian in U.S. 2– and 4-year colleges and universities in 2008, as compared with 4.3 students for each teaching faculty member.

-Reference librarians in the nation’s  public and academic libraries  answer nearly 5.7 million questions  weekly. Standing single file, the line of questioners would span from Long Island New York, to Juneau, Alaska.

-Americans go to school, public and academic libraries nearly three times more often than they go to the movies.

<strong>(Unlikely? )Quotes about libraries:</strong>

"I must say that I find television very educational. The minute somebody  turns it on, I go to the library and read a book."  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx">Groucho Marx</a>)

When you are growing up, there are two institutional places that affect  you most powerfully: the church, which belongs to God, and the public  library, which belongs to you. The public library is the great  equalizer."
(<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/45539.Keith_Richards">Keith Richards</a>) (Imagine Keith if he hadn't spent so much time at the library...)
