<p><b>Title:</b> Use of Audio Podcast in K-12 and Higher Education: A Review of Research Topics and Methodologies (2008)<p>

<b>Author:</b> Khe Foon Hew</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-008-9108-3/fulltext.html">Use of Audio Podcast in K-12 and Higher Education: A Review of Research Topics and Methodologies</a> is meant to help educators develop a better understanding of how learners use podcasts. The review provides a summary, critique, and exploration of podcast use in K-12 and higher education. The review focuses on usage profiles, effects on learning outcomes, and instructional aspects and identifies unanswered questions in the literature to propose future research directions.</p>

<p>For this meta-analysis, the researchers evaluated the literature based on podcast-related keywords. The author discarded the theoretical pieces, opinion papers, and studies of non-audio podcasts. The final group contained 30 studies that were sorted using a constant comparative method approach in which the coding scheme was not predetermined but emerged inductively from the data. In this manner, three major research themes were defined: usage profiles, effects of podcasts, and instructional aspects.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Most of the studies considered for the meta-analysis were descriptive and were conducted in traditional higher education course settings. The author found that the most common scenario for podcasting was an instructor distributing podcast recordings of lectures or supplementary materials for students to review in their own time and place. Results from the student self-report studies appeared to suggest that the use of podcasts could enhance student perceived learning, though results were inconclusive in studies that tested student outcomes. The results generally suggested that podcasting had a positive effect on student satisfaction, but no effect on student performance.</p>
 
<p>Student self report studies revealed that students generally enjoy the podcast as a learning tool. Surveyed students tended to listen to the podcasts at home using desktop computers, rather than on the move with a mobile device. The main benefit of podcasting may be that it allows students to listen to specific material as many times as necessary to gain understanding. The availability of podcasts in course materials did not appear to encourage students to skip classes or listen to the podcast in lieu of attending class.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This review revealed a landscape of podcast use in higher education that seems to have a positive effect on student perceived learning. There were no conclusive results regarding the learning impact of podcasts in the classroom so further research should be done on student outcomes, especially in K-12. It is possible that improved integration of podcasts with other teaching and learning activities will be required before actual learning gains can be realized.
