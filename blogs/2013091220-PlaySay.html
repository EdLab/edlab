<p>For students studying a foreign language, a common obstacle to practicing their speaking skills is finding opportunities to converse with a native speaker; it may be hard to connect with someone, commit to a schedule, and cover useful material. <a href="http://www.playsay.com/">PlaySay</a> is a language learning app for iOS that uses speech recognition technology to eliminate those barriers. It facilitates conversation and pronunciation practice for Spanish and English language learners using everyday phrases in structured, practical, mission-based exercises.</p>

<p>By logging in with a Facebook account, users are connected to an existing contact or new friend and invited to start a mission like "go to bar" and "flirt." They are then guided through a conversation in two languages. Both partners are prompted to record a phrase in their own language as a model, exchange those messages, and then record the phrase in the target language. Users receive feedback on pronunciation and repeat the process until the conversation is complete. The app retains conversations to be played back later and awards points, unlocking new missions.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>PlaySay builds on a skill that other apps commonly neglect while incentivizing users with gamified objectives through a social network. Users are encouraged to play multiple games at once and partner with several people of different backgrounds and accents, a feature that increases engagement and targets listening skills as well. All of this is done through simple and colorful navigation with easy step-by-step directions. It only takes a moment to install and begin practicing conversation skills.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Customer reviews indicate that some users are frustrated by the slow response times from their language partners; their ability to progress through exercises at their own pace is hindered by a slow or unresponsive partner. Because the goal is to create a real life conversation, it may be discouraging when that conversation doesn’t happen in real time.</p>

<p>For intermediate-level speakers who want a challenge, it can also be frustrating to start with beginner level exercises and trudge through "Hola, como estás?" without an option to jump ahead. It’s also not clear how accurate the pronunciation correction is. Despite the best advances in speech recognition software, this feature may not be an adequate replacement for a native speaker’s discerning ear. Right now, the app is only available to English and Spanish speakers; earlier this year PlaySay was acquired by Babbel, so perhaps the language options will expand.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>PlaySay is a structured and practical way to learn conversational phrases for beginner-level Spanish and English learners. With many language learning apps to choose from, this stands apart because of its focus on social interaction and communicative activities. However, despite the excitement surrounding this and other apps that approach language in different ways, it’s still no replacement for quality in-class guidance and error correction.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>If you just want to learn some survival Spanish, this app is a fun way to practice.</p>
