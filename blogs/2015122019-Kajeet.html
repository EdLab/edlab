<p><i>"Our story began more than 15 years ago with three dads figuring out how mobile technology, kids and parents work best. Thinking of our own kids, ("Kajeet" is an acronym of the first letters of the names of the company's founders' children), we designed a service to provide them with everything they need to safely explore the exciting world of mobile technology. Whether you’re here to learn more about our Education Broadband™ solution for schools or the Kajeet cell phone service for kids, we want you to know that kids are the center of our universe.
"</i> (<a href="http://www.kajeet.net/about-us">About Us - Kajeet</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Connecting Students to Online Learning</b></p>

<p>One of the most common concerns amidst the increased presence of edtech tools in our lives is the accessibility of those resources outside the classroom. Many students are asked to continue working with the software they use in class when they are at home, but not everyone has access to tech devices or wireless internet. This can be particularly problematic because these students can then be at a disadvantage in their learning progress. <a href="http://www.kajeet.net/">Kajeet</a>, a wireless provider that focuses specifically on children’s use of mobile technology, is looking to change that.</p>

<p>Kajeet’s Education Broadband service comes with a SmartSpot device, a mobile hotspot, and a cloud portal that together allow schools to provide their students with access to the web wherever they are. Because this broadband service is targeted for kids, Kajeet gives schools the ability to filter content and manage time restrictions in order to keep internet usage safe and focused. Kajeet offers this service through two possible plans—one that is managed by the school itself and another that is run by Kajeet, which takes the onus off school staff.</p>

<p><b>Cellphones for Children</b></p>
 
<p>Kajeet’s other primary offering is its cellphone service for kids. Because safety is a priority here as well, the service gives parents the ability to set time restrictions, locate their children, block certain calls, and filter websites.</p>

<p>With mobile technology more and more prevalent—for both educational and non-educational purposes—it is increasingly important to keep students safe without depriving them of the technology and devices that are becoming fundamental to their learning.</p>
