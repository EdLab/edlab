Assessing the Compensation of Public-School Teachers, by Andrew G. Biggs, Jason Richwine, the Heritage Center for Data Analysis

The latest shot fired in the ongoing battle over teacher compensation is a <a href="http://www.aei.org/paper/100259">report</a> from Jason Richwine and Andrew Biggs at the American Enterprise Institute that was released yesterday.  
<!--break-->
<b>Summary</b>: 
The authors begin by noting that arguments over whether public school teachers are over or under-compensated often evolve into arguments over whether they make more than private-sector workers with similar (education and experience) characteristics.  They then run such a comparison, but this time, they argue, while taking into account more (and more accurate factors) than previous analyses.   For instance, rather than using educational qualifications to compare workers in the different sectors, they use an IQ measure (specifically, the Armed Forces Qualification Test).  They also try to include more difficult metrics of compensation than simply salary levels, such as benefits, pensions, and job security.  

They conclude: “public-school teacher salaries are comparable to those paid to similarly skilled private-sector workers, but that more generous fringe benefits for public-school teachers, including greater job security, make total compensation 52% greater than fair market levels.”  Although many of the specific arguments that go into this comparison (how they quantify the economic benefits of job security, for instance) are, well, arguable, I think they've made a strong case.  While I wait for a convincing rebuttal, I'm willing for the moment to believe that teachers' compensations can be significantly reduced without comparable losses in teacher quality.
