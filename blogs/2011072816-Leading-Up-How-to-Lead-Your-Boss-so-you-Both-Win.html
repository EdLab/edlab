<strong>Author:</strong> Michael Useem

<strong>Publisher:</strong> Crown Business, New York, NY (2001)

<strong>Call #:</strong> <a title="Leading Up" href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=Leading+Up%3A+How+to+Lead+Your+Boss+So+You+Both+Win&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">HD57.7 .U83 2001</a>

<strong>From the Publisher:</strong> Today’s best leaders know how to lead up, a necessary strategy when a  supervisor is micromanaging rather than macrothinking, when a division  president offers clear directives but can’t see the future, or when  investors demand instant gain but need long-term growth.  Through vivid,  compelling stories, Michael Useem reveals how upward leadership can  transform incipient disaster into hard-won triumph.  For example, U.S.  Marine Corps General Peter Pace reconciled the conflicting priorities of  six bosses by keeping them well informed and challenging their  instructions when necessary.  Useem also explores what happens when those  who should step forward fail to do so—Mount Everest mountaineers might  have saved themselves from disaster during a fateful ascent if only they  had questioned their guides’ flawed decisions.

<strong></strong>Leading Up is a call to action.  It asks us to get results by helping our superiors  lead and by building on the best in everybody’s nature, and it offers a  pragmatic blueprint for doing so.

<strong>About the Author: </strong> Michael Useem is the William and Jacalyn Egan Professor of Management at  the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania,and director of its  Center for Leadership and Change Management.  Dr. Useem is also the  author of <em>The Leadership Moment</em>.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leading-Up-Lead-Your-Boss/dp/B00005RYZJ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311886109&amp;sr=8-4"><em>Editorial Review</em></a>

Leaders today aren't just bosses, they're self-starters who take charge.  Upward leaders get results by helping their superiors lead.  They make  sure that good ideas don't die on the vine because a boss' understanding  doesn't reach down deep enough into the organization.  Upward leadership  assures that advice arrives from all points on the corporate compass,  not just from the top down.  And it applies at every level: Even CEOs  need to learn about leading up because they ultimately answer to their  boards.

Drawing on the extraordinary experiences of real people, Useem  shows us what happens when those not in charge rise to the challenge,  and also what happens when those who should step forward fail to do so.

	<li>COO  David Pottruck learned how to lead with his superiors at Charles Schwab  &amp; Co. in order to radically change Schwab's core business.</li>
	<li>Had  he been able to convince his superiors of the dire situation in Rwanda,  United Nations commander Romeo Dallaire might have prevented the  genocide that claimed 800,000 lives.</li>
	<li>The CEOs of CBS, Compaq,  and British Airways concentrated on leading down when they needed to  lead up their boards, too.  The result: All three were fired.</li>
	<li>Mount  Everest mountaineers admitted they might have protected themselves and  others from harm during a fateful ascent if only they had questioned  their guides' flawed instructions and decisions.Leading up is not the  same as managing up.  Managing up is running the office; leading up is  taking the reins and exceeding what's expected.  As hierarchies  everywhere shed much of their rigidity, upward leadership at all levels  becomes more possible - and more necessary.  <em>Leading Up</em> is a call to action.  It asks us to build on the best in everybody's nature, and it offers a pragmatic blueprint for doing so.</li>
