<a href="http://www.younginvincibles.org/News/Releases/PUB_Student_Loan_Borrowers_FINAL.pdf">Whitsett, H. C. (2012). High debt, low information: A survey of student loan borrowers. <i>NERA Economic Consulting</i>, 1-27.</a> 

<b>Summary:</b>
<i>High Debt, Low Information</i> is an analysis and series of recommendations put out by <a href="http://www.nera.com/index.htm">NERA</a> based on a survey conducted by a group called the <a href="http://www.younginvincibles.org/">Young Invincibles</a>. The survey reported that 65% of borrowers felt that they misunderstood the terms of their loans and repayment plans during the borrowing process. It looked particularly at high-debt groups, borrowers with outstanding loans of more than $100,000. These borrowers represent the top 5 percent of those with student debt and the majority of these borrowers are young, between 18 and 39. 

The paper recommends policy changes on the micro and macro level to ensure that students are well-informed before borrowing. NERA suggests that colleges take a more active role in educating their students about debt and repayment but also calls for stricter mandates for this education. The entrance and exit counseling now required by law doesn't seem to be effective in communicating the gravity of loan repayment and the paper recommends more thorough counseling including attempts to roll parents and other “adult” debt decision-makers into the education process. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Admittedly, there are problems with this survey. YI approached users of the site <a href="http://forgivestudentloandebt.com/">forgivestudentloandebt.com</a> who had already signed a petition for student loan forgiveness. Despite its flaws, it highlights known problems we've been attempting to address with our UFR efforts. Practical and digestible information about personal finance should be a part of the curriculum and financial literacy education should begin long before students sign off on their first loan. 

Something is clearly wrong with the current entrance and exit counseling aimed at student borrowers, but the exact problem is still unclear. Timing might be an issue, as present-focused 18 to 21-year-olds are often forced to make large financial decisions during the busiest part of the semester. If I remember correctly, the quality and readability of the educational materials offered at the beginning of the borrowing process could also use some attention. The loan-haters might be onto something here.
