<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at The Wealth Factory?</b><br>
<p>As a Global Market Research Analyst for Prudential Financial I was fortunate to learn a myriad of financial tactics and best practices for financial operations. Being a keen investment analyst and data scientist helps when crafting algorithms to impact financial behavior.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at The Wealth Factory will change how students approach financial literacy as they get older?</b><br>
<p>Wealth Factory aims to provide the opportunity for students to learn about financial literacy and have equal access to information, regardless of income level or geographic location.</p>
 
<p>I hope to expose students to financial responsibility, principles, and activities that they wouldn’t normally encounter; to  shift their perspectives, acumen, and behavior to be more financially conscious as they develop and make decisions.</p>
 
<p>I want students to achieve higher income and net worth levels, and to begin life with a financial foundation, save their money, protect their savings and grow it via financially savvy options.</p>
 
<p>Hopefully future students will have less debt, larger savings, higher credit scores and more ownership of real estate as well as small businesses.</p>
 
 <p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence, Gamification, CyberSecurity, and Digital Fabrication</p> 
 
<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to The Wealth Factory?</b><br>
<p>In March 2017, I started working with an Oscar winning producer on the filming of a documentary titled Untapped at SXSW and at incubators across the country. We followed Black tech stars as they rise in the ranks of SXSW, Silicon Valley, and the overall tech industry. Specifically, we highlight the entrepreneurs’ everyday lives, pitching, mentoring sessions, advisory meetings, investor reviews, and even some of their lowest moments. Throughout the film, we review how the industry is receiving these entrepreneurs and the movement in tech to be more inclusive. We also focus on the lack of funding being invested in these companies despite them being the most successful. These entrepreneurs are breaking the mold for race, gender, socio-economic backgrounds, and geographic locations beyond anything ever accomplished in the human race, establishing them as American heroes.</p>
<p>In April 2017, I released a book titled ‘History of the Black Dollar’ at the Center for Global Policy Solutions Color of Wealth Summit, with the foreword written by Dr. Maya Rockeymoore. The book reveals significant economic moments in history that have helped shape America – slavery, sharecropping, convict leasing, Little Rock Nine, Black Wall Street, Civil Rights, The Great Recession, Black Lives Matter and other important milestones – along with highlighting important figures, some lesser known, that have made these Black, financially historical moments possible through their personal diligent efforts. This book aims to help older generations remember, while enlightening younger generations on the progression of America and its direct correlation to the support of Black Americans that will inspire both groups to continuing uplifting economic social justice.</p>
 
<p>June 2017, I created a cartoon titled Princess Angel – The Ninja. It’s about a Black nerdy princess that solves social justice issues through tech. We are currently working on the animations and plan to release the first episode at SXSW 2018.</p>
 
<p>I’m the organizer for EdTech DC; which is currently DC’s largest EdTech Meetup group, and one of its most active.</p>
 
<p>I’m also an active board member for the Charter School Development Corporation in Washington DC and a chair for Global 1000.</p>
