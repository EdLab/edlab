<p><a href="https://www.cell-ed.com">Cell-Ed</a> is a mobile learning platform designed to teach job and language skills to English language learners. The platform offers dozens of hours of mini-lessons geared toward adult learners hoping to enter the workforce in various fields, such as in healthcare and customer service. It was also recently a semi-finalist in the <a href="http://adultliteracy.xprize.org/teams/cell-ed">Barbara Bush Adult Literacy XPrize competition</a>.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Cell-Ed is designed to be <i>cell first</i>, meaning that its courses can be completed entirely with phone calls and text messages rather than via the web (although learners can also access the courses online if they choose). Anyone with a phone and texting plan can partake in these mini-lessons, which are short enough to fit into tiny pockets of time throughout the day. Learners simultaneously listen to a phone call and respond via text to the questions posed, so there is both auditory and literacy practice. The lessons focus on two areas: English language learning and job skills. Learners practice English by answering questions about real-life potential dialogue scenarios in a workplace. These involve customer service questions, idioms, and employer requests.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It’s great that Cell-Ed provides lessons over cell service, but not all of the questions I was sent via text translated correctly. Specifically, the images intended to accompany each question did not display on my phone. This made it impossible for me to correctly answer the questions posed to me. It’s possible that this is just a problem with the demo version rather than the real courses, but all the same, it did not work. When I signed in online, however, the images displayed correctly.</p>

<p>In addition, I have some reservations regarding their pedagogical reinforcement strategies as they appear on the demo version I reviewed. When you answer a question incorrectly, instead of the platform repeating the question and requiring the learner to think through it again, the correct answer is immediately given, and the learner is simply asked to type it in. I think there could be better learning potential if the correct answer were not immediately given, but rather withheld until the learner came to it on their own.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Cell-Ed was created to address an incredible need in this country: to help improve literacy and language skills for adults wanting to enter the workforce. Unfortunately, there seemed to be some issues with images sent via text message, and I felt like there could be better learning opportunities within the question and answer model. That said, Cell-Ed is a company with momentum that has already positively impacted the adult literacy sector and will likely continue to do so.</p>
