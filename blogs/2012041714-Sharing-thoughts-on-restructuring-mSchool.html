In today's D&R weekly meeting, our table (Danny, Fred, Janet, Kate, and I) was talking about how mSchool might be changed so that it stands out from other thousands of Moodle LMSs. Because the time in the seminar didn't allow us to share all our ideas, and I think these ideas a great enough to start a new post, I'd like to write about them here.

-	mSchool really need be different than other general LMS! 

-	mSchool should allow instructors and students use many free online resources (offer by EdLab and others) including Vialogues (YouTube), EdNode, PocketKnowledge, SurveySidekick, Pundit, iTunes U, Khan Academy, and so on.

-	mSchool should be a more relaxed environment for learning. Not another online classroom where students get bored and take the course just for getting credits.

-	A good example of informal learning in ancient times is Socrates' dialectic inquiry where the mentor encourages students to learn constructively by asking inspiring and challenging questions. 

-	In mSchool, inquiry-based learning can take place in a pseudo-synchronous (i.e. asynchronous in nature, but discussants are online at the same time to discuss in the same way as synchronous discussion â€” similar to the Vialogues discussion in EdLab seminars) discussion forum where the instructor coordinates student discussions on a set of learning materials (texts, graphs, videos, hyperlinks, etc.). 

-	Student discussions are Twitter-like so that the conversation is active and dynamic. The discussions are tied to the particular learning materials being discussed.
-	The instructor prepares the learning materials students start to discuss. Students can also post additional multimedia resources for discussion and discuss resources that other students post.

-	The instructor coordinates the discussion by presenting learning materials in order so that the discussion is focused on a single topic at a time.

-	When the class is done, students can export the whole learning module including the instructor's content and the discussions as PDF, slides, or xml to study later by themselves.

-	Such a learning system can be used in colloquiums, practicums, and online courses in general at TC. For example, in my department the colloquium takes place every other week and each colloquium focuses on one educational topic such as games for learning, intelligent tutors, adaptive learning, etc. These classes can all be offered online within mSchool. (Gary would be the perfect ambassador to promote mSchool to TC departments).

-	We can also reach out to teacher preparation programs/initiatives such as Teach For America and ask them to develop mSchool courses.

Please share your thoughts. I think this a cool idea for mSchool and it's unique by being casual, interactive, and flexible.
