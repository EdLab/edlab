<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/beelinguapp-learn-languages-with-audio-books/id1225056371/">Beelinguapp</a> is a language learning app with a specific focus on reading. The app displays passages from short stories or articles in the user's own language alongside a translated version. Readers are able to listen to audio versions, read aloud, and can follow along in either the target language or their native tongue.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Beelinguapp is free to use with ads, but a premium version with an expanded library is available for a monthly fee of $1.99 or for a lifetime membership of $22.99. With just the free version, the app’s library is still quite impressive. The short passages are available in three difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. While the collection is heavily geared towards children, there are also readings that adults can enjoy, such as topics related to travel or science and technology. </p>

<p>I tested the app in Chinese, but it is also compatible with 12 other languages. Most of the stories are available to use in multiple languages. The app used a native Mandarin speaker to read my selected passages, meaning the sound was natural and easy to follow.</p> 
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Most of the adult-focused texts are only available at more advanced levels. My Chinese reading level is still at the beginner stage. I tried testing the Artificial Intelligence passage, but I simply could not follow along. I ended up reading a Chinese folktale, <i>Frog in the Well</i>, which I did still enjoy. It would be nice, though, to have an expanded library at the lower levels.</p>  

<p>There are a few technical issues with the app. First, because the app is translating the passages, context, grammar, and translation choices are lost to the user. For instance, idioms are difficult to translate and direct translations often don’t make sense. It is unclear if the app is replacing idioms with similar phrases or using direct translations. Additionally, you can only pause or click on segmented sentences, and not on single words. I would like more control and explanation for each specific word in the passages.</p>

<p>Finally, the app is advertised as "unique karaoke reading," which I thought might be more similar to regular karaoke. But, the function is more akin to following along with someone reading. I don’t really consider this karaoke and it is a bit misleading.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Despite a few complaints, Beelinguapp is a handy companion tool for the language learning process. This app won’t replace <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3088/quizlet/">vocabulary building</a> or <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4756/fluentu">grammar sessions</a>, but it will provide a helpful boost to reading and listening skills. The assortment of materials available in the free version makes this app worth a trial.</p>
