            <b><a href="http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/book/10.1201/9781584888338" target="_blank">Skillicorn, D. (2007). Understanding complex Datasets: Data Mining with Matrix Decompositions. Boca Raton, FL: Chapman & Hall/CRC</a></b>

<b>Description:</b> This book provides a solid, in-depth review of various data mining techniques involving matrix decomposition, and how these techniques can be used to analyze complex datasets. It does not dig too deep in terms of the mathematics, but explains exceptionally well the general concepts, the procedures, the application with scalable examples, and the implication of the results. It covers the most commonly used and well established techniques including general matrix decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Semi-discrete Decomposition (SDD), using SVD and SDD together, Graph Analysis, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF), and so on. I haven't looked into every chapter but found the discussions of SVD, SDD, and their combinations extremely useful for the project I'm working on. It even comes with Matlab code examples which I haven't had a chance to test them out.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> We are conducting and plan to conduct many projects relating to data mining. These projects are supposed to help us understand how our products have been doing, how we can improve them, and potentially what new projects to launch in order to excel in promoting education innovations through technology. As far as I know, many Edlabbers like me have fading memories about all the statistical and math procedures involved in data mining, and are not familiar with many techniques such as SVD and SDD, and so on. In working on a data mining project with Manav on Vialogues, I found this book extremely helpful in helping me pick up the idea and procedures of SVD and SDD. It explains the details much better than most journal articles or conference proceedings that I found on the same topic (including a few by the same author David Skillicorn). If you are in a similar boat as me or would like to do data mining projects involving complex datasets, take this book as an excellent reference. And best of all, although this book sells for $60 on Amazon, it's free when you access CRCnetBASE through the Columbia network. Open the link by clicking the book title at the top.
