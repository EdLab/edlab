<a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> has created a social, community-based lending service that lets students receive loans and loan consolidation from alumni of their institution. Alumni at each school contribute to a shared pool of financial resources and are then given a "share" in each student borrower. Then, when the student pays back their loan, the alum is paid back as well. Specific programs are unique to participating institutions. 

The primary benefits of this model, developed by Stanford B-School grads in 2011, include "double bottom line returns" for alumni investors, lower loan rates for student borrowers and a greater engagement with alumni of participating institutions. Additionally, the "social" aspect of the platform encourages networking between students and alums. Columbia even has a newly launched SoFi program; learn more <a href="https://www.sofi.com/blog/sofi-loan-fund-for-columbia-university/">here</a>. 

<b>Pros:</b> 
By pooling resources, students benefit from lower rates while also gaining valuable contacts who could help them get a job after school to pay back their loans. This seems like a system that helps to cut out the typical student loan middleman.

<b>Cons:</b> 
What happens if you default? The site had very little information regarding penalties for defaulting on your loan. Also, what is the payment plan like? This idea might sound completely beneficial, if you are able to pay back your loan on time; however, are the penalties higher if you are unable to make payments? 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> 
As we develop ResearchBroker and Ednode, two tools that will benefit alumni here at TC, it would be interesting to explore additional "social sharing" communities that connect alumni, students, and institutions in a web of resources.

<b>Takeaways:</b>
SoFi is an innovative new community-based student loan model. In a $1 trillion dollar student loan market, there is room for new models that provide value for all involved.
