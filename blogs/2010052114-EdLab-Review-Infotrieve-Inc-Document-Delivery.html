            <b>Infotrieve, Inc. Document Delivery</b>

<i>The Information Center Specialists</i>

Provided by <a href="http://corporate.infotrieve.com/">Infotrieve, Inc.</a>, the Document Delivery system is a online search and ordering tool that provides access to, and copyright compliant delivery of journal and magazine articles, conference papers, case studies, and book chapters published anywhere in the world.

<b><a href="http://www.infotrieve.com/documentdelivery">www.infotrieve.com/documentdelivery</a></b>

<b>Price:</b> Per document, the cost is US $13.00 Service Fee (for orders placed using PubMed, Article Finder, eContent, or Table of Contents using Infotrieve's integrated shopping cart) + Copyright Service Fee + Delivery Fee and tax where applicable. For all other ordering methods, the cost per document is US $19.00 Service Fee + Copyright Service Fee + Delivery Fee and tax where applicable. According to the Infotrieve website, more than 90% of orders are fulfilled within 48 hours with 80% delivered within 24 hours or less. Next day (“Rush”) and same day (“Panic”) fulfillment services are also available for an additional fee. Organizations planning to order more than 100 documents per month may benefit by implementing Infotrieve's <a href="http://corporate.infotrieve.com/virtuallibrary">Virtual Libraryâ„¢</a> technology (discussed in more detail below). 

<b>Prop points:</b> There are many useful features included in the Document Delivery system. Documents may be delivered as a link in, or as an attachment to, an email, or by Ariel, fax, mail, or FedEx. Also, Infotrieve has direct access to a collection of print and digital documents through agreements with more than 130 leading STM publishers, Infotrieve's own STM Libraryâ„¢ of managed print collections, and content sourcing/retrieval experts based in the United States, Europe, and Australia. In addition, Infotrieve can provide advanced referencing services for hard to locate documents. 

With respect to customer service, U.S. Customer service is available between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm ET Monday through Friday. Customer Service is also available online via a web form.

As mentioned above in the Price section, organizations planning to order more than 100 documents per month may benefit by implementing Infotrieve's <a href="http://corporate.infotrieve.com/virtuallibrary">Virtual Libraryâ„¢</a> technology. Virtual Library 2.0 is Infotrieve's base level search, discovery, and ordering platform which provides end-users with nearly immediate access to more than 40 million citations available in Infotrieve's catalog of published scientific, technical, and medical (STM) content.

End-users can search for content, select which specific articles to order, indicate the intended usage for the article (so the correct copyright permissions are granted), and track those orders through the document delivery process. All orders are priced before the order is submitted which allows patrons to make decisions based on actual prices. According to the Infotrieve website, both solutions deliver more than 60% of their orders in five minutes or less; and all documents are 100% copyright compliant.

<b>Drop points:</b> There are some drawbacks to the Infotrieve Document Delivery system.  Infotrieve's Document Delivery system is not a "full service" solution. To receive a more comprehensive solution, the Document Delivery system would need to be combined with Infotrieve's other services such as Business Process Outsourcing; Library Staffing; STM Library; Content SCMÂ®; and Virtual Libraryâ„¢ (all available for additional fees). 

With respect to image quality, copies made from print documents housed in third-party libraries are copied in black and white unless a color copy is specified.  If a color copy is required, delivery may be delayed up to one week and a $2.00 per page surcharge will be added to the order. 

Also, Infotrieve can provide "Enhanced Quality Document Delivery service" that includes removal of all black spots, borders, web navigation elements, stickers, and stamps, in preparation for FDA submissions.  However, this service costs an additional $10.00 per document. The Enhanced Quality Document Delivery practices follow the eCTD (Electronic Common Technical Document) procedures as required by regulatory agencies in the United States.
 
<b>Final score:</b> Infotrieve has delivered high quality electronic and print documents for twenty years. That is a long-established reputation in the industry. Turn-around time is short, and documents can be delivered in color (when available) and in FDA-accepted formats. However, rush fulfillment services, color copies, enhanced quality assurance, and other services are all add-on features that cost the end-user additional fees. The cost-benefit of these services in comparison to the competition is unclear, particularly when the delivery service is evaluated as a singular component of a larger library management solution.

<b>Recommended uses:</b> Online search and ordering tool for journal and magazine articles, conference papers, case studies, and book chapters for higher ed libraries.
