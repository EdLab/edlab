          <p>
            Stephen and I are interested in conducting a research on eBook reader tools for the iPad. Like many people and publishers, we think the iPad is a great reading device offering the comfort and efficiency that no other device have. Most importantly, its positioning between a computing device and a traditional e-book Reader makes it highly versatile for both casual reading and academic learning tasks. It has stronger computing power than Kindle and Nook so that it can be used as a research tool to accomplish tasks such as managing literature, composing texts, creating charts, Internet research, and online collaboration, among others. Aslo, it has better portability and display than a laptop and it can be taken anywhere for reading and learning.

However, we think the iPad's great potentials provided by its hardware are still largely limited by the availability of good applications for reading and learning. We started by looking at some popular eBook reading apps for iPad including the iBook app by Apple, the Kindle app by Amazon, the B&N eReader app by Barnes & Noble, and the Good Reader (GR) app by Good iWare Ltd. The first three apps are developed by big businesses and their book stores are the only resource to obtain books. The last app, GR, is the NO. 1 selling e-book reader app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod due to its great features and functionality, but it isn't affiliated with any online bookstore. Next I will share a summary of these four apps. I will describe these apps in 6 types of tasks: file management, customization, navigation, content interaction, social interaction, and extended tasks.

1. File Management

1.1. Obtaining books

The online stores are the only resource to obtain reading materials for iBook, Kindle, and B&N eReader. It might be possible for users who own a physical Kindle reader to upload one's own materials to the personal library with Amazon, then synchronize the Kindle app on iPad to read the uploaded contents. But for most people it is not possible to read materials they obtain elsewhere other than the merchants' online store.

The iBook app integrates the online bookstore within the app itself. So the user can browse, purchase, and read books all within the app. In comparison, Kindle and B&N eReader's bookstores must be access by using a web browser.

The GR doesn't offer the possibility of purchasing books. But it offers many other ways to obtain materials:

a) Connect iPad to a PC or Mac using a USB cable or bluetooth, then transfer files via iTune. GR must be installed on iPad in order to do so because iTune per se doesn't allow transferring files other than the audio and video formats that it supports.

b) Download files from the Internet. This can be done by browsing the web using GR's integrated web browser, or by directly entering a URL.

c) Download via a dozen of web services such as mail servers (IMAP and POP3), FTP servers, Google Docs, Dropbox, box.net, FilesAnywhere.com, etc.

d) Download from other devices via WiFi.

1.2. Synchronizing between devices

All these apps allow synchronization between devices. For example, in iBook, Kindle, and B&N eReader, books purchased from the online store on other devices can be synchronized to the iPad. GR itself doesn't provide synchronization services. But GR natively supports some online storage services such as DropBox and Google Docs, and the user's documents can be synchronized using these services. However, the first three apps also synchronize reading progresses, bookmarks, notes, etc, while GR doesn't.

1.3. File organization

Only GR supports file organization. One can create folders to organize files.

1.4 Search book

Only B&N eReader and GR allow the user to search books by title in the library. There is no keyword or full-text search function in any of the four apps.

1.5 Supported media

iBook, Kindle, and B&N eReader have very strict control on the media formats that they support. Since one can obtain books only from the online stores, the only supported formats in these apps are those the book publishers sell. They don't support audio or media playback.

GR, in contrast, supports many textual formats including PDF, TXT, as well as all formats that Safari supports (e.g. Word, Exel, Powerpoint, HTML, etc). It also supports images as well as audio and video playback on formats that iPad supports.

2. Customization

All four apps allow the user to customize the reading interface to some extent. iBook is the least customizable app as it only allows adjusting font size, font family, and screen brightness. Kindle and B&N eReader are more customizable as they also allow adjusting font color and background color. GR is the most customizable as it allows the user to define text alignment (TXT only), the tap behavior, auto scroll speed, etc in addition to the font, background, and brightness.

3. Navigation

Navigating within an e-book seems most convenient in B&N eReader as it supports a) browsing and jumping to chapters; b) jumping to specific pages; c) browsing and jumping to user-created contents such as bookmarks and notes; and d) searching for a term or sentence. iBook supports a), b), d).  GR supports b), c), d). And Kindle supports b), c).

4. Content interaction (interaction with the reading material)

Kindle and B&N eReader appear to do best among the four apps. They allow the user to bookmark pages or contents, highlight texts, and annotate texts. iBook only allows bookmarking and highlighting. And GR allows bookmarking textual files, as well as zooming, rotating, and cropping PDF files. None of the four apps natively supports file editing, although in GR its possible to open files with external editors.

5. Social interaction

Social interaction is the biggest missing element for all four apps. None of the apps allow the user to share book content, annotations, bookmarks, or conduct discussions. Only GR allows the user to share files by email. And Kindle has the "Popular Highlights" feature which identifies the passages that are most highlighted by millions of users. But there is no way in any app to interact with a specific group of people in any meaningful way for collaborative learning.

6. Extended tasks

iBook and B&N eReader have the capacity of accessing external resources. For example, both apps allow the user to select texts and look them up in built-in dictionaries, Google, and Wikipedia. If a term is not found in the built-in dictionary, B&N eReader also provides the option of looking up at reference.com.

GR allows the user to open files with external applications. This feature is very useful especially because GR can download file types that it does not natively support. So the user can actually use GR as a file transferring program to download any types of file, then launch external applications if GR cannot open them. However, it appears if the downloaded files are changed on iPad, GR cannot synchronize them back to the online repository.

Summary:

It seems GR is the best choice for casual reading tasks due to its support to many file formats and the flexible ways to obtain reading materials. It may also be good to support learning tasks because it can launch external apps to view or edit the files that it downloads. However, the biggest drawback for GR is it is not affiliated with any online bookstore, which makes it difficult to find textbooks for learning.

GR also has the greatest potential to support learning. Although GR doesn't natively supports text composing or editing (none of the other three apps do either), it can launch external apps to accomplish these tasks. The other three apps are too controlled to allow a wide range of learning tasks.

However, even GR is far from adequate for learning tasks. In some aspects, GR is even less efficient than the other three apps because it doesn't integrate any learning tools such as dictionaries. And its navigation and content interaction features are not as good as B&N eReader. Most importantly, there is no way to synchronize notes, bookmarks, or highlights to other devices, and there is no way to share these user-generated contents with other people.

The bottom line is a good app for reading and learning is needed for iPad. None of the existing apps are adequate to conduct learning tasks particularly collaborative learning.
