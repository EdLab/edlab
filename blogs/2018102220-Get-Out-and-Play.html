<p>Digital technologies and apps catering to children have created a new category of play. In addition to physical movement, imaginary play, constructive activity, and formal games, tablets and Youtube offer a new arena of digital play for children to explore. What do parents think about this new kind of play? In this study, researchers surveyed 500 parents from four countries in order to gain insight into how they perceive digital play.</p>
 
<p>The researchers distributed a questionnaire to parents of children aged four to six in China, Turkey, South Korea, and the United States. They inquired about the parents’ play preferences as well as their children’s average daily screen time. Additionally, they collected data about parents’ educational background and employment, and interviewed ten parents from each country about their play preferences.</p>
 
<p>Parents from all four countries cited digital play as their least preferred type of play. Turkish and Chinese parents preferred constructive play, while American and South Korean parents identified physical play as most important. The researchers also discovered a correlation between educational level and play preference in Turkish, Chinese, and South Korean parents. Respondents with lower education levels reported a higher preference for digital play.</p>

<p>In interviews, participants cited digital play’s entertaining and educational qualities as its main advantages. They praised this type of play for teaching skills, introducing children to technology, and keeping them occupied. However, parents expressed concerns that digital play can adversely affect children’s health, display inappropriate content, and lead to addiction.</p>
 
<p>This study highlights the need for ongoing research about the potential risks and benefits of digital play for young children so that parents can make informed decisions about how to engage with this new type of play.</p>
