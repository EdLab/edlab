<a href="http://edr.sagepub.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/cgi/reprint/39/5/387"> van Aalst, J. (2010). Using Google Scholar to estimate the impact of journal articles in education. Educational Researcher, 39(5), 387-400.</a>

While most aspiring academics are well-acquainted with the “Impact Factor” rating associated with many top-tier journals, how might Google Scholar complement or enhance these rankings?  In the latest issue of <i>Ed Researcher</i>, this is exactly the question Jan van Aalst set out to explore.

<b>Methods</b>
After identifying a sample of 112 accomplished scholars in three sub-fields of education (science education, language education, and educational technology), van Aalst compared the Google Scholar citations for 401 journal articles published by these authors between 2003 and 2007 with their Web of Science and Scopus citations.  Involving more than 5,000 documents, the investigation looked to see <i>which</i> documents were included in the citations, <i>which kinds</i> made (or did not make) the cut for each ranking system, and how the systems ultimately compared.

<b>Findings</b>
While noting that Google Scholar is of course still developing, van Aalst suggests that the tool may in fact be an important (and free!) complement to more traditional measures of research output influence — especially for early- or mid-career academics hoping to understand the impact of their pre-tenure scholarship.  Indeed, traditional impact factors for publications in education remain low (relative to other disciplines, like business), and do not include other important measures of reach like inclusion in dissertations, conference papers, course syllabi, books and book chapters.  Moreover, while early critics of Google Scholar found that the database did not index a number of key journals, and worried about an inflated number of citations due to non-scholarly or non-peer-reviewed links, van Aalst reported that Google journal citations have been growing steadily since Scholar's inception in 2004, and that the Web accounted for less than 13% of Google citations in the three sub-fields.  For each discipline, as well, Google Scholar painted an acceptable portrait of the relevant scholarship, and may in fact be a <i>more</i> equitable representation of research impact across sub-fields, as citations accumulate at about the same rate (unlike Web of Science rankings).  

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
As home to the college's own <i>Teachers College Record</i>, expanding the way we look at and understand journal impact has exciting implications — especially as the Google Scholar alternative has gone mainstream in <i>Ed Researcher</i>.  For that matter, I suspect there are some important ideas we might consider for our TCR data reports, including a new lens for evaluating article popularity.
