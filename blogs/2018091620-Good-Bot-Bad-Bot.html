<p>From tutoring to teaching, robots are becoming ubiquitous in educational spaces, but that doesn’t mean they have the same personalities. Engineers can program robots to have distinct personalities, even ones that complete the same tasks. Because of that, researchers are studying what types of robot personalities work best with students of different age groups.</p>

<p>One recent study examined how children ages 6–11 reacted to two different robots: an agreeable bot and a disagreeable one. The researchers split the 174 participants into three subgroups based on their ages: 6–7 year olds, 8–9 year olds, and 10–11 year olds. They then tasked each child with completing a mission that involved voice commanding the robots through a maze to avoid obstacles and collect sweets. The robots’ voices and actions were secretly controlled by the research team to give the participants real-time responses.</p>

<p>The agreeable robot vocally praised and encouraged the child throughout the mission and followed each command with precision. For example, the agreeable robot would tell the child things like, "I think we are an excellent team!" The disagreeable robot, on the other hand, spewed discouraging words and often ignored or disobeyed the child’s command. This robot would say things like, "You fail! You do not provide the appropriate instructions." After the children completed the missions, the researchers conducted an interview with them to determine how they felt about each bot.</p>
 
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, not all children disliked the disagreeable bot. In fact, a decent number of kids in the youngest age group (ages 6–7) actually preferred the disagreeable robot to the agreeable one. Some even said the disagreeable robot made them happy while the agreeable one made them sad. The oldest children, however, unanimously preferred the agreeable robot and felt much happier guiding it than the disagreeable one.</p>
 
<p>The researchers think this disparity between the age groups might be because the younger children found it harder to note differences between the personalities in general, but it could also suggest that young children tolerate negative attitudes better. The findings suggest that people designing social robots should program their responses and personalities based on the age group they interact with. For younger children, for instance, robots should have more exaggerated reactions to make their incentives and personalities more obvious. For older children, robots should always react positively.</p>
