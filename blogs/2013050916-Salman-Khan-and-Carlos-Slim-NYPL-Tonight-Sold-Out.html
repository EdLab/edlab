The following is a repost of my original blog entry from 02/10/13! Jo and I are excited to attend and report back on the blog tomorrow... if I am able to, I will live-tweet as well!    

<b>Event Details:</b>
"The One World Schoolhouse" is coming to the New York Public Library (NYPL) on Thursday, May 9th!  Salman Khan will be joined by philanthropist Carlos Slim to discuss the future of online learning and educational technology.

<b>From the event page on NYPL's site:</b> 
<blockquote>
How can we improve our schools for the 21st century?   

 Salman Khan, founder of Khan Academy, believes that his interactive videos, used by millions of students, parents, and teachers across the world, can revolutionize education. Mexican businessman and philanthropist Carlos Slim agrees: "Sal Khan has developed the best and most cost-efficient way to use technology to bring universal high-quality education, creativity, and innovation to all."

SALMAN KHAN is the founder of the Khan Academy (khanacademy.org), a nonprofit with the mission of providing free, high-quality education for “anyone anywhere” in the world. His new book, The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined, includes his diagnosis of the problems in America's current education system and solutions for fostering creativity among students and utilizing technology effectively in the classroom.
 
CARLOS SLIM HELÃš has been a businessman and investor since 1952. He has served as vice chairman of the Mexican Stock Exchange and chairman of the Mexican Association of Brokerage Firms. As a philanthropist, Slim has contributed to business and community development in Mexico and Latin America to improve education, health, sports focused in social support and development, justice, employment as well as the fine arts.
