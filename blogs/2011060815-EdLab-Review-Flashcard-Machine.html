            <b>Description</b>:Flashcard Machine is an online flashcard program that can be accessed on desktop or mobile devices. Online flashcards can be easily be created, shared, and downloaded. There is minimal structure involved with this program but a lot of flexibility with regards to how you wish to design and organize your flashcards. 

<b>Pros</b>:
Tons of valuable features; just going through the list, it seems very exhaustive.
The UI for the iPhone App is quite good. Easy to use and sleek.
iPhone App comes with a "New Reminder" feature to remind the user to study his/her flashcards at a given time. Lots of flexibility (everything from exporting your flashcards to your ipod to adjusting the fonts and text sizes used in your flashcards). Automatically creates multiple-choice quizzes from flashcard stack.

<b>Cons</b>:
The Web UI is clunky. The website is very plain and the poorly-placed ads make the site look rather...lame. Navigation is hardly seamless.
Initially, I could not sign in to my account on the iPhone App because, while the online version accepted long passwords, the iPhone App would only work for shorter passwords. You only get "100 Flips" with the free iPhone App purchase. You have to pay for more flips... ($5 for unlimited), lack of an algorithm for maximizing retention. No adaptive technologies involved. The app tends to crash easily.

<b>Relevance</b>: Flashcard Machine is most relevant with regards to the flexibility it provides. Users can easily customize their cards to their respective needs. There are some problems with regards to optimized randomization since the program only allows you to "shuffle" or "un-shuffle". As far as checking what you know, tracking progress is easy but hardly informative (check if you know it, x if you don't). There is no way to selectively sort or shuffle either. Two takeaways: a.) learn from the iPhone app UI when designing the UI for the web-platform for an SMS-flashcard app & b.) include as many of the customizable features available on this app so that making and sharing flashcards is as easy and flexible as possible in the SMS and web context.
