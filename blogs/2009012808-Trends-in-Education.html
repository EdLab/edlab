            Keeping up with the latest developments and innovations in education is important in our line of work but it's not always easy to do.  Buried far beneath the front page, ed stories are often overlooked and underappreciated.  I've taken the grunt work out of the process by combing through various news outlets to present you with a brief update on the latest happenings in the ed sector.  Consider yourselves schooled for the day. 


<b>Brandeis U. museum: Closin' up, cashin' in</b>

In an attempt to stave off the effects of a threatening economy, Brandeis University has decided to close its Rose Art museum and sell  its collection to help keep up with the college's expenses.  The museum is best known for its collection of modern art, featuring works by Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and Roy Lichtenstein.  There is no word, yet, on the total worth of the collection, 
 

<b>Shriveling endowments leave colleges with few options</b>

According to a national survey, American colleges and universities lost an average of 23% on their endowment investments last semester. There has not been a drop so severe since the mid-1970s. Many colleges are hesitant to raise tuition or cut financial aid and are instead opting to freeze hiring, put construction projects on hold, and restrict staff travel.  Sixty percent of schools surveyed reported that they do not plan to change the amount they withdraw from endowments in the current fiscal year. 

 
<b>No more cursive?</b>

A 2007 study conducted by Vanderbilt University revealed that 90% of elementary teachers taught in schools that required handwriting instruction and that they spend about 15 minutes a day on the subject.  However, the stress for state assessment prep, a push for computer literacy, and the lack of time in a school day has forced some elementary school teachers to place less emphasis on the teaching of cursive. The trend seems to be putting more emphasis on process than on form; in other words, it is teaching for efficiency rather than for the beauty of the skill.

 
<b>Wikipedia to change editing rules</b>

Wikipedia is no stranger to incorrect revisions but when a recently submitted fake post about the deaths of Edward Kennedy and Robert Byrd garnered harsh criticism, the company began to consider putting restrictions on the editing of its online encyclopedia.  The proposed idea would prevent new and anonymous users from instantly editing content and would reserve this privilege to registered and reliable users.  The new idea is called Flagged Revisions.  New and anonymous users may still edit, but these edits are subjected to the approval of the registered and reliable users.  This new plan would go against Wikipedia's previous policy of anyone being able to edit at any time.  Opponents of this new policy are encouraged to comment on company creator Jim Wales's user talk page, with an alternate proposal by January 30th.   Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Why_I_am_asking_Flagged_Revisions_to_be_turned_on_now">here</a> for that page.
