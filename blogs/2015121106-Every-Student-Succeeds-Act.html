          <p>
            The "Student Succeeds Act" is one of the few acts both Democrats and Republicans have agreed on. On December 10, President Obama signed the act with by <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/34080-every-student-succeeds-act-still-leaves-most-vulnerable-kids-behind">bipartisan support</a> both in the Senate and House of Representative. The act is to replaced the " No Child Left Behind" which was signed in 2002 by President Bush to help struggling students succeed in school. However the NCLB was based of standard testing and also on unrealistic goals. Teacher around the country did not like teaching under the pressure of meeting unrealistic goals and teaching based on testing students. The NCLB had good intentions to help student be proficient in math and reading by 2014 to catch up with the gap with other countries. 

The new bill gives control to the state to decide what is best for their students. Regular testing is involved however with the power of setting guidelines giving to state teachers are not under pressure of meeting federal requirements. I believe the states should give cities and districts power to also shape academic success. This is because at a local level they will understand the kind of students they are dealing with. With support and funding from the state this will be a good way to help students succeed in school.
