<p>A new toy gives kids insight into the inner workings of computers by having them build mechanical computers powered by marbles. The Turing Tumble, named after computer scientist Alan Turing, was created by Paul Boswell. While teaching at the University of Minnesota, Boswell noted how important it was for all students to learn how to code and have a solid understanding of computers.</p>

<p>Although there are many coding and programming toys that are available now, many donâ€™t dive into the actual mechanics of computing. "They all treat computers like abstract boxes," says Boswell. "They teach how computers behave, but not how they work." The Turing Tumble is a mechanical computer that kids build themselves; by playing with it, they learn the secrets stored in computer chips. Using the six different pieces of the toy, kids can solve logic puzzles, compute simple equations, and create patterns. Boswell included a set of 51 puzzles that kids can work through to become master logicians. The Turing Tumble is currently raising financing <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/871405126/turing-tumble-gaming-on-a-mechanical-computer">on Kickstarter</a> and has already far exceeded its fundraising goal.</p>

<p>Why might it be educational for children to learn how computers "think"? Do you think the Turing Tumble could interest children in programming or computers? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/37960/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:04 Cinthia.Fabian:</b> Honestly, I'm interested to see how this idea could be adapted to adult learners. I use a computer most every day, and I couldn't even begin to tell you why it actually does the things it does. It's important for children (and me, probably) to be familiar with the underlying functionalities of computers because that then gives us a basis upon which to build better computers in the future. </p>

<p><b>@02:45 RuthS:</b> I wonder whether playing with this toy would interest children in actual computers. The two might seem disparate for children, but maybe fostering these skills early in life could still be useful.</p>
