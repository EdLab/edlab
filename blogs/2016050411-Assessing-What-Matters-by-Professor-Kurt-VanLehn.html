          <p>
            Gary and I are attending a talk by Professor Kurt VanLehn. 

Here is an abstract of the presentation: 

There has been an unfortunate tendency in learning analytics to apply sophisticated tools without much consideration of what the assessments mean.  This talk will present two counter-examples.  The first presents a solution to the assignment of blame problem, which is the problem of how to apportion blame when there are two or more explanations for an error.  This method has been implemented and some preliminary results are available, using data from the Dragoon intelligent tutoring system.  The second counter-example involves trying to assess a whole classroom of students rather than an individual student.   This is part of the FACT project, which I spoke about on March 1 at TC, so we may curtail the presentation and just discuss the details if everyone was at that talk.

Here is Professor  VanLehn's bio:
Kurt VanLehn is the Diane and Gary Tooker Chair for Effective Education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. He received a Ph. D. from MIT in 1983 in Computer Science, was a post-doc at BBN and Xerox PARC, joined the faculty of Carnegie-Mellon University in 1985, moved to the University of Pittsburgh in 1990 and joined ASU in 2008. He founded and co-directed two large NSF research centers (Circle; the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center). He has published over 125 peer-reviewed publications, is a fellow in the Cognitive Science Society, and is on the editorial boards of Cognition and Instruction and the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education. Dr. VanLehn's research focuses on intelligent tutoring systems and other intelligent interactive instructional technology.
