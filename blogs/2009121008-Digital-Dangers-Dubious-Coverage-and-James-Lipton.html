          <p>
            This morning's broadcast of <i>The Takeaway</i> featured a <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/stories/2009/dec/10/digital-dangers/" target="_blank">segment</a> on "digital dangers" facing teens. The segment cited a survey from MTV and the AP in which almost half of teens said they had been involved in "sexting"--sending or receiving risque photos of each other on their phones. Another guest talked about the extreme effects of cyberbullying, including one case where a girl was forced to move to a new school to escape the "bullies."

I had a few qualms with the report: first, the data from the various surveys was vague and conflicting--as with any survey, what is the chance that a participant will report their actions accurately? This, I think, might be even more true for teens, who are likely aware that what they're doing is inappropriate and wouldn't want to admit it to an adult, even a "researcher" from MTV.

My other problem with the report was the report itself: who's listening to <i>The Takeaway</i> at 6:45 a.m.? Probably a lot of adults, who are more likely to believe that technology--whether it be the Internet, video games, or (now) camera-phones--are corrupting the younger generation. I was reminded of <i>The Media Show</i>'s excellent episode on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lsnC-iWHJ0" target="_blank">online predators</a> and the disparity between how teens perceive threats to themselves and adult reactions to these reported threats.

I think a particularly excellent take on phone-related "threats" like sexting and cyberbullying are the PSAs featuring James Lipton and his beard, sponsored by LG. The website, <a href="http://www.giveitaponder.com/">giveitaponder.com</a>, asks teens to literally wear Lipton's beard and consider the consequence of their actions. Useful advice given with tongue firmly planted in Lipton's cheek that doesn't pander to teens, from a trusted voice in adult-news-entertainment. Now that's an episode I can get behind.
