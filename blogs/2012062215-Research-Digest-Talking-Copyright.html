<a href=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01575.x/abstract>Herman, B. D. (2012). Taking the copyfight online: Comparing the copyright debate in congressional hearings, in newspapers, and on the web. <i>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 17</i>(3), 354-368.</a>

In <i>Taking the Copyfight Online</i> Bill D. Herman seeks to examine differences between traditional and digital publications using the 2003-2006 DRM negotiations as an example. The idea has often been demonstrated, most recently in the coverage around SOPA and PIPA, but little research has been done around policy outcome changes facilitated by internet communication. It's clear that the internet has changed copyright both in format and in best practices, Herman writes, “changes include increases in infringement and the difï¬culty of enforcement, as well as a decrease in the importance of copyright as an incentive to produce and distribute some kinds of content.” But the culture and communication on the web has also changed news, resulting in greater crosstalk between internet culture and traditional news outlets.

The conversation in 2003-2006 primarily circulated around newly-ubiquitous digital television recording and the DMCA anticircumvention provisions. Herman coded a number of government documents, print news sources, and online discourse for copyright camp, either SC (strong copyright) or SFU (strong fair use.) He unsurprisingly found that the congressional hearings documents examined were the most balanced and internet sources were the least balanced. He also found that internet sources were 6.22 times more likely to be coded SFU and were far less likely to include neutral or SC arguments in the same source. 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
Herman concedes that he chose a highly biased issue to examine e-world/p-world differences and influence on policy, “the technology professionals, scholars, NGOs, librarians, and computer enthusiasts that drive the calls to limit copyright may be the most technologically adept multi-sector political coalition in history.” Though this land is our land, the study does call attention to the growing importance of media literacy and especially source variety on the internet. As the argument migrates and multiplies online, so too does the burden of seeking and evaluating sources.
