<p>The authors of this study examined the use of podcasting as a socially inclusive technology in a South African university largely catering to nontraditional students. Although many studies have been conducted on the pedagogical effects of podcasting, few have examined it as a socially inclusive tool specifically with regard to gender, age, and home language. For the purpose of this research, nontraditional students are generally older low-income or first-generation college students whose first language is not English or Afrikaans (the languages used at the university), but rather an African language.</p>
 
<p>Of the 434 students participating in this survey, most listened to podcasts of class lectures outside of class time. In addition, the study found that the students who used podcasts most regularly were older and spoke an African language at home. As lectures were conducted mostly in English, many of these students listened to podcasts repeatedly in order to fully understand the content. This demonstrates that in this particular context, nontraditional learners listened to podcasts more than traditional students.</p>
 
<p>In addition, this study challenged perceptions of podcasts by claiming that podcasting is an active rather than passive way of learning. More than half of the students who listened to podcasts took notes while doing so and others followed along with online modules. In fact, only 22% of students listened to podcasts without engaging in other study-related activities, demonstrating that podcasting is more frequently active than passive.</p>
 
<p>The fact that nontraditional students engage in podcasting more than traditional students demonstrates that this medium could be a socially inclusive technology. It should be noted that this study is limited to one South African university where podcasting is still an emerging technology. Despite that, the research also shows that podcasting can be an active way of learning rather than just passive and ultimately depicts podcasting as a promising pedagogical tool for all learners.</p>
