            <span style="font-weight: 400">Flipped classroom is a pedagogical approach that "exchanges the time used to deliver basic knowledge in class and the out-of-class time for applying the knowledge or doing homework” (Lai &amp; Hwang 2017). With such arrangements, educators hope to use valuable face-to-face time to help students as they apply knowledge to solve problems and interact with them more deeply to address their individual needs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There have been many studies on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom. </span><a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4217/is-flipped-learning-the-best-form-of-learning"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thai, De Wever, and Valcke (2017)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> found that students in a flipped classroom had better learning performances and higher levels of self-efficacy compared to those in a face-to-face or e-learning class. </span><a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4014/is-the-flipped-classroom-hurting-students"><span style="font-weight: 400">Asarta and Schmidt (2017) </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">found that the flipped model widens achievement gaps between different learning performance groups. Low achieving students performed more poorly in the flipped classroom than in a traditional classroom setting, while high achieving students presented the opposite - they performed better in the flipped classroom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While more research on this pedagogy is needed, one research direction that considers adding self-regulation to the flipped model shows great potential to improve student learning. </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131516301166?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lai and Hwang (2017)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> conducted a study on self-regulating flipped classroom approach in elementary math classes. Students started with goal setting (what strategies do I plan to use? how much time do I think I will spend? where do I plan to learn?what score do I wish to get? etc.) before the flipped classroom learning process, and they evaluated their self-regulation (what strategies did I actually use? Where did I actually study the materials?) at the end. The findings revealed that self-regulation in flipped learning improves learning performances and students' self-efficacy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As more technologies are used in the classrooms to facilitate learner-centered activities, Lai and Hwang’s study reminds us that self-regulation is a great meta-cognitive skill for students to effectively navigate technology-enabled learning resources and activities.</span>
