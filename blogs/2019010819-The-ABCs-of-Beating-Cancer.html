<p>There’s nothing fun about having cancer. But the creators of <a href="https://beaba.org/en/game/">Alpha Beat Cancer</a> realized that for young kids with cancer, an added suffering comes from not understanding their treatment process. In this free app, young cancer patients become cuddly superheroes who conquer the game by completing their treatment in a gamefied way. Along the way, they learn the ABCs of cancer: what treatment words mean, what different medical personnel do, and why each step is important for getting better.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Alpha Beat Cancer was designed through a collaboration between young cancer patients, health care professionals, and creative designers. Each level teaches a concrete lesson in an understandable and empowering way. For example, in the game introducing the immune system, the protagonist is inside the bloodstream in an epic pinball game, throwing platelets that bounce off the walls and blast bacteria into oblivion. In another game, the hero swipes away food as a clock counts down fasting time. The food flies quickly, and it’s hard to deflect it all, but when I finally succeeded, I felt like a champion. The game also fosters empathy for healthcare professionals. In one level, the user is a cheerful nurse caring for three patients, and if the nurse doesn’t fill the patients’ needs in time, they get sick. In order to beat the level, you sometimes have to skip over the nearest patient to care for one farther away with a more pressing need. The level gives patients the opportunity to stand in their nurse’s shoes, and at the end of the level, they’re asked if they might want to be a nurse one day.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Alpha Beat Cancer was developed in Brazil, and the creators are still working on fully developing the English version. While the game is completely playable in English, the level names appear only in Portuguese. This makes it difficult to go back to games, since they are identified by their starting letter. For example, to open the fasting game, you need to click on the block labeled J because the Portuguese word for fasting is "jejum." I can see users wanting to replay that game every time they fast, but it is tricky to locate if you don’t know Portuguese. Also, while I found the interface largely intuitive, there were a few places where I was initially unsure what to do. The most prominent stumbling block for me was the opening screen. When the app starts, the first screen shows an American flag and Brazilian flag. I thought this meant it was loading, and it took me awhile to realize that tapping a flag began the game in the corresponding language. A few added instructions or illustrations could help minimize user uncertainty.</p>
 
 <p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I have never undergone treatment for cancer, so I can’t say whether this game would provide entertainment or comfort for children in that situation. I did learn a lot through playing the game, though, and I felt like a superhero when I demolished dirt to protect my immune system, hunted down tumors with ultrasounds, held still for CAT scans, and caught raining urine droplets in a cup. The game does not idealize cancer treatment, but converts every aspect, big and small, into an opportunity for victory. I can imagine young cancer patients going back to these games every time they receive treatment. I hope it makes them feel like heroes.</p>
