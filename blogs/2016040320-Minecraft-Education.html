<p><i>"Minecraft encourages millions of players to create, explore, and discover. We want to bring that passion into the classroom. Join us as we create a Minecraft built for learning."</i> (<a href="http://education.minecraft.net/">Minecraft Education</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>A New Organization</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/minecraft-in-classroom-andrew-miller">Minecraft is no stranger</a> to the classroom. But this summer, Minecraft is cementing that relationship through <a href="http://education.minecraft.net/">Minecraft: Education Edition</a>, as Microsoft will be acquiring the 5-year-old MinecraftEDUâ€”a version of the game that was built in Finland and specifically developed for schools. The new Minecraft: Education Edition will seek to provide a host of resources that connect the game to learning in the classroom, including lesson plans, "Minecraft Mentors" to provide support for educators, and other tools. On top of that, the organization is also taking part in <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us">#HourofCode</a>, a growing movement to bring coding to students across the country.</p>

<p><b>Why Minecraft?</b></p>

<p>But why bring Minecraft into schools in the first place? Joel Levin, a former teacher and the Education Director of TeacherGaming, told <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/teaching-in-the-age-of-minecraft/385231/">The Atlantic</a> that his five-year-old daughter was honing her spatial skills through the game, not to mention her literacy skills through a desire to communicate with other players.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://minecrafteducation.tumblr.com/post/133128677380/recreating-learning-environments-in-minecraft?is_related_post=1">A blog post</a> for Minecraft: Education Edition also highlights the opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with and practice ratios, scale, and proportions through the game. Students can use one block to represent one inch, and scale their building to make sense out of the proportions of its dimensions.</p>
 
<p>Minecraft: Education Edition is not too different from the nostalgic days of primary-colored Lego blocks, serving as another addition to play-based learning to practice everything from executive function skills to foundational geometry. When the full education-based version of the game officially launches this summer, it might be another step toward bringing digital game-based learning to the classroom.</p>
