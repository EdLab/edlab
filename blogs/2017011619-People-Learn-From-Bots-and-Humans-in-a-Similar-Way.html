<p>Robots might not be taking over the classrooms just yet, but <i>bots</i> are taking over social media, and the confluence of bots distributing information has garnered the attention of researchers. According to new research, most humans learn, seek information, and even communicate with bots online in the same way they learn from other people.</p>
  
<p>In this research study, 120 undergraduate students were led to believe they were viewing tweets from the CDC (Center for Disease Control). However, some students were receiving messages from a person, while others were receiving messages from a bot. After reviewing tweets filled with information on reproductive health, students took surveys about how much they trusted the information and their motivation to learn more from the source, which they rated on a score of one to five. Results showed that students believed the information from the bots just as much as they did from humans and their motivation to learn from both entities was also about equal.</p>

 <p>Many reputable agencies use Twitter as a medium to share information with the public. However, not all organizations have the time or funds to craft tweets for every announcement, which is why bots have grown more popular. However, in the chaotic world of social media, malicious bots can transmit large quantities of false or misleading information. In a famous case, <a href="http://gawker.com/how-we-fooled-donald-trump-into-retweeting-benito-musso-1761795039">Gawker News</a> created a bot that retweeted quotes from the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to trick President-elect Trump into retweeting the bot to his followers. And Trump did; he was unable to distinguish between the bot and a human.</p>

<p>Researchers connect the confidence we have in bots with our subconscious tendencies to personify innate objects, noting how we project characteristics like dominance onto computers and robots. However, they also note that the source of a bot might affect our perception of how reliable its information is, meaning a bot created by a known organization like the CDC would be well received as opposed to an anonymous bot. Though these results can be beneficial for people who have no time to craft tweets, it is cause for concern for educators seeking to help students find reliable information.</p>
