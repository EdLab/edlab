          <p>
            The School of One is now facing some significant <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2061024,00.html">struggles</a> in trying to spin off from the New York City government as a non-profit so that it can replicate what it has achieved in New York City. School of One aims to combine blended learning with educational data mining, to put it concisely. 

I am a big fan of Andrew Rotherham's writing and his blog eduwonk, but I have to wonder whether spinning off is the only option for Rose.

I think it is worth noting Rose's goal and what kind of product he has to offer. Ultimately, Rose, and I think most of us, would like to see his concept applied in more school systems. The question Rotherham does not (have time to) address is whether spinning off as a non-profit is the best way to achieve such a goal. In order to answer such a question, an important distinction must be made between Rose's public-sector innovation and a lot of what occurs in private-sector innovation. If you develop an innovative product in the private sector, you would certainly not like to see another firm free-riding on your technology and putting out a copycat version of your product. a.) It cuts into your market-share and b.) said firm can probably produce at the same marginal cost but without all of the high R&D fixed costs you had to put up with. 

Rose is working with a public-sector innovation, where it was actually the taxpayers of New York City that paid for initial fixed costs of his venture. It is for this reason that Rose's idea is probably public domain (the only other valid argument I can see is that NYC taxpayers ought to receive royalties from other school systems that institute the School of One, but that sounds a bit ridiculous). Hence, there is at least some argument that public school systems can observe and copy what Rose did, thus replicating the School of One idea elsewhere. 

Now it might be the case that only Rose's team knows how to scale up the School of One, since they know the most about their venture. However, the reader should remain skeptical that spinning off is the only way for the School of One to be replicated until said point is directly addressed.
