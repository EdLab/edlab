<p>Developed by a team at Stanford University led by Sam Wineburg, <a href="https://beyondthebubble.stanford.edu/">Beyond the Bubble</a> promises to help educators and teachers rethink how to do history assessment in schools. Beyond the Bubble’s assessments only take a few minutes and are easy to score. The assessments come with rubrics and samples of student work that aim to promote academic literacy and provide windows into students’ thinking.</p>

<p>The program makes available the massive archive of high-quality digitized resources from the Library of Congress for K-12 learning, assessment, and teacher professional development. Beyond the Bubble’s assessment exercises are called HATs (History Assessments of Thinking). HATs are designed so that each student learns to do more than just recall a memorized fact. HATs teach habits of thinking that can be used regardless of the historical source or question. The habit of thinking, or strategy, asks students to think about when a source was produced, who wrote it, and for what purpose. The assessments are designed to align with the Common Core standards and come with a host of suggested lesson plans and professional development resources. Beyond the Bubble’s tools were inspired by research into creativity and historical thinking. The theory and scholarship behind the tools is evident throughout the website.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Beyond the Bubble is transparent about research, resources, and the framework of the historical assessments. Many of the developers of the assessments have published on the topic. The team prototyped assessments, held focus groups to test the assessments, conducted interviews with students, and piloted the assessments with large groups. The investment in developing these assessments is motivating. The assessments listed on the site are informative and ready to use in the classroom. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Currently the site has ten Common Core assessments listed that can be immediately implemented in the classroom. It is not clear if more can be accessed or bought or if teachers are expected to apply the principles they’ve learned from the ten listed assessments to create their own. It seems Beyond the Bubble links to a host of other projects, and it is not clear how a teacher should engage, use, and investigate the other partner projects. It seems to entail a good deal of additional research, but it might be worth the effort.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Beyond the Bubble offers a comprehensive, research-backed approach to doing history in the classroom that is based on easy-to-grasp thinking strategies. The assessments designed by Beyond the Bubble promise to teach students critical thinking skills that will become useful across disciplines.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Begin here and bring imagination and curiosity along with rigorous thinking skills into your history lesson.</p>
