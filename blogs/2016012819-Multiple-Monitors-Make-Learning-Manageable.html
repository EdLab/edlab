<p>As classrooms are being inundated with seemingly endless forms of multimedia—YouTube videos, PowerPoints, and pictures pulled from the internet—this deluge of content can have an overwhelming effect when presented on one screen. Researchers in education are looking to multi-screen displays with hopes of helping teachers more efficiently present course content. The authors point to the potential for simultaneously showing different digital learning media, rather than having them overlap on the same screen.</p>
 
<p>The researchers behind this study therefore conducted an experiment between two groups—one that was lectured in a classroom with a single projector, and the other group in a room with three projectors. The participants took a pretest and posttest on the content presented, in addition to a survey on cognitive load.</p>
 
<p>Results from this study showed that multi-display setups did correlate to reduced cognitive load for students and improved academic performance. However, the teacher in the study reported that having multiple screens took more time to set up and manage than a more traditional single-display system.</p>
 
<p>The authors argue that it is important for educators to keep presentation design principles in mind with the growing presence of technology in schools. Students can benefit from well-coordinated forms of media. These results could have implications for non-classroom settings as well—business presentations might also be more digestible if designed with multiple screens in the conference room. Teachers and businesspeople alike will just have to be willing to put in the extra effort to do so.</p>
