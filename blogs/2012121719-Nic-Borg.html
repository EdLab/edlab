 <i>Right now to grow quickly in the space, it’s all about going directly to the teachers with something free they can adopt tomorrow, and then bring into their classroom </i> (<a href="http://www.xconomy.com/">Xconomy.com</a>).

<p>
<b>It all started in a basement with a tweet </b><br>
Nic Borg is the co-founder of the educational social networking site <a href="http://www.edmodo.com/">Edmodo</a>. Called by some the "Facebook for education," Edmodo is a way for educators to connect with students online, share resources, assign classroom activities, create events, and more. Edmodo allows educators to use the power of social media to personalize learning for each student, promote collaboration among students, and enhance learning in and out of the classroom. All of this is done within Edmodo’s safe and secure platform, which Borg likes to emphasize when <a href="http://blog.edmodo.com/2012/03/20/video-ceo-nic-borgs-presentation-at-sxswedu/"> presenting Edmodo</a>. 
<br>
It is no accident that Borg built a system that works inside schools. Borg had seven years of work experience at Kaneland High School in Maple Park, Illinois, building web-based tools and learning management solutions.  He wasn’t the only one with experience in educational technology; his partner and Edmodo co-founder Jeff O’Hara had nine years of experience as a high school network administrator in Illinois.  The two initially met through O’Hara’s wife, who was teaching biology at Borg’s school where they worked together. Both co-founders, through their work in high schools, noticed that the schools lacked a safe and secure way for educators to share resources and collaborate online with their students and other educators. Driven to solve this problem, the two banded together and began working in O’Hara’s basement with their own money on what would become Edmodo.  In 2008 the duo announced the launch of Edmodo to the world through a simple tweet, "We are launching Edmodo… NOW!"
<p>
<b>Connecting educators to students, educators & developers</b><br>
When Borg talks about Edmodo and it’s success, he always praises the educators who use the site and share their resources with other educators. He cites this ground-up "grassroots" type of movement that made Edmodo what it is today. In the beginning stages Edmodo only supported educator-to-student sharing. When Borg spoke with educators, however, he discovered that while they were glad to connect with students online, they were even more excited about connecting with other educators, and this led to the addition of educator-to-educator sharing. Now he firmly believes that by offering educators greater opportunities to collaborate, they will be able to develop better learning innovations in their own classrooms. In Borg’s presentation at <a href="http://blog.edmodo.com/2012/03/20/video-ceo-nic-borgs-presentation-at-sxswedu/">SXSWedu</a> he spoke about his plan to connect educators to software developers of various educational applications that are on Edmodo. The idea is that since educators are at the front line and developers are working in another arena related to the work of educators, educators should be able to communicate their needs to developers who can then make what he calls "rapid innovations." These "rapid innovations" would make it feasible for educational applications coming down the development pipeline to better address the needs of educators than ever before. Nic Borg seems to be finding new ways to support educators with Edmodo in the hopes that it will lead to better learning in the classroom, and about 9.3 million educators and students would like to thank him for that.
