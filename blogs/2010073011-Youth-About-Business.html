          <p>
            In light of Tuesday's EdLab's Development and Research about entrepreneurship and education, I immediately thought of <a href="http://www.youthaboutbusiness.org/camp/video/index.php">Youth About Business</a>, a nonprofit organization that helps high school students learn how to successfully run a business. Students compete with each other to create mergers and acquisitions and then win a percentage of that company's stock. The objective of the program is summed up below:
<p>
“Enrolled students engage in a business competition performing mock mergers and acquisitions. They are taught to research and analyze public companies, and are exposed to financial terminology such as market capitalization, EBITDA, synergy, leverage ratios, and capital structure — many for the first time. They are also challenged to think through their decisions and understand the strategy and due diligence necessary to determine and execute a feasible transaction.</p>
<p>During the negotiations, student teams assume the leadership of their assigned corporation by acting as the executive management committee and begin their research by reading their annual report.</p> 
<p>Each student team is advised by area professionals -- including accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, and marketing specialists -- who serve as business consultants to each team. The executives help students understand these very complex transactions, and give them guidance on the proper techniques used when negotiating a merger or acquisition.”</p>
