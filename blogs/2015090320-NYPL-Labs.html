<p><i>"NYPL Labs is an interdisciplinary team working to reformat and reposition the Library's knowledge for the Internet age. Labs combines core digital library operations (digitization, metadata, permissions/reproductions, etc.) with a publicly engaged tech, design, and outreach team focused on enabling new uses of collections and data, collaborating with users on the creation of digital resources, and applying new technologies to library problem-solving."</i> via NYPL Labs</p>

<p>Within the New York Public Library, <a href="http://www.nypl.org/collections/labs">NYPL Labs</a> is working to improve and revolutionize the way the library shares, structures and disseminates its resources through crowd-sourced projects that involve collaboration with various NYPL departments and with patrons themselves. Their innovations throw a new and brighter light on what the library is able offer patrons and the modes in which these services are offered.</p>

<p><b>Core Library Resources Reimagined</b><br>
Two major Labs projects have helped improve public browsing of existing NYPL materials. What is now called <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/">NYPL Digital Collections</a> began in 2005 as NYPL Digital Gallery. Labs worked with the digital repository team at the library to create a more robust platform for all the content of their digital collections including digitized versions of rare books, posters, maps, photographs, and prints from the library’s collection.</p>

<p>In 2013 NYPL Digital Collections debuted and today holds over 800,000 items. Labs worked with the Manuscripts and Archives Division to add features to <a href="http://archives.nypl.org/">NYPL Archives and Manuscripts</a>. A tool called "Collection as Network" features new ways to look through finding aids and connect them together. A tool called "Terms Explorer" links various people and topics from the archives together and creates a visual image of these links. Another current archives project is called "Visible Spectrum" which will allow researchers to search the archives as a whole and perform searches for words that are repeated over the entire archives collection. </p>

<p><b>Projects in the Works</b><br>
NYPL Labs is working on <a href="http://www.librarysimplified.org/">Library Simplified</a> with ten libraries from locations such as Michigan, Tennessee and California to create an ebook borrowing system on an open e-reader platform that promotes ease of use. Other books-based explorations include <a href="http://tools.nypl-labs.biz/gutenberg/">Gutenberg Authors</a> which allows users to find out more about Project Gutenberg authors. Via computer coding <a href="http://www.nypl.org/blog/2014/09/03/generative-ebook-covers"> Generative eBook Covers</a> automatically creates images for public domain book covers based on the letters that make up a book’s title. One of the most forward thinking aspects of NYPL Labs is the promotion of collaboration through crowd-sourced projects. Two fascinating and ongoing projects, among others, open for public participation are <a href="http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/">Building Inspector</a> and <a href="http://stereo.nypl.org/">Stereogranimator</a>. Check them out and add your insights today to help keep these endeavors thriving.</p>
