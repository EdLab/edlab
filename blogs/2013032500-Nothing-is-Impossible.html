            A married couple, Angela and Willie Gillis, were able to lose a combined 500 pounds. One day, Willie woke up to realize that he was tired of being big and feared that he might not live long enough to see his newborn goddaughter grow up. In January 2011, Willie's weight was 492 pounds and his wife Angela had a weight of 338 pounds. They also lived in Beaumont, Texas which was coincidentally named the fifth most obese city in America in 2012. This couple was determined and Angela ended up losing 200 pounds and her husband lost 300 pounds. Both were able to overcome this obstacle in life. Willie Gillis stated, 
<blockquote>A lot of people give up -- they end up quitting because they're not doing something right. You have to take what you messed up on and try to make it work for you," he says. "Once you learn it, it doesn't take much to keep it going."</blockquote> 

I found this <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/22/health/gillis-weight-loss-couple/index.html?hpt=he_c1">article</a> very inspiring by how they never gave up and were able to overcome a challenge together. You will get what you want as long as you work for it. Hard work pays off within time. 

Were you inspired by this couple?
