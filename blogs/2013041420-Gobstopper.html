<p><a href="http://www.gobstopper.com/">Gobstopper</a> is an e-reading platform that encourages humanities teachers to embed questions, quizzes and commentary in the text of student reading materials. The system was developed by former English teacher and KIPP school principal <a href="http://www.newschools.org/blog/introducing-jason-singer">Jason Singer</a> who wanted to develop a product that would give teachers a window to student reading habits. Gobstopper streamlines book distribution, customization, and assessment by bringing reading online.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The reading experience on Gobstopper is clean and smooth; students are prompted for quizzes and thoughts during reading through camouflaged cues or when they turn the page. The challenges presented to the reader have a gamified feel, since students must answer each question before moving on in the reading. The system tracks both progress and quiz answers on the teacher side, so instructors can monitor whether students have done the reading along with their comprehension levels. All the questions are "open book" and students can go back in the reading and look for passages they may have missed before answering.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Gobstopper is currently focused on public domain titles so the book selection is limited. The system is currently aimed at students in grades K-12, but if future iterations of the platform support publisher partnerships or teacher uploading it might be appropriate for higher education. On-screen reading has not traditionally been the e-reading ideal, but today’s students might not be put off by Gobstopper’s web-only platform and it seems like a good move for technologically diverse schools.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Gobstopper is part of a changing reading landscape that is more social and more integrated. The system presents more opportunities for teacher intervention and assessment. By drawing attention to key passages through in-text questions, Gobstopper could potentially increase comprehension by encouraging careful reading. It’s possible to imagine a future iteration of the product in which incorrect answers lead to mini lessons that direct readers to important passages. Encouraging critical and questioning reading has always been a mission of literature teachers. Gobstopper reveals student progress to help ensure that students are getting the most out of reading.<p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Gobstopper gives teachers direct access to student reading and comprehension.</p>
