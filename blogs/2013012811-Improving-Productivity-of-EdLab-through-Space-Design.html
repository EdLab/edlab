            A Teachers College (TC) student randomly walked into the EdLab space. He paused in the middle of our wide-open seminar space and pondered for a few long moments. "May I help you", I asked, breaking his train of thought. It turns out he was an organization psychology student, with a special interest in workspace planning... and he had some ideas for us.

It was a timely encounter for me, since I've been thinking about how to be more productive during my hours at EdLab. As you all know, I move around a lot. It's likely I've sat in your chair when you weren't around... I go where the people are and where the equipment is... like in the case of working on New Learning Times' (NLT) visualized, where I find myself in a corner on our beautiful Wacom Cintiq tablet, trying to produce sketches... alone. I need to be alone to get into the flow, but at the same time, I deeply need feedback at frequent intervals in order to keep that flow going. But that flow often breaks... I'm bound to a systematic process of getting feedback on the evaluator, and also physically too far to ask someone to take a quick look...  I could blog about it, but what can be done when coworkers are quick to joke, "I don't really check the blog". It's not all that bad. I do interrupt some people on their stroll back to EdLab from the bathroom. And overall, I have a newly inspired mission to be more productive (and better) at creating visualizations for NLT.

Yesterday, I was mildly wrought by this... so I started writing a blog about spaces. The blog was further inspired by a conversation I had with David Havens from New Schools Venture Fund last week, where he directed me (and Megha) to <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">d.school at Stanford</a>. I found this section in the d.school website about "Make Space: The Book"... Here's an <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hiding-place.pdf" target="_blank">excerpt</a>.

Anyways, I'm curious to chat more about how EdLab's space can be improved.

What I propose:

1) I'd like to map out the interactions that happen within the EdLab. Data might exist within our weekly work updates. It would also become a nice visualization about our organization! Perhaps, a fresh take on the "People" page on our website? Remember this post I made way back when about datasexuals? I wrote it on my FIRST day at EdLab. <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7719" target="_blank">Check it out here.</a>

2) From there, let's talk about some ideas for our space. I don't feel like blogging it all out... Talking is faster. Please, just respond below if you're interested in talking about a space make-over, its implications on our productivity as an organization, and whether you feel like getting down and dirty with some heavy-lifting. Maybe we could invite this TC student to also collaborate with us. He would benefit, and we would too!
