<b>Recognizing Students' Goals in Game-Based Learning Environments: A
Markov Logic Approach</b>

James Lester, Jonathan Rowe
<blockquote>
Abstract:
There is growing evidence that game-based learning environments are
effective learning tools across a broad range of domains. Rich virtual
environments afforded by commercial game technologies offer
opportunities for guided inquiry-based learning and problem-solving
scenarios with multiple solution paths. However, dynamically
supporting students' learning processes within a game-based learning
environment requires computational models capable of recognizing and
reasoning about students' goals and plans during learning. Goal
recognition in game-based learning environments involves inferring
students' goals from observed sequences of low-level actions performed
by the student in the game environment, such as navigation,
manipulating objects, and interacting with characters. Game-based
learning environments pose significant challenges for goal
recognition, such as inherent uncertainty, exploratory actions, and
ill-defined goals.

In this talk, we describe recent work devising a goal recognition
framework for identifying students' problem-solving goals based on
Markov logic networks (MLNs). The goal recognition model's parameters
are directly learned from a corpus of student interactions with an
open-ended game-based learning environment, Crystal Island. We
describe the model's structure and present experimental results, in
which the MLN-based goal recognition model was compared to several
n-gram baseline models. The findings suggest the MLN goal recognition
model yields significant accuracy gains beyond the n-gram models for
predicting student goals in an open-ended game-based learning
environment.

<b>Making adaptive tutoring practical practical for the masses</b>

Bob Sottilare
<blockquote>
Abstract:  A primary goal is for adaptive tutoring to provide guided
learning experiences which are tailored for each individual without
the need for a human tutor.  This powerful technology is limited in
its application by high development costs and limited adaptiveness to
the needs of individual learners.  This talk will address key issues
to be resolved for adaptive tutoring technologies to be practical and
affordable for use in education and training.  Discussion will be
narrated in the context of the adaptive tutoring learning effect chain
which describes acquisition of learner data, modeling of learner
states, selection of optimal instructional strategies and the
influence of these processes on learning gains (e.g. performance) in
computer-mediated tutoring experiences.  Dr. Sottilare will also touch
on processes for affordable authoring and assessment of Intelligent
Tutoring System technologies.

of the SFC Paul Ray Smith Simulation & Training Technology Center
(STTC) within the Army Research Laboratory's Human Research and
Engineering Directorate (ARL-HRED). He also leads adaptive tutoring
research within ARL's Learning in Intelligent Tutoring Environments
(LITE) Laboratory where the focus of his research is in automated

Use of sensor-based data mining techniques to improve learner
modeling: Keith Brawner
</b>

<blockquote>
Abstract: Computer-based instructors, just like their human
counterparts, should monitor the emotional and cognitive states of
their students in order to adaptive instructional technique. Doing so
requires a model of student state to be available at run time, but
this has historically been difficult. Because people are different,
generalized models have not been able to be validated. As a person's
cognitive and affective state vary over time of day and seasonally,
individualized models have had differing difficulties. The
simultaneous creation and execution of an individualized model, in
real time, represents the last option for modeling such cognitive and
affective states. This talk presents and evaluates four differing
techniques for the creation of cognitive and affective models that are
created on-line and in real time for each individual user as
alternatives to generalized models. Each of these techniques involves
making predictions and modifications to the model in real time,
addressing the real time datastream problems of infinite length,
detection of new concepts, and responding to how concepts change over
time. Additionally, with the knowledge that a user is physically
present, this work investigates the contribution that the occasional
direct user query can add to the overall quality of such models. The
research described finds that the creation of a reasonable quality
affective model is possible with an infinitesimal amount of time and
without "ground truth" knowledge of the user, which is shown across
three different emotional states. Creation of a cognitive model in the
same fashion, however, was not possible via direct AI modeling, even
with all of the "ground truth" information available, which is shown
across four different cognitive states.
