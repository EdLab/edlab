<p>Despite the common Western view of Japan as a technological wonderland of robots and science fiction gadgets, this stereotype isn’t the full reality. The Japanese education sector has especially lagged behind in <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4698/how-the-shift-from-paper-and-pencil-has-negatively-impacted-east-asian-test-scores">incorporating new innovations</a>. One of the nation’s leading universities, Osaka University, is just now exploring online alternatives to required English courses. Before making these changes, a group of university researchers explored the ability and willingness of the student body to utilize online language learning.</p>

<p>The team surveyed 299 undergraduate Japanese students from the university. The survey tallied ownership or access to crucial tools needed for online classes (such as computers, webcams, and microphones). The respondents also self-rated their knowledge of various user functions and their personal use of educational web tools. Finally, the researchers asked if students were willing to take their English courses online. </p>

<p>Almost all of the participants had ample access to the internet or other resources needed for an online course. Likewise, students reported high competency rates in basic computer skills. However, most students were unfamiliar with more advanced skills, such as media editing. Students actually only averaged about two hours per day of computer use, less time than the researchers expected.</p> 

<p>While the researchers found the students had access to the necessary technological resources, they also discovered that most students were unwilling to make a switch to online English classes. Only about a third of the respondents felt comfortable studying through an online model. Most of the other undergraduates were apprehensive about the change. Around half of the students were concerned about their ability to type in English. </p>

<p>Through this preliminary research, these professors believe that the Osaka student body is not ready to convert completely to online courses. While students have ample experience playing online games, using social networks, and consuming other entertainment, many of them do not have enough experience or confidence with digital learning. The scholars suggest that university leaders pay careful attention to these results before making any curriculum changes. </p>
