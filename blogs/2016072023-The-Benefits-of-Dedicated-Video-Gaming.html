            As an avid member of the competitive Super Smash Bros Melee community, I love watching, studying, and playing the game. Recently, I've made some observations of three of the five "gods" of Melee that I thought showed just how beneficial dedicated video gaming can be.

Joseph "Mang0" Marquez, commonly referred to as the greatest Melee player of all time, once stated in an interview, "Melee is 90% mental- if you don't have the right mentality when training or playing in tournament, you're going to lose." He has placed horribly in tournaments before, but due to his fantastic mental fortitude, he has always been able to bounce back from loss.

Jason "Mew2King" Zimmerman has put in well over 2000 hours of research and in-depth frame data into the game. He is the origin of much of the modern metagame- strategies used in games which transcend prescribed rulesets.

Kevin "PPMD" Nanney suffers from depression and, despite only going to four major tournaments in the past two years, members of the community still support and love him, waiting for him to return to the main stage.

Allow me to explain further:

The first of these benefits is the development of a strong mindset- a winning mindset. In essence, this mentality is the idea that growth only comes from grit. This type of thinking is incredibly beneficial- not only does it foster confidence in people, but it also destroys the corrupting illusion that talent trumps effort.

Video games often have accessible in-game statistics also allow players to really buckle down and study its characteristics. In in the case of Melee, dedicated video gamers know tons of frame data- how long certain moves last, based on the number of frames it stays out for. The focus and concentration it takes to study, memorize, and execute this type of knowledge in-game is unparalleled. I've linked an example of this frame data <a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/smash/Fox/Frame_Data
" target = "blank">here</a> to look at (keep in mind that one frame is equal to 1/30 of a second).

It is also incredible how social video games like Melee have a knack for helping people who suffer from developmental or mental disorders. Zimmerman, for example, suffers from autism, and lacks some essential social skills while Nanney suffers from depression. Yet, both of these players are welcomed by the community, have been touted as gods, and have made lifelong, supportive friends and fans.

This <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/11/how_video_games_can_teach_your_brain_to_fight_depression.html" target = "blank">article</a>, written by Jane McGonigal approaches this topic of video gaming with a more psychological point of view- mainly showing how it helps with depression- but it describes a variety of benefits in the process.
