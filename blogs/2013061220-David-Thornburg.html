Although many futurists and education theorists have predicted the rise of mobile, open-source technologies and the importance of project-based learning, <a href="http://www.tcpd.org/david-thornburg/">David Thornburg</a> is one of the few to focus on these areas and also make a clear case for the importance of learners "creatively constructing" their own knowledge.  Thornburg accomplishes this goal of "prepar(ing) students for their future, not for our past" while fostering hands-on learning through his innovative <a href="http://www.tcse-k12.org/pages/holodeck.pdf">Educational Holodeck project</a> (Also explore <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/3599">this vialogue</a> featuring the Holodeck).  The Holodeck reimagines physical learning space and makes use of projection, online technologies and multiple screens to create an "immersive, interactive, learning environment suited to interdisciplinary exploration of academic topics through realistic simulations."  Holodeck classroom interactions are especially well-suited to the sciences and STEM subjects, a special interest area for Thornburg.   
<p>
Thornburg advances his work with next generation learning technologies through his consulting group, <a href="http://www.tcpd.org/">The Thornburg Center for Pragmatic Visionaries</a>.  In addition to consulting with a wide range of global public and private sector organizations, individuals and governments, Thornburg is also in demand as a public speaker, workshop facilitator and author (Look for his forthcoming book, <i>From the Campfire to the Holodeck: How Place Matters in Education</i>).  He cites his own lifelong fascination with space travel as the guiding factor that inspires his goal of supporting and exploring new ways to use the "Holodeck" concept to expand our idea of the "classroom," create the STEM classroom of the future and develop an environment that fosters inquiry-driven, project-based learning.  Thornburg worked at Xerox Parc in the 1970’s and taught at Stanford’s Engineering school on the subject of creativity. He is currently a Senior Consultant with the architecture firm Fielding Nair and engaged on projects focused on re-imagining learning spaces.  Most recently, Thornburg has been engaged in a part-time appointment teaching at Walden University in the field of Instructional Technology.  Thornburg has received many awards including Golden and Platinum Disk awards from CUE (Computer Using Educators, Inc.), was selected as one of twenty "pioneers" in the field of educational technology by ISTE, and was named by Technology and Learning Magazine as one of the top ten most influential educational technologists of the past twenty years.  Thornburg completed both his masters and PhD at the University of Illinois at Urban-Champaign.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> I have always been interested in science and engineering.  As a child of the October Sky, the launch of Sputnik in 1957 cemented my interest and (as a consumer) I was the beneficiary of some good educational experiences and some that were not so good.  I found that I was learning the most when I was doing projects and answering questions I had a role in asking.  My current dedication to inquiry-driven project-based learning is a clear result of this experience.  I also realized that creativity and curiosity were central to unlocking the door to learning in all children.


<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> While I was at Xerox PARC in the 1970's, I taught part time at Stanford University in the Design Division of the college of engineering.  My main course was on the topic of creativity and my students were all in the PhD program.  Since that time I have expanded my understanding of educational ideas through such brilliant thinkers as Seymour Papert (whom I met for the first time in 1972), Howard Gardner, and others.  My work with educators through workshops and through another part-time University appointment (Walden University PhD program in instructional technology) keeps me fresh.  In Brazil I enjoy doing workshops with children.  Their creative capacity is amazing.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> NCLB is dead - at last.  My hope is that my work in areas ranging from inquiry to the theory of learning spaces (first published years ago in Campfires in Cyberspace, and now to appear in a new book from Jossey-Bass - From the Campfire to the Holodeck) will create learning environments that enrich students and teachers alike.


<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> The Next Generation Science Standards provide a refreshing change in how science and engineering are taught in the K-12 schools.  Technologies (as McLuhan said) are the extension of man, and they will continue to change as capability increases and price decreases.


<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Our current major work is described at <a href="http://knights-of-knowledge.com/">Knights-of-Knowledge</a>  We have created a series of short videos (about a minute or so in length) that set up a challenging question for students to explore.  Many of these "quests" are transdiciplinary, and we have materials across the spectrum of subject areas.  Our next set of video quests are all STEM related, as this is such an important area these days.
