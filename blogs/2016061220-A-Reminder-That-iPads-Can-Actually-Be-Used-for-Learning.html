<p>After all the bad press iPads have gotten from poorly executed technology integration programs by school districts, it's important to remember that when used correctly, they can be valuable learning devices.  </p>

<p> A recent study tried to determine the most important educational benefits provided by iPads.
The 15-week-long qualitative study examined graduate students’ use of iPads in their scholarly lives. It examined the many ways learners wove iPads into their academic workflow, including studying course material, completing assignments, and conducting research. </p>

<p>The study revealed four key themes across participants. First, <i>affordances</i> are the array of properties that define the use of a device. The main iPad affordances include its small size, multiple functions, large storage capacity, and ability to act as a personal organizer. Second, iPads provide access to written materials including articles, books, and other documents in a convenient electronic form. Third, iPads provide access to online resources, including diverse web content and low cost apps that personalize their use. Fourth, students use iPads to create academic materials such as class notes. </p>

<p>Due to the iPad’s low price (at least relative to other Apple products) and diverse feature set, many graduate students use them not only for play but also to meet more formal scholastic requirements. This study gives these students and other scholars more concrete ideas about how to incorporate the seemingly infinite affordances of iPads into their daily academic lives. If nothing else it serves as a reminder to educators and administrators that when used appropriately, iPads are worth the investment.</p>
