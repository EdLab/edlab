          <p>
            A recently released report sheds light on the <a href="http://www.usnewsuniversitydirectory.com/articles/online-educations-importance-confirmed-by-release_11805.aspx">increasing role of online education among higher education students</a>. The report, compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), notes that between 2000 and 2008, the number of undergraduate students who took at least one online course rose from 8% to 20% while the number of students enrolled entirely in online courses during this time rose from 2% to 4%.

Though there are many reasons that account for this increase in online course enrollment among undergrads, the overwhelming sentiment among students is that online courses affords them a chance to earn credits from the comfort of their living rooms instead of commuting. Students also noted that online courses allowed them to finish their work on time and allows for more flexibility than most campus-based classes. For older undergraduates, most of whom have work or family, online courses offer them a chance to balance all of their responsibilities. Disabled students are also most likely to enroll in online courses than their peers. 

In addition to the aforementioned increase and reasons, the study also highlights the areas of study with high enrollment in online courses as well as institutions that has an increase in the number of its students enrolled in online classes.
