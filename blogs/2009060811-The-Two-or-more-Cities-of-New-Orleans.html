          <p>
            If anyone's interested, here's another sample blog I've been working on for the <i>Teaching the Levees</i> website:

What's the current situation in New Orleans?  It seems the news media can't agree. While the Chicago Sun-Times recently published a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/nation/1588556,CST-NWS-orleans24.article">sunny article</a> describing how recovery money has steeled New Orleans against the recession (leading young, laid-off workers to flock to the area) and the Times-Picayune <a href="http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2009/05/experts_economic_boost_associa.html">suggests</a> that the 2013 Superbowl (recently awarded to the city) would spark an "economic engine," other reports were not quite so favorable.  The Economist labeled New Orleans a <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13649034&source=hptextfeature">City of Sickness</a>, describing a persistent lack of medical services and a preponderance of vacant homes, while The Nation suggested that putting taxpayer dollars towards luxury Superbowl improvements was the <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090608/zirin">wrong kind of spending</a> for a city with little stable infrastructure and high poverty rates.  Furthermore, Mayor Ray Nagin in his recent <a href="http://www.louisianaweekly.com/news.php?viewStory=1340">State of the City address</a> discussed the continuing racial divide within New Orleans, and the Los Angeles Times published a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-shrink-new-orleans31-2009may31,0,1428057.story">story</a> indicating the distress of the city's black population over unfavorable housing regulations.

    An <a href="http://www.2theadvocate.com/opinion/46583822.html">op-ed</a> on a local Louisiana news site goes so far as to describe the "two cities of Orleans," echoing the perplexing divide in the media's recent coverage of the recovery process.  In truth, however, New Orleans has perhaps always been two cities, or more than two, depending on your perspective.  Historically (and as noted in the Teaching the Levees curriculum), the Crescent City has possessed one of the nation's highest rates of economic inequality, as well as complicated racial definitions stretching back to the 1700s.

    In the face of past crises, New Orleans' response has rarely been simple.  After the schools crisis of 1960 (in which the first attempts at school integration were made in the city, causing a violent reaction on the part of white supremacists in the region), the city seemed to progress and decline simultaneously.  While the crisis galvanized the black community, and eventually led to a more open political system (at least on the surface level), it also spurred the start of a long trend of white flight, leading to an increase in poverty and inequality and a decline in population. 

As such, New Orleans in particular can be hard to peg down when it comes to the city's progress.  It is important to recognize these historical patterns as we explore the narrative of post-Katrina recovery and attempt to make sense of the variability in the stories available.  It is also valuable to note that the challenge of rebuilding the city is not just one of resurrection, but also of unification in areas that have previously been dangerously disparate.
