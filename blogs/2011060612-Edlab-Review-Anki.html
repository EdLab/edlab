            Edlab Review: <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>

Description:
Anki is an open-source flashcard program that uses spaced repetition (adjusted based on the user's confidence level) to maximize memory retention.  This is old-hat for us at <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5659">Edlab</a>.  But Anki is stricter than Brainscape, and it keeps you to a tight schedule, so that if you skip a day, you're just going to have to do that much work to catch up.
<!--break-->
Pros:
What's interesting about Anki to me is how well set up it is to follow a user across all potential platforms.  The program automatically syncs with an online account, so that whatever computer (or iphone, or tablet, or other supported device) you happen to be using, you'll remain on the same schedule.  This sort of convenience is necessary in a program that wants to keep you on such a tight schedule, and also makes Anki a great timewaster when you're waiting for the train.  
Anki's resources (“decks”) are all user-submitted,and you can study an extremely wide variety of subjects (although the quality of the decks is, of course, not assured).

Cons:  The interface is not particularly intuitive, and figuring out how to take advantage of all of Anki's features is a slow process, as I imagine is common for open-source software.  
This particular flash card format is also somewhat inefficient at instructing the use on a database with which they have no familiarity.  It's hard to remember any word definitions, for instance, when you don't know any of the words at all.

Relevance:
Although I haven't made a survey of the whole field, Anki was the most convenient flashcard-type program I've found yet. And yet, it still feels like something's missing.  It may be worthwhile to think about how to integrate a “flashcard” type program with other learning tools.  Besides simply memorizing definitions, learning a language should involve translating sentences, grammar study, etc.  It's not particularly easy to shoehorn those other tools into a flashcard program, and yet it would be good to make learning on other related fronts keep pace with your progress in the narrower category of “vocabulary.”
