            <strong>Guns N’ Roses Encyclopaedia</strong>
<strong>Location</strong>: under “<a href="http://vq2st5lq8v.search.serialssolutions.com/">Journals and Databases</a>” at TC, search for it by name

Here’s a reference resource you might not realize is available to you through Gottesman Library: <em>The Guns N’ Roses Encyclopaedia</em>.  Chock full of meaty details and color photos of the band and their friends, <em>The Guns N’ Roses Encyclopaedia</em> is a treasure trove of facts and stories.  Did you know that Dave  Abbrusseze, former Pearl Jam drummer (his time with them was  short-lived) also played for GN’R on Chinese Democracy?   You would know this if you read the first entry in the Encyclopaedia.   Organized alphabetically (as most encyclopedias are) this reference  work collects all people, subjects, places, and bands closely or  tangentially related to our fearless tattooed rockers (featured  prominently in numerous photos throughout).  For instance, you might not  expect Shaquille O’Neil to have an entry, but he does; he rapped a bit  on Chinese Democracy.   According to the entry, Shaq enjoyed the work.  “'It was the first  time I’d ever performed with a rock band, and it felt good.’ Shaq later  admitted.” (p. 187) Entries read like lively magazine profiles.   Consider this description of the band’s ill-fated use of Persian  heroin:  “Although Slash hadn’t partaken in the Persian, he’d knocked  back enough Jack Daniels to fell a buffalo....”  Mayhem ensues,  including an emergency room visit for Motley Crew member Nikki Six.  He  recovered, and the incident inspired the song, Kickstart My Heart. (p.  222)

This is not the only reference resource for Guns N’ Roses enthusiasts.  Teachers College also holds <em>Guns N’ Roses: The Band That Time Forgot </em>in its collection, an unauthorized biography by Paul Stenning.  Although  the author was not able to interview Axl Rose, and suggests that Rose  probably doesn’t know his book exists, Stenning claims that inside is “a  view of into the psyche of Axl Rose and a large part of the book  concentrates on what exactly he has done for the last decade, creating a  highly personal and probing profile previously unwritten or explored.”  (p. 7) Indeed, chapter 11, “Estranged,” focused on Axl’s life from 1993  to 2003.
