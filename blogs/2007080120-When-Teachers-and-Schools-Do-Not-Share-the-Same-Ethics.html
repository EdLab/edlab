          <p>
            This past spring I spent several days observing art classes at the School of Arts and Technology at Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Lincoln Center. MLK Jr. used to be just one school, but a few years back it was closed because it was considered a "failing school" by the New York Dept. of Ed (many students were failing, the school had a low graduation rate and there was also a shooting that occurred).  The NYDoE then re-opened the school with 5 sub-schools located inside (schools are separated by floor levels).  One of these schools, the School of Arts and Technology, is where I decided to complete my observation hours for my art education program requirement. I had chosen the school thinking it was a magnet school and because I wanted to observe a teacher that had not gone to TC (I had wanted to expand my horizons...).

I can honestly say it was an eye-opening experience, but it was also jaw-dropping.  I also found out that the school is not an arts magnet high school, but was just given the name "School of Arts and Tech" because, according to the teacher I observed, "it probably sounded good to the Dept. of Ed".  The teacher I observed disliked the school and her job and said on more than one occasion how hard it was to teach there.  I also witnessed fights among students (on one occasion I reported a fight to a security guard in the hallway and he merely looked back at me, blank faced) and terrible attendance rates (during my eight visits to the "advanced" class, I counted 8 different numbers for the daily attendance, ranging from 6 students one day to approx. 15 another).  This is not to say that the students I observed did not have any potential, in fact I saw several drawings on folders and in notebooks of students that proved the contrary, but that this potential is not being realized at MLK Jr. HS. <i>(read more)</i>

I had almost pushed the memory of those visits to the back of my mind when I came across <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/education/01education.html?ref=education">this article</a> on the New York Times website about a teacher from the same school, School of Arts and Tech, that recently quit his job as a math teacher because of an altercation regarding one of his student's grades.  The teacher had been given strict guidelines for grading students and found himself in an ethical dilemma this past spring when he realized not everyone, namely the principal and vice principal at the school, sticks to these guidelines. I was quite surprised by the vice principal's involvement in this story because I had met Mr. Arocho and had spoken to him at length about my career, the school, and education in general; in fact, he was the only person I had met at the school that I thought was being pro-active and trying to make the school a better place, however my views of him have now been tainted after reading this article.

The article, though disheartening in many regards, does bring up a valid and relevant point for today's schools; When does a teacher draw the line and be "insubordinate" to administration so that the students will benefit and the teacher does not compromise his/her own morals? Is it ever OK?  In my classes here at TC we have been warned to recognize that there is a fine line between pushing the limit with what artwork we hang, for example, and what we don't; In an ideal world, student artwork would never be censored (e.g., nudes would be viewed as art and not lewd pictures of naked individuals), but often times catering to an administration/community members that do not think nudes are appropriate for a school's hallways, and not losing one's job, becomes the priority.  How do we, as educators, find a balance between our own agendas and those of others (e.g., administration, faculty, parents, etc.) that determine our fate at the school?
