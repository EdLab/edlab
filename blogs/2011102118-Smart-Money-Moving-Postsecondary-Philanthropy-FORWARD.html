As long as there have been caring philanthropists with the means ($$) and resources (more $$), there has been private funding and support for postsecondary education. This report by the Institute for Higher Education Policy describes a super reader-friendly and creative approach to informed philanthropic decision-making to help organizations continue to support postsecondary education.

<b>Description:</b>
Because the allocation of resources that private philanthropic organizations — both national and community foundations — have been increasing over the past decade, it is important that funding decisions be made properly with key questions in mind. This report especially emphasizes the educational need in metropolitan areas. Therefore, they suggest a mapping approach (categorizing metropolitan areas into quadrants) for assisting national and community foundations in crafting those key questions, such as: Where to engage in funding activities, for how long, and what types of activities are likely to succeed in specific metropolitan areas. 

<b>Method:</b>
Using national data, four quadrants were developed to represent the distinct local demographic, economic, and policy contexts of metropolitan areas. With empirical analysis, each metropolitan area was mapped into a specific quadrant, showing what type of philanthropic intervention would be most appropriate to meet their education and economic needs. The mapping was done using calculations along two dimensions: Current educational need (percentage of adults with a college degree in 2009) and extent of inertia present in a metro are (change in college degree attainment rate from 2000-2009).

<b>Results:</b>
As a result, 22% of the 267 metropolitan areas used in analysis were placed placed in the Targeted Programs Quadrant, 16% in Capacity Building, 36% in Large-Scale Investment, and 26% in Workforce Development. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Overall, I thought this was a very creative and helpful way of approaching informed philanthropic decision-making, not only for postsecondary education, but also for all fields in need of support. The methods presented in this report would help minimize waste of money and resources and help leaders of philanthropy craft strategies that will be successful. Taking into consideration metropolitan areas in this “categorization mindset” way offers a foundation for strategic decision-making for education philanthropy in the future. And a side note: The aesthetics, graphics, and great layout of this report was what made the read THAT much more enjoyable!
