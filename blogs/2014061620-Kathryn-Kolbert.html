<a href="https://barnard.edu/profiles/kathryn-kolbert">Kathryn Kolbert</a> inspires young learners through both her groundbreaking career as a public-interest attorney, journalist, not-for-profit visionary, and her work as the Constance Hess Williams Director of the <a href="https://athenacenter.barnard.edu/">Athena Center for Leadership Studies at Barnard College</a>. Ms. Kolbert’s career has spanned the fields of civil rights, reproductive rights, women’s issues and collaborative leadership, and she was recognized by The National Law Journal as one of the "100 Most Influential Lawyers in America." Ms. Kolbert has been instrumental in securing women’s reproductive rights, argued the landmark case of <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1991/1991_91_744"> Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> before the U.S. Supreme Court, and is credited with saving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>. Prior to joining Barnard, Kolbert was the President and CEO of <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/">People for the American Way</a> and People for the American Way Foundation, as well as overseeing a program on law and American life at the <a href="http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/">University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center</a>. Kolbert was also the executive producer of <a href="http://www.justicetalking.org/">Justice Talking</a>, and along with many other roles, directed the educational website, JusticeLearning.org.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have had a very eclectic career.  Most of my career was spent as a public interest attorney doing women’s rights litigation.  But I have also had stints as a journalist and radio producer, and as a CEO of a large civil rights organization.  I learned from all of these jobs, two critical things about myself.  I like learning new things on a regular basis and I like trying to create new programs that are effective and directly impact and improve the lives of women and girls and other people from disempowered communities.   
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have had the honor of working at the highest levels of my profession, and arguing cases in the Supreme Court that made a tremendous difference in the lives and health of women across the nation.  But not everything I have done has been a success.  Many of my initiatives have failed in large and small ways.  I think I have learned that to be effective you need to think big, be willing to take risks, and be resilient in the face of failure.  Most importantly, I have learned that it is really important to like going to work every day and have fun while you are there.  Nurturing your own spirit is key.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I have long believed that if we knew the best way to advance women to leadership, we would have done it already.  Overcoming discrimination and ensuring that women can develop their own leadership skills and ambitions is difficult work with no easy ways to scale.  By developing a research based approach to leadership training and development that can be tested and used to train professionals working in this area, we hope to ensure that more women have an opportunity to advance to leadership and to change institutions that have too long stalled their progress. 

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Women particularly want to learn in settings in which they can understand why learning these skills or content will make a difference and see the practical applicability of them to contexts that can improve the lives of others.  Thus I think it is important to give context to the content college age women learn in a liberal arts setting, ensuring both that they have critical thinking skills, a wide basis of knowledge <i>and</i> the ability to apply these in settings where their creativity and enthusiasm can make positive social change. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The Athena Center has just completed developing the Athena Core10&copy;, a set of attributes and skills that we think women need to learn in order to rise to leadership and be effective.  In the next several years, we will test the model, develop a methodology to teach it to women in both corporate and nonprofit settings and build an assessment tool to measure women’s progress.  We are also working on a new project to license to schools, a 1 or 2 day version of the <a href="http://athenafilmfestival.com/">Athena Film Festival</a>, a celebration of women and leadership, which showcases women leaders in real life and the fictional world.
