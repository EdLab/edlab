            Why are English and math exams still predominantly used to gauge students' abilities? Although generally accurate, says an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/us/study-finds-early-signs-of-creativity-in-adults.html?ref=education&_r=0">article in the New York Times,</a> spatial reasoning exams may prove more accurate. The study referenced in the article had students take both the SAT and the Differential Aptitude Exam, an exam that measures spatial reasoning abilities by having students manipulate certain objects in 2 and 3 dimensions. The students that did well on both the SAT and the Differential Aptitude Exam tended to be more reliably successful than those that just did well on the SAT, particularly in STEM fields. Cognitive psychologists are saying that spacial reasoning abilities are the key to success in STEM fields, though they often go undetected. For this reason, researchers from Vanderbilt University are calling for an inclusion of a spatial reasoning section on the SAT and ACT exams.

This brings up a critical question. Should we keep the traditional English, math and science based curricula, or should we try to implement courses that try to develop fundamental skills and different ways of thinking? I have personally noticed that most of elementary school follows a pattern of tiny iterative advances from year to year. What is the big difference between third grade math and fourth grade math? Many of the courses taken in elementary and even middle school are just smaller versions of courses to be taken in high school. How many times do I have to take the same US history course with slightly more depth with each iteration? I'm not suggesting we eliminate history or math in elementary and middle school. I think they can be more efficiently implemented alongside courses that could train kids to think in different ways and allow them to discover their abilities in spacial reasoning. Thoughts?
