<p>Flocabulary has established its place as a cool classroom tool that teaches students vocabulary through hip hop, yet its newest feature, <a href="https://www.flocabulary.com/subjects/">Lyric Lab</a>, brings a whole new level of creativity to the platform. One of seven activities students can dive into in each Flocabulary unit, Lyric Lab puts student vocab knowledge to the test by having them incorporate key terms into their own original rhymes.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Flocabulary already made students into lyrics interpreters and vocab learners, but the addition of Lyric Lab means that students also get to be lyric creators. On any given unit, Lyric Lab increases students’ vocabulary understanding by having them use key terms concerning the unit’s theme. Each Lyric Lab module includes a list of key terms that are crossed off when students type them into their lyrics. These terms also come with a list of rhyming words, slant rhyming words (as in, those words that are possibly-but-not-really rhymes), and a corresponding definition.</p>

<p>The platform also allows students to choose from an extensive list of beats while they construct their rhymes. These beats can get the creativity flowing while allowing students more individuality in their song construction. Because Lyric Lab lets students construct their own lyrics using vocabulary words on the theme, it supports their understanding of key concepts and terms through creative use. Although it would probably not work well as a standalone vocabulary learning activity, Lyric Lab provides a fantastic way for students to practice using words they’ve already learned.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The list of key terms presented in Lyric Lab is a useful feature, but also comes with the drawback that it may hinder students’ creativity. By having a measure of vocabulary words included (e.g., 0/8), these terms are positioned as words that need to be written into rhymes rather than as suggested terms, which may make writing lyrics feel more like a test than an opportunity for creative expression. Also, teachers aren’t able to edit the key terms to change the vocabulary they want students to practice. This could limit how the platform aligns with a teacher’s curriculum goals.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Although Lyric Lab is fun enough for students to want to dive right in, this new addition to the Flocabulary platform works best in conjunction with the other modules in each unit. From video raps, to vocab maps, to writing their own tracks, students hop from flip to hip as they grow their vocab with Lyric Lab.</p>
