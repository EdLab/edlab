<p>Richard Byrne is a former high school social studies teacher best known for developing the award-winning blog <a href="http://bit.ly/1RlP5eW">Free Technology for Teachers</a>, which reaches more than 100,000 educators. Byrne’s work is focused on sharing free resources that educators can use to enhance their students’ learning experiences. Byrne is a Google Certified Teacher and five-time winner of the Edublogs Award for Best Resource Sharing Blog. Byrne received a Merlot Classics award from the chancellor’s office of California State University in 2012 and was a finalist for the Association of Computer Teachers and Educators in Maine (ACTEM) educator of the year award in 2010. <a href="http://bit.ly/1JplPCR">Tech & Learning Magazine</a> named him one of its "people to watch" in its 30th Anniversary celebration. Byrne also maintains <a href="http://bit.ly/1SvdoIo">iPadApps4School.com</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1Pb68vG">PracticalEdTech.com</a>. His print work includes his monthly column for <i>School Library Journal</i>, his work in <i>What School Leaders Need to Know About Digital Technologies and Social Media</i>, and contributions to <i>Teacher Librarian</i>.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>Prior to becoming a high school teacher, I was an operations manager at a couple of FedEx Ground terminals. Part of my responsibilities there included training and mentoring new employees. That experience sparked the teaching bug in me.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>My goal is to help teachers create memorable learning experiences for their students. That could mean having students use technology for things like MakeyMakey projects that they'll remember for years. Or it could mean helping teachers use technology to streamline a workflow so that they have more time to spend working one-on-one with students.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Over the next five years, I think we'll continue to see a push toward teaching multiple subjects through the lens of programming and STEM.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Currently, a lot of my time is dedicated to MindRocket Media Group, which provides advisory services to edtech start-ups. I also spend a lot of time developing online PD courses for teachers.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I always recommend following <a href="http://bit.ly/1PI94oe">Larry Ferlazzo</a> because he is always sharing great, new educational technology resources. <a href="http://bit.ly/1OGRtyf">Dr. Scott McLeod</a> has always been great at challenging my thought process without being confrontational. That's a quality that I really appreciate about Scott. Some people get on Twitter and act like being confrontational equals challenging thought processes—it doesn't. <a href="http://bit.ly/1Z1dyqH">Vicki Davis</a> is another person who I have always respected for her thoughtful approach to sharing and discussing trends in educational technology. <a href="http://bit.ly/1SveiVc">Dr. Wes Fryer</a> is also someone who I greatly respect for his ability to write about trends in educational technology, theory, and practice in a very balanced style.</p>
