          <p>
            I came across <a href="http://edreformer.com/2010/07/personalize-learning-to-broaden-equity-and-knowledge/">this very recent interview</a> of Howard Gardner, a Harvard Professor who is known for work on the Multiple Intelligences Theory.

The interview is about personalized learning.  The idea here is that every topic can be taught in multiple ways, and which presentation gets the better response will depend on the student.  Gardner criticized our education system for providing a "uniform" standard, which seems fair on the surface but is actually extremely unfair.  When a uniform system is chosen, the students for whom it works win, and the other students lose.  There's no reason why it has to be that way.

I think that good teachers have understood this for a long time, and therefore the criticism by Garner applies more to our standardized test system and overall public education philosophy.  I agree with Gardner that there are certain skills that everyone should have, but there are various ways of demonstrating these skills:

"This is not to say that there should be no common standards.  But students ought to have flexibility in how they demonstrate what they have learnedâ€“through essays, through projects, through the creation of works of art that bear on the topic at hand."

Two current trends that indicate that personalized education is an important emerging field.

1) Technology.  Through information technology, we can all get a much more personalized experience.  Not only do we have lots of choices, but we also have sophisticated algorithms that help us make those choices.

2) The Charter School movement.  I believe that to have true differentiation of educational approaches, some of it will have to occur outside of the traditional school system.  Gardner seems to understand this, but he hedges by saying that he doesn't see them as a "silver bullet" in order to ensure that his interview is not too controversial.  In the end, it does not matter if alternative education programs are not a "silver bullets" so long as they are a prerequisite to change.
