<p>Although we can’t all be musical prodigies like Mozart or <a href="http://guardian.ng/art/indonesian-child-prodigy-again-up-for-grammy/">Joey Alexander</a>, that does not mean music shouldn’t play a vital role in our learning and development. For those who are not naturally talented with instruments, technology can become an essential medium for the growth of musical skills. The creators of <a href="http://auxy.co">Auxy Music Studio</a> use technology to make composing tracks and beats accessible to anyone with a smartphone or tablet.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>Auxy Music Studio can make you a composer in a matter of minutes. You simply put on headphones, pick an instrument via the app, and the magic begins. The platform makes it easy to create electronic beats. The interface is intuitive, and the built-in scaffolding helps users work effortlessly. Though video tutorials were available, there really was no need for me to reference them even though I was a beginner to the app. Each user starts with a blank page and is able to mix and match a wide range of beats and musical tracks. Users are also able to export the music into files that are compatible with several different devices so they can share their creations with different audiences.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>There are no built-in tools that make it easy for educators to grade or create lessons, so it is important that learning goals are clear for students if Auxy Music Studio is used in a school setting. There are several questions surrounding the differences in educational benefits of learning real instruments versus using electric ones, as plenty of research has been done citing significant benefits for the use of real instruments. In addition, a redundancy issue can arise from the use of digital instruments as students may quickly become bored with the repetitious beats. Don’t depend on this app to learn music constructs, as its function lies solely in its ability to help you easily compose rhythms based on sound. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p>Auxy Music Studio gives people who struggle with music the opportunity to go beyond playing Hot Cross Buns on the recorder, and this is coming from someone who tried to learn the guitar, the violin, and the piano with no success. With many high profile musicians now using digital music, it is important for educators to also begin considering classroom space for this type of application. Auxy offers learners the chance to explore music and technology, and it may even turn them into digital composers.</p>
