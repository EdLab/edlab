<b>Description:</b> 
<a href="http://www.tutorcloud.com/">TutorCloud</a> is a pay-as-you-go, cloud-based online tutoring platform.  What makes this system unique from other similar platforms like <a href="Hoot.me">Hoot</a>, <a href="http://www.tutorchatlive.org/">TutorChat Live</a> and other live tutoring sites?  First, you get to pick your personal tutor from a "menu" (see screen shot below) that lists their background, unique style and focus subject areas.  Also, you can use Skype, email, text messages and the proprietary virtual learning environment (see screenshot below).  One of the main points of difference is the pay-as-you-go model, for top-tier tutoring sites this seems like a rarity, as many only offer yearly or monthly memberships.  Also, each session is guaranteed, to be "perfect" or the fee will be refunded (how do they measure perfection?).

<b>Pros:</b> 
The system seems flexible via many forms of communication and content delivery from video to audio to text-based communication.  This open delivery & communication seems like such an important distinguishing feature of any tutoring system, that it will meet the learner wherever they ARE in their lives.  The reliance on a virtual classroom that is cool & "not your grandmother's classroom" seems like a great way to access & engage young  digital natives.  Also, the UI seems intuitive, simple and fun to use, burrowing from existent social media & e-commerce conventions like share, like, reviews etc.  Like <a href="http://ednode.com/people/">Ednode</a> (check-ou the new release!) TutorCloud has an anonymous internal communication system allowing learners and tutors to communicate without sharing their personal contact info.  

<b>Cons:</b>
The price,  at $20-40 (depending on experience/credentials of tutor) an hour, this is not a resource for lower-income students.  Resources like <a href="http://www.tutorchatlive.org/">TutorChat Live</a> and <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> are free resources that are high quality, though offering less flexible, real-time interaction with tutors, for highly motivated learners these sites could be great option.  In this economy & as <a href-"http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6738">income inequality becomes even more of an issue for students</a>, we need more free tools to close the achievement gap.  Finally, a minor drawback is that tutors receive reviews and their isn't an aggregated "score" so you have to go through & read each review to make your final selection. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As I mention above, this platform seems great for wealthier kids who may already have advantages in life that their less wealthy peers lack.  What additional tools can we develop that are free or can be bought by school districts at a low-price and offered to ALL students?  How do we balance profitability & social responsibility when developing new tools for the education sector?  Do you take money from advertisers to balance the cost for schools?  How effective would a wiki-based tutoring system be? 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
As we work to develop our own learning management systems, content delivery platforms, online courses and educational games it is important to remember the balance between the benefits of social media, flexible content delivery and price of the system both to the creators and end users.  I wonder what additional asynchronous learning tools EdLab could create?  I imagine that <a href="https://vialogues.com/">Vialogues</a> could be used as a tutoring system  or way to "flip the classroom" & provide reinforcement outside of the "normal" school schedule, plus, Vialogues is free.
