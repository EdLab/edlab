          <p>
            I just watched a great movie about education this weekend I want to recommend to the Edlab crew. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iin1Itk-7c">"The Class,"</a> a movie from France written by (and starring) Francois Begaudeau, is based on his real experiences teaching in an "inner-city" high school. It follows one (sophomore?) high school class throughout a year.
<!--break-->
I guess it was interesting to see that France has the same class and race issues in their schools as we do, but the real attraction was in the movie's investigation of an unorthodox (to my eyes at least) teaching style.  

Begaudeau, called "Marin" in the movie, works very hard to treat his students like equals, and attempts to engage them honestly and forthrightly.  Although there wasn't much of a plot to the movie, this habit does lead to the one scandal, when Marin unfortunately expresses an unguarded opinion of the academic prospects of a struggling student.  

The student is hurt and grows disaffected, and the downstream effects include a great deal of tension and argument within (and outside) the classroom.  The lesson I took away was that the teacher-student relationship is necessarily an unequal one, and requires some embrace of hierarchy to function.

But I tend to score strongly on the "authoritarian" side of any values questionnaire, and I'd be curious about other people's reactions.
