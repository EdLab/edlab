          <p>
            All around America today we are concerned about how to improve the education system and we think that using<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-11-11/the-false-promise-of-classroom-technology"> technology in classrooms</a>
 would be the magic pill that will help this situation. All of us understand that technology is the modern way of life and we use it for our everyday needs. We live in a world that is dominated by technology. That doesn't mean it will solve poor learning outcome in students across the country.
I understand that technology can be very useful by providing additional support outside classroom. But let us keep in mind that teachers would need more training for the use of these devices in addition of their teaching time. Not to forget the need of technical support to troubleshoot these devices in case of failure. There are many factors we need to consider while introducing ipad and other devices into the classroom.

I was not even introduced to calculators in school, back home in Africa, before coming to United States 4 years ago and yet I was a big fan, and still am, of Mathematics and technical subjects and here I am pursuing a degree in Engineering. <a href=" http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/technology/technology-in-schools-faces-questions-on-value.html "> Technology would be beneficial </a> for schools that are well structured and organized because students are already manageable. Let us ensure that technology does not become a barrier between students and teachers because there is no substitute for face-to-face interaction.
 
Teachers are doing the best could to provide quality education to students but cannot go beyond the district curriculum which prevent them from being creative in the way their teach. Parents are also responsible for bad learning outcome of their children because if you want your child to do better in class, you will sit with him/her, do homework and stay in touch with teachers regarding your child performance.
