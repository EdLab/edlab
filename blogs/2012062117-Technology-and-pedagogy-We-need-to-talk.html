            <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2012/06/hybrid.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16585" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2012/06/hybrid.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a><a title="Hybrid Pedagogy" href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/index.html">Hybrid Pedagogy</a>, a digital journal and forum devoted to the discussion of teaching and technology, will host a Twitter discussion group from 1:00 -2:00 EST on Friday, June 22, 2012. On the agenda is a debate about the role of technology, and Learning Management Systems in particular, in pedagogy.

Sean Michael Morris writes:
<blockquote>In the world of educational technology, the relationship between tool and tool-user, functionality and creativity, is complex. Software engineers invent new ways to organize and open learning platforms to diverse functionality, while teachers bemoan the limitations of their virtual learning spaces. The relationships between learners, teachers, college administrators, IT folks, software engineers, and CEOs all come crashing down upon the LMS and the other digital tools that are part of the educational technology repertoire -- Twitter and Facebook are hardly immune. In fact, strained communication between all these players in the game contributes to the confusion about which should drive education: technology or pedagogy?

From the corporate side of educational tech, the importance of the product -- the LMS, for example -- is assumed. But most instructors would say pedagogy comes first. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/devinknighton">Devin Knighton</a></span>, the Director of Public Relations at <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a></span> says that “Thinking and talking about pedagogy, and not just product, is important.” Is it equally important for teachers to talk about product? Should pedagogy and product be on equal ground?

Maybe what really needs hacking is the marriage of teaching and technology. Instead of working with one or the other -- or one and then the other -- we need to find a way to get the unhappy couple talking.</blockquote>
As you can see, Morris is calling the relationship between technology and pedagogy a broken marriage of sorts. I'd like to think that they get along quite well. And I'd like to think that both of them are pretty close friends, if not lovers of, libraries too. But who isn't a library lover?

See what you think. Tune in, tweet, or just check out Morris's full <a title="Hacking the Marriage of Teaching and Technology: a #digped Discussion" href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/Journal/files/Hacking_the_Marriage.html#unique-entry-id-44">post</a>. The discussion is set to continue every Friday at 1:00 EST throughout the summer.
