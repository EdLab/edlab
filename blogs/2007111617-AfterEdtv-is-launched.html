          <p>
            Visit <a href="http://aftered.tv/">aftered.tv</a> to see the new home of our nascent channel. We designed this site to serve as an archive of past episodes, but also as a destination for promotional efforts.

The next phase of our growth will be getting the word out about the website, and this can take many forms. Write about it. Tell your friends and family. Or send an email to a teacher or administrator (I've written up a generic email below).

Our audience is learners and teachers. We are currently working on events and other outreach efforts to broaden our exposure and visibility. Coming up in December, for example, we are working with a New York City school to use After Ed as a resource for thinking about the future of education. At an <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/995">Edit Jam</a> event on 12/14, the production team will help students and teachers produce their own web video which will be highlighted in our lineup.
<!--break-->
What else can you do? You can help us make our website better! Everyone can provide feedback by leaving comments. We invite members of EdLab to create new posts by getting a new account on aftered.tv, and asking us to upgrade you to a "producer user." Everyone can also sign up for our newsletter (Thanks to Dan for all this great Drupal functionality).

Note that there are two main RSS feeds available for After Ed:
- The <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1078591423?action=rss">weekly lineup</a> feed to watch each new episode.
- Our <a href="http://aftered.tv/index.php?q=rss.xml">aftered.tv blog</a> feed to follow the evolving conversation.

In the section below, I've written out a generic description of After Ed that you can copy into an email and send to someone you know. Please give me feedback if you have ideas for how this could be better.

Hi,

I came across a cool resource. Check it out:

After Ed is a web-based video channel about the future of education. Our homepage, aftered.tv, features a full archive of our content, producer blogs, and community tools. New content is published weekly, including news, documentary, and editorial segments. Aftered.tv is where we discuss our content, what's happening behind the scenes, and ideas for future episodes.

Anyone can request to put our syndicated player on their website (it's free!), submit videos, or comment on the blogs. We hope learners and teachers of all ages will find our content insightful and useful. If you're a student, teacher, or parent, have your school to put us on its website, and give the community a reason to visit every week.

Teachers can use After Ed in and out of the classroom to stimulate thinking about education. We publish content for learners and teachers who want to better understand the education sector and the changing nature of education.

What does our name mean? "After Ed" is our way of starting conversations about the future of learning. Today's education system is in the service of our collective educational ideals, but it's also a set of institutions that will need to be overturned as our world continues to change.

We invite you to join us in pursuit of new forms of education that will empower the next generation of learners.
