<a href="http://facultyproject.com/">The Faculty Project</a> was launched earlier this year with a goal of providing free online multimedia lectures to the "millions of lifelong learners across the globe who do not have access to the world's greatest institutions of higher learning, but do have an Internet connection." Launched in partnership with <A href="http://www.udemy.com/courses">Udemy</a>, using the platform to create and host courses, the project has attracted (and recruited!) a wide range of <a href="http://facultyproject.com/professors">instructors</a>, from an associate professor of Managerial Economics at Northwestern to a professor of Russian Literature and Music at Northwestern University.  Each of the courses, which are as diverse as the instructors, can be delivered through online video (YouTube - non interactive), PowerPoint presentations, PDFs and articles on Udemy.com. There is also an online discussion board to support learning and answer student questions. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The platform is free, easy to use, and the courses cover a wide-range of subjects. The videos, while not interactive, flow well and are easy to download and watch later on a separate device. All course material is effectively and efficiently displayed in a user dashboard (see first screenshot, below). The discussion board (see second screenshot, below), though simple, distinguishes between "instructor" and "student" well by using a color to highlight teacher comments. The short intro videos for each course are effective advertisements and can easily be shared across multiple social media platforms.

<b>Cons:</b>
The videos utilize both standard text and handwritten "white board" technology (similar to Khan Academy, but not as advanced as Udacity). While diverse, the courses would be more "discoverable" if they were grouped by subject. Also, the discussion board lacks both tags and ranking, making finding a specific question difficult and cumbersome. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we continue to explore online learning and course management platforms here at the lab, it is interesting to track the development of other products and services in the same space. So far, the trend seems to lean towards short, video-based lectures with a dashboard-like layout. I wonder who will come in and truly disrupt this space? MITx? Coursera?

<b>Our Takeaways:</b>
Video-based lectures paired with an effective discussion board is a recipe for success; however, the degree of success depends on the additional features and organization.
