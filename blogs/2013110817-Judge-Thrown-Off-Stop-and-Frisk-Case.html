            Judge Shira Scheindlin who found the NYPD's Stop and Frisk policy unconstitutional was thrown off her case. According to this <a href="http://breakingbrown.com/2013/11/the-judge-who-ended-stop-and-frisk-just-got-thrown-under-the-bus/">article</a>, Scheindlin explained her reasoning behind the ruling; judges are not allowed to talk about an open case. Since she is no longer in charge of the case, the Second Court issued a stay on her ruling, so Stop and Frisk can officially resume as a NYPD tactic. 

In my opinion, I believe Judge Scheindlin was wrong. No judge should explain his or her thinking behind an open case. As an impartial party in the case, judges should not speak about their thoughts on a case as to favor one side over another. Some of my classmates in my Criminal Justice class agreed that she should have be thrown off the case and that it was right for the Second Court to issue a stay on her ruling. Many disagreed because she did not exactly say what was going to happen or go deeper into the case. 

Was it right for Judge Scheindlin to get thrown off the case? Should her ruling still stand?
