<p>Working at institutions already tight on money and relying on professionals often spread way too thin, teachers often donâ€™t receive the professional development they deserve. Technology has been able to provide some services to alleviate this problem, such as <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/40702"> Earshot</a>, a program that automates audio feedback for teachers. But what about visual feedback?</p>

<p>Kettle Moraine High School has been employing a new method of teacher professional development to fill this specific gap. Their new system involves using a video tracking system alongside coaching to help teachers pinpoint problems in their classroom and find ways to monitor and fix those problems in their practice. Through the use of this new type of visual learning, teachers can better track student engagement and address their own blind spots in a way they can't when at the front of the class.</p>

<p>What effects do you think the use of video might have on both teacher and student performance? What benefits and drawbacks do you see to the implementation of this technology in classrooms? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47874">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:23 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>This method seems like it would be helpful only if teachers sincerely want to use it as a way to improve. There could be the temptation to perform in front of the camera, so if the teacher wants to make an honest self-assessment, he or she would have to make an honest effort to ignore the device. Students might perform at first, but I imagine the novelty of the device would wear off quickly.</p>

<p><b>@01.32 RuthS: </b>I wonder if this method of tracking the classroom would intimidate some teachers and students. Would everyone be able to act normally knowing they're being recorded and watched later? I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable as the teacher in the room!</p>
