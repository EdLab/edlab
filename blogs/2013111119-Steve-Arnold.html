<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I studied education and developmental psychology, among other things, in college and graduate school.  I assumed at the time that I would pursue a career somehow related to one of those disciplines. But in the early 80’s I got some exposure to the first generation of personal computers, and I became convinced that personal computer technology would literally change the way children learn how to think.  I got myself a personal computer, taught myself a little bit about programming, and started exploring applications of technology to learning and entertainment.  Then I got an opportunity to work in the emerging computer game business, and ended up with a career over 30 years in various management roles in the technology and digital media industries.  But I always maintained my interest and passion for innovating in education and human development, so that is what I am focusing on now. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> In the late 80’s and early ‘90s, I was a senior executive running companies and divisions of companies at the intersection of digital media, gaming and interactive storytelling, interactive education, large scale online systems, and interactive user experience.  Then I co-founded a venture capital firm and spent the next fifteen years investing in a range of companies, some of which were in related sectors such as digital media, gaming, internet applications and e-commerce.  All of those experiences combined to further convince me that fast-evolving communications technologies, the global internet, and new kinds of access to information, media, and social relationships made possible by those inventions, would change Western society in fundamental ways.  And with those changes in society comes a necessity to evolve and transform the education system to align with that evolving society.  Now I am working with several education non-profits that are innovating in related fields:  blended learning curriculum with an online component, adaptive online technology to personalize and "crowd-source" learning pathways, online media for teacher development, high quality research and documentary films about "what works" in educational transformation, and applications of gaming technology to learning and assessment, to name a few.  But not everything I am involved with now is related to technology.  I am also on the board of an organization that is innovating in a completely different way, bringing evidence-based social and emotional learning programs to urban school districts.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Great question.  There are lots of important issues swirling around education "reform" that relate to political structures, economics, and the history of the education system.  But in my view what really matters is the actual learning experiences students have, what happens between a student and a teacher or mentor, and how those experiences are framed to support the student’s academic and psycho-social growth.  I believe that the purpose of education is literally to provide the framework to allow each successive generation to "grow up and grow into" being successful human beings and effective citizens in the society they are ultimately expected to participate in and lead.  That means students need to learn about academic disciplines, the arts, and "non-cognitive" domains.  There are significant discoveries in neuroscience—how the brain develops capacities and responses to the world—and learning sciences—literally how people learn—that are not yet incorporated into our education system.  These are the areas I am focusing on in my work.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> Here’s a list of a few:<br>
<b>a)</b>     More integration of appropriate technologies to allow for personalized learning and differentiated instruction.<br> 
<b>b)</b>	Re-structuring the credit system to focus on demonstrated competency moving toward mastery in a domain, instead of "seat time" and hours in the classroom as a measure of learning.<br> 
<b>c)</b> 	More uses of performance assessment and other kinds of authentic assessment, and making assessments in general a tool for the learner instead of a weapon for the funding sources.<br> 
<b>d)</b>	More explicit focus on developing social and emotional skills alongside academics as essential to successful postsecondary and career success.<br> 
<b>e)</b> 	And, a trend I would like to see more frequently--that all of the adults in our society, particularly those who are enjoying significant success, recognize that effectively educating the next generation is an economic and social imperative for the nation, and be willing to participate in some way.<br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am currently working with the Executive Directors of Edutopia and GLEF Research to expand the research work of the George Lucas Educational Foundation.  I also serve on the Management Committee of the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning, which is working to bring evidence-based social and emotional learning programs to urban school districts.  And I co-founded a non-profit organization called <a href="http://educurious.org/">Educurious Partners</a> that has developed two ninth grade courses that incorporate a very innovative model of blended project-based learning in which students do authentic work collaborating with working professionals using an online social network.  Each of these projects incorporates some of the principles I described earlier.  Next up is a deeper focus on the neuroscience of adolescence—I think there are significant developmental opportunities that grow out of what we are now learning about brain development, that I think will allow us to be more "intentional" in how we effectively educate our next generation.
