<p>A recent mixed methods study examined the use of the popular game Minecraft  by third- and fourth-grade girls at home and school. Drawing data from a three-year research project that involved ten schools in Australia, the authors analyzed students’ gameplay through photographic records and student and teacher interviews. Over the course of the project, the authors worked with the participating schools to set curricular and research goals while supporting teachers’ professional development in game-based teaching and reflection.</p>

<p><a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> is an open-ended 3D game that enables players to establish their own in-game worlds, a feature that distinguishes it from many other commercial games. Players co-produce game content with their peer groups online. They modify and respond to the game in unstructured ways while developing new skills to experience the full capacity of the game.</p>

<p>The authors found that digital gaming was already part of many girls’ after school lives. Prior to the study, students played a range of digital games at home across multiple devices, including iPhones, iPads, Nintendo Wii and DS systems, as well as family computers. Compared to their gaming experiences at home, the girls seemed to enjoy the collaborative gaming experiences at school where they could constantly communicate with their friends in the same physical space. In addition, Minecraft provided alternative ways for teachers to design classroom literacy practices and helped cater to students’ strengths that were ignored by regular school evaluations. For example, a girl who earned below average grades exceled in gameplay and was positioned as an expert by her peers, and this leadership role helped her gain confidence in her schoolwork.</p>

<p><a href=" http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511610554&cid=CBO9780511610554A018">James Paul Gee</a> conceptualized affinity spaces as virtual or physical places where participants could share common interests and practices in an informal learning environment. Data analysis revealed that the girls commonly created various types of these affinity spaces within the same classroom Minecraft community. The groups that frequented such spaces were transient and contested while constituting a loosely hierarchical system. For example, one small group was viewed as the authority of the classroom gaming discourse, leading other peer groups in navigating the virtual world.</p>

<p>The study presents a case of how the classroom use of a 3D game like Minecraft might create new opportunities for students’ literacy practices. Games like this can motivate students' writing of fictional and non-fictional texts and help to form writer communities based on children’s popular gaming culture. For example, students can write about the stories around their game avatars as well as describing the facts about their game design. It enlightens classroom practitioners and teacher educators to develop selection criteria for quality games, including but not limited to the creation of non-linear game texts, the availability of a collaborative online environment, and the multiple design choices that students can draw on to add meaning to their game-based learning. </p>
