<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The pivotal point in my education was when I went to UC Berkeley. I was offered a basketball scholarship that I declined, and as a result, I had to get a job to support myself while going to school. It was incredibly fortunate for me to be hired as the Chief Operating Officer of the most amazing non-profit I have ever come across, called Break the Cycle (BTC). BTC was a non-profit that trained and hired UC students to tutor K-3 kids who were already doing poorly on standardized tests. 
<p>
What I learned, which impacted me deeply, was that even though I was the product of California public schools, not everybody got the same quality of education and not all parents were comfortable helping their kids achieve at school. Working with Break the Cycle prompted me to write my senior honors thesis about what we now call, the "achievement gap."  
<p>
Part of the success of BTC was a comprehensive approach to student success:  working with parents, good pedagogy based on proven strategies like having a ratio of 1 tutor for every 4 kids, providing yummy after-school snacks, targeting education for parents so that they could better advocate for and support their children, and committing to research that had a direct impact on educational outcomes. Since my days at Berkeley and with Break the Cycle, I have dedicated my life to a variety of organizations and initiatives focused on educational and professional equity.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Because I've had 25 years of helping people achieve their academic and professional goals, I've had a variety of experiences inform my work. In the mid-1990s, when welfare reform was legislated, I founded San Francisco Work (SFWorks) to help train women who would need to enter the workforce, and needed hard skills and specific education to make them ready for careers. Working as the CEO of SFWorks was a formative job because I had to teach people how to self-assess, figure out what they already knew, and support their discovery of what they needed to acquire in terms of education and training to be job-ready. SFWorks was an employer-driven initiative, whereby we reverse-engineered training and education needs from actual job openings the companies had difficulty filling due to the need for specific training.  In our training and educational programs, we taught soft skills like finance and money management, hard skills related to the job, like business math and English, and also functional skills specific to each job so that participants could change their financial futures over the long-term. I was very proud to develop Individual Development Accounts that could be applied to home ownership and educational opportunities for all of our 1,000's of women placed into jobs. Our organization was a model for other workforce development organizations nationally.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> As the CEO of a learning technology company, <a href="http://www.pathbrite.com/">Pathbrite</a>  I hope that we advance student success as measured by completion rates and job placement of students. I’m confident we will do this by providing the best ePortfolio experience in the market. We believe that by facilitating student reflection about their learning, and allowing students to articulate what they are learning and what it means to them, that we get better, richer insights into student learning than any other technology.
<p>
We have an educational technology that dramatically improves the learning experience for students, the teaching experience for students that provides much improved and holistic information for educators and administrators. We believe that Pathbrite Portfolios not only allow students to speak for themselves and better own their own learning trajectories, but also provides real-time insights into students for educators to intervene and support students earlier. We want to help students visualize what they know so they can better showcase the skills they’ve mastered as they enter the workforce, whether directly from high school or upon graduation from college.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> One of the big trends we will see soon is the desire for people to have control over their own learning content, information about themselves, and a better sense of control over their destinies. You could call it personalized learning or personalized information. This might be the next big trend.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I'm currently working on taking the amazing information that our learners are putting in their portfolios and serving up insights to learners about themselves. I’m also building better analytics for educators and administrators about their students and what they are really learning. We think there are tremendous limitations with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and Student Information Systems (SISs). We need to start with the actual learners, and portfolios are a great mechanism for that.
