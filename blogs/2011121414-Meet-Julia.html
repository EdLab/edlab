<em>Hello! I’m Julia, I work upstairs at the EdLab but am known to sneak downstairs to see what’s going on at the desk. I do some assessment work in the library, and help keep the <a href="http://pressible.org/">Pressible Network</a> moving along.  I've been working at the lab for One Year and  25 weeks according to my blog profile. </em>

<strong>Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</strong><img class="alignright" src="http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/29884_693945410832_16103997_38804220_4375962_n.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="206" /> No, I studied Library and Information Science at Pratt.  Where I met fellow Library staff member <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/rebecca/meet-rebecca">Becca</a>! Here I am waiting to get that masters:

<strong>Where’s your hometown?</strong>
I lived in Brooklyn, NY for my first 9 years, then Chappaqua, NY for the next 9, then Albany, NY and now back in Brooklyn. It’s a whole “full circle living" plan I have to make this question easier to answer.

<strong>Your favorite meal?</strong>
probably 2 tacos on soft corn tortillas (deluxe, squash filling and pinto beans) Or a burrito (same filling). And a coke (either a mexican coke, or a kosher coke . ..  real sugar cokes are AMAZING!)

<strong>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it:</strong>
This is a long list but I have to say <a href="http://youtu.be/6Z66wVo7uNw">“Move On Up” by Curtis Mayfield</a> is absolutely the best. . . . how can you deny those trumpets.

<strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.sunrisesigns.com/Portals/84214/images/twine%20ball.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="241" />A country you’d like to visit?</strong>
All.

but seriously, the next on my list is weirdly Northern Canada. I’ve never been to Nova Scotia and would really like to go. Also, I feel like i haven’t seen much of this country, not the grand canyon nor mt. rushmore, nor the world’s biggest ball of twine. These are things I’d like to see.

<strong>What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong>
A Lawyer and a writer. There was also an environmentalist/park ranger idea for a while, which overlapped with my reading <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/aKingsolver%2C+Barbara/akingsolver+barbara/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=akingsolver+barbara&amp;1%2C1%2C">Barbara Kingsolver</a>’s Prodigal Summer.

<strong>What was your first job?</strong>
I was a babysitter from about 11 on through graduation. My first job within the law was at a local chain of Health Food stores called Mrs. Greens.

<strong>What has been your worst job?</strong>
I’ve been pretty lucky with my jobs. The worst job interview I ever went on, the interviewer threw a pen at me, and when I caught it she said “you’re quick, I like that.” walked away and then returned with paperwork for me to fill out.

<strong>What has been your best job?</strong>
Like i said, I’ve been pretty lucky with my jobs. That said, I love being a librarian, I'm not exaggerating and according to my friends, I talk about how great it is more than they'd like.

<strong>What do you remember about your first day of school?</strong>
The door was labeled “puerta”. My Kindergarten teacher was bilingual and had a bilingual classroom which was pretty cool.

<strong>A book you strongly recommend?</strong><img class="alignright" src="http://pf.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/robert-mapplethorpe-patti-smith-a1-582x550.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="330" /> I just read <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=Just+Kids&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">Just Kids by Patti Smith</a> and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Please-Kill-Me-Uncensored-History/dp/0140266909"> </a><a href="http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=2884&amp;recCount=50&amp;recPointer=0&amp;bibId=2092599">Please Kill Me by Legs MacNeil and Gillian McCain</a> and then watched <a href="http://youtu.be/iB4x-uyb8rE">a documentary about Sam Wagstaff and Robert Maplethorpe</a>, which was a pretty cool way to read about that time period in nyc.

<strong>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)?</strong> I really like playing Soccer. I like watching pretty much any sport that lets me yell and cheer. I REALLY like yelling, and am a loud person in general so I enjoy environments where that’s embraced. . . . it’s pretty weird I became a librarian now that I think about it.

<strong>TOP THREE….</strong>

…Best places to read?  The Subway, Laying in the grass (somewhere safe to do that like the park or something), a sofa chair by a window.

… Favorite authors or books?
This is a dangerous question to ask a librarian. <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=Hunger+Games&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">The Hunger Games trilogy</a> is a completely awesome contribution to literature. I think a lot of YA fiction is really creatively exploring humanity as well as telling great stories.

Complete the sentence.

The strangest thing I’ve ever done was try to convince my third grade class that I was my own long lost twin Bridget. I wore a hat, and was pretty pissed they wouldn’t believe me.

Most fascinating person I’ve ever met was these friends of my grandfather. They are a couple and the husband had gone to college with my grandfather for a year, then they both shipped out to the war, and then ran into each other again when they got back and started school again. Then, many years later, they ended up working in different departments of the same bank, and now, they are retired to the same town in Florida. This couple ended up getting stationed at the bank in Argentina and have a lot of really amazing stories of South American adventures and hiking.

The weirdest thing I’ve ever done for money I was a junior camp sports skills counselor at a sports summer camp and had to teach 2-5 year olds “sport skills” which amounted to “lets all run in the same direction”.
