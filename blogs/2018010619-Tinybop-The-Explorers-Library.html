<p><i>"Kids play and learn by diving into big ideas, seeing how things work, and making connections about the world they live in."</i> (<a href="https://tinybop.com/about">About Tinybop</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Toys for Tomorrow</b></p>

<p><a href="https://tinybop.com">Tinybop</a> designs educational apps that activate imagination and allow children to play and learn through exploring how things work. Created by a team of artists, designers, researchers, and engineers, Tinybop’s apps are intelligently animated, kid-friendly, and evidence based. </p>

<p><b>The Explorer’s Library</b></p>
 
<p>This consortium of nine different apps helps kids ages four and up develop foundational science literacy. Each is named for the topic it explores: The Human Body, Plants, Homes, Simple Machines, The Earth, Weather, Sky Scrapers, Space, and Mammals. All apps in Explorer’s Library are, as the name indicates, exploratory in nature, with no rules or levels. The surprises hidden within each app are the rewards for curiosity, and children acquire knowledge through self-guided movement and actions.</p>   

<p>To support learning, an extensive handbook specific to each app is available for parents and teachers in eight different languages. Each features insider information, fun facts, interaction hints, and discussion questions. These handbooks are full of STEM education support.</p>
 
<p><b>Big Ideas Explored Simply</b></p>

<p>Explorer’s Library ambitiously tackles teaching engineering, life sciences, physics, and architecture for children as young as four years old. While these subjects might seem advanced for preschoolers, Tinybop has reduced the main components into their most simplistic form, allowing interaction to guide them toward realization based on cause and effect. For example, to understand how touch stimulates nerves and triggers brain recognition of the object being touched, children using Mammals can blow a feather toward a tiger’s whiskers and watch from inside of the animal’s body as sparks travel from the tip of the whiskers up to the brain, ending in a thought bubble showing the image of a feather.</p>

<p>The apps let children experiment with natural processes, like weather patterns and the circulatory system, travel across time and space, and explore the forces shaping the planet, our bodies, and the living things around us. Beyond the natural world, Explorer’s Library teaches children how people live and work in different spaces, how things are built and destroyed, as well as different languages, cultures, and ways of life that exist across the globe.</p>

<p>Whether these tools are used at home or in school, their imaginative design is sure to support positive STEM development in young children. For further information, Tinybop also has a <a href="https://tinybop.com/blog">blog</a> and newsletter, which feature app and company updates, collaborating artists, and articles detailing what their apps can achieve.</p>
