            Too much of our discussions of teacher quality seems to revolve around hiring and firing.  But why not work with the material you've already got? The LA Times <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/07/local/la-me-teaching-20120107">reported this week</a> on a <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/college-ready-education/Documents/preliminary-finding-policy-brief.pdf">new study</a>  by the Gates Foundation, which argues “the old-fashioned practice of rating instructors by watching them teach is tricky, labor-intensive, potentially costly and subjective – but perhaps the best way to help them improve.”
<!--break-->
The Gates Foundation, as part of their MET (Measures of Effective Instruction) project, has been studying a new system of teacher instruction, wherein the teacher is observed several times annually by more than one person, and are continually updated with feedback on their methods of instruction. The foundation collected thousands of digital videos of teachers in their classrooms to allow for large-scale observation and evaluation.

Along with improving teacher quality with targeted feedback, the Gates Foundation argues that more intensive observation can be combined with the more traditional measures of teacher quality to give us a better picture of how good teachers are, bringing us back to the “hiring and firing” issue that has already been much discussed.

This is certainly one area where new technologies of video capture and presentation can offer big boosts in efficiency, and if their findings are to be believed, that might even be a worthwhile thing to do.
