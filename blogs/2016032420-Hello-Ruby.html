<p>"<i><a href="http://www.helloruby.com/about">Hello Ruby</a> is the world’s most whimsical way to learn about technology, computing, and coding. We are all about curiosity, playfulness and logic. We provide tools for kids, parents and educators to learn to understand programming in a fun and creative way." </i> (<a href="http://www.helloruby.com/about">About Hello Ruby</a>)
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>One of the first things you might notice about Hello Ruby is the array of vibrant colors or the playful, hand-drawn illustrations that decorate its website. What started off as a children’s activity and picture book (Hello Ruby: Adventures in Coding) is now a full-fledged initiative to get children excited to learn about computers. The book features cute, animated human and animal characters and follows the main character Ruby as she uses her imagination to discover the world of computers. It is both refreshing and affirming to see that the main character of a children’s book about computers is a girl—an important portrayal when considering the gender imbalances in the field of computer science. In addition to English, the book is offered in Finnish and Swedish, with seven other translations on the horizon.</p>

<p>The companion website offers a variety of print and play products, such as DIY instructions for building your own computer and universal remote control. These printables follow the website’s engaging and kid-friendly design, and are great activities for kids at home or in school. For teachers looking for something even more structured, Hello Ruby also offers a handful of lesson plans that are written and organized for quick classroom integration. At home, with friends, or at school, it looks like Hello Ruby succeeds in helping children learn computing on their own terms. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>For five-year-olds, getting into the nitty gritty details about how a computer works in an age-appropriate way is certainly not easy. Unfortunately, Hello Ruby does not have explicit coding activities available on its website However it does offer games like Easter Eggs, which prompts kids to use instructions given by a computer and to write out their own instructions for decorating the eggs. Considering the target audience, this might be the most direct coding experience possible without throwing in things like Java or Python.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>In today’s wave of initiatives aimed at bringing coding into classrooms, Hello Ruby is a unique and thoughtful one that tackles the challenging task of making programming accessible to kids as young as five. Using familiar activities likes dress-up games, but with a coding twist, Hello Ruby makes kindergarten coding seem possible and easy.</p>
