<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sophia-ali/4/700/303">Sophia Ali</a> is the Founder and CEO of social enterprise, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Childrens-Television/186982364668647?sk=info">International Children’s Television (ICTV)</a>.  After working for over twenty years in the film and television industries in the United States, Europe and Asia, Ali has harnessed this media expertise and created a new vehicle to promote progressive education in South Asia.  <a href="http://www.themagictent.com/home.html"><i>The Magic Tent</i></a>, produced by ICTV, is a vibrant, educational initiative designed to teach critical thinking and creative problem solving through television, mobile and tablet apps and in-school activities to the 570+ million underserved children in the South Asian and Pan Arab Market.  The creator of Miss Piggy and <a href="http://www.themagictent.com/team.html">other children’s television legends</a> are a part of the team.  Previously Ali produced Kahani Corner, an educational TV series for Pakistani children.  She holds a Masters Degree in Child Development from Teachers College, Columbia University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I spent the earliest part of my education in Pakistan in a rote-learning educational system where the primary focus was on memorization.  I quickly learned the limitations of this system and how detrimental it can be to discourage curiosity and creativity among children. As an adult with experience in entertainment production, my vision is to create exciting television programs for kids in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India that promote exploration and independent thinking.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Midcareer I left Los Angeles and went to Pakistan to produce a small children’s television program. It was a show that featured celebrities reading stories to children. I had every intention of returning to LA to continue my film career once we were done. However, during that experience I soon discovered that there were no quality books available for kids.  In fact there was very little available to entertain them at all. There were no movies, not much music, and almost no local television…and surprisingly this was true in India as well. It was this realization that made me decide that rather than returning to LA, I’d go to graduate school, get qualified and produce entertainment designed to meet the very serious educational needs of South Asian children.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> Our goal is to impact the learning landscape in South Asia. I would like to change the way people view <i>question asking.</i> Culturally a person asking questions is still seen as being ‘rude’ or ‘stupid’ rather than ‘smart’ and ‘informed.’  I believe changing this view and encouraging curiosity and creativity is the first step in fostering a generation of independent thinkers.
Global population trends indicate that today's South Asian child population is positioned to become the future global workforce. This makes the introduction of these essential life skills urgent not just for children themselves, but for society. An educated South Asian child is crucial to mitigating the political and economic concerns implied by these trends.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> Not to sound too cliché, but I think technology in the classroom will impact learning tremendously, even in Pakistan and India.  I think India will leapfrog over the past 30 years right to today.  Therefore educational programing like ours must have mobile/tablet and gaming components. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My company, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Childrens-Television/186982364668647">International Children’s Television</a>  has created a television series called <a href="http://www.themagictent.com/home.html"><i>The Magic Tent</i></a> designed to teach critical thinking, creative problem solving and conflict resolution to kids across South Asia. I have partnered with some of children’s television’s best talent to help get the job done. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_K._Frith">Michael Frith</a>, Jim Henson’s creative director and the designer of Miss Piggy, has created a cast of wonderful local characters. Together with a group of educators from both South Asia and the US, we have created an original curriculum designed to address the region’s most pressing issues.  We have produced a pilot episode and are pleased to report it has tested very well with kids in both Pakistan and India.
