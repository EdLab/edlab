            Facebook has been the largest and most actively used social network for years. Several competitors such as MySpace has all come and gone while Facebook has remained popular and can now boast over a billion users. In <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324731304578193781852024980.html?mod=rss_Technology">article</a>, Amir Efarati argues that Google's Google+ has created a challenge for Facebook by using many tactics to push people toward using it instead of Facebook. Since Facebook has dominated the social network business, the best thing for Google to do is essentially to play catch up to Facebook. In order to stop Facebook's seemingly endless domination, Google must push strong to capture more users by using different tactics to pull people towards Google+.

The first step in drawing people towards Google+ is to create public pages for people who have Google accounts through Gmail, YouTube and other Google services. Since both parties gain much of their revenue through ads, Google plan to get more revenue by integrating Google+ across many of its services, which will allow for targeting more users and thus resulting in more profit. To many, Google has been trying very hard to compete with Facebook because they are forcing their services on users with a Google account, namely a Google+ page. On the contrary, others believe that in order to move up in the social networking business such steps must be taken. In recent months, Google's integration ideas has come into effect and more and more users are using Google+. This proves that Google is willing to battle with Facebook to be the gateway to social networking.
