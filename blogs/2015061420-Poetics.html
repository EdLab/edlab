<p>NYC artist Seth Indigo Carnes created <a href="http://www.poetics.me/">Poetics</a> as an extension of his physical exhibit, which began in 2007 and was shown across the United States as well as in Sweden. The piece consisted of a metal wall with magnetic words for participants to arrange. He has transferred the concept to this app, which builds on his original project by permitting the user to write their own text and to capture or upload photos as the backdrop for their visual poetry. The "poetic," as the resulting product is called, is a completely customized blend of text and images.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> Poetics introduces a fresh way to create multimodal poetry. It offers a wide range of possible photo edits, which encourages artistic experimentation and creative license. The instructions are clear and simple to locate within the app, and sharing a poetic is easy through social media platforms. The coolest feature is the ability to have the poetic printed and shipped anywhere on the globe as a personalized postcard through <a href="https://sincerely.com/"> Sincerely.</a></p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> Although there are countless options for tweaking the photos, Poetics offers very few ways to alter the format of text. It is true the text can be moved and sized in all sorts of ways, but the capacity to at least change fonts and text color would be an improvement. With this minor addition, the already extensive creative possibilities would skyrocket.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Poetics works to expand the definition of poetry by offering a unique way to construct art that is simultaneously visual and textual. Using the touch screen to play with the placement of words increases the creatorâ€™s connection to their art, providing an effect similar to that of finger painting. It is a virtual tool that is remarkably able to facilitate a hands-on artistic experience. Poetics can easily be envisioned in classrooms, pushing students to experiment with crafting multimodal works.</p>
