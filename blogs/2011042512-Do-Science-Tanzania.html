            Like most good physics teachers, Diana Hall has a deep respect for the importance of the experimental method in science education. What sets Hall apart, however, is that her commitment to bringing engaging lab work to eager students has taken her atop mountains, over seas, and into a community that would otherwise lack the resources to set up even the most basic labs for its students.

In February 2011, Hall started "Do Science Tanzania," a project to share teaching strategies and equipment with science teachers in Moshi, Tanzania. According to the project <a href="http://dosciencetanzania.wordpress.com/the-do-science-project-outline/">blog</a>, Hall's intention is "to facilitate a more active science program and to inspire students to continue studying  beyond the secondary level." For Hall, the best kind of learning comes from critical observation. Her classroom in Canada is filled with various mechanical trinkets and visually engaging devices. In this way, she says, "it was â€˜designed' to stimulate students to ask, wonder and think about the world around them."

It was her belief in the scientific process that drove her to Moshi, a town of 100,000 situated in the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. Though Moshi has some of the best schools in all of Tanzania, teachers lack the materials necessary to conduct proper labs, especially in primary and secondary school settings. Hall's mission is to change that, bringing exciting labs to eager young minds and putting the 'Do' in 'Do Science Tanzania'

Hall will be in Tanzania until at least August. Here's hoping her endeavors are as successful as she could possibly hope.
