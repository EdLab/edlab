          <p>
            Please watch this video if you haven't already... I guarantee at least a smile.

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/40000072?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

So, did you smile? What gumption! He's just a boy! But he made my day AND got me thinking about entrepreneurism:

<b>1) Use what you know to prototype sooner than later </b>
Why wait until a college engineering degree, or even high school shop class to attempt building an arcade? No more excuses! Use dad's old auto parts, yarn, and cardboard boxes (says the nine year old)! Whatever tools and metaphors are on you today, use them NOW to get the idea across. Work on learning new tools as you go (Caine upgraded in time... taking feedback and ultimately creating better prototypes). Can we ever be as unbarred about protoyping as this boy?

<b>2) Our consumers can be our best PR</b>
Caine had one loyal customer who spread the word to people he knew would be interested. Social media really helps catalyze this movement. Today, all we need to do is expose our products to those critical people who give us that "in" into new or relevant (social) markets. For Caine, the market was a group of people who really value finding hidden gems in LA ("Hidden LA" facebook group). Who do you know? Who can you introduce EdLab products to (that you haven't already reached out to)?

<b>3) Documentary style videos seriously work... and that special lens effect (?) helps </b> 
It's no blockbuster film, but gosh who else feels like they know the boy after 10 mins? By watching the video alone, I feel like I've participated in his success. So in a way, I'm already an investor! (...investing while stocks cost me just a mere 10 mins... a small cost for a greater promise) And if Caine were to generate new ideas, I'm already more inclined to listen. Dare I say it? I think this is also part of the Justin Bieber phenomenon. 
EdLab might be able to reach audiences outside of TC/NYC, and subsequently gain rapport/loyalty through this method... What is EdLab's image outside of TC? Is there even a presence and expectation of EdLab by outsiders? If I remember correctly, we have a filmmaker in our midst! Something to think about how to brand EdLab beyond TC.

Anyways, first blog post from me!
