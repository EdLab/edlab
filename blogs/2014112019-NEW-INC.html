<p><i>"Fusing artistic provocation with an entrepreneurial spirit to enable ideas that make culture better."</i> (via <a href="http://newinc.org/">NEW INC</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="http://newinc.org/">NEW INC</a>, located in the New York City’s historical Bowery area, is the first museum-led incubator that brings together people from a range of different practices to design sustainable solutions. Though it is an incubator, NEW INC is unique because it has the resources, facilities, staff, and space of a museum. NEW INC's shared workspace offers professional development opportunities at the intersection of art, technology, and design. The program includes events like demo nights, hackathons, and symposiums. The lab boasts a diverse array of full-time and part-time members including Binta Ayofemi an artist <a href="http://newinc.org/#community">whose project</a> at NEW INC, <i>Pollen</i>, "a cold-press green-juice truck and a plant materials lab," investigates the feasibility of plant-based building and living materials.</p>

<p><b>Creative Ideas are Born at Intersections</b><br>
It’s often acknowledged that there is a strong affinity between libraries and centers of design, schools and museums. Though distinct, the parallels are useful for imagining how spaces might look in the future and visualizing the interplay between these spaces—could a school, museum, library, and lab all be the same? Much like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1941">AmIaDesigner</a>, which reimagines how designers are taught and how teachers work to create design solutions, NEW INC explores what happens when a museum provides all its resources to designers—the lab offers a kind of "<a href="http://newinc.org/#faq">artist in residence</a>" model that creates a space for innovative people who do not fit into a single category. NEW INC is founded on the belief that museums will have to look different in the future and that part of imagining the future of museums involves bringing together people from diverse backgrounds to ensure a range of ideas.</p>

<p><b>Background</b><br>
The co-working space was co-founded by Lisa Phillips and Karen Wong, both Directors at the New Museum. Additionally, the New Museum Board is one of the major supporters of the space and initiative. The lab is part of the New Museum's expression of <a href="http://www.newmuseum.org/about">their mission</a>: "new art, new ideas."</p>
