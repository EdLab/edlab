          <p>
            My experience at college summit was amazing. I fulfilled and completed all my intended goals at the summit: writing my personal statement, becoming a peer leader, and understanding the financial aid process for college. I had an alumni leader who assisted me in writing my personal statement and was very helpful and influential in other aspects of my time there. I also had a chance to meet a college adviser who recommended colleges based upon my interests, social and academic interests. 

During the trip, I was fortunate to meet a lot of new people whom I was able to get to know very well over the four days, especially my two roommates because we all connected as one due to our similar interests and hobbies. I had the opportunity to hear the stories of other peer leaders during confidential sessions also known as "Rap sessions". The rap sessions gave the peer leaders an opportunity to open up and share their life experiences with everyone. During the rap session I had the chance to discuss the obstacles that I had overcome in life thus far and what I want to do with the rest of my life. Overall, the experience changed my insights about college and shown me different aspects of college life.
