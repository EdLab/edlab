<p>Healthcare professionals have to constantly stay up-to-date on new medical literature to treat their patients in the best way possible, but there are often time constraints or difficulties with retaining the huge amount of medical research being published. Medical journals and educators are increasingly turning to new methods to convey this information, including social media platforms, podcasts, and infographics. A recent study examined infographics in particular to see how well physicians learned content in this format as opposed to text, and also how well they enjoyed the medium.</p>
 
<p>The study assessed the responses of 61 physicians practicing in a Canadian emergency department. Each person received four infographics and four text-only research abstracts and were allowed to examine each for a maximum of three minutes. After, each physician filled out a survey asking which medium they preferred, as well as an assessment measuring how great their cognitive loads were during the different tasks. Four weeks later, the participants were given tests to assess how much information they had retained from both the infographics and the text summaries.</p>
 
<p>Overall, participants recorded that they preferred the infographics rather than the text abstracts. In addition, their cognitive loads were lower while reading the infographics. Having a lower cognitive load, such as when looking at a picture or brief statement rather than a full-length article, could lead to better information retention. In this case, however, participants remembered content from the infographics and the text abstracts at the same rates; there was no real difference between the two after a four-week period.</p>
 
<p>These findings show that infographics could be solid replacements for written articles in keeping doctors up to date on new medical literature. Physicians preferred them, and there’s no real difference in information retention. The only hesitation in using infographics could be how time-consuming they are to create. The infographics in this study were designed by professionals, so it could take a lot of resources for this project to succeed in a medical education context. If some medical journals or educators take up the practice, however, it will support many physicians as the make their way through the medical literature in order to treat their patients with the most up-to-date information possible.</p>
