Desire2Learn aims to provide a turnkey online learning experience through their LMS platform. The site fills many of the emerging needs of online learning for institutions with a platform that is comprised of six parts deemed essential elements for an engaging and personal online learning experience. These six parts are: capturing content, creating a learning environment, developing a learning repository, setting up an ePortfolio system, deep analytics, and mobile integration. 
It is these six elements that set Desire2Learn apart from other learning management solutions such as Blackboard or Moodle.

The learning environment is the main part of the platform and allows users to design fully customizable online courses that are supported by the other parts of the platform. Learning artifacts such as documents, audio and video files, presentations and more can be stored and shared with advisors, employers, and peers through the ePortfolio system. Desire2Learn believes that when learners share what they have accomplished it encourages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_learning_theory">social learning</a> to help support learners in their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning"> lifelong learning</a>. Educators can store and organize learning material such as instructional videos, research papers, online learning games, etc. in the platform’s learning repository. The analytical tool keeps statistics on a user’s actions and learning progress through the platform, which can provide educators with a deeper insight on how a student learns and make data driven decisions on how to improve and personalize a student’s learning. 
</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The "capture" feature is especially remarkable as it allows instructors to record their lectures using a webcam so that students are then able to view the lecture either live or whenever they wish via a mobile device. The video itself is what Desire2Learn is calling a "CaptureCast," and it has a few very interesting features. One of these features allows the instructor creating the "CaptureCast" to create a sort of "table of contents" for the video lesson by inputting the topics that were discussed at specific moments of the video. When viewing the "CaptureCast" students are able to select the timestamp from the table of contents and jump directly to that section of the video.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Desire2Learn is a platform that is purchased by institutions to be used for their students. Outside of institutions using the system, there is no option for individuals to access the Desire2Learn platform.

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>The unique Capture Cast annotation feature helps support some of the growing teaching movements like the "flipped classroom" model, and blended learning when video lectures are used both to enhance in-class instruction and to free-up classroom time to focus on higher cognitive tasks and active learning. Deep analytics can support personalized learning to help learners reach their fullest potential. Desire2Learn moves beyond the physical restrictions of traditional schools to create a more ubiquitous online learning environment. 
</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Desire2Learn is a learning management system with 6 ways to enhance your learning.</p>
