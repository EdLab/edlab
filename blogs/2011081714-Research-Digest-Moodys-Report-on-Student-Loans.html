Moody's, the credit rating company, has <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/08/02/qt#266732">recently released</a> a report on the student loan industry, which may provide some context for the arguments I've been making against our current higher education system.

Summary:

The report looks at the behavior of the student lending industry before and during the Great recession.  In a few ways, the education sector looks very different from other consumer lending areas.  For starters, growth in tuition costs has been much higher (more than doubling since 2000) than anything comparable, including health-care and housing.  Also, demand for education is fairly counter-cyclical (we all can sympathize with the desire to ride out recessions at a university), as well as artificially supported by subsidized government loans.  

These and other factors have led to the strange result that while “the year-over-year growth rate [in student lending] has slowed in the last two years, it remains high at above 10%, bucking the trend of balance declines that has occurred across all other consumer lending segments.”   Conversely, “unlike other loan segments, recent student loan originations are performing worse than those originated during the lending boom… The worsening performance of student loans reflects the fact that student loan origination standards were not tightened as they were for other types of student loans.”

Moody's predicts that, due to projected growth in “the pool of potential borrowers,” student lending will continue to grow at a fast rate, and delinquency and failure rates will continue to rise.

This may lead, they argue, to an eventual decline in educational demand, for which we should begin planning.  

Edlab Relevance:

Growing demand has created the niche now occupied by for-profit online universities.  But as can be seen with the crackdown already begun by the Obama administration, cheap, high dropout rate, low-educating schools are not viable or moral responses to this demand.   On the other hand, efficiency maximizing tools may experience a boom in demand, and anybody well placed to fill that demand could be looking at some salad days in the years ahead.
