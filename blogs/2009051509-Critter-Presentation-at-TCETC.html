            Zhou and I presented Critter during Sunday's session of TCETC. We thought the tool was well received and got many questions. In terms of our presentation, we focused primarily on how we initially conceived of Critter as a potentially valuable learning tool. We talked about grounding our methodology in design based research - using existing theory about video-based instruction and online communication to drive the functionality of Critter. We also hope to continue this process by conducting research on the efficacy of Critter in different learning environments and then iterating its design and implementation accordingly. In terms of the current design, we referenced research on scaffolded learning, reflective learning, social and personal reinforcement for instructions and the potential drawbacks of video lectures that others have identified (most notably the passive nature of watching such lectures).

We closed off our discussion by thinking about where Critter could be used to transform present educational practices. We identified three key areas: distance education, traditional lecture-based models of instruction, and professional learning communities. For each of these areas, we felt that Critter could be used as part of a transformative new pedagogical approach. For traditional lecture-based instruction, for example, we said that you could imagine using Critter to more effectively (and interactively) deliver lectures through the web. Such a step would then free up significant class time for other tasks such as projects, practice problems, and delving deeper in to a topic.

In the end, I felt this was a really good experience and a chance to share some of the great work that we're doing in the Edlab. Hopefully, this conference is a good first step to other related conferences in the future - I'm certainly hoping we could develop some of the Critter research more and present it as a paper or in some other way to other audiences. After the presentation, the most common feedback was 'when will it be ready?' (answer: prototype will be out by June, expect Beta version later in summer). We also got feedback from one person that it would be nice to attach documents and other materials to your video discussions so that people have additional resources to reference as they are watching videos. This would be especially useful for teachers who want to provide students with readings or other materials as they watch a lecture or edcational video.

I've attached our abstract for TCETC if anyone is interested in reading that.
