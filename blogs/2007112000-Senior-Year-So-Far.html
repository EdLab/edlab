            When I stepped on campus in the fall, it seemed as if senior year was going to be long and difficult. I was warned by everyone, especially my parents, not to wane off my efforts and finish what I started three years ago when I first stepped foot on the campus of St. Peter's College (SPC) in Jersey City. The first week on campus was business as usual: classes, staying up until the wee hours of the morning with friends and attending every party possible. It wasn't until the second week that I realized that my senior year was going to be fun and difficult. First, I received a letter informing from my dear teacher Dr. Richard Thurston that I had to start doing more concrete research on my undergraduate thesis about the causes of modern-day Islamic terrorism. Second, my parents continued their questioning about my post-graduate plans but time and again I couldn't yield an answer. I entered college with the sole aim of attending law school immediately following graduation. For my first three years, everything went according to plan. I took the courses that prepared me for law school, specifically two semesters of constitutional law. However, towards of the end of last summer, I started to question whether I wanted to attend law school. It seemed as if my interest lied with international policy making and not with domestic law. To make things easier on myself, I decided to take a year off following graduation to try something different, maybe business, which will give me a clear indication of where my post-graduate education lies. In addition, I'm taking five classes (Early American Political Theory, Contemporary City, Global Inequality, Genocide and International Financial Strategy) 
in conjunction with my thesis, which counts as a class but is officially listed as a tutorial. Of the five courses, genocide has been by far the most interesting. The class has brought my attention to countless cases of genocides that most people, myself included, didn't know about such as the genocide that engulfed Bangladesh during its bitter split from Pakistan in 1971. <p>

The one event that I have looked forward to every year since I started college is Model UN. An annual conference held during spring break, SPC students serve as moderators while high school students from all across New Jersey debate the many problems that ail our world today. This year, I was fortunate to be assigned perhaps the most important UN committee, the Security Council. The rules and procedures for the Security Council differ from other UN committees and I am anxiously waiting my chance to head that committee when Model UN commences in late March of next year. I also continue to serve as a Teacher's Assistant at Stevens Cooperative School in Downtown Jersey City. Judging from their optimism and willingness to learn about everything going on around them, I am very optimistic about the future of our nation if these students grow up to become as politically active and willing to learn about the world around them as they are now. <p>

Despite all the work, senior year has also been very fun. The activities leading to the inauguration of Eugene Cornichia as the first layperson in almost 130 years to serve as president of St. Peter's College were entertaining and brought out the entire college community-a rarity at St. Peter's. I have traveled to college campuses such as Monmouth, Manhattan and Fairfield to support my friends on the school's soccer team. An outgoing and enthusiastic freshman class have livened the campus once again. The turn of the new year in less than seven weeks will mean that I am on the stretch run of my college career but it is a run I'm eagerly anticipating. <p>
