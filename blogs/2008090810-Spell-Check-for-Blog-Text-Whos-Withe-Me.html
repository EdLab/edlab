          <p>
            Over the weekend, I had the horribly embarrassing experience of posting my very first EdLab blog, only to discover that I'd included a typo.  I had a few free minutes on Saturday, and thought it would be a good time to contribute to the general discussion.  The problem was, shortly after I started writing, my parents arrived at my apartment (just before the post-hurricane downpours), and my train of thought was interrupted by the insistent buzzing of the doorbell.  It wasn't like they showed up without an invitation — we'd set a date for lunch — but still, I really wanted to finish my post before we headed out.  I let them up and skimmed my entry while answering a string of concerned-parent questions with nods and one word answers: “How was the first week of school?  Is that a new plant?  Do you have enough to food in the fridge?”  And assorted others like that.

Anyway, I was being rude, so I pressed “submit,” chose a diner, had a lovely meal, and that was that.  

Later that evening, I decided to log-in to check if everything went through.  That was when it saw it.  A life-long student of the English language and a professional who made a living correcting other people's writing (among other things), I nonetheless managed to misspell the simple word “with” (I instead wrote “withe”).  Eager to be a part of the exciting experiments in the superhero lair atop the library, I felt more like an overly enthusiastic underclassman offering homemade Chex Mix at a varsity keg party.  Oops.  

So, rather than purport my use of “withe” was a deliberate etymological throw-back to Middle English, or a lesser-known but entirely acceptable British usage (neither of which are true), I am suggesting now that we somehow add a spell check feature to the EdLab's blog space.  On a selfish level, it would save me from future embarrassment due to careless errors, but in a general sense, it would facilitate a more polished and user-friendly version of on-line publishing.  A medium that takes a lot of heat for of its ubiquity and universal appeal, blogging nonetheless represents an alternative and democratic forum for the exchange of ideas.  Why not add an additional safeguard like spell check?  I know I'd use it.

In the meantime, I'll stick to the “cut-and-paste” method so I can edit my text in a Word document first.  I apologize again for the typo, and while I still can, I'll sign off with the oh-so-professional closing, “TTFN.”
