          <p>
            While visiting the New York City Department of Education website for insights on general questions I have about high school, I stumbled upon an <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/mediarelations/NewsandSpeeches/2010-2011/2010satap091410.htm">article</a> that discussed the 2010 SAT and AP scores of current high school seniors in New York City's public school system. NYC Department of Education chancellor Joel Klein released the results and was full of appraisal for the positive results. The results indicated in the report were made in such a light that the headlines of each page were phrased to be positive.
 
The results showed gains in SAT subject scores among every racial group, a tremendous increase in the number of students taking AP classes as well as an increase in number of students who passed the AP exam. One of my primary concerns with the results is that Chancellor Klein, in his endless praise of the positive results, failed to acknowledge the negative aspects of the report and areas where improvement is still needed.
 
Although NYC public school students increased their SAT scores, they're still 60-70 points behind the state and nation's mean score. I also noted there was a hidden racial gap in the report that can easily go unnoticed if one doesn't further investigate. Although there is an increase in the number of students participating and passing AP exams, most are usually Asian or White. Less than half of the few black and Hispanics students who took AP courses passed the accompanying exam.

The report mostly compared results from last year but on the last page, I observed that the average SAT scores from the past five years for blacks was declining at a much faster rate than their counterparts from other racial group. Much of the decline can to be blamed on a lack of free/affordable SAT prep classes available for inner city students, which are mostly comprised of blacks and Hispanics.
 
The available free SAT prep sessions are often very selective and are often inefficient at preparing students for the test. Most SAT prep sessions are given by major private companies such as Kaplan and Princeton Review and the prices range from $400 to $2,000, an often difficult amount for low-income students and their families. I am personally turning to these classes (one is offered at my high school by Princeton Review at $399) as my only option aside from personally studying due to lack of free inefficient classes. Toward the end of the article, the DOE did reference to their efforts in providing more free SAT prep session for students in the coming years, recently offering to cover the cost of PSAT for students who choose to take it. Actions like these along with continuing efforts to improve the NYC public school system, the largest in the country, can led to the city being in contention for the best school districts in the nation.
