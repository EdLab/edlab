            New York State <a href="http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/education/144276/january-regents-exams-saved-by-private-fundraising">reinstated the January edition of the mandatory high school Regents</a> statewide exam after outcry from parents and teachers. The Regents, a series of subject exams, is mandatory for all high school students in New York State as part of their graduation requirements. They are usually given in June following the end of classes but is also administered in August for summer school students and January for those students wanting to avoid a flurry of Regents in June or retaking a failed one.

The city initially axed the January Regents as a result of the state needing to save money this coming spring. In steps Mayor Bloomberg, who was in favor of keeping the January Regents. The mayor reached out to five individual private donors who pledged $250,000 each to keep the January Regents for 2012. According to the mayor, the five donors, who asked to remain private, are all residents of the city but the donation is for the entire state since the state required as such. Mayor Bloomberg however warned that the state must find a permanent solution to the problem since donors cannot be expected to dole out money for the 2013 January Regents.
