<p><i>"Students learn the fundamentals of entrepreneurship; develop basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and form teams to develop a mobile app and business plan aimed at improving education or the quality of city life for NYC students."</i> (from <a href="http://nycgenerationtech.com/">GenTech</a> site)</p>

<p><b>Tech-Based Innovations</b><br>
<a href="http://nycgenerationtech.com/">GenTech</a> is a free summer program developed by Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship and New York City Economic Development Corporation that promotes hands-on learning for NYC students. The program is designed to help students develop real-world skills in computer programming, problem solving, opportunity recognition, and leadership. All participants develop a basic, working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and form teams to create mobile apps dedicated to improving education or the quality of life for city kids.</p>

<p>GenTech is dedicated to teaching and empowering students with the know-how they need to succeed in the technology-ridden, fast-paced world we live in today. During the initial 2-week "boot camp" students learn basic coding languages, develop an understanding of the fundamentals of entrepreneurship, and formulate their business plan and mobile application. Following the boot campâ€™s completion, students begin developing their apps during weekly classroom sessions and are paired with a "tech mentor" who offers support, insight, and guidance during various evening mentoring sessions. Finally, an awards ceremony and demo night concludes the two-month program and students receive cash prizes and various honors for their hard work during the summer term.</p>

<p><b>Inspiring Young Entrepreneurs</b><br>
GenTech is powered by a collection of students, mentors, guest speakers, partners, and sponsors. These volunteers are the backbone of the organization, donating their time and energy to helping students succeed and thrive in the technology world. Tech Mentors range from account executives and analysts to web developers and art directors, all offering their knowledge and insight into the competitive world of technology and entrepreneurship. Guest speakers have included the co-founder of MyCityMyWay, the CEO of Recyclebank, and a data scientist from bitly.  Donations from companies like Microsoft, Google, and Verizon make this program freely available to students looking to get involved in the field.</p>
