            *KEEP PRIVATE*

As many of you know, for six months, we had the opportunity to collaborate with Outward Bound to teach basic filmmaking and storytelling skills to first year CUNY College students. It was a fun, enlightening and a challenging learning experience.  I just wanted to share a few notes of what we did, what went well and if presented with possible future collaborations, what we can do in the future. 

<p><b><u>WHAT WE DID:</u></b></p>

<p><b>1. Storyboarding and Story Structure</b></p>

<p><b>2. Production</b></p>
	-Learning about the 3 P’s: Pre-production, production, and post
	-Interviewing skills
	-Basic Operating Camera Skills: Setting up the camera and tripod
	-Basic Shooting skills:
		- Framing, camera movement, monitoring audio levels, white balance, 			focus, exposure, aperture, shutter speed and gain
		-Shooting to Edit

<p><b>3.Editing: Basics of Adobe Premiere</b></p>

<p><b>4. Presenting to an audience</b></p>

<p><b><u>What went well</u></b></p>

<p><b>Shooting on their own: </b></p>Students went out on their campuses to independently film, demonstrating their gained knowledge on shooting and interviewing techniques. They were able to take creative and artistic risks on their own. 

<p><b>Rental System:</b></p> We created a rental system in which one person from each production group was solely responsible for checking out and returning the equipment. This allowed students to take more time outside of EdLab time to work on their projects. 

<p><b>Extended hours:</b></p> In order to meet deadline, editors came in throughout the week to edit for hours at a time. 


<p><b><u>What we could have done differently</u></b></p>

<p><b>Schedule:</b></p> For the first three months of the session, we saw students every other week, which was not conducive to learning and retaining information on new technology and software. Also, there were weeks at a time that students were absent. Next time, we should hold workshops more consistently, and more often. We also should have some kind of attendance rule where students have to make up their hours in order to continue to be part of the production of the final film. 

<p><b>Deliverable vs. Learning:</b></p> Because we had to have final polished films that Outward Bound would  use to screen to audiences, there were points during our shoots where either the deliverable or learning opportunity suffered. There was not any cushion time for failure. In the future, we should have deadlines for smaller projects and evaluations throughout the workshop, so we can allow them to learn from their mistakes and apply what they learned to the final film. 

<p><b>More equipment:</b></p> Because there were 15-20 students, it was hard for each student to have time with the camera. It would be helpful to have more equipment at our disposal to ease the rental process.

<p><b>Media management:</b></p> Because of the amount of media that each student had, it was hard to find an easy system to organize and back up their footage. Each group should be in charge of dumping and formatting their team’s specific media cards. 

Overall, it was a great and valuable learning experience for the video team.
