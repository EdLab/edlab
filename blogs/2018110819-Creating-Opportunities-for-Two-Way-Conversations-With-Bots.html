<p>What if you were able to have a real conversation with a bot like Alexa, one that allowed you to engage with AI in a new, more meaningful way? Is such a thing even possible, or is it just another Hollywood movie plot? A team of students at Brigham Young University thinks it is possible, and hopes that its new socialbot could make two-way conversations between humans and robots more feasible.</p>

<p>As their entrance in Amazon's Alexa Prize Challenge this year, the students have created Eve, a bot they hope will be able to engage in more meaningful conversation with humans. Using machine learning combined with models of human cognition and conversation, the team has designed Eve to be utilized by people who can't read or write, engage autistic children in new ways, provide therapeutic support or companionship, help students brainstorm, or provide educational opportunities to those who don't have access to them. </p>   

<p>What kinds of learning opportunities do you think Eve could provide, once fully developed? What advantages and disadvantages can you imagine come with its use? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44730">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:01 Sara Hardman: </b>Not to be pessimistic, but I really see this tech being used way more by people for fun rather than by people who can't read and write or who have other learning or social obstacles. One reason for this is simply accessibility. As it is right now, and even with the projected 2-way conversation, Alexa is a luxury rather than a necessity.</p>

<p><b>@02:03 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> St. Louis University is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/16/saint-louis-university-to-install-2300-echo-dots/">installing Echo Dots in dorm rooms</a> starting in fall 2018. I guess it's loosely educational to be able to ask a robot how to get to class, but it seems like it's more a concession to student laziness or an effort to unclog advisor emails than a real promotion of learning.</p>
