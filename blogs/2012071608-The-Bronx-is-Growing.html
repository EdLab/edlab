          <p>
            Last week, I <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7946">blogged</a> about how location is crucial for any new business or even old businesses looking to rebrand. I also looked at a list of cities across the country that are very business friendly, especially for new ones. The startup scene in New York City may be expanding to one of the city's most marginalized communities: the Bronx. According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/magazine/bronx-economy.html?pagewanted=1&_r=3&smid=tw-share">New York Times article</a>, the Bronx is trying to become a hub for aspiring companies and entrepreneurs. In the article, the author compares the social and economic conditions of the Bronx and Brooklyn during the 1970s and 1980s and how Brooklyn has outgrown and outpaced the Bronx in all areas. Much of the business growth in the Bronx can be attributed to Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., who has been ambitious in his plans to drag the Bronx out of the shadows.

As a Bronx resident, news such as this is always very positive to read as most news that tend to come out of the Bronx focus on violence, and drug use, among others. The author notes that focusing on enticing startups and aspiring businesses may not ultimately determine whether the Bronx does indeed grow to level Brooklyn and Manhattan. He compares the Bronx to Pittsburgh and how they revamped from being a steel city to a major research city. Home to several universities and the research center of The Botanical Gardens, the author recommends the Bronx can remodel itself as a major research center while still focusing on improving its image.
