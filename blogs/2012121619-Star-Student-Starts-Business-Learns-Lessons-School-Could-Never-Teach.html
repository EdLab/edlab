Gary Jiang is wise beyond his years. As a student at Brooklyn Technical High School, he was president of the Young Entrepreneurs Association and CEO of his own t-shirt design company, MuffinMilk. Now at Babson College, a private business school renowned for its entrepreneurship program, Gary still maintains his Muffin Man status while balancing life as a student. 
<p>
During the formative years of his company, Gary learned firsthand the harsh lessons that entrepreneurship will teach you. For one, his initial team was made up of his friends from middle school, leading Gary to quickly discover why business and pleasure don’t mix. So, he reassembled a new team, with each member bringing a strength to the project. The value of collaboration was not lost on him. 
<p>
Gary’s entrepreneurial spirit was nurtured at an impressionable age, thanks in part to the various opportunities presented at his school. If more schools and programs encouraged kids to express their inner entrepreneurs, would more kids have an experience similar to Gary’s? What effect would supporting early entrepreneurship have on the future of the Millennial Generation? 
<p>
