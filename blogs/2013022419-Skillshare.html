<i> Skillshare is fueled by the passion and commitment of regular people all over the world. Anyone with experience and knowledge to share can teach a class, and any place can be a classroom -- a co-working space, coffee shop, garage or conference room </i> (<a href=" http://www.skillshare.com/ ">Skillshare</a>).



<p>
<b>People-Powered Learning </b>
<p>

Taking learning outside of the traditional bounds of the classroom, <a href=" http://www.skillshare.com/ ">Skillshare</a> has, since its founding in April 2011, offered lifelong learners the chance to gain hands-on education directly from peers located in their immediate geographic area.  Advertising "informal" learning opportunities ranging from workshops, classes and even solo study sessions, Skillshare has been a growing force in the movement to democratize learning and take it outside the exclusive and often exclusionary realm of educational settings. Skillshare’s wide range of educational opportunities encompasses numerous topics spanning anything from branding and public relations to bread making.  The only prerequisite is that a proposal must be accepted by Skillshare’s "class curators" who select what opportunities will ultimately be offered. Skillshare uses matching algorithms and location-specific software to help people find each other and connect around a desire to learn in real-time in the "real world." The site has also recently added a new "hybrid" option that blends the best of online learning (curated resources and threaded discussions) with in-person experiences, and with an emphasis on "project-based" learning. This new hybrid model creates even more of an opportunity for teachers to act as facilitators and curators of class resources, instead of the traditional banking model in which the teacher acts as the exclusive broker of knowledge.
<p>
<b>"Every Neighbor into a Student and Teacher"</b>
<p>
Open and accessible education supported by technology that allows learning to happen EVERYWHERE is a burgeoning trend in both formal and informal learning settings.  Everyone from YouTube stars featuring "how-to" tutorials to traditional institutions of higher education like Stanford University, and their free, Massive Open, Online Courses (MOOC) offered through Coursera are contributing to this movement towards empowering virtual and literal neighbors to form interconnected, networks devoted to learning.  One only has to look on TeacherTube, explore Ed.gov’s "Connected Educator" or search #EdChat on Twitter to discover that educational stakeholders at every level in more formal learning environments have also started to move towards a socially embedded experience.  This move empowers students to utilize asynchronous enrichment resources, and it fosters greater opportunities for networked, peer-to-peer learning opportunities, while contributing to less reliance on the traditional "sage on the stage" model of traditional instruction.Skillshare might, through further evolution and exploration of new learning models, 
help to infuse more formal educational experiences with working examples of less traditional models of collaborative learning. Perhaps in the near future students will be able to find locally-sourced learning resources and "teachers" who advertise their learning opportunities on a new kind of learning marketplace modeled after Skillshare’s successful example (the site has over 39,000 followers on Facebook alone) and help to create a truly collaborative learning community that lets learning happen EVERYWHERE, from EVERYONE and in EVERY possible setting. Can you imagine a course on Algebra taught by the local, retired Astrophysicist?  Or the judge who allows students to attend a class on the judicial process, in her chambers.  I can. Perhaps someday soon we will, as Skillshare CEO, Michael Karnjanaprakorn hopes, "turn every city and community into a campus, and every neighbor into a student and teacher."
