<b>Backstory</b>
One of the most tried-and-true methods of learning an instrument on your own is to listen to your favorite artist(s) and then emulate their sound.  This self-taught strategy works for some (especially those with great pitch and listening skills) but it takes a certain level of discipline. <a href="http://jammit.com">Jammit</a> is an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch app that helps you learn an instrument with this method in mind. It gives you access to a variety of original master recordings to learn and promises to support you with innovative strategies along the way.  Think of it as karaoke for the instrumentalist.

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>
The Internet is full of resources to help you learn how to play an instrument. YouTube, for one,  is loaded with instructional videos; tab[lature] sites are also quite numerous. But, while these sites may contain useful information, they are not the most helpful when it comes to realizing your learning goals. Jammit zeroes in on the intersection between people's willingness to learn but lack of discipline to reach competency.  

Jammit offers a library of original master recordings that people can play along with using various instruments (guitar, bass, piano/keyboard, drums, and voice).  Each track comes with the sheet music and tab (you can use whichever you are more comfortable with) so you don't have to rely on your ears alone.

You are shown the levels of each instrument in the track and, most importantly, you can control them which means you can turn off all the instruments except the one you are learning. This isolates the sound and helps learners concentrate on their instrument.  Once you've learned your part, you can go ahead and turn the other instruments back on while silencing your instrument's part so you can hear yourself playing as the star of the show!

Upon mastering your song, you can record yourself (backing instruments included) and keep it for your own self-assessment, send it to friends, or post it to facebook.  

There are myriad options to choose from when you embark on an adventure to learn an instrument, but this one immerses you into the musical experience like no other.  While you may never be a rock star, Jammit can help you play like one.

<b>EdLab Takeaway</b>
Jammit creates an interesting learning environment that allows users to engage in self-paced learning. It gives them all the tools they need to reach their goals and allows them to build confidence with the ability to check their progress by using the recording feature. Outside of a self-directed course, though, this app could also be used in conjunction with music lessons.  Teachers can assign students one of the songs for homework and request that they turn in a recording when they've finished. They can then work together in subsequent lessons to clean up any errors made.

Allowing students to move at their own pace is paramount to learning a new task; but allowing them to feel like rock stars when they do so might just be the secret to their success.
