Raul Gutierrez is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1Tq6Sl5">Tinybop Inc.,</a> a Brooklyn studio of designers, engineers, and artists building elegant STEM apps for kids around the world. Tinybop’s award-winning apps include The Human Body, Plants, Homes, Simple Machines, and The Robot Factory. The company champions curiosity, tinkering, and good plain fun. Inspired by vintage children’s books, toys, and films, Tinybop designers create digital toys that dive into the wonders of our everyday world. Gutierrez is an entrepreneur with a 20-year history in technology and the arts.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
Most of my life has been defined by early explorations in art and science. I'm the product of an isolated small town in East Texas. During my pre-cable, pre-internet 70's childhood, the city was effectively an island surrounded by a deep pine forest with little access to the outside world. From a young age I wanted out. Our schools were underfunded and subpar, so many of my most important learning experiences took place outside of the classroom. I spent my summers at the local library working my way through the stacks of the children's section. I especially loved vintage children's science books and they became a big part of my understanding of the world. </p>

<p>My parents convinced smart friends to tutor us in art and science. In those extracurricular classes I learned to ask questions and make connections between disciplines. I learned about abstract expressionism and modernism from the 80-year-old wife of a riverboat captain. I learned about physics from a man who designed the world's most successful oil pump. Something worked, because I managed to escape to Princeton. I enrolled as an engineer but graduated with a degree in Art History. That interplay between art and science has defined my life ever since. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
We aim to up the bar of children's apps and aspire to create content as good as the best children's books. We think of our apps as kindling for conversation. At their best, our apps get kids excited about science. Our hope is kids are creating their own narratives rather than buying into a brand narrative.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
There are so many unknowns about the shape of education and technology in the next two, five and ten years, but there is one thing you can absolutely be sure of: more and more kids at younger ages will have more access to touch screens. By creating content that is deep, rich, engaging, and about universally important subjects, I hope we put ourselves at the center of this macro trend offering quality instead of mere distraction.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
We don't talk about specifics of future projects, but we are working on projects for each of our two series. In August we'll release the next app in our Digital Toys series of digital construction kits. The first app in this series allowed kids to build virtual robots. We think the second app in this series skews a bit older and involves programming concepts. Then, in September we'll release our next Explorer's Library title (The Explorer's Library is a set of single big subject apps that introduce kids to ideas and phenomena. Past titles have included The Human Body, Plants, Homes, and Simple Machines.)</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
Rather than try to rate an absolute list of most interesting people on Twitter, which seems impossible, I looked for the most interesting people on my twitter feed as I write this. It's hard to beat <a href="http://bit.ly/1xRJ0eF">Marc Andreessen</a> for pure interestingness. He has an aggressive intellect and rangy curiosity that comes through loud and clear in his tweets. <a href="http://bit.ly/1JJpz1i">Bjarke Ingels</a> is the force behind the BIG architectural firm that is reshaping the skyline of NY. And I think I should throw in an outlier, so here's one your readers probably haven't encountered: <a href="http://bit.ly/1dHBazy">Galaxy Kate</a> is a researcher interested in the development of AI tools to augment user creativity.</p>
