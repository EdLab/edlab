          <p>
            The OUYA Kickstarter I <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7964">blogged about last month</a> ended last night in a big way.

It only took about 8 hours for the project to raise their "modest" goal of $950,000. It only took a few more minutes for OUYA's Kickstarter to join the elite group of million dollar projects, bringing the number up to eight. OUYA was also the fastest project to cross that mark, taking 8 hours and 22 minutes, about half the time the number 2 project took.

So that was about a month ago. When the kickstarter ended last night the final count was $8,596,475, with over $500,000 pledged in the final minutes. This is the highest amount ever raised through Kickstarter, and more than double the previous record holder. 

Interestingly, the previous record holder in both categories, fastest to cross the 1 million mark and to raise the most money, is the same project: a point-and-click adventure game called <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure?ref=live">Double Fine Adventure</a>. In fact, 4 of the top 5 projects in both categories are video games (or a console in OUYA's case) and all of them have some kind of video game nostalgia element to their pitches. What is it about video games, particularly games with an old-school feel (point-and-click interface, 2D graphics as a feature, and a sequel to a game from 1988) that convinces people to shell out over a million dollars for a game they hadn't even heard just a few days, or hours, before?

OUYA is going to be a great opportunity for educational games and I think if Kickstarter is any kind of prediction, some old school elements are going to have to show up if their going to be successful. I'll be glad to jump on that bandwagon as soon as it takes form. In the mean time, I'll just keep an eye on my mailbox for any potentially OUYA shaped packages to arrive...
