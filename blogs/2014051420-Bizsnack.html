<p>Have you ever wanted to take an online course in digital marketing, basic accounting, or starting your own business? Then <a href="http://www.bizsnack.com/">Bizsnack</a> may be the answer for you.  Bizsnack is on a mission to provide quality business training that is convenient, affordable, and accessible. From seasoned professionals looking to expand their skillset to people who simply want to learn more about the financial world, users are embracing the MOOC-style Bizsnack courses, all taught by leading industry professionals. Bizsnack courses are a quick and easy alternative to certificate programs, corporate seminars, and other formal training methods, such as an advanced degree.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Convenience and affordability are two major advantages of Bizsnack. Currently, the cost of a Bizsnack course ranges from $19.00 to $49.00. Some courses can be completed in less than an hour. Bizsnack courses are accessible via Web, tablet, and mobile devices. Each course provides a video introduction and an outline of topics covered, so students know exactly what to expect and if it is the right fit for their needs. While Bizsnack is still expanding its course library, there are already offerings in digital marketing, business communication, accounting and finance, leadership and management, and entrepreneurship. All lectures are recorded in HD-quality. With Bizsnack’s Social Learning Platform, users also have the opportunity to ask questions, share notes with other students, and earn "skill badges," to demonstrate their proficiency. Throughout the course, students are assessed on their progress and are notified of areas for improvement. Upon finishing the course, students receive a certificate of completion. Bizsnack courses offer a 30-day money back guarantee and can also be sent as a gift.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>As Bizsnack expands its course library, the price range will increase as well. Some courses will run up to $150.00 depending on course content, length, and instructor. As the site continues to develop, it would be helpful to see course ratings for each of the current offerings. Feedback and comments from students that have gone through the course can be helpful for prospective users who may be deciding between classes.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>With shifting demands in today’s workplace and an economy that is increasingly driven by information technology, Bizsnack understands that there is an unmet need for continuing education among busy professionals. A quick and affordable alternative to traditional training methods, Bizsnack courses offer the practical and directly applicable business skills individuals may need to succeed and possibly advance in their careers.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Learn from the experts and get the business skills you need, fast.</p>
