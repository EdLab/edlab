<p><i>"We decided to take a different path and rethink the relationship technology has with people. What we found was when you give the brain and the body what they want, suddenly the shackles are off, the rectangular boxes are tossed, and something magical happens… experiences like none you’ve ever seen." </i> (<a href="https://www.magicleap.com/#/company">About Magic Leap</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The Promise of Magic</b></p>

<p>Since its founding in 2011, <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/#/home">Magic Leap</a> has promised the world a revolutionary augmented reality headset that could tremendously change the way we experience our surroundings. The videos and images the company has released have been remarkable: a whale jumping out of a gymnasium floor and a solar system that can fit in the palm of your hand, among others. Yet for all its promises and glimpses into the future, Magic Leap has remained one of the most secretive startups in the industry. While <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/the-reality-behind-magic-leap">one reviewer</a> has said that the Magic Leap headset currently resembles the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Hololens</a> in many ways, no one is entirely sure what it will look like or how it will function when finally released, perhaps <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13894000/magic-leap-ar-microsoft-hololens-way-behind">not even the company itself</a>. All we know is that if it pans out like it suggests, this technology could permanently change the way we learn, create, and discover.</p>

<p>The company asserts that it has created a headset that superimposes 3D images on the world. This is a version of mixed reality, where a person can interact with the augmented reality images overlaid on their surroundings. Unlike a virtual reality headset that sucks you into an entirely virtual world, Magic Leap leaves you in the real world, but just adds new, virtual features to it. The greatest attribute to Magic Leap is that if multiple people wear the headset, they can see the same images superimposed on their surroundings. The collaborative opportunities of this product give it tremendous potential to be a tool for learning.</p>

<p><b>Secretive, Successful, Futuristic</b></p>
 
<p>While the company remains quiet regarding its product, it has been incredibly successful in recruiting investors and all-star players to their team. It’s estimated that since its inception, Magic Leap has raised over $1.4 billion and is worth $4.5 billion. In addition, the company is fully committed to being on the bleeding edge of futurism. One of their team positions, Chief Futurist, is filled by Neal Stephenson, a noted sci-fi author whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/books/review/seveneves-by-neal-stephenson.html">most recent novel</a> features a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world.</p>

<p><b>Magic Leap’s Unknown Future</b></p>
 
<p>Magic Leap has yet to commit to a release date or cost, so for now, it’s uncertain how or when the company will make an impact in the field. What is certain, however, is that if Magic Leap fulfills its lofty promises, it could be the product everyone will be wearing in the future. This is particularly true if the company is able to shrink their headset to a pair of glasses, which they have asserted in the past. Magic Leap has promised the world a revolutionary product, but for now, we’ll have to be patient to see just how much magic it will create.</p>
