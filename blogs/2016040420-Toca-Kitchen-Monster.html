<p>In an era when disconcerting rates of childhood obesity have drained all the fun out of conspicuous consumption,<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toca-kitchen-monsters/id510301841?mt=8">Toca Kitchen Monster</a> pushes youngsters away from fast food fantasies and toward nutritious dishes using their iPads. Players prepare healthy meals for two hungry monsters, leaving foodies to cook on their own. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Toca Kitchen Monster is a delightful app. Kids choose different raw food, like meat, tomatoes, and broccoli, from a fridge. They can boil or cook; slice or dice; fry, mix, or microwave—all without the mess. Their virtual fridge has fresh ingredients that can be prepared in as many ways as they can dream up, making cooking a fun, exploratory adventure. They can learn the basics of life in the kitchen without adult supervision. A formerly off-limits, no fun zone has opened up to a world of shaking and baking.</p>

<p>Fun bubbles to the surface as soon as you launch the app—a happy sounding voice gleefully yells "Toca!" when Kitchen Monsters starts. The monsters are endearingly cute. They love eating and do so with gusto, chomping into whatever you make with sounds of delight, as long as you prepare it the right way. Slicing and dicing is particularly fun, as veggies split with a simple swipe of the finger. Gentle reminders let you know what the gobbling monsters like (you better fry that meat, raw is a no go). And if the monsters really don’t like what you've put together, they stick out their tongues and toot a tiny tuba sound, making it clear that you have to up your cooking game. All of the interactivity is playfully jestful; no hurt feelings here, just choose another ingredient, cut it up, and the monsters will eventually eat.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Toca Kitchen Monster’s demographic is pretty narrow, with K–3 being the limit. Older kids who consider themselves kings of the kitchen may find the app too childish. There is also a limited amount of food in the fridge so kids may become bored after a couple of rounds of monster cooking madness. Mixing food seems to be more difficult than it should, and preparation is easiest when you only choose one. Finally, although kids can learn the rudiments of basic food prep using Toca, there are stark limits to what they can do. Frying meat is fun on an app, but keep youngsters away from heavy pans and hot surfaces in real life. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Toca Kitchen Monster is a cute cooking app that most youngsters would adoringly embrace, even without wearing oven mitts. It has the wild creatures, festive colors, and sweet sounds that creative kids crave. Although Toca does a fabulous job of introducing the rudiments of culinary craftwork to mini cookers, Toca Kitchen Monster Sr. needs to be developed to bring youth to a higher level of food expertise and that oh so elusive Michelin rating. Bon apetit! </p>
