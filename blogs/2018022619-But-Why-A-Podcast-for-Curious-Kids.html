<p><i><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/474377890/but-why-a-podcast-for-curious-kids">But Why: A Podcast for Curious Kids</a></i> is a podcast produced by Vermont Public Radio that lets kids ask questions to experts. Each episode focuses on one central theme, ranging from fact-based informationals such as "Why Do We Have Daylight Saving Time?" to moral or ethical quandaries like "Is It Ever OK To Break A Rule?" The show’s founder and host is public radio veteran <a href="http://digital.vpr.net/people/jane-lindholm#stream/0">Jane Lindholm</a>.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The podcast continues public radio’s tradition of high quality production, and the producers for each episode seamlessly splice together clips, music, and interviews. Because the target audience is kids, there are no long conversations between the host and guests. Instead, the show keeps a brisk pace in order to hold children’s attention. </p> 

<p>Episodes feel quite interactive, too. Audio recordings of questions, answers, or other thoughts from young people across the world are featured throughout each episode. Listeners are encouraged to <a href="questions@butwhykids.org">send in their own recordings</a>, which creates a feeling of accessibility.</p> 

<p>The <i>But Why</i> podcast is also a good introduction to the medium of podcasting because episodes often feature crossover guests from other pods. For instance, one episode brought on hosts from the <i>Slate Money</i> podcast to talk about personal finance. Exposing kids to new shows should get them more interested in this expanding medium. </p>  

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p><i>But Why</i> is specifically for kids, but parents may have to listen along with their children. Creating content that’s both kid-friendly and entertaining to adults is a difficult task. Some of the topics and discussions are just too simplistic at times and parents could get bored fairly quickly.</p>

<p>The podcasting industry relies on advertisements, but when something is specifically targeted at kids, like this show, this need for ads could become problematic. While all of the ads that I heard seemed fine, it’s still something for parents to think about when considering this form of entertainment for children.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The <i>But Why</i> show is a nice introductory podcast to get kids interested in this medium. The quick pacing and relatability in each episode should be highly inviting to children. Parents actually may enjoy listening along with their child to some content, but other simple topics may be too tedious.</p>
