<p>Even though storytelling itself is an ancient art form that dates back centuries, digital storytelling has seen <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/311211/lifestyle/learning-the-ancient-art-of-storytelling-the-modern-way">a surge in popularity</a>, both <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/2437/take-a-digital-leap-in-classroom-teaching">in</a> and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1497/youth-take-a-stand-story-telling-and-digital-aged-civics">out</a> of the classroom. Digital storytelling can take many forms, often combining—in any number of permutations—verbal, visual, auditory, and kinesthetic narration with multimedia.</p>
 
<p>A research team in Slovenia recently conducted a study in order to take a closer look at the lack of information and communications technology (ICT) training that pre-service teachers receive. They focused specifically on pre-service math teachers, asking them to design a lesson plan that employs a digital story using anything from animations and photography to video and music in order to teach math.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that the pre-service teachers usually included math problems with multiple solutions in their digital stories, demonstrating that storytelling can influence students to believe there are many possible ways to solve math problems. They also found that pre-service teachers previously felt that their relationship with ICT was mostly passive; however, after creating digital stories, they felt more engaged and confident in using ICT. They further reported that digital storytelling changed their perceptions of computers in classrooms from passive (students watching a video, pressing buttons in a game) to active (solving math problems).</p>
 
<p>Although digital storytelling might not seem like an intuitive match with math teaching and learning, this research provides insight into how it can be successfully incorporated in a math classroom. As teachers feel more comfortable using ICT and more confident in its ability to produce active, engaged learning, digital storytelling could be a novel and productive way to get both teachers and students thinking about math in complex ways.</p>
