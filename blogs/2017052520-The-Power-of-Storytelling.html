<p><i>Cognotion uses the power of a story to craft "emotionally and cognitively intense training and test prep applications that combine interactive video narratives with gamified learning modules, augmented by live simulation and social media reinforcement."</i> (<a href="http://www.cognotion.com/mission">About Cognotion</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Education Through Storytelling</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.buildingbeats.org/">Cognotion</a> is a New York City-based educational technology company that specializes in learning management systems for healthcare professionals. Their mission is to increase patient outcomes and empower medical professionals who serve in this challenging industry. The company takes a narrative-based approach for training the growing workforce of healthcare workers. Learning experiences are structured around immersive stories. As learners progress through these narratives, they draw upon information resources, develop empathy for the characters portrayed, and build new knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Preparing Healthcare Professionals</b></p>

<p>Cognotion has created two learning management products: <i>ReadyHealth</i> and <i>ReadyCNA</i>. ReadyHealth is a training platform for Allied Health professionals. Some professions that are considered under the umbrella term <i>Allied Health professionals</i> are dental hygienists, respiratory therapists, speech language pathologists, and many more. As these professions make up two-thirds of U.S. healthcare workers, Cognotion sees the need to develop certification products for this learner population. The ReadyHealth program not only meets all necessary certification requirements, but uses Cognotionâ€™s novel storytelling approach to teach students through narrative examples supplemented by practice, games, and simulations. The second Cognotion product, ReadyCNA, uses the same approach to train Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA) to pass CNA exams and prepare for this demanding profession. </p>

<p>With an aging population in the United States, training a growing workforce of primary care workers is a demanding task that Cognotion aims to address. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the health care sector will add <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2014/spring/art03.pdf"> over four million jobs</a> between 2012 and 2022. In addition to teaching core skills, Cognotion presents stories that portray both the role of care workers and the impacts they have on the lives of their patients.</p>
