<p>What are plastic bricks doing in a botanical garden? More than you might think! Nature Connects is a traveling sculpture show that puts thousands of LEGO bricks in the midst of beautiful, natural displays of flora and fauna. It is based on the principle that all living things on Earth are interconnected through complex networks. Anyone who has ever created anything out of LEGOs knows that it would be impossible to build something without fitting blocks together, and the bigger the structure, the more complicated it gets. And so the lesson begins.</p>

<p>The exhibit is accompanied by LEGO buy-and-build stations, design competitions, and interactive sites that demonstrate connections in nature. While the sight of pixelated buffalo grazing in a grass field may initially be jarring, it serves as a reminder that the networks in nature may not always be so transparent, but they are ever present.</p>

<p>If this exhibit found its way to your local botanical garden, would you go to it? In what other ways have you seen LEGO and learning combine? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/14008">Jump into the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a> and share your thoughts on all of the above.</p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:37 YogiP:</b> I can imagine this turning into a sort of Easter egg hunt for kids, searching for the next sculpture as they inadvertently travel the entire garden.<p>

<b>@02:25 Carla:</b> One thing I would liked to have seen is the connection between animals and something else. Take the hummingbird, for example. This was a great way to show the relationship between the bird and the flower. But for the bison, I feel like there was something missing. What are they connected to?<p>

<b>@02:35 YogiP:</b> I wonder the extent to which the idea of "connection" is pushed to visitors. For example, do kids understand that the placement of each brick affects the bricks that will follow, just as with the composition of organisms? Between that and explaining the actual placement of the organism within the garden... there's a lot of potential for learning with this exhibit.<p>
