<strong><a title="From the Production Company" href="http://burninginthesun.wordpress.com/about/">From the Production Company</a>:</strong> 26-year-old charmer Daniel Dembele is equal parts West African and European, and looking to make his mark on the world.  Seizing the moment at a crossroads in his life, Daniel decides to return to his homeland in Mali and start a local business building solar panels – the first of its kind in the sun drenched nation.  Daniel’s goal is to electrify the households of rural communities, 99% of which live without power.  BURNING IN THE SUN tells the story of Daniel’s journey growing the budding idea into a viable company, and of the business’ impact on Daniel’s first customers in the tiny village of Banko.  Taking controversial stances on climate change, poverty, and African self-sufficiency, the film explores what it means to grow up as a man, and what it takes to prosper as a nation.  An Official Selection of IFP’s Documentary Rough Cut Lab and Independent Film Week/Spotlight on Docs, and supported by LEF Foundation, Brooklyn Arts Council, and  Experimental Television Center.
