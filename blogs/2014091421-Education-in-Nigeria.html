            The American University of Nigeria (AUN) is an organization based in Nigeria that aims to adequately prepare students for a better future. The primary vision of this organization is to prepare students for university degrees in STEM. In the northeast section of Nigeria, where conflict has been at its peak, millions of children are out of school. However, there is one co-educational private secondary school in Yola, which is painting a brighter future for its students through online learning. Due to the excessive growth in technology, many countries are trying to adapt to a new system of teaching based primarily online. Many students in this school agree with this system, as they wish to see Nigeria have a Chinese style tech revolution.
<p>
As highlighted in this <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/07/using-technology-education-nigeria" target="blank">article</a>, Nigeria is facing one of the world's worst learning crises and is in need of a reform. The rapid growth in the country's population has resulted in an increase in millions of children not in school. There is an estimated 10 million children out of school in the country. Additionally, UNESCO estimated that in 2008, almost a third of men aged 15-29 with just six years of education were illiterate. This shows the inefficiencies of the education system in Nigeria. Additionally, there are not enough books and qualified teachers. In the case of AUN, students at a governmental school in Yola are taught during after school hours and learn with tablet computers. They use apps to improve literacy, numeracy and critical thinking skills. This is what Nigerian sees as a pivotal starting point for greater things to come in the future of Nigerian education.
