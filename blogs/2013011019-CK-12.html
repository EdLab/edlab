<p><a href="http://www.ck12.org/">CK-12</a> proves itself as a learning site at the forefront of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">open educational resources movement</a>. The site, available to both teachers and students, publishes and provides free learning content online for many K-12 subjects. CK-12’s subjects include math, science, engineering, English, history, astronomy, and test prep. The dynamic learning content includes audio, images, quizzes, and interactive activities.</p>

<p>CK-12 has separate logins for teachers and students. The student interface directs users to free learning content, includes quizzes for each learning concept, and offers progress tracking. Teachers are able to log in to use free learning content for their classrooms. Student and teacher users also have access to CK-12’s unique Flexbooks feature. This functionality allows users to customize their own textbooks by saving learning concepts, the equivalent of a textbook chapter, from any subject. This provides users with the freedom to customize what they want to learn or teach.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>CK-12 is organized so users can quickly find their desired learning content. In the student interface users can track their learning progress, highlight words, and write notes in the text, all of which increase the level of engagement. The Flexbooks feature lets students and teachers customize the organization and content of their own textbooks. Flexbooks also auto generates a table of contents for user-curated content. CK-12 balances this strict organization with a diverse and engaging set of media options.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Though most of the math and science learning content includes media and interactive features, some of the other subjects are not so rich. CK-12 covers a wide range of K-12 subjects, and it would benefit users greatly if media content was applied consistently across subjects. This would help ensure that students with all types of learning styles were served by this technology.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>CK-12 is diverse enough to be a source of learning content for many types of learners. The site personalizes learning through text, audio, images, quizzes, and interactive activities. With the Flexbooks feature, students can create custom textbooks that focus on their areas of interest. CK-12 is at the crossroads of personalized content and open educational resources. As they bolster their library of media diverse resources, this position could bring open content to a vast audience and potentially make a real difference in schools that are unable or unwilling to invest in new technology.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>CK-12 is armed with plenty of open educational resources for every learner.</p>
