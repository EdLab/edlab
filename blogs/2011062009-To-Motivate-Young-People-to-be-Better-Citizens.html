This Queens school has over 4,200 students, but about 700 of them are JROTC (Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps) kids. According to this video, the integration of this military program into an otherwise typical high school has been highly beneficial to everyone involved.

While I was familiar with the <a href="https://www.usarmyjrotc.com/jrotc/dt">JROTC </a>by name, I didn't know much beyond that. The program's been around since 1916, but its goals have changed: "Once looked upon primarily as a source of enlisted recruits and officer candidates, it became a citizenship program devoted to the moral, physical and educational uplift of American youth. Although the program retained its military structure and the resultant ability to infuse in its student cadets a sense of discipline and order, it shed most of its early military content." Its motto? "To motivate young people to be better citizens."

The JROTC website also lists the program's objectives: 

-To appreciate the ethical values and principles that underlie good citizenship.
-To develop leadership potential, while living and working cooperatively with others.
-To be able to think logically and to communicate effectively with others, both orally and in writing.
-To appreciate the importance of physical fitness in maintaining good health.
-To understand the importance of high school graduation for a successful future, and learn about college and other advanced educational and employment opportunities.
-To develop mental management abilities.
-To become familiar with military history as it relates to America's culture, and understand the history, purpose, and structure of military services.
-To develop the skills necessary to work effectively as a member of a team.

Do you think these are all important attributes to promote? Does a military presence like this have a place in public schools?
