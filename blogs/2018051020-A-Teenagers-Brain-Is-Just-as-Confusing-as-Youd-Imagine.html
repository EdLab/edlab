<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inmind-2-vr-cardboard/id1166999366?mt=8">InMind 2 VR</a> is a "VR scientific adventure" that gives players the power to make strategic decisions based on neuroscience, specifically as they relate to the chemistry of emotions expressed in the human brain. As you journey through the micro-world of a teenager's brain, you get to shape their future as they grow into an adult. Available as a free app, with the option of an in-app purchase of $2.99, this game is inspired by the Pixar movie <i>Inside Out</i> and, more scientifically, by Lövheim's theory of emotions.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The concept behind this game is intriguing and relevant, especially for kids approaching or experiencing puberty. Beyond seeing how different emotions affect different life outcomes (such as a humiliating experience in a math class keeping you from pursuing a STEM career path), it is fascinating and comforting to see that these emotions have scientific causes. Understanding how different components within the brain produce life-changing responses is a really unique idea for a VR game.</p>

<p>The design of InMind 2 is beautiful, featuring a colorful imagining of what it’s like to be inside the human brain. The game is easy to navigate and utilizes VR capabilities to the fullest; the player is fully immersed and must search for neurotransmitters from all angles.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Packaging neuroscience in a digestible way for young minds is difficult, and though InMind 2 clearly tries, it fails to completely connect the dots between the activities the user engages in and the science concepts they’re meant to represent. While there is some preliminary explanation of the science of emotions, I really wished there was consistent narration or more scientific connections being made while progressing through the game. This type of reinforcement would have helped me better understand how collecting certain amounts of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline led to different emotional results in the main character’s brain.</p>
 
<p>Another concern I have about the game is that it’s very repetitive. While there are different outcomes at each level, the process for gathering neurotransmitters is exactly the same each time. It got boring after a while, and I imagine a younger player’s attention span would be even shorter than mine.</p> 

<p>Lastly, while many are aware of VR’s ability to cause <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/virtual-reality-has-motion-sickness-problem">motion sickness</a>, InMind 2 is shows that this can be a real barrier for users. The combination of constantly shifting and focusing to capture neurotransmitters while also moving through the brain is dizzying, and kept me from playing the game for more than about 15 minutes at a time.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the concept and design are good, InMind 2 failed to gamify learning effectively. Only with increased scientific content and a greater variety of games will this app be able to live up to its full potential.</p>
