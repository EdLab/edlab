          <p>
            I believe I've passed on some horrible examples of public service announcements in the past which should never have been made. For contrast, here's two very-low-fi videos made by public service agencies which are actually kind of successful. 

Here's why I think they don't fall prey to the traps of many other public service announcements:

"Don't Do What Denise Don't Does," Arizona Office of Administrative Hearings: http://www.azoah.com/video13.html

"Why Don't We Do It In Our Sleeves?" endorsed by the Maine Medical Association: http://www.coughsafe.com/media.html

1) They use illustration and explanation which is humorous rather than simply didactic, and somehow, they just hit that sweet spot. I think in part it's because the humor is about cognitive dissonance ("My first exhibit is this fishtank!")

2) The low production value helps lower your defenses to an overproduced, commercial-like message -- it feels like something a friend might have produced.

3) They're really specific. A lot of the old Jem and GI Joe PSAs I watched for the Media Show's latest season are insanely vague ("Keep practicing until you can do... something!" "I hanker for a hunk of cheese!"), and don't seem to have an intended audience or setting. These videos fit into a specific place -- the doctor's office, the courtroom -- and communicate information which is important to that setting.

Do they work? Well, I can tell you I'm more inclined to sneeze into my arm than my hands now.

(My first choice for best PSA ever is actually the "Check Your Balls" campaign for early diagnosis of testicular cancer, but the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nK1CEo5ho&feature=channel_page">videos</a> are not as safe for work: The use of physical comedy and pottymouth humor to talk about a sensitive subject is perfect for the demographic they're trying to reach.)
