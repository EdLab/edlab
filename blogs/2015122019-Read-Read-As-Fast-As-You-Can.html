<p>Surely by now we’ve done away with the inefficiencies of toting around a heavy book, turning the page to read, even scanning from left to right or—gasp—blinking while we read. Several apps have been developed to facilitate reading on digital platforms, by changing the color gradient of the text from one end of the line to another to reduce eye fatigue or breaking text into chunks to enhance focus. Scientists are researching whether or not these apps live up to their claims of making reading easier or developing speed reading capabilities, which will have implications for how we read and how we teach reading. </p>
 
<p>Spritz promises to help you becomes a speed reader, soon tripling your words per minute (wpm) from the regular starting pace of 250 wpm. The idea is that traditional reading from left-to-right is less suitable for small screens than rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), which displays words one at a time to reduce eye movement and blinks. Spritz also incorporates an optimal recognition point (the letter highlighted in red), which is the most important letter for the brain to process word meaning. A group of French and Swiss scientists tested this theory in a controlled experiment, comparing users’ eye movements and comprehension responses for a text read left-to-right on a screen and the same text read through the Spritz app on a screen. They found that contrary to Spritz’s claims that RSVP would reduce eye fatigue and increase comprehension, reading with RSVP caused more visual fatigue, because the eye is not blinking as frequently. It also lowered literal comprehension, because the eye cannot scan through previously read text to facilitate information processing. </p>
 
<p>Spritz is continuously developing its technology, allowing users to adjust pacing and modifying the rhythm of the text with consideration for length of sentences and punctuation. There will be a continual research feedback loop as scientists evaluate how Spritz (and apps like it) affects our reading experience. The goal of enhanced reading technologies is to reduce the brain and eye taskload when reading to open up mental bandwidth for processing the information, which could have promising applications for struggling readers in the classroom. </p>
 
<p>What is especially interesting about this study is the implication for learning. Can we learn as accurately when we read with RSVP or other optimization methods, as the developers of Spritz claim? When we teach literacy, will we come to include teaching students to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks to different reading methods for different situations? For example, we might continue using Spritz when reading an article like this, but perhaps stick to a typical screen for the original report. </p>
