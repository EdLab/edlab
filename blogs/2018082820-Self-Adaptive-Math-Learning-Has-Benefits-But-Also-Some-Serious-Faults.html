<p>Created by the Indian organization <a href="http://www.ei-india.com/">Educational Initiatives,</a> <a href="https://mindspark.in/#about_us">Mindspark</a> is a computer-based, self-adaptive learning program. The cloud-based platform aims to increase students’ math abilities by providing them with a unique learning path and a pace that allows them to move comfortably through material. Mindspark is aligned with educational standards in several different countries’ national curricula, and can be used by individual students or whole classrooms.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The Mindspark platform is very intuitive and easy to follow. After a brief tutorial, you have the option to engage in different exercises on math topics that are grade-level appropriate. Because I have taught second grade math, I selected that grade level for my trial of the product, and I can confirm the appropriateness of the content.</p>

<p>The exercises are organized by topic, and though you’re advised to focus on one at a time, you can move between them if you wish. One great thing about the exercises is that the answers are always explained, regardless of whether you answer correctly or not. This way, if you luck out with the answer but still don’t really understand why you were correct, guidance is provided.</p>

<p>While I only tested Mindspark as an independent student, I can see how it would be beneficial for teachers using it for an entire class. The ability to track students’ performance in real time, customize topics, and efficiently see where students are struggling is fantastic. Watching this progress as a parent would also be helpful.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>A problem I had with Mindspark was that I felt thrown into the middle of the exercises with very little context. The platform seems more like a space for practice than a tool that teaches, since there are no explanations, few examples, and no established goals for the lessons. If you were coming straight from a classroom demonstration, I imagine Mindspark exercises would make more sense, but they lack clarity as standalone material.</p>
 
<p>While some sets of lessons seem good at demonstrating mathematical concepts, others make concepts far more difficult than they have to be, using too many words, images, or numbers to convey a simple concept. For example, in order to understand multiplication, the learner starts by reading about a frog that "takes four jumps of two steps each," and is then confronted with a visual representation of a frog jumping along a numbered line. It took me longer than it should have to realize I was being asked to multiply 4 x 2, a problem that could have been visually represented more simply with four groupings of two items or two groupings of four items. Starting with a fairly abstract story problem seems counterintuitive, especially for young age groups.</p>

<p>Perhaps part of the problem is that the instructions were inconsistent and hard to follow. Written instructions are rephrased verbally by a robot, which is especially confusing for students learning to read. Words are often squished together incomprehensibly, and several times the audio stated an animal different than that pictured (such as "the monkey jumped," when the exercise pictured a frog). These shortcomings make me question the quality of the platform.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Mindspark is affordable at $45 for three months, or $125 for a year, but I’m not sure the low cost is worth it. As a supplement, it could be a decent tool, but I would not suggest it for independent or long-term use.</p>
