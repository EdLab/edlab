<p>Candice Lys is executive director and co-founder of <a href="https://arcticfoxy.com"> FOXY</a> (Fostering Open eXpression among Youth), a non-profit that uses traditional beading, theater, digital storytelling, photography, and music to help Canada’s Northern and Indigenous young women ask questions and express their knowledge and opinions.</p>

<p><b>You were recently awarded the prestigious Ashoka Fellowship. Previous recipients include Nobel Peace Prize laureates and the Wikipedia founder. What do you hope this recognition will do for FOXY? </b><br>
<p>Earning the Ashoka Fellowship is such an incredible honor. I am particularly excited, as I was the only Canadian Fellow in 2017! Ashoka works hard to support their fellows, and for FOXY this means <i>pro bono</i> legal support, access to their massive network, and connections with organizations across the world. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to connect with new and more experienced fellows; to ask them questions and have discussions about things that, I think, only those fellows who have given everything they have to make ideas happen can understand.</p>

<p><b>How has your educational and professional trajectory shaped the work you do with youth, in particular young women?</b><br>
<p>During my first week as an undergrad at the University of Alberta, I saw a presentation about sexual and mental health done by the University’s Peer Health Education (PHE) team. I loved how they did it; I discovered an interest in health promotion. The following year, I was hired by the PHE Program and from there I wound up in a master's in health promotion program at Dalhousie University. My master's research brought me back home to the Northwest Territories, where I talked with young women about their sexual health education experiences and found that sex ed was still lacking in the North. So, when I started my PhD I really wanted to do something with what I had learned from my master's, and the next logical step was to create <a href="https://arcticfoxy.com"> FOXY</a>. Nearly six years later FOXY has taken off, expanded to include young men through the SMASH (Strength, Masculinities, and Sexual Health) program, and reached over 3,000 youth across the three Canadian territories.</p>

<p><b>FOXY uses drama and the arts to open up a dialogue with teenage girls (13–17) about healthy sexuality and mental health. Are the skills they learn transferrable into adulthood?</b><br>
<p>Absolutely! An evaluation study is following cohorts of youth who have completed the FOXY and SMASH programs. The results show that gains in knowledge, changes in attitudes, and capacity for safer sexual health behaviors are maintained over time. Anecdotally, we know that FOXY and SMASH are changing lives every day, as we keep in touch with youth through our alumni network and get to hear all the awesome things they are involved with, from stories about how they've helped their friends make better choices to getting into university programs related to sexual health. We're so proud of our Peer Leaders.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning for young women in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think social media does, and will continue to, have the greatest impact on young women. There is a lot of opportunity for education and health promotion in social media (remember that video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbei5JGiT8"> consent and tea?</a> There are very few people who haven't seen it!), but also great potential for harm through the spread of misinformation and online bullying. Media literacy is one component of our programming that I think is so important. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on? Do you have other big projects in the pipeline?</b><br>
<p>My PhD… finally! I am in the eighth and final year of my doctorate in public health through the University of Toronto, and though it's been on the back burner for a few years while I expended an exhausting amount of time and energy making FOXY/SMASH sustainable, the stars are aligning for me to graduate in 2018. After the PhD is done I will focus my energy more on creating alternate sources of revenue for FOXY/SMASH to hopefully decrease our reliance on government grants (stay tuned for more!), and pick up all kinds of abandoned hobbies such as quilting and reading books for fun.</p>

<p><b>Who are your heroes? Who inspires Candice Lys?</b><br>
<p>While I am very fortunate to have so many inspirational mentors in my life, including my mom, several young people who work for FOXY and SMASH, and many others, my granny, Seraphine Evans, is one of my greatest heroes. She raised 16 children and although she passed away in 2008, I am forever grateful that she taught me the value of kindness and the importance of ethics. My ethical bottom line has always been: "Would my granny approve?" If no, I try to avoid making those choices.</p>
