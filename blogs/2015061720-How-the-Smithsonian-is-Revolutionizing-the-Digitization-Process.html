Digitization is an incredibly slow process. How slow, you ask? A person goes through each individual item in a collection, takes a digital image, and manually enters metadata into a system so that others may view the object online. As you can probably imagine, it is no swift task. The normally expected timeframe required to complete a single collection is many decades. Rusty Russell, the Collections and Informatics Program Director in the Department of Botany in the National Museum of Natural History, is amazed at the prospect that his entire collection may be digitized while he is still on the team at the Smithsonian. </p>

<p>The new method the Smithsonian Institution is employing to digitize their collections is via a conveyor belt imaging system, which accelerates the digitization process by an incredible rate. For example, the Numismatics department in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History is currently digitizing their collection of coins and currency. The traditional method would take roughly twenty years to digitize this collection of over 250,000 items. This new conveyor belt technology shrinks that down to about four months! This is no small breakthrough! </p>

<p>Just imagine being able to view the vast collection of items that remain hidden in museum storage. Less than 1 percent of the Smithsonian’s items are on display at any given time. This digitization method can allow the public to view the other ninety-nine plus percent within a few months! </p>

<p>Could this lead to saving the honeybees? There is a very real and practical benefit to rapid digitization. Virtual access to the Smithsonian’s gigantic bee collection can help researchers study and determine how to prevent the eradication of these crucial critters from our ecosystem. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:27 LauraCostello:</b>That system looks very efficient! It seems like they have a person on one side feeding the machine and on the other side re-assembling the box, so things are ready to go back into the archive immediately. Genius! </p>

<p><b>@03:08 CTerracino:</b> This is a prime example of how valuable rapid digitization is: studying this collection of bees is crucial to understanding the current global bee situation. </p>
