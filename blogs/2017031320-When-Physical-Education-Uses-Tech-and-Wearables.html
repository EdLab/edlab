<p>Educational policies and emerging technologies have left no subject untouched in the past decade, and that includes physical education. In fact, following the NCLB Act in 2001, almost half of all schools surveyed in the U.S. cut PE class time in favor of other subjects despite the fact that childhood obesity affects <a href=" https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/obesity/facts.htm">about 20% of all school aged children</a>. At the same time some schools have begun experimenting with incorporating technology into their gym classes, which will potentially change the face of physical education.</p>
 
<p>To expand the possibilities for PE, researchers in South Korea sought to develop a class that incorporated <i>exergames</i> (a combination of exercise and digital gaming) and <i>wearables</i> (such as smart watches and Fitbits) into its pedagogy. In South Korea most PE classes are conducted with worksheets or other sedentary activities rather than with exercise. By developing an exergame called Running Othello 2 and tracking students’ movements with wearables, the researchers were able to develop a program that fused the pedagogical content of PE with exercise. In it, the third grade students learned PE course material (such as health and safety information) while playing a game that demanded physical movement.</p>
 
<p>The results were promising. Not only did both students and teachers enjoy the activity, the children also moved much more than they did in normal PE classes, where course material was often valued over actual movement. In addition, the students learned more from playing the game than did the control group, who had just been given a worksheet. The exergame and wearables provided a content-rich course that still required students to exercise.</p>
 
<p>The researchers note that this program is in no way intended to replace sports in PE classes. While students should still learn to kick a ball and run a mile, this research suggests that some exercise can be integrated into regular course material, and PE could be better for it.</p>
