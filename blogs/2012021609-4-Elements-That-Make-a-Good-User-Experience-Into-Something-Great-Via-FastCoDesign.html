            <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669048/4-elements-that-make-a-good-user-experience-into-something-great"/>This article</a> is a report from the Inaugural Interaction Design awards. I thought that in light of Gary's presentation on the expansive and experimental goals of the lab that this article might be of particular interest. 

As we begin to brainstorm ideas for reaching people and moving outside of the predictable education system, I think it's going to be more and more important to be building what I think of as "bridge" tools, which live between formerly siloed worlds (Education and Criminal Justice System) are an example. It's easy enough to say that, and hard enough to do.

The Four Principles in this article are
<ul><li>Building Platforms:"[The] combination of a solid foundation built with inherent flexibility that allows users to seize something and make it their own is a key characteristic of many of the digital platforms that will flourish in the years to come."</li>

<li>Moving Beyond the Screen:"The People's Choice award went to “Interaction Cubes” by FundaÃ§Ã£o Oswaldo Cruz/Museu da Vida, from Rio de Janeiro.[...]The exhibit was part of the still-somewhat-nascent move of interaction design away from the pixel and into the physical realm. "</li>

<li>Seamlessly Integrating Data:"The real challenge for interaction designers is to figure out seamless ways to use data in ways that are genuinely meaningful."</li>

<li>Empowering the User: "“People are more exposed than ever to the numerous choices of what to do to fill their time, to feel important, to feel loved and creative,” commented juror Younghee Jung, designer at Nokia Research in Bangalore, India. For her, this means that designers have a responsibility to use their work to afford users with the feeling that they retain the sense that they are in control, not at the mercy of a design or a format. "</li></ul>
