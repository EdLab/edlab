<b>The Details and Backstory</b>
<a href="http://contently.com/">Contently</a> was founded in NYC by Joe Coleman, Shane Snow, and David Goldberg as a "marketplace for the world's best writers" and developed with the mission of creating an "anti-content-farm."  Learn more about content farms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm">here</a>.  With an initial goal of creating an open marketplace for writers and companies seeking writers, the concept later evolved to allow marketers and brands to source and manage professional writers and freelancers for editorial content and for the writers conversely, to easily manage their careers and showcase their work through the platform. Contently launched privately in beta in January 2011 and has been in open beta since April 2011.  

<b>Unique Point of Difference?</b>  
As mentioned above, Contently was founded in 2010 (co-founder Shane Snow purportedly only had $0.48 in his account) and is now poised to rake-in revenues of around 1 Million by the end of the year.  As anyone familiar with the startup lifecycle knows, that is an EXCEPTIONALLY fast acceleration to profitability.  One of the main points-of-difference for Contently that may help explain their rapid success, is that as a service platform, they provide exceptional value BOTH for the providers of a skill set and the companies seeking those skills.  What exactly is this value for Contently users?  Companies are provided a cost-effective, easy-to-use alternative to maintaining expensive in-house staff or engaging a traditional agency.  Acting as a free agent for writers, Contently helps them to effectively showcase an interactive portfolio of their work, manage their workflow and according to Snow and this <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/12/06/contently-video/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29">this Mashable article</a>, earn more money than the national average by using the site (avg. salary for a full-time schedule of work found through the site is 50-60K).   

<b>EdLab Take & Takeaway?</b>
Setting-up a platform that only rewards the seeker of a service or knowledge, in Contently's case, the company looking for a writer, you create an unbalanced reward schedule and run the risk of turning-off top-notch writers.  Contently avoids this by charging companies to find and manage writing talent, while providing a free, "empowering" platform for writers to showcase their talents and manage their careers.  The take-away is this: create a unique marketplace for ideas that rewards all parties involved.  The reward can range from data, to money to alleviation of a previously tedious task, like managing freelance scheduling or getting paid.  When you add value to something that was previously a chore, while effectively providing what each party wants from interacting with your site, you are creating both a new market and helping to ensure the success of your offering.  As we prepare to launch ResearchBroker in the coming weeks, we should consider the success of this model... provide value BOTH for the provider of a service and the service seeker.
