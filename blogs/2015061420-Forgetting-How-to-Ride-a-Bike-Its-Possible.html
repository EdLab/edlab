Destin Sandlin, an engineer with his own YouTube channel called "Smarter Every Day," walks (or, more accurately, bikes) us through the process of forgetting and relearning a skill. Destin, like so many others, first learned to ride a bicycle when he was a child. Riding was an exercise that he completed rather automatically, until he tried to backpedal (pun intended) and forget this skill that he has already mastered.</p>

<p>After months of attempting to override the technique he was taught as child, Destin discovers that it requires unrelenting concentration and practice to finally learn how to ride a backwards bike without falling. He is amazed by how quickly his young son is able to reach the same goal, and concludes that children can more efficiently and rapidly learn and unlearn abilities than adults can. Now successfully able to ride the infamous backwards bike, Destin is seized with panic when he gets on a regular bike and finds himself unable to ride it. His astonishment highlights a disconnect between comprehension and practical application.</p>

<p>How can this experiment inform educators to bridge this gap between learning something in theory and putting it into practice? Share your methods and ideas <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/22749/">on Vialogues</a>. </p> 

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>00:30 @mpowers:</b> this kind of procedural knowledge is hard to unlearn because you're not actively thinking about how you ride the bike—you just do it. </p>

<p><b>@04:04 Sappho: </b> This makes sense! It seems whats at the center of the discussion here is habits and automatism. Young children have less deeply ingrained habits (whether physical or mental) whereas adults have more. It makes sense that a young child could re-learn quicker. </p>

<p><b>@05:40 mpowers: </b> interesting that he can kind of switch between the two modes, but it's still a struggle. I wonder if he forced himself to switch every day, would he get faster at switching each time, or is there always going to be kind of a reset interval? </p>
