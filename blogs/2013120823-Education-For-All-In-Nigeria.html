            Systems Approach to Better Education Results (SABER) is used to collect and analyze policy data on education systems around the world. This system has been recently used to examine the state of Nigeria's school system. The results show Nigeria's government is not putting its resources and energy into improving the dismal state of its public schools. In the state of Ekiti, it was discovered that some schools had more teachers than it needed. Meanwhile in the state of Bauchi, only language teachers were found in schools. There was not a single subject teacher in sight. A similar problem is facing rural schools in the state of Anambra.  

The question then becomes, what kind of education are students in these three states receiving? 

According to statistics gathered by SABER, seven million children in Nigeria remain out of school. The net enrollment rates remain low at approximately 60% and 26% at the primary and secondary level, respectively. Not only that, the female disparity index is only 83.6; a survey from sub-Saharan countries also showed that Nigeria had the lowest marks for student achievement. All these are indications of major problems in Nigeria's school system. However, to help the country resolve some of these issues, the World Bank has designed a $150 million State Education Program Investment Project for Nigeria (SEPIP), with the overall object of increasing education for all. I am really glad with the work of the World Bank because their work is geared towards resolving key educational issues in many countries.
