<p>We all know how much can get lost in the communications among teachers, parents, and students. When kids are the messengers, homework can end up with an entirely new meaning. Enter <a href="https://www.remind.com/">Remind</a>, an application designed to alleviate the miscommunications that happen between school and home. Remind is a free, easy-to-use app that connects students, teachers, and parents with a platform that operates with the same simplicity as texting. It was designed to free teachers from constantly repeating assignment expectations and reminding their students of deadlines and updates. The application creates a variety of ways to communicate within the school community: opt-in chats, announcement posts, and folders that organize class information by subject in an appealing, clean format. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The creators state that the application is a safe way to channel communication between students and teachers via smartphones. Since cell phone numbers are not shown in this application, private information is secure. With an easily-accessible app that all parties can share, it is very difficult for students to have any excuse to forget, or misunderstand their homework. And as charming as the occasional creative excuse might be, teachers will agree that completed homework is always the better story. The direct communication enabled between parents and teachers can increase the odds that students are completing their homework with the most information possible. </p>

<p><b>Cons: </b></p>

<p>Phone numbers aside, the opt-in chat option may still make some parents uneasy, as it mimics the one-on-one texting that is generally avoided between teachers and students. While this feature might be necessary when it comes to out-of-school communication, it might still cause parents some anxiety. This app may be convenient, but the outside-of-school communication might be just as demanding. The point of the application is clearly to help teachers, but this after-hours avenue of chat might end up demanding more time and work for teachers off the clock. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway: </b></p>

<p>Parents can easily use the app to stay connected and up-to-date with their child’s schoolwork. Any inconsistencies or questions that students might have after leaving school for the day can be answered by checking posts or sending a message. Kids can ask their teachers questions, teachers can clarify assignments with parents, and different teams and school groups can organize and host their own page for announcements, encouragement, or homework help. </p>

<p>Assuming that all the students own a smartphone, this application is helpful in ironing out communication discrepancies between families and schools. The intuitive nature of the application makes it a convenient tool for teachers. An application that relieves teachers from extra work—and keeps students from missing the mark—is a win for everyone. </p>
