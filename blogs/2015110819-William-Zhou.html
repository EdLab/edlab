William Zhou is the CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1eXfjoD">Chalk.com</a>, an education software company focused in K-12. Zhou has been passionate about entrepreneurship since a young age and founded his first company in high school. He launched his first Internet business in 2010, which he sold at the age of 18. To pursue the bigger challenge of changing education, Zhou founded <a href="https://www.chalk.com/">Chalk.com</a> to create a productivity suite for K-12 teachers. Forbes recently named Zhou to its top 30 under 30. Today, Chalk.com is used in over 20,000 schools and is empowering teachers to focus on what matters most—their students. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
My background did not stem from teaching. In fact, I’d always thought that teaching is an easy job. I thought teachers taught from a textbook and got three months off in a year. I could not be more wrong and it was not until I revisited my own high school teachers that I realized this is not the case. Like many other educators, my own high school teachers were struggling with the overwhelming amount of work necessary to be a teacher. They were dealing with lesson planning, assessment, and attendance, in addition to fending off angry parents and the bureaucratic administration. Now, I told them I couldn’t help them with the latter two, but I was willing to see what I could do to help with their daily tasks. That’s when I started Chalk.com. </p>   

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
Data driven instruction will enable an entirely new way of teaching. Right now it’s very difficult for educators to keep track of the students who are being left behind. But with data, we can take a lot of that weight off of educators’ shoulders by determining which students are struggling with the concept, and which are excelling at it. We can keep track of the learning styles and interests of students to enable the delivery of, not just one lesson for everyone, but a couple of lessons tailored to different groups of students so that they can learn at a their own individual pace. This will enable students to retain information better and develop a stronger interest in what they’re learning. More importantly, we won’t be adding extra work to the educator’s day. Personalized education will allow students to develop their interests earlier. A teacher that knows all of the strengths and weaknesses of a student will be able to differentiate their instruction to meet each student’s needs. The beautiful thing about this is that Chalk.com is a stepping stone for this form of education. Teachers are entering this data into Chalk.com to use with their existing work flow, but with that information we’re able to help teachers with their differentiation of instruction. Chalk.com isn’t so much a tool as it is a personal assistant for every teacher. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The current education system is built for the industrial era. You may have heard of the factory model where each student is divided into their age group and information is disseminated downwards at the exact same pace. It worked for that era, but now, how do we adapt education to today’s knowledge based economy? Every school system is thinking about this problem. With personalization, we can tailor education to the needs and interests of each learner. Until recently it’s just been a question of how? But that’s all changing with technology. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> My recent talk at Digital-Life-Design 2015, a TED equivalent conference in Munich, shows the future of Chalk.com and the future of education.
