            *PRIVATE PLEASE*

On Friday, I attended Bill Hoogterp's public speaking workshop at the Columbia Engineering School. Bill, the CEO and founder of the Own the Room communication training program, led an interactive session to help participants gain confidence and improve their public speaking technique. 

Some key takeaways were:

- People become more comfortable with public speaking over time, but they don't necessarily improve their technique. 
- It is not about the presenter, it is about connecting with audience members. Speakers need to "get over themselves."
- Audience members do not often remember words or numbers. Instead, presenters must "paint pictures" and "evoke emotions."
- Speakers must also add variety to their presentation. Instead of speaking in monotone, they can vary their speed and also harness the power of the pause. 
- It also takes a conscious effort to take out filler words, such as "um," "basically," and "like," that add no value to one's presentation? (This is something I've often found myself guilty of doing.)
- Finally, presenters should "harmonize" their space when they are presenting. Don;'t be afraid to use hand gestures (within reason) and to move around when presenting. Also you should speak not directly to the audience, but to the four corners of the room. By projecting your voice to the four corners, this will ensure that all audience members can hear you loud and clear; this is how you "own the room."

Bill recently published a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Your-Perfect-Presentation-Audience-Anywhere/dp/0071825002/ref=la_B00HCZIVIO_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396895894&sr=1-1/">book</a> as well.
