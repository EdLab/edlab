            <strong>The Question</strong>

The Pressible Team has been asked why Pressible doesn't allow for more <em>Page</em>-creation options. For example, the following issues have been raised by a Pressible User (who is an author and also a site administrator):
<ul>
	<li>Information in <em>Posts</em> get buried beneath other <em>Posts</em></li>
	<li>A <em>Post</em> doesn't feel like a "landing page"</li>
	<li>A <em>Page</em> could be visible on the header, then deactivated so it was hidden.</li>
</ul>
Analysis:

The author is looking for a special way to put content on the web.

<strong>Our Answer</strong>

Questions like this one often come from Users who are familiar with WordPress in another context, without the constraints imposed by Pressible's design... And they are tough questions that touch on the core tenants of the Pressible project. Pressible sacrifices some of the flexibility of the broader WordPress-universe-of-code to offer Users a <em>site-within-a-network</em> system. As a result, each site is built on a generic template. So, is the sacrifice worth it? Let's take a look.

Quickly, here's how <em>Posts</em> and <em>Pages</em> compare in Pressible:
<ul>
	<li>If you make a <em>Page</em>, it automatically creates a "top link" (and there is no way to disable this).</li>
	<li><em>Pages</em> include a "Featured Posts" sidebar.</li>
	<li><em>Posts</em> appear on the homepage in a linear order, receding into the past (and represented by excerpts).</li>
	<li><em>Posts</em> include a "Related Posts" and "Tags" sidebar, with additional social tools and metadata about the date created and author.</li>
</ul>
Analysis:

<em>Posts</em> are designed to be the lingua franca of Pressible, and Pressible discourages the creation of <em>Pages</em>. The rationale for this is twofold: 1) Pressible is meant to be a web-friendly publishing system, not a website-authoring system, and 2) we think this makes content <em>better</em>. So, let's return to the example...

<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Page Scenario:</span> If the User makes a <em>Page</em> (in a hypothetical system that allows for it to be <em>displayed</em> or <em>not displayed</em> on the homepage), they publish all kinds of interesting information. And it's useful for a while. And the User could "feature" it in the site's navigation (hypothetically). If someone finds the <em>Page</em> years later, they'll be lucky if it's dated in some way. And it may be unclear who authored it.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">The Post Scenario:</span> If the User makes a <em>Post</em> (in the Pressible system that currently exists), it will appear on the "top of the stack" (on the homepage). When there are new <em>Posts</em>, it will start its descent into the <em>Post Pages</em> (where it appears as an excerpt). But it can be categorized as "Featured," and it will appear on the Homepage sidebar, as well as its Topic's sidebar(s), and <em>Tag</em> and <em>Topic</em> <em>Page</em> sidebars. With luck, the <em>Post</em> was also <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/16/hughes/tags-keywords">tagged</a>, and this means it may appear across the <a href="http://pressible.org/header/faq#Whatis">Pressible Network</a> in relevant places. The <em>Post</em> also carries metadata – when it was first posted and who authored it. Years from now, this may prove interesting to future readers, as it gives the information more context than <em>Pages</em> often make available.

Some key ideas:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pressible makes Posted content available in several unique ways.</strong> <em>Author, Tag,</em> and <em>Topic Pages</em> highlight posted content across a site. <em>Posts</em> are <a href="http://pressible.org/molly/elegant-excerpts">excerpted</a> in search results and <a href="http://pressible.org/molly/post-and-repost-were-walking-down-the-street"><em>Reposts</em></a>. <em>Related Posts </em>are featured on <em>Posts</em> across the Pressible Network.</li>
	<li><strong>Posting creates a narrative. </strong>A Pressible site is not a "blog" per se, but content with a context. By explicitly tying most content in the Pressible Network to authors and dates, we think we're creating a stronger network of content.</li>
	<li><strong>Just like </strong><strong>Pages</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Posts</strong><strong> have permanent URLs</strong>. Read <a href="http://development.pressible.org/hughes/cant-my-pressible-site-be-a-more-customizable-cms">this post</a> for an idea of how to organize them in a Pressible-friendly way.</li>
	<li><strong>RSS! </strong><a href="http://pressible.org/pressible/what-you-get-with-rss">'nuff said</a>.</li>
</ul>
So, while the current system is disappointing to some Pressible Users, we feel there are ways to use Pressible to achieve the desired goals. In designing it this way, we think we've made the Pressible Network <em>more</em> intuitive and easy to navigate, not less so – and better designed for the emerging "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web">social web</a>." But, as with all design choices, time will tell if this choice was a good one or not...

<em>Thanks for using Pressible! Keep the questions coming.</em>
