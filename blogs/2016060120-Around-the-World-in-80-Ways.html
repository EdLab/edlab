 <p>Marty McFly may have had a hoverboard by the year 2016, but we might be in for something even better. Sure a hoverboard could fly you over sidewalks and yards, but it couldn’t take you to the depths of the ocean or to a medieval castle under attack and desperate for your help. However, the new virtual reality product in this vialogue, HTC Vive, can take you to these places at the touch of a button.</p>

<p>With the headset on and controllers in hand, users are transported to any environment imaginable; each is 3D and allows users to interact with any of the incredible details they see. Some go to space and navigate through meteorites and space ice, and others swim alongside great blue whales. A few people take up a virtual bow and arrow and practice their archery on virtual enemies; another keeps it closer to home by making virtual bacon and eggs in a virtual kitchen. The HTC Vive can be hooked up to a TV, allowing people not wearing the headset to be included in the action.</p>

<p>It’s clear this product is incredible, and if it becomes easily accessible in the future, it could greatly impact education. Imagine a class being able to travel to the pyramids of Giza or the Great Barrier Reef together, or even dive into a human’s digestive system, all without leaving their desks. In the future, the HTC Vive could transport us to worlds inaccessible to us now, and learning could literally take on a new dimension.</p>

<p>Do you think the HTC Vive could be a tool for learning? Do you think it has a place in the future classroom? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/28827/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:07 dinosossi2:</b> I wonder about the suspension of disbelief that is necessary to engage fully in virtual reality. Due to the tendency of this reality to be different from actual reality, would it subsequently appeal more to gamers who often inhabit these non-real worlds?</p>

<p><b>@02:09 idrissa10:</b> Would one be able to see their surroundings with the HTC Vive glasses on without someone telling them that they are going to hit the wall?</p>
