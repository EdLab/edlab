          <p>
            So I've been thinking a lot lately about how an idea inspires another... then another... then another... More specifically, I'm interested in figuring out ways to <b>show</b> how ideas inspire each other, and how they evolve, over time. 

This concept seems to be discussed so often in the art world, but I rarely find direct and indisputable evidence that project#1 inspired project#2. The concept is also explored in the computer programming community, and since programming edits are so much easier to track and attribute, I think it's a good guinea pig for testing out thoughts about how ideas travel. (Ben Fry created <a href="http://benfry.com/revisionist/">Revisionist</a> back in 2003 to visualize the evolution of the Proce55ing project over 40 revisions.)

Where am I going with all this? Well, I wonder if it might be possible to take advantage of some of the built in features of online communities of creators such as <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> to do a better job of understanding how projects inspire others? These online communities let you upload your project's code, then track who downloaded it, and who revised it and re-uploaded it. With this embedded information, it seems like you could to create a new way to look at and understand how kids' creative coding projects evolve over time.

More after the break...<!--break-->

 The image below shows a simple example of what I'm talking about: The first (left-most) project code was new and original. The second (middle) project was made when someone new downloaded the first project, edited the code, then re-uploading it as a new project. The third (right-most) was similarly based on #2.

I'm thinking about creating a video/animation that steps through the iterations of change in code, matching it with transcripted conversations from the project's "comments" section and visuals of the projects themselves (usually animations).

These thoughts are just bubbling around in my head, so I apologize for not (yet) being able to clearly communicate them. But I'm interested to know whether anyone has encountered inspiring ways to visualize the ways that a project changes over time? Suggestions? Anything you'd like to see?
