<p>Dr. Sanjaya Mishra is an Education Specialist at the <a href="https://www.col.org/">Commonwealth of Learning (COL)</a> in Canada. He is involved in developing technology-enabled solutions for increasing the quality of and access to educational opportunities at all levels. Dr. Mishra’s vision is to unleash the potentials of every learner through innovative uses of educational technologies. Prior to joining COL, he was Programme Specialist at UNESCO. During his service in different capacities at the Indira Gandhi National Open University he earned a one-year Post-Graduate Diploma in eLearning. He has contributed to books, chapters, journal papers, conference presentations, book reviews, and distance learning materials.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at the Commonwealth of Learning?</b><br>
<p>My education and training in the field of knowledge organization, networking and resource sharing, distance learning, video production, and training and development have a strong influence on my current work. I worked in a large open university in India where I supported many other developing countries in offering quality distance learning through staff development. There I started offering an online program on eLearning and then moved to UNESCO to serve as its open access program specialist. This gave me an understanding of the needs of the developing world and how to provide high quality and appropriate solutions. For example, my work at COL’s regional office involved supporting learning for development in the Asian Commonwealth countries. I focused on the appropriate use of ICTs in building the capacity of communities, as well as the university sector, to create quality learning materials and release them as open educational resources. My current role focuses on supporting Commonwealth governments and institutions in the adoption of ICT in education and the adoption of OER to improve the quality of learning and strengthen livelihoods. From past experience and research, I have seen that effective implementation of ICTs requires policy, appropriate technology, and capacity building. At COL, I focus on strengthening policy and capacity of our partners and advise them to use appropriate technologies. Through our work, we create enabling conditions for developing high-quality courses that help learners progress and succeed.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at the Commonwealth of Learning will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Our work at the COL is based on both a top-down and bottom-up approach. Focusing on policy, capacity, and technology as anchors for our interventions, we work with partners to develop long-term projects that result in positive learning outcomes and impact. Our results-based management approach to educational development is helping change the learning landscape in the developing countries of the Commonwealth to focus on learner achievement and success that supports people’s livelihoods and sustainable development. My work with governments is to help build the much-needed commitment to strengthen ICT interventions, while institutional partners are developing courses and programs, using ICTs, to offer blended learning opportunities. We are working on a project called <i>Commonwealth Digital Education Leadership Training in Action</i> along with colleagues from the University of Cape Town, which aims to create new leaders who will take action to use advances in technology for lifelong learning and to influence others to take similar actions. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>There are several broad trends that have either started having an impact on learning, or are expected to have an impact on learning, in the near future. Some of these are:
<ul>
<li><i>Just-in-Time Learning</i>: As the workforce becomes more specialized, the need for just-in-time learning will grow. This is making learning on the go possible with the use of mobile and tablets, anywhere and everywhere. This means learning databases that can be queried to find answers will be a major trend. For example, today Google or YouTube are the first destinations for many to search for answers to their questions. Many specialized just-in-time learning providers can be expected to emerge in the future. </li>
<li><i>Designing Personalized Learning</i>: As learning gets unbundled as a result of technological advancement and the need for learners to learn and earn, technologies will help them choose their courses, design their curriculum, and identify educational certificate providers to earn certification that will be an aggregation of micro- and nano-credentials to suit the job market and their personal interests. </li>
<li><i>Using Open Educational Resources (OER)</i>: As the availability of openly licensed learning materials grows, their use will be key to developing programs and courses suitable to learners’ needs. Customization and personalization of OER would be the key to the sustainability of the ecosystem of digital content development.</li>
<li><i>Social Media in Learning</i>: As learning becomes unbundled, learning will happen through social media in an informal environment. People will share byte-sized learning resources on social media to enable informal learning.</li>
<li><i>Emergence of Learning Explorer</i>: As new options to learn from many agencies evolve, there will be an evolution of new groups of learning professionals who will explore possibilities for others and guide pathways to success. Some of these explorers could be bots controlled by artificial intelligence.</li> 
</ul>
</p>Some of these ideas may look naïve at present, but technological advancements can help pave the way for a better world for learning and knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>While the word coding itself has become very trendy, it is critical to not look at it in isolation. Our work focuses on computational thinking and problem solving and integrates coding as one tool to help build solutions and innovate. Digital skills have become a basic literacy.</p>

<p><b>Apart from Commonwealth of Learning, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>In one lifetime the focus should be one goal. My current engagement is primarily focused on COL work. A short part of my work is to manage COL’s <a href="http://www.jl4d.org/index.php/ejl4d">Journal of Learning for Development</a>. This is a relatively young open access journal that needs contributions on the cross sections of learning, technology, and development. I am happy to contribute time to my work and spend time with family as much as I can.</p>

<p><b>Who are some of the most interesting people you follow on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>Most of the people I follow on Twitter are from the field of OER such as <a href="https://twitter.com/CherylHW">Cheryl Hodgkinson-Williams</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mweller">Martin Weller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dendroglyph">David Porter</a>.</p>
