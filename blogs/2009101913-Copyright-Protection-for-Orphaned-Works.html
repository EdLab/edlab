            Occasionally during our academic research efforts, we come across "orphaned works," i.e. copyrighted material where it is difficult or impossible to contact the copyright holder for permission. This is particularly relevant given our use of online search tools and digitized resources. With no central database of copyright-holders, this situation can arise for many reasons including works published anonymously, the author information has been lost over time, the chain of IP ownership has become unclear or the work may have never been traditionally published at all. 

If you are interested in learning more about proposed legislation and the proper use of orphaned works, there is an event Tuesday, October 20, 2009, from 6 PM - 8 PM entitled, <i>"Lost & Found: A Practical Look at Orphan Works Legislation"</i>, co-sponsored by the Art Law Committee and the Copyright and Literary Property Committee of the New York City Bar Association, in conjunction with Columbia Law School's Kernochan Center for Law, Media and the Arts. The location of the event is the <a href="http://www.nycbar.org/">New York Bar Association</a>, 42 West 44th Street New York, NY 10036. The panel discussion will be moderated by June M. Besek, Executive Director, Columbia Law School's Kernochan Center.

<b>Issues to be discussed include:</b>
<li>How should the law treat “orphan works”?</li>
<li>What should be the obligations of potential users with respect to searching for copyright owners?</li>
<li>How should infringement claims be handled if a copyright owner emerges?</li>
<li>Do different types of copyrighted works present unique issues?</li>
<li>What roles might registries and recognition and detection technologies play?</li>

More background on the Copyright Act of 1976 and orphaned works after the jump.

<!--break-->

According to the Copyright Act of 1976, copyrighted works are protected the moment they are fixed in a tangible medium of expression, and do not need to be registered with the Copyright Office. Also, the term of copyright protection is a term of life of the author plus seventy years. In January 2006, the United States Copyright office released a <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/orphan-report.pdf">report</a> regarding orphaned works in light of technological advances in the reproduction, dissemination and storage of digital information. The recommended new legislation sets out limitations on the remedies that would be available if the user proves that they have conducted a reasonably diligent search and describes guidelines of a reasonably diligent search.

The challenge of copyright protection in this new digital age is the balance between protecting the author's incentive to create and distribute new works using advanced technology tools and thwarting misappropriation and copyright infringement.
