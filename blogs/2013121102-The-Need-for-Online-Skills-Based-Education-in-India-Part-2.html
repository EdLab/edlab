            One of the ways to resolve the issue I described in Part I could be the development of a certified online skills based curriculum in various subjects (soft-skills such as communication, attitude, presentation, etc., and hard-skills such as languages, IT services, plumbing, carpentry, etc.,). Once completed, make them readily available in multiple languages as part of the curriculum in vocational training institutions and also at public and private universities across India. The initiative is likely to be well received by the masses due to the fact that Internet usage in India is growing at over 30% every year and three-fourths of the population below the age of 35. Such a trend is indicative of the fact that the Internet could be used as a medium to deliver constructive online courses that could help the potential job seekers, particularly youth, with the skills required for gaining employment.

Sam Pitroda, the chairman of National Innovation Council and Advisor to the Indian Prime Minister on public information infrastructure and innovations, recently established a Rs. 5,000 crores ($1 billion) fund to support innovations. Mr. Pitroda is a firm believer of using technology for development to save cost and maximize reach. Additionally, NSDC has launched a star scheme to partner with organizations that offer training to unskilled labor. The beneficiaries are required to complete a very basic assessment exam at the end of the 30 days of training.
