          <p>
            This is my response to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5849">Skanda's second round post</a>

The Trivial Stuff:

I don't see that we have appreciably declined in educational attainment, or that the focus some nations have placed on excelling at these international comparisons has had any particular effect on prosperity.  I stand by my “panic” assessment.  

Yes we often lament how our educational outcomes have stagnated in the face of higher expenditures, but how much of this a failure in efficiency, and how much Baumol's disease?  Like our burgeoning medical costs, I suspect this trend is simply a natural result of our rising prosperity.  Even so, I can't disagree that we would all be better served by productive innovation in this sector.  I can only quibble on the issue of how fruitful value-added teacher evaluation will be in this regard.  In circumventing the problems of fixed labor productivity, more promising arenas for innovation include adaptive technology and remote learning.

The Important Stuff:

I am happy to concede that teacher quality is important; that it can, to some degree, be measure with Value-added models, and the incorporating some such metric would be, in the abstract, advisable.  The real question is: “will it help us to improve student performance?”  In the absence of a variety of institutional and social reforms to prepare and adjust schools around this new measure of personnel performance, I fear that it will simply muddy the waters.  

Proponents of value-added assessment always want to talk about its statistical significance, and the large effects of quality teaching as compared to “experience, certification, and post-undergrad degrees.”  But we critics of the method, as I attempted to emphasize in my original post, aren't concerned with how robust models they are, but with how they will be applied. In watching the linked presentation I'm struck by the optimistic predictions he made on the consistent year to year effects that finding better teachers through value-added analysis will have, reminiscent of this <a href="http://xkcd.com/605/">famous comic on extrapolation</a>. This optimism stems, I believe, from being unable (or unwilling) to consider the “practical constraints” that thy so glibly dismiss.  

For instance, is there really a large enough supply of excellent potential teachers who are willing to work in an environment of low-pay and no job security?  Will destroying the power of teachers unions help or hurt teacher motivation and performance?  We're going to have to greatly increase the amount of testing and student assessment we do, and often in subjects where knowledge is not particularly quantifiable.  What will the second order effects be? Many state and local governments seem particularly enthusiastic about <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-teachers-value-20100815,0,2695044.story?page=1">“naming and shaming”</a> teachers using this metric.  Can it really bear the importance that will be ascribed to it, or justify the effects it will have on individual teacher's careers as a result? I have often been told that the hard part of being an economist is learning to look beyond your basic intuitions to predict effects that will appear later on down the road.  I'd like to see some economic thinking on this issue.
