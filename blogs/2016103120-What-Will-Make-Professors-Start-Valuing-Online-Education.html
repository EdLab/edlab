<p>The number of universities that offer online courses has skyrocketed in recent years. Yet despite this, over two-thirds of universities report that faculty members do not value online education or find it legitimate. Even more alarming, while faculty opinions of online education have remained low as the field’s popularity increases, administrators’ opinions have grown significantly, with 74% now viewing online classes as equal or superior to face-to-face classroom learning.</p>
 
<p>Most studies on online education focus on students’ opinions and learning outcomes, yet this study brings another important dimension to the discussion: how online education affects the subjective meaning of teaching for professors. Specifically, this study examined what experiences shape professors’ attitudes toward online learning.</p>
 
<p>The study was conducted via interviews with 16 full-time professors at a large university. The researchers collected responses to the questions, coded them, and conducted sentiment analysis to gather information on each professor’s emotions. They found that the most important aspects in making an online course meaningful for professors were the ability to express subject matter of personal significance and to take on various social roles via the online platform.</p>
 
<p>The professors who had the most positive experience with online education were those who interacted with the platform as a medium of self-expression and were able to form connections with students in different ways. These positive reactions largely stemmed from universities that gave full reign of online courses to professors, allowing them to shape the class how they saw best. On the other hand, the professors with the most negative experiences felt restricted and limited with the online platform and could not use it to form meaningful relationships with their students. These largely stemmed from a university’s demand to use cookie-cutter online courses that professors did not shape for themselves.p>

<p>This study demonstrates that while administrators’ opinions of online education depend largely on student outcomes, faculty members incorporate their own personal experiences into their viewpoints. As only 28% of professors currently value online education, this study could be an important asset to improve faculty experiences in this growing field. When faculty experiences improve, it’s likely that online education will improve as well.</p>
