            Can you imagine what will happen if all of this year's eighth graders in New York City public schools failed the Math and Reading state exams? It will probably turn out to be one of the most controversial events in the history of public school education in our country. First and foremost, questions will be asked about the exam, whether it was arduous, complicated or whether there was even a glitch. Additionally, the quality of Math and English teachers and their respective departments will be heavily questioned. Unfortunately, such an incident recently occurred in Liberia.

According to this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23843578">article</a>, about 25,000 secondary students in Liberia failed the test for admission to the University of Liberia, one of only two public universities in the nation of close to four million people. One university official believes the reason for the embarrassing news is that students lack motivation and did not have basic understanding of English. What this essentially means is that when a new academic year begin, there will be no first-year students entering the University of Liberia. A situation has and continues to raise a lot of eyebrows. However, there are some reasons why this may not be so surprising to education officials in Liberia, who believe the decades long civil war that engulfed the nation is still and depleted most of its infrastructure is still having a terrible effect on its progress. Liberia's President, Nobel Laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf even acknowledged the current situation and lamented the state of education there as being in a “mess” and in need of major improvements.
