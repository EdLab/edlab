            <b>Maps are the new black</b>
Seriously. Crazy maps are everywhere lately and with the technological add-ons, they are more useful than ever! The newest innovation I've heard about is MOBVIS. After you take a picture on your camera phone, MOBVIS will identify the objects and then <i>hyperlink</i> them to relevant info! For example, say you're a tourist traveling in Rome.  One quick snap of the Spanish Steps will give the user info on their history, events, or nearby shops.

This technology reminds me of OCR for images.  The system has a pre-set database so when a user takes a picture, it compares this new photo to the ones it already knows and then returns the relevant info to the user.  The main obstacle that developers face is the differing conditions under which users take the pic. For example, it might be dark or cloudy light or users may move too quickly, producing a blurry image. Any of these situations would cause problems in image recognition.  Still, developers have high hopes, reporting that the system has never produced any “false positives.” In other words, if it doesn't recognize the building, it won't put an incorrect link on it.

<b>Board up your windows–tsunami season is coming “soon”</b>
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-04-06-teachers-retiring_N.htm">A recent USA Today story</a> reported on an expected retirement “tsunami” to hit the teaching world.  Experts in the field are unsure of when the wave will hit: it could be anywhere from 2 to 10 years from now.  At least 13 states have a teaching corp in which at least 51% of the teachers are 50 years old or older.  Boomer retirement means a loss in experience, sure, but it makes more room for the newbies and current “under 50” generation of teachers.  However, the article goes on to report that young teachers enter the field after college but tend to leave within five years.  Dan Domenech, executive director for the American Association of School Administrators, hopes that the stimulus package will help create more teacher training programs.  Maybe this will be the most positive tsunami ever?  Only time will tell!
