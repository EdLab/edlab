          <p>
            The different kinds of ongoing conflicts around the world have resulted in the shut down of many schools in those territories. For instance, the war in Syria, endless conflict in the Gaza strip, Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria, ethnic conflict in Central African Republic (CAR), and the occupation of Ukraine are some of the ongoing conflicts that have affected education. While children in the United States, England, France and other non-conflict zone attend school regularly; about <a href="http://www.aworldatschool.org/news/entry/30m-children-not-at-school-because-of-conflicts" target = "blank">30 million children are out of school</a>, most of them in conflict zones. Millions have been moved from their schools and homes. Additionally, some schools are attacked or occupied by military forces.
<p>
In CAR, a third of schools were struck by bullets, set on fire, or occupied by armed groups. Likewise, during the Gaza conflict, more than 100 schools were used as shelters for more than 300,000 people. In Nigeria, students and teachers have been killed and abducted in the northeast region where Boko Haram reigns. These are some of the reasons why 30 million children are not in school. Unfortunately, even teachers who are willing to help students are being killed. Due to the fact that these issues demand a long-term solution, an alternative solution is needed to prevent children from staying home.
