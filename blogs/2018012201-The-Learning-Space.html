          <p>
            Last week, I looked at how language learners at an institution in Japan used a classroom as part of their self-directed goals. Since the classroom was arbitrarily selected as a place for self-directed learning, I was interested in learning if certain elements in that space made it conducive to autonomously learn. However, the author failed to highlight specific components of the classroom that encouraged participants to learn. The students simply used the classroom as a meeting place where they could gather their ideas and learn from students with similar learning and career objectives. I came across the work of Garold Murrary, a Professor of Okayama University in Japan who has been doing a lot of work on learner autonomy and social learning spaces, among others. In his recent paper, <a href="https://sisaljournal.org/archives/jun2017/murray2/" target="_blank">Autonomy, and Complexity in Social Learning Space Management</a>, he specifically looks at the conditions of learning spaces that makes it ripe for self-directed learning.

Murray looked at L-café, a social learning space on the campus of a large national university in Japan. Though originally conceived as a space for language learners to congregate and practice their oral skills, it quickly became a hub on campus for all students to meet and learn. the space afforded Murray and his colleagues an opportunity to look at how students were using it in a learning context. The researchers found a host of learning opportunities occurring at L-café. First, they noted that it is the students who define the café as they were constantly interacting and all sorts of learning possibilities were emerging. For instance, at the L-café, there are opportunities to make new friends and engage in intercultural exchanges afforded many learning experiences such as improved vocabulary and cultural understanding. Furthermore, some students were ever present at the café that the manager invited them to serve as assistant managers. Those students, in particular, took ownership of the title and were invited to participate in the redesign of the café once the school sought to expand the space. This process allowed the students to work collaboratively on the layout and some even came to serve as experts who helped fellow students with questions or concerns about the space. This process meant “learners could help each other, learn from each other and were then able to do things for themselves.”

The redesign of L-café had a telling impact on students’ use of the space as a learning center. The increase in size, layout, and new physical elements such furniture meant that the space was indeed different from others on campus and therefore allowed students to “take risks and push personal boundaries.” Murray noted that size of the space, layout, furniture arrangement, wall decorations and components of the physical space all had an impact on learners’ interaction and perception of the learning space. They recommended that managers of learning spaces should always support learner autonomy by distributing control and promoting collaboration. In addition, they need to be open to unexpected learning opportunities that might occur through student interaction with the space and be attentive to the physical space and design features.
