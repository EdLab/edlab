<p>Matthew Battles is a maker and thinker whose work merges literary, scholarly, and artistic forms of inquiry. His writing on the cultural dimensions of science and technology appears in <i>The American Scholar</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>. At <a href="http://metalab.harvard.edu/ ">metaLAB</a>, Matthew advances an agenda of creative research exploring the dark abundance of collections in libraries and museums; technology’s impact on our experience of art, culture, and the natural world; and the conditions of culture and experience in the context of deep time. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work? </b><br>
<p>My educational trajectory has been a thing of shreds and patches: growing up in a tiny midwestern town with a singular history (it was surveyed by Abraham Lincoln, and his shade was very present to us), I split my time between the library and the river. The book of nature and the book of human memory have contested for my attention ever since. I was a mediocre student, although always enthusiastic about learning. Music and theater were terrifically important as well. I ended up at the University of Chicago, which made me helplessly tied to the model of the university as a refuge; studying anthropology there in the 90s, I turned to creative writing. After an MFA in fiction from BU, I went to work at Widener Library, and the place became a muse for me. I've split my practice into wedges: creative nonfiction and scholarly attention, art practice and literary criticism, making and thinking. The theater and music dimensions manifest now chiefly in a will to collaborate. </p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>I hope my work will awaken learners to cycles of time and domains of experience beyond those we normatively reckon: geologic time, and the long arcs of human history; the roles of nonhuman actors in our lives; and the need to compose forms of life worthy of these cycles and perspectives. </p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
<p>As for broad trends, I think the filter bubble is something learning needs acutely to contend with; <i>post-fact</i> and social-media-driven forms of knowledge need to be situated and contested. Without a working awareness of the slow violence of climate change, we're lost. </p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>My big project right now revolves around memory as a property of the world: how time manifests itself in landscapes, migratory patterns, and the forms taken by the human built environment. It will be a book and will probably have manifestations in other media as well. I also am working on a video piece that explores the status of animals in captivity, their roles, rights, and experiences, in visual and spatial terms. </p>

<p><b>How did metaLAB start? How does it help artists, students, and the overall community at Harvard and beyond?</b><br>
<p>metaLAB started as a collective of faculty, grad students, and researchers interested in intersectional work combining media, design, and the humanities. It's a project at the Berkman Klein Center, but its major support comes from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and it is housed in Harvard's Graduate School of Design. It fosters project-based creative research, chiefly in archives and museums, in visual culture, and in the environmental humanities; in all of these instances, asking how digital media, data, and networks transform the ways knowledge is produced and culture is created. We also serve as an atelier, clearing house, and refuge for graduate students interested in such questions, theoretically and practically; we involve such students in our projects, and also serve as a workshop/seminar/mentoring space for bringing their own digital media projects forward. </p>

<p><b>What is your role(s) at metaLAB? </b><br>
<p>My role at metaLAB is administrative, academic, and artistic: I'm the associate director, so I shoulder responsibility for making sure we have power and heat, and that our administrative colleagues at the Berkman Klein Center know what we need in terms of hiring, financials, event planning, and other such practicalities. I offer management and oversight of projects in our portfolio, and develop such projects out of my own research interests. I've published three books since coming to metaLAB, including the forthcoming <i>TREE</i> (Bloomsbury, March 2017), which explores trees as aesthetic objects, resources, and organisms in their own rights, with lives and meanings that extend beyond the human. This might seem like a departure from my previous work on libraries and the history of writing, but there is a connective line: much of the research for the book took place at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, which is a large collection (like a museum, or a zoo) of trees and shrubs. Making living things into collectible objects, turning them into artifacts or specimens, is part of the work a botanical garden does; and by the same token, library books, art objects, manuscripts, all the sorts of things that end up in archives, libraries, and museums, have bigger lives than the ones they take up in those institutions. I'm interested in categories, and how leaky they can be. </p>
