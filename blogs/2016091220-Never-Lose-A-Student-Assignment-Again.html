<p>Many classrooms are overflowing with multiple subject binders, notebooks, and folders. It can be overwhelming for both students and teachers to keep track of them all, which is why new edtech apps focusing on documentation and organization like <a href="https://threering.com/">Three Ring</a> are a lifesaver.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Three Ring is an app supported on iPhone and Android devices, tablets, and laptops. It was developed in concert with teachers and is meant to serve the needs and demands of the classroom. Work of nearly any kind can be captured (including MS Word documents, pictures, and videos) to create a comprehensive portfolio that supports multiple modalities of learning. Three Ring doesn’t have a storage limit, which is particularly helpful for teachers with a lot of student work to handle.</p>
 
<p>Teachers can organize and sort student work by categorizing assignments and using tags to make file search simpler, and can use the Three Ring search engine to find exactly what they’re looking for. Teachers can also add comments to the assignments to provide students with feedback, and can customize sharing settings so that students, other teachers, parents, and administrators can also view the documents if need be.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although the app itself is free in the iTunes and Android stores, schools and districts have to pay $199 per teacher per year for the unlimited storage and licensing. </p>
 
<p>Another downside is that it does not include an integrated grading feature. Although the teacher could add grades in the comments, it doesn’t factor into the platform in other ways, which means that the teacher would likely have to track grades in a different system. This could be complicated and confusing.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Three Ring is a great way to go paper-free in classrooms that have access to enough devices for students to use. It provides a fantastic option to organize mountains of student work and showcase a portfolio of their achievements to parents and other teachers.</p>
