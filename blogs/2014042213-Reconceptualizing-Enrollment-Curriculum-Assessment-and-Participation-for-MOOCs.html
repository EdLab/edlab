          <p>
            I recently reviewed a great <a href=”http://tll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/library/Changing_Course.pdf”>research paper</a> from <i>Educational Researcher</i> about learning activities in MOOCs for New Learning Times. The authors present great observations about the incompatibility between traditional educational variables and the MOOCs learning context. I think it is worth an earlier preview here on the blog as we continue conceptualizing a new learning platform and novice learning experiences online:</a

<b>Reconceptualizing Enrollment:</b> 
Unlike conventional college course registrants who meet certain preconditions (admitted college students) and express informed commitment (e.g. tuition) at course registration, registrants of MOOCs come from various backgrounds with different reasons for course enrollment. They also have various levels of commitment for coursework. Thus, the common criticism of low course completion rate in MOOCs seems to miss the target. For instance, considering only those users who attempted at least one homework problem, posted at least once in the discussion forum, and clicked on at least one video, the completion rate with a certificate rises to 48% in a 2012 MIT MOOC.

<b>Reconceptualizing Curriculum, Participation and Achievement:</b>
Analysis of student course clicking data suggests that the openness of curricular resources allowed students to customize their curriculum experiences: they interacted with course resources at different times, in different sequences and at different rates. A large number of users only clicked videos but did not do homework and show no intention for course certificate. Thus, conventional definitions of curriculum, course participation and achievement do not apply effectively and appropriately to the MOOCs context.

<b>My Takeaways:</b> 
We need different approaches to describe learning activities and trajectories in MOOCs to present its true value for open learning (for instance, giving badges to auditors, shoppers, or dabblers). Both learner self-identified data (e.g. from pre-course survey) and clicking or log data in the system would be helpful to present new understandings about learning in MOOCs. These understandings would be helpful to design more customized curriculum paths for learners with different intentions and prior knowledge as they take MOOCs.
Furthermore, spending time with these learning materials does not necessary mean that users gain new knowledge or skills (e.g. an auditor might watch all videos but still struggle with major course concepts). Designing various assessment and achievement paths would contribute to a better description of learning results in MOOCs.
