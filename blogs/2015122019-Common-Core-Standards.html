<p>You know your new educational standards have struck a nerve when Louis C.K. mentions them in his stand up comedy act. <p><a href="https://www.masteryconnect.com/goodies.html">Common Core Standards</a> is a free app from the makers of the Common Core for students, parents, teachers, and other educational stakeholders who need to read and understand the new federal standards for K-12 education. </p>
 
<p>Common Core Standards allows users to find this vital academic information by grade, subject, and category (e.g., domain/cluster). The app has been expanded from Mathematics and English Language Arts to include History/Social Studies as well as Science and Technical Subjects. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Common Core Standards is comprehensive. The app provides coverage for any single specific standard, or sub-standard, you can think of with respect to the Common Core across its constituent subject matter at any level from K to 12. </p>

<p>Common Core Standards is robust in its functionality. To make this abundance of content navigable, the app is orderly in its layout, using alphanumerical sequencing of content (e.g., ordered by letter and number). Content can be scanned quickly, taking advantage of the inherent logic of Common Core. </p>

<p>Common Core Standards could prove to be useful for parents who want to support their child but are not well-versed in the finer points of these new standards. For example, this app could be a handy companion for parents on-the-go, rushing to a parent-teacher conference, who want to have informed questions about their child’s education. Administrators, teachers, and support staff could also use the app as a quick reference for discussion regarding curricular matters. Finally, the app could be tremendously helpful for teachers as a quick way to pull up standards to align them with their lesson planning. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> Common Core Standards is spartan in its appearance. The app is almost entirely text. Basically, if you digitized the original text of the Standards and put this text on a mobile device, you would have this Common Core Standards app. There are no multimedia elements—video, animation and audio are absent. Also, owing to its intense focus on the Common Core, if you are interested in anything educational other than the bare bones Standards, they are not included. You get what the app was designed to give you. No additional frills. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Common Core Standards does exactly what you would expect it to do—provide a straight-forward way to explore the new federal educational Standards. It allows users to learn about these Standards, across subject area and level, in the palm of their hands. If you are a parent going to a parent-teacher conference, an educator who needs to stay on top of the latest curricular developments, or just someone with questions about the Common Core Standards, you can’t go wrong with this app. However, if you are looking for anything other than a text-based rendition of these Standards, you are out of luck. </p>
