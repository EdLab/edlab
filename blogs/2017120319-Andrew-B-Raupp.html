Andrew B. Raupp is the Executive Director of <a href="https://www.stem.org/">STEM.org</a>. Raupp has facilitated STEM opportunities for over 142,500 disconnected youth from public, private, and charter schools in over 27 countries.The organization was most recently awarded both the MichBusiness Excellence In Education Award and was named 101 Brightest & Best Companies To Work For. Raupp has been recognized as one of Oakland County's 40 Under 40 Elite and selected as an Emerging Leader by the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at STEM.org?</b><br>
<p>All of my previous positions, as well as my academic preparation, have influenced my current work as the Executive Director of STEM.org. I grew up as a native of Southwest Detroit, and it was that very community where I returned as a young adult and found an opportunity to give back by connecting at-risk youth to community field trips and hands-on learning projects. Those initial efforts have now grown into STEM.org, an international micro-credentialing organization devoted to helping teachers and students "do STEM better." Since founding STEM.org in 2001, I have subsequently been able to share my passion and knowledge on a wide variety of subjects with others through my advocacy efforts at STEM.org. In addition to my work at STEM.org, I also co-founded the Michigan Virtual Education Association (MIVEA) and led over 650 administrators and educators from 2012 to 2015. I’ve also worked as a guest STEM instructor at the Henry Ford Early College of Excellence, providing high level STEM instruction to Michigan high school students. A current 2017-2018 Fellow at Michigan State University’s Education Policy Fellowship Program, I have also served as a 2013 Fellow in the Emerging Leaders program at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.</p>
 
<p><b>What has been the response from individuals and organizations who have worked with STEM.org?</b><br>
<p>The educators and administrators we work with across the globe have offered positive feedback and cite STEM.org’s programs as a major tool in helping to develop and improve their educational offerings in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and for schools where we offer STEAM programs, the arts as well. We’ve certified over 13,000 individuals and over 4,600 programs to date. Recent comments from educators focus on the ease with which they were able to implement STEM activities in their classroom, and the impact that their certification had on their students. We’ve been pleased to establish ourselves as a trusted, professional source for strengthening pedagogy and classroom tools for teachers as well as educational leaders in countries around the world.</p>
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>As our economy continues to shift toward incorporating both automation and artificial intelligence (AI), it’s imperative that students are prepared for the demands of a modern, and increasingly tech-centric workplace. This means giving students the skills they need to think critically and approach systems-based problems with confidence. It also means working to prepare students for jobs that actually don’t exist yet. At STEM.org, we’re also interested to see how technology designed to integrate with our own brains continues to influence both the job market and the educational landscape. We’re curious to see the ways in which AI can support learning by helping educators and cognitive scientists to better understand the neurobiology that drives thinking and learning. If we play our cards right, humans will be able to leverage the benefits of technology and expand our capacity; in other words, we won’t be "replaced by robots" if we learn to leverage and manage AI tools and systems, rather, we will be able to use these tools to solve problems and expand opportunities.</p>
<p><b>In addition to STEM.org, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>First and foremost, I’m a proud father and husband, which continues to bring a tremendous amount of joy to my life. In addition, I am a Fellow at the Institute for Educational Leadership, a program designed to help leaders grow their leadership and policy making skills on a national level. I also serve on many boards in the Greater Detroit area, including <a href="https://www.artsandscraps.org/">Arts & Scraps Detroit</a>. This is an incredible non-profit program that provides arts and education programming to low income youth by transforming recycled industrial materials into dynamic, hands-on projects.</p>
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you follow on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I would say that one of the most interesting people I follow is <a href="https://twitter.com/dgaytandzhieva?lang=en">Dilyana Gaytandzhiev</a>. She is a courageous journalist with a captivating story, and has shown great clarity and fortitude in her reporting of international events. Some other "must follows" are Detroit educational leader <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_Vitti">Dr. Nikolai Vitti</a>, tech consultant and speaker <a href="https://twitter.com/ClassTechTips">Dr. Monica Burns</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/RaquelGarciaAnd">Raquel Garcia Andersen</a> of Global Detroit.</p>
