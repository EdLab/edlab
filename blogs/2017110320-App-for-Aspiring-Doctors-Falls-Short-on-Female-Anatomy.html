<p><a href="https://3d4medical.com/apps/complete-anatomy">Complete Anatomy</a> is an educational app created by <a href="https://3d4medical.com">3D4Medical</a> designed to supplement medical and anatomy classes, or simply curiosity about the human body. It is a comprehensive look at the different systems of the body as well as many exciting and compelling tools. A new 2018 update brought even more interesting features to the app, such as augmented reality.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Complete Anatomy offers a variety of tools to study and explore the human body. The app lets you isolate different body parts and anatomical systems, then layer them any way you wish to view them in conjunction with each other. For instance, you can view just the skeletal system, or the skeletal, nervous and lymphatic systems. The app contains 12 different systems that users can also manipulate by adding growths and spurs, or by fracturing bones and cutting muscles. A new feature on the app’s latest update is augmented reality, which you can use to overlay parts of the body on your environment.</p>
 
<p>The note taking features on Complete Anatomy are comprehensive and enable medical students to annotate anatomical images with text, images, and tags. The app also contains a wide range of pre-made quizzes to help you keep track of body part names, as well as recorded lectures by professionals, although most of these require an in-app purchase.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Complete Anatomy has undergone a major renovation with the 2018 update, there are still some features that are sorely lacking. The most prominent piece missing is the female body. Currently, users can only study anatomy on a male body. However, Complete Anatomy says it <a href="https://3d4medical.com/category/support/complete-anatomy/faq">plans to release a female model</a> within 2017. Also, some of the quizzes are outdated or don’t load properly, rendering this feature of the app less than reliable.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Complete Anatomy is an app sure to bolster anatomical and medical learning. It has a sleek interface and is incredibly informative. I hope the app follows through on bringing the female anatomy to its platform because in 2017 when almost 50% of medical students are female, you would expect nothing less. Until then, it still provides a solid foundation for all explorers and memorizers of the body’s anatomical systems.</p>
