<p>Humans do not simply look at individual characteristics of faces to recognize a person; instead, we rely on an integrated totality of features for recollection. Researchers have long understood this human characteristic of vision, but it has been less clear how other animals process facial impressions, especially in cross-species recall. A team of researchers has tested how sheep recognize human faces through a test using celebrities such as Barack Obama and Emma Watson. </p>  

<p>The sheep were first trained to recognize the celebrities. Next, they needed to choose the correct face flashed on a screen in order to get a tasty reward. Researchers found that sheep were able to pass the test with around 80% accuracy and have facial recognition patterns remarkably similar to those of humans.</p>  

<p>To show that the sheep were not simply memorizing the images, the team used other images of the celebrities at different angles. The sheep still passed the test with only a slight drop in accuracy, but a drop similar to humans in the same kinds of tests. The results prove that sheep have advanced facial recognition capabilities that were previously thought to be found only in humans and other primates.</p>

<p>This kind of research builds both empathy and knowledge of the natural world. Does knowing that sheep have visual recall similar to humans change the way you think about these animals? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41391">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:47 Melanie Hering:</b> I think this particular discovery could have an impact on research regarding how different animals, including humans, utilize memory for different purposes. I'd be interested in how effective sheep are at recognizing other sheep, and how effective humans are at recognizing different sheep. </p>

<p><b>@01:49 RuthS:</b> I wonder if this research and other similar studies to follow will convince more people to become vegetarian. The more we learn about animal brains being similar to ours, the less inclined we will likely be to eat them.</p>
