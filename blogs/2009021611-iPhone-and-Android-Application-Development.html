            Session - 4

1) Clear about the project proposal
2) Elevator Pitch for the project.
3) Check for the additional material on the topic of interest.
4) Give enough motivation to have it on Mobiles.
5) Assumptions: Find out the assumptions whether they make it  
    a) iPhone can be used to replace the credit cards and can be scanned for   
         paying. 
    b) Timeline - work a prototype by Spring Break.
    c) 40 projects for the class - 2 classes at the end of the semester for the  
         project.
    d) Final Report - last day of the class (20 pages of good stuff). what is the 
         project, assumptions, design, system architecture, components, protocols,     
         UI design , Flow from one screen to another, usage model, idea of    
         performance, tuning and where do you run this application on emulator or 
         actual device.
         <b>The GOAL</b>: code of the project that is useful use it, mention the   
        citation in  the project report (bibliography) for code samples, advice,    
        references.
    e) 

Project Criteria
