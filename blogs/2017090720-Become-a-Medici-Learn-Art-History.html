<p>Dive into the Italian Renaissance and explore the era’s rich art history with the new educational computer game <a href="https://triseum.com/art-history/arte/mecenas/">Arte Mecenas</a>. Players adopt the role of a Medici banker, balancing their relationships with the church, other cities, and artists, all while learning about actual historical and artistic events.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Arte Mecenas teaches players about famous artistic pieces by placing them in an interactive situation within the historical setting of 15th century Florence. As a member of the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/medici-family">Medici family</a> (a powerful Italian family infamous for their art dealings), players progress in the game by making strategic choices concerning money, church and state relations, and artistic movements. As such, the learning objectives reside in the relationships between renaissance art, history, and socioeconomic realities.</p>
 
<p>Many of the choices presented to the player revolve around artists of the time. For instance, at one point I had to decide whether to support either Brunelleschi or Ghiberti to create doors for the Baptistery of St. John. Although I chose Brunelleschi (having very limited art history knowledge), I quickly learned that Ghiberti had constructed these doors, now known as the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gates-of-Paradise-by-Ghiberti">Gates of Paradise</a>. Giving the player power over such tactical decisions makes the learning experience richer and more salient than the predictability of parsing through content. This is particularly true when tasked with different kinds of decisions, so that players understand the intricate connections between power relations and art during this time period.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While I think the game solidly achieves its learning objectives, the gameplay itself involves just a few actions. The questions themselves are informative and help create a context much richer than the scenery itself, yet the repetitive actions might not hold players’ attention for long. I think player engagement could be improved if more details on the collected pieces of art were presented throughout the game. Currently, the game lists only a few facts for each piece (including title and artist), but as an outsider to art history, I wanted a more comprehensive slate of information for the pieces I collected. For this reason, the game would be best as a complement to a class rather than a standalone educational activity.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>I not only thought that Arte Mecenas was engaging, but I also genuinely learned about art history while playing it. Before entering the game’s first level, I never knew about <a href="http://www.duarte.com/blog/great-moments-in-presentation-history-the-architect-and-the-egg/">Brunelleschi’s egg story</a> or that an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-XXIII">antipope</a> ever existed. The repetitive gameplay might not hold a player’s attention indefinitely, but its strategic content would be a fantastic complement to Italian Renaissance art history classes. This is particularly true because the creators of Arte Mecenas provide class implementation strategies, syllabus guides, and research demonstrating the positive learning outcomes students have had with this game. The thoughtfulness of this package is sure to please any teacher seeking new ways to engage students with a standard curriculum.</p>
