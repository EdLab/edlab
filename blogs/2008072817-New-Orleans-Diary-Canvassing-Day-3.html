            Day three of canvassing was the most depressing and also most uplifting at the same time. Dropped off in one of the worst hit areas of the Lower Ninth Ward, the first house me and my partner India visited was a renovated house in the midst of mostly demolished houses. We were greeted by a 40-something African American man who lives in Houston but was in New Orleans helping to renovate the house for his elderly mother who refuses to leave New Orleans. He talked openly about his frustration with the lack of support for Katrina victims by the corrupt government of Louisiana. The lack of conveniences such as supermarkets was also a contributing factor in his decision to move to Houston. Next, we saw an elderly man sitting in front of his still refurnishing house. He seemed to have a hard time hearing what we were trying to tell him, and it was then that we noticed he had a hearing problem. The communication problem persisted even after he reached for his hearing aid. When he was able to communicate, he informed us that his FEMA check finally came in after years because his son had been stealing the checks. He was hoping the checks will help him finish the renovations to his house. As we walked the long deserted road to North Clairbone road, we encountered three 50-something men. They were all lifelong residents of the Big Easy. Katrina had forced them to neighboring states but the lure of home brought them back. The most interesting of the men was Rickey Hawkins, a 52-year Vietnam War veteran who was a mix of Irish, Native American and Puerto Rican. A father to three lovely daughters and a grandfather to 13 children, Rickey had lived through every known hurricane to have hit the Gulf Coast in the past 50 years. He didn't speak much about the problems in the community but rather his interest in my digital camera and how he wants someone to make a documentary about his life so he can make that person a millionaire. Clearly homeless and living in destitute, he spends the bulk of his days in front of an abandoned building playing cards with his friends or sitting under a palm tree in the middle of the two way street directly across from the abandoned house. <p>

Rickey was the last person we encountered for almost a mile until we knocked on a house at the very end of the long deserted street. We noticed the person living there had a disability due to the sign on their parked car. A 62-year-old African American man, Butch, answered the door and immediately invited us to join him and his wife. His home was equipped with a large flat screen television, musical instruments and adorned with pictures of his family. He talked candidly about his life prior to Katrina: he owned a thriving restaurant, and vacationed to every corner of the United States with his five children. Katrina had destroyed his business and forced him to live in Tennessee for some time before he returned to start over. As the only residents in the entire neighborhood, Butch mentioned a few brushes with armed robbers in his home, including one in which he almost killed the robber with a shotgun that is visibly placed in his living room. The lack of neighbors and companionship, as his children are all adults, was his major grievance with Katrina's effects. A pious man and avid singer, he sang us a few hymns while his wife played the piano. He gave us a tour of his house, which included a large backyard and an attic. The entertaining hour with Butch was our last of the day as it was time for us to return to Camp Hope. As the rest of the five person canvass team met up to wait for our famous blue bus, I looked straight down the long desolate road to imagine the kind of community it must have been before Katrina's wrath.
