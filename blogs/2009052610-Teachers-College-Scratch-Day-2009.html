          <p>
            On Saturday May 16, 2009, I had the pleasure of being involved with and documenting a video game design event at Teachers College called Scratch Day.  Children and teens from across New York City traveled to TC to attend workshops and design their own video games using Scratch.  As Eric Rosenbaum of Lifelong Kindergarten at MIT explained during a recent seminar, Scratch promotes the teaching of programming concepts in a visually stimulating and dynamic environment.

My documentation of the workshops and student experiences will be featured in a future vlog about Scratch Day and the Scratch program.  However, during this particular day, I was very discreetly asked by Greg Hallman if I couldn't come up with a quick edit of the experiences of the day to show at the concluding presentation.   Faced with the daunting challenge of both documenting and producing a quick edit within the course of an afternoon, I decided to make the challenge a bit more manageable by concentrating on the kids' personal projects, experiences, and thoughts. It has been my experience that children usually get a huge kick out of seeing themselves and their friends on camera, so I figured any production that I came up could be guaranteed to be at least mildly entertaining just as long as the focus was on the kids, not necessarily the program itself.

After gathering a bit of footage, many soundbites, and a fun song entitled "So 80's Long", I came up with the following quick edit within two hours, just in time to show at the end-of-the-day presentation.   The kids seemed to think this was hilarious, and I even had a couple ask me for copies of the DVD at the end of the day.

So, while a quickly-edited project is not always ideal, I believe in some cases it can be used to add a bit more of fun to any project or presentation in more informal situations.
