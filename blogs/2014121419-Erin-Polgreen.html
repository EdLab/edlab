Erin Polgreen is the cofounder of <a href="http://bit.ly/1z3BwaZ">Symbolia</a>, a magazine that merges graphic novels and journalism. She previously served as interim director of the Media Consortium, where among other things, she oversaw strategic development and editorial collaborations. Polgreen is the co-author of the book, <i><a href= "http://bit.ly/1BlGbY3">Engaging Audiences: Measuring Interactions, Engagement and Conversions</a></i>, which focused on how digital-first news organizations are measuring and struggling to measure audience participation and the overall impact of their work. Polgreen has produced work for numerous outlets such as American Public Media and Tumblr’s Storyboard.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
I can't remember a point in my life that didn't revolve around comic books or journalism. I was a kid reporter for a local children's radio station in Minnesota and my first job was in a comic book store. 
<p>
In terms of my actual education, two things stuck the most: The practical education I got from working on my high school and college newspapers, and the harder-to-define skills that come from a broad liberal arts education, like critical inquiry. I chose not to major in journalism based on the advice of my all-time favorite professor and advisor, Melinda Rhodes. She told me that journalism was a skill, and I could get that down through real life practice. She was right. I do wish that I'd focused more on technical development capacity while I was in school, but it's never too late to take a tutorial. 
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
First and foremost, I am not a professional educator. My goal is to create content that is journalistic in intent, but not to teach. 
<p>
That said, comics have amazing applications in academic environments. Symbolia's work is used in classrooms around the world, which is something I'm very proud of. This format engages multiple senses, making it possible for students to retain more and do it faster. It is also great for low-literacy students or people who speak English as a second language.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
We'll see more content for interactive and digital devices as well as a rise in skills-based learning. I hope to see an increased focus in civic literacy and design thinking in the classroom. We need to empower tomorrow's makers and doers to work within their communities to make a difference. 
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
I'm currently writing about innovation in journalism for the Columbia Journalism Review on top of running Symbolia as Editor and Publisher. We're working on a few interesting projects for 2015, but nothing I can share yet! Just keep your eyes peeled. 
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
<a href="http://bit.ly/1vnCGZ2">Caroline O’Donovan</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1w5BmRl">Glenn Fleishman</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1Ia2Kkv">Noah Berlatsky</a>
