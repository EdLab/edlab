<b>Title:</b> E-Learning Personalization Based on Hybrid Recommendation Strategy and Learning Style Identification
(2011)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Aleksandra Klašnja-Milicevic, Boban Vesin, Mirjana Ivanovic, & Zoran Budimac</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131510003222"><i>E-Learning Personalization Based on Hybrid Recommendation Strategy and Learning Style Identification</i></a> tests an adaptive recommendation module for a programming education tutoring system. The module, called Protus (PRogramming TUtoring System), recognizes learners’ habits and interests to generate personalized learning content based on their individual learning style. Recommendation systems are common in e-commerce, advertising, and social networking and the authors sought to test if the same technology that tracks behavior for targeted product placement could also target users for particular learning modules.</p>

<p>The system grouped students by learning styles based on the <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/LS-1988.pdf">Felder-Silverman Learning Styles Model</a>. This model categorizes students into four learning groups:
<ul><br><li>Information Processing: Active or reflective learners, work well in groups and also alone<br></li>
<li>Information Perception: Sensing or intuitive learners, have patience with details and are more interested in overviews</li>
<br><li>Information Reception: Visual or verbal learners, prefer text, pictures, or diagrams</li>
<br><li>Information Understanding: Sequential or global learners, prefer to process information sequentially or get the big picture first</li></ul>
<p>
The authors studied the behavior of 440 Serbian undergraduate students in the system and used collaborative filtering to rank the participants based on sequences mined by the AprioriAll algorithm. The students were presented with adaptive recommendations based on their learning style group. A control group experienced the modules without the recommendation system in place and all users filled out a psychological questionnaire and were evaluated on performance in the models.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results show that the students who received recommendations continuously completed more lessons successfully and it took them less time to complete the lessons. The questionnaire also revealed that of the group that experienced the recommendation system, 60-70% were satisfied and found the recommendations appropriate and convenient.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> We are living in an increasingly personal digital world filled with the recommendation systems employed by our most frequent web destinations. Unfortunately, most learning has remained generic despite these advances in technology. While it is challenging to combine personalized knowledge level and behavior patterns, this work showed some promising improvements in learning effectiveness and efficiency. Future research is necessary to develop more innovative and effective learning recommendation systems, but we are on the way to a more efficient and personal method of online learning.
