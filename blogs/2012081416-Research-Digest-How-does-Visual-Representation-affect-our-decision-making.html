<b>Summary:</b>
Visual representation involves the selection, transformation, and presentation of data (including spatial, abstract, physical, or textual) in a visual form that facilitates exploration and understanding. There are tons of existing tools and techniques used to abstract the data into values and convert the values into visual cues. They could be charts or graphs with variations of colors, shapes, and motions; for recognizing patterns or to identifying  outliers, to make certain information more salient and other information less salient, and show detailed information on specific alternatives or provide a context for evaluating focal information. However, there's too little systematic analysis of the implications of these visualization tools for decision making. This paper presents a framework of how visual representations are likely to affect the decision processes, particularly those that involve the analysis or synthesis of substantial amounts of data. The authors identify 2 aspects of visual representations that are likely to affect the visual decoding process. 

(1) <b>Visual Perspective</b>: includes <i>interactivity</i> and <i>depth of field</i>. It changes the relationship between visual information and the decision maker. The interactivity enables the users the ability to change perspective, for example, by rotating or simulating movement around an image. The depth of field is giving the choices to zoom-in or zoom-out to see different levels of details on the data.

(2) <b>Information Context</b>: includes <i>vividness</i>, <i>evaluability</i>, and <i>framing</i>. it provides the ability to manipulate information and see both details and overview information, the information context affects which information the decision maker attends to. Vividness, says the vivid visual information is likely to be acquired and processed before the others. i.e. bold fonts, contrast colors, sizes and shapes etc. Evaluability refers the easiness of information being assessed and compared. The comparability enables simultaneous viewing of multiple attributes can lead to more compensatory decision making. Framing, by changing the reference point against which data are compared to. It could result in a total different decision making. 

<b>EdLab relevance:</b>
1.	These two aspects are useful for us as indicators to choose what kind of visual representations we'd like to adopt in the db design and the front end in all the <i>big data</i> related projects (data dashboard, data backpack). In AI perspective, personalized learning requires to present a student model in a reasonable format. And it will be easier to be interpreted in visual forms. In broader sense of education and longer term of the project scope, Learning Analytics rely not only on the data aggregation techniques in the backend, but also very much on the visual representations in the front end. So obviously for different education stakeholders, the goals of “viewing” the data are different. These should be prioritized and be adapted. 
2.	The adaptive visual representation is a less explored domain; particularly adaptive visual infographics is nearly none. We really could capitalize this in the EdTech community review project. So the visual representations framework could be used as the rubrics when we adapt to the ed apps users & reviewers. 

Side note: 
This paper provides very good literature review on visualization representation â˜º
