            User Inteface Design
----------------------
4 major things to iPhone Application

1) Foundation - 
Multi touch - 44px x 44px (Mouse precision was predefined, finger precision is variable, Scroll bars become transient, drop downs are no longer scalable,.

Direct Manipulation (New interaction Metaphors)
- Tapping for immediate action
- Sequential taps
- Dragging objects to destinations (everybody accepts)
- Abstraction increases stress

Tactile Design (new visual styles)
- Rounded corners for buttons
- Linear grading or tactile shining is a button
- for toolbar we use glossy effects to navigational bar.

  
2) Product Definition - Develop core concepts and directions

iPhone Development Cycle - half of the product cycle is to be given to design. Design has intentional way of designing the screen. The goal should be to design a solution rather than to create a collection. 

Application Definition Statement
a) Your Differentiation 
  - Visually appealing and robust.
b) Your Solution 
  - The problem to be Solved 
   - Organizing
  - Editing
  - Sharing
c) Your Audience 
   - Firemen 
   
Application Definition Statement - Easy to use digital photo editing, organizing, and sharing for casual and amateur photographers

Solution - Easy to use digital photo sharing for casual photographers.

Filter out features:
    - Pick the few features most frequently used, by the majority of the users for most of the times.

Photos
----------
Simply photos
 - select from a list
 - browse a grid
 - Swipe the photo

3) Design and Prototype - Rapid problem solving on paper
  "You must understand the rules before you can break them" 
  - iPhone Human Interface Guidelines. It contains wealth of information for the why the things they are. - Table Views, etc (read it sequentially).
 <b>  Understanding the basics:-</b>
  <ul>
  <li> Multi - touch input 
          1) Stock keyboard, custom controls.
          2) Ability to hid keyboard when desired.
          3) Minimize the amount text entry by user.
          4) Offer Potential Choices
          5) Remember Everything entered. - Learning last choices
          6) Mirror Object hierarchy - Title reflects location
          7) Enable Standard Navigation among views(Enough of a tell as to what the previous screen like Media for the Back button).
          8) Home button is very destructive to move back one level it would take them to the home button, put it anywhere never keep it on the top part of the screen.
          9) Navigational Bar - use standard location for it and standard button to add.
           10) Provide controls that filter views
  <li> Lists
          1) Plain Table Views
               - Unconstrained data sets
               - Categorization
              - Quick Navigation
           2) Grouped Table Views
              - Constrained Data Sets
              - Grouping of like items
               - Graphically rich
             (shades and color are first interpreted first in human mind).
               - Category icons for the category (huge buff for productivity and ease)
            3) Use the Disclosure indicator
               - Flat Arrow with a row
            4) Use the advanced disclosure button
              - White arrow with a blue circle
      <li> Pickers
            1) For multivalues
             2) For entering less items.
     <li> Tool bars
   - Directly affect the current screen
  - Contain frequently used controls.
   <li> Tab bars 
 - Manage Complexity
 - Increased Efficiency
 - Switch between modes and collections
 - Mostly permanent
   Note: Ordering - Freshness vs. frequency of use.
<li> Aesthetics
     - Prioritize items most frequently used
     - Use standard, built in controls
      - avoid unneeded customization
     - Keep it clean 
         #Colors
         #Alignment
         #Spacing
 </ul>

Application Styles
  - a grid on which it should be put to figure out whether the application is a fun or a serious app, etc.

   Fun tool 
    - Fun to use and useful 
    - Some graphically rich useful elements 
 
Fun entertainment 
 - Pure entertainment (a story)
 - Interaction driven
 - Rarely hierarchical

Serious Entertainment 
 - No Productivity
  - Parse and download videos
- Data - driven
 - educational entertainment
 
Not any of the categories then Utilities group of app
- Graphically rich
 - Single screen
 - Discrete functionality
 - Narrow in Scope 
 - gone in 60 seconds like food apps, weather
  
Paper Prototyping 
 - Preliminary sketches
 - Sketch every screen
 - Sketch every interaction
 - Go through the flow on paper
 - Prototype the interface with rectangles and text inside them.

4) Polish and Refine - Appliation Differentiation through details.
