<p>Research has shown that learners who participate more in online classes generally do better in them. Little attention has been paid, however, to the factors that predict a student’s level of online participation, particularly in adult education. A new study examined the most significant predictors for participation in online adult education courses.</p>

<p>The researchers found several significant socio-demographic predictors beyond the control of the instructor. For example, students who participated more in class were more likely to be employed while studying, hold lower degrees, and be female.</p>

<p>There were other significant factors, however, that the instructor of an online course can control. Students were more likely to participate in class if they believed that using the online system would benefit their job performance. In addition, students participated more when they felt a sense of belonging in the group and when the instructor established norms of reciprocity among learners.</p>

<p>In light of these findings, the researchers suggested tactics for instructors in online adult education courses to improve student participation and learning. First, they recommend that teachers explicitly communicate how interacting with peers can result in better learning outcomes; this will enhance the  perceived learning benefits of the course. In addition, they suggest that teachers foster a sense of belonging in class. This may involve providing more equal chances of participation and establishing group goals at the beginning of each class. Finally, the researchers suggest that teachers establish norms of reciprocity in their classes. This could entail giving students specific tasks based on their individual strengths and previous educational attainment. In this way, students can benefit from the experiences of others and collaborate to share ideas.</p>

<p>This study has clear implications for online adult education courses. It details what factors predict more student participation and suggests methods to improve social interaction in online courses. Although there is no way to control for some of the socio-demographic predictors, a supportive classroom environment that promotes learning outcomes and reciprocity will likely lead to more engaged and successful students.</p>
