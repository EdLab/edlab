            Just as a small intro, Suli Breaks is a spoken word artist that holds a law degree from the University of Sheffield.  He has been called "controversial" by a large group of people, and has multiple videos that address different issues in education.  However, this was one video that struck me as important because I found that it was one of the most relatable.

All of us that have attended any form of school, whether it be elementary, high school, or a higher institution, have experienced some sort of examination.  This examination was administered through the teacher, and was given to strictly asses how the students were doing in the classroom.  Doing well on an exam and diligently doing homework translated into receiving a good grade in the class.  On the flip side, students that did not receive good grades on the exams would be hard pressed to receive a good grade in the same class.

Suli Breaks' spoken word addresses the issue that exam results do not perfectly translate into the qualification of a person.  He asks us, as listeners, to recall a time when we remembered the answer to a test right after time is called. "Does that mean remembering 5 minutes earlier would've made you more qualified for a particular job? Well on an application form it would've."  Although his viewpoints on education may be controversial, I agree with the simple statement that exams do not portray the entire package that a student has to offer. 

Do you agree with what he is saying? Discuss in the comments below.
