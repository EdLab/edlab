            <h3> Ning Session </h3>

    * What is Ning
          o Tools are ever-changing and we have to be willing to adapt to and adopt to new tools that are constantly emerging.
          o You create a group and your identity changes to apply to the group that you are in. You create a social group that is specifically tailored to a particular use and manage it as you like. Your identity and preferences can then also be tailored to each different group.
          o The privacy and enforcement issue comes up again - specific Ning policies discussed about removing offensive content and what age groups it is targeted to.
    * So What?
          o Teacher and administrator create public Ning group where students sign up and then the group is made private so that approval doesn't need to be made for each individual student.
          o "We the People" Ning Group -- people join as if they're individuals in history and play that role. 
                + Front page is public, but the rest of the page is private. 
          o Opening up work to a larger audience outside of class - authenticity of assignments and motivation for working on those assignments.
          o Distinction between different age groups: older students who were on Facebook found it as a way of "workifying" their social networking; younger students saw it as an entry opportunity in to something they were not allowed/didn't have an opportunity to participate in.
          o Personalize your own page and then control what you put in to individual Nings.
          o Evaluation? How do you evaluate kids who are doing multiple forms of things (blogging, posting videos, etc.).
                + Activity page helps keep track of who is doing what.
    * Discussion and Information forums about Ning and Ning-related technologies.
          o Ning in Education
          o Classroom 2.0 -- big community of educators interested in creating/applying technology for classroom. 
          o 21CTools -- tutorials on creating Nings and using them.
