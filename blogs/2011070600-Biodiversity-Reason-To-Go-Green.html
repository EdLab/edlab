            Biodiversity is the variety of species that makes up the genetic and natural communities around the earth. This includes all of the native plants and animals that sustain life on Earth Including humans. Biodiversity goes far as many groups of organisms, such as insects, fungi, and algae, which very little is known about them. Biodiversity play a big part in the ecosystem.Biodiversity brings a lot of benefits to mankind from direct harvesting of plants and animals for food, medicine, fuel, construction materials, and other uses to support life in order to survival. Benefits to ecosystems include climate and water regulation; the creation and protection of soils, helping to reduce floods and soil erosion, shoreline protection, and providing natural controls of agricultural. The natural world is not the just the collection of magnificent and wonderful species but people also depend upon the vast biodiversity around them to supply their daily needs.  Millions of people depend on sustainably harvested fish, timber and fruits for nutrition and their livelihoods.  It is estimated that 80 percent of the income of the rural poor is derived from the local biodiversity. Wood remains the most common fuel throughout the region.  

The current massive extinction of species is taking place on a short timescale, and their effects will reset the future evolution of the planets. Record suggests that recovery of global ecosystems has required millions years but, intervention by humans, the biggest factor to the current environmental crisis, is required for any possibility of short-term recovery of the planets biodiversity along with deforestation and over harvesting. This has threatened pollution, overharvesting, climate change, disruption of community structure in habitats, and others. One of the Major Current Biodiversity is the Population of humans on earth. Humans are one of the massive creatures on the surface of the planet and their interaction in the ecosystem with other living or non- living is a great factor in biodiversity of species. The human population has been increasing therefore disrupting the ecosystem and the nature of other organism which will also affect the nature of the earth as time evolves. The activities of human on the planet has been the major reason behind the decline of biodiversity, thus human still continue to disrupt the functioning of many ecosystem across the earth biosphere. The current biodiversity problem caused by Human is deforestation and overharvesting which has affected earth's rain forest.
