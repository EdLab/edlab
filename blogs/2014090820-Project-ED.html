<p><a href="https://www.projected.com/">Project Ed</a> is an initiative that challenges youth to create short films that interpret a concept in English or science. Each week, the site hosts a <a href="https://www.projected.com/contests">contest</a> with a concept from the school curriculum. Students have a month to finish their film and the site rewards the winner with cash. Project ED has become a platform to showcase students’ creativity and to share multi-media educational content.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Project ED empowers students to create educational materials for themselves and their peers. By making short films, the students engage with the science or language concept very deeply while acquiring digital literacy, building communication and collaboration skills, and becoming creative thinkers. The videos not only teach but also showcase the personalities of the student creators. The students get to see how the same concept be interpreted in different ways.</p>

<p>Project Ed also provides tips for youth to become better filmmakers and for educators to integrate Project ED in their teaching. An online community is being built where students and educators help and communicate with each other.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>One of the judging criteria in the contest is the quality of the video production. This might create an access gap for students from lower income schools with limited access to production tools.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Filmmaking may not seem like an efficient way to learn vocabulary and science, especially to those who are under pressure from high stakes testing, but producing a complex final product helps students learn creative problem solving. Students also become the creators of teaching materials, and there is often no better way to learn something than trying to teach it. At Project ED, students’ work is of high quality, very short, usually funny, and classroom ready to teach the vocabulary and science concepts posted in the contests.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Project ED lets students become the teachers and directors.</p>
