<p><i>"There’s just so much science, nature, music, art, technology, storytelling and assorted good stuff out there that my kids (and maybe your kids) haven’t seen. It’s most likely not stuff that was made for them."</i> (<a href="http://thekidshouldseethis.com/about">The Kid Should See This</a>)</p>

<p><b>No More Garbage Kid Videos</b></p>
<p>There is a lot of <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2">"garbage content"</a> for kids on the internet. The best online educational content is often intended for adults; but who has the time to sort out what could be suitable for kids? This is where <a href="http://thekidshouldseethis.com/about">The Kid Should See This</a> (TKSST) comes in. TKSST is a free site that connects parents, teachers, and educators to kid-friendly and educational videos.</p>

<p>Every day the site posts one to two new videos covering a multitude of topics, such as science, technology, space, nature, food, music, and art. Currently, the site has thousands of kid-friendly videos. The content is pulled from organizations like NASA, BBC, or other sources geared at adults. However, TKSST promises that while the videos are not made for kids, they are perfect for them. Plus, parents don’t have to sit through mind-numbing junk masquerading as educational content. </p>

<p><b>Mom Approved</b></p>
<p>Rion Nakaya, the founder of TKSST and a mother of two, was inspired to create the site in 2011. While working as a <a href="https://offspring.lifehacker.com/use-this-website-as-your-antidote-to-the-mind-numbing-k-1821431178"> video producer and design director</a>, she’d constantly find fascinating videos that she thought would be engaging for her children. She realized other parents would be interested in sharing these kinds of videos with their kids, too, but not everyone had time (or a job) that allowed them to scour the internet. Inspired to help out, she decided to launch TKSST. </p>

<p>While the content offered on the site can just be viewed as entertainment, teachers and educators are encouraged to incorporate the features into lessons. Indeed, Nakaya has chronicled some of the <a href="https://storify.com/thekidshouldsee/classrooms">innovative uses that teachers</a> have come up with for her videos. Likewise, she also curates a list of <a href="https://tksstgiftguide.tumblr.com/"> toys or items</a> that are perfect for in- or outside-the-classroom learning.</p>
