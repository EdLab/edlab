Muhammed Chaudhry has made it his mission to help prepare learners for STEM careers and as the President and CEO of the <a href="http://svefoundation.org/svefoundation/">Silicon Valley Education Foundation (SVEF)</a> he is well on his way. SVEF is the leading education not-for-profit preparing students for college and careers in Silicon Valley. With a wealth of experience, having previously served in management positions in brand marketing with the Clorox Company and Dazzle Multimedia, Chaudhry has been instrumental in helping the foundation forge strong partnerships with the tech industry and education community to develop innovative programs to support public education. Chaudhry is a member of the board of the Californians Dedicated to Education Foundation and the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley. He is on the National Science Foundation's Advisory Committee, advises Silicon Valley Reads and the California Consortium of Education Foundations. Chaudhry holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from San Jose State University and is a graduate of the Stanford Executive Leadership Program.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My university degree is in business administration and my early job experiences focused on marketing and finance positions at top product and multimedia companies in Silicon Valley. I was on a path to lead a company or organization.  After nearly five years working for these companies, I got tired of being a cheerleader for products and realized I wanted to be a cheerleader for children—for causes and initiatives that improve children’s lives, especially underrepresented children. Now, as CEO of the <a href="http://svefoundation.org/svefoundation/">Silicon Valley Education Foundation (SVEF)</a>, I am the leader of an organization—one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent non-profits—that is making great strides in raising student achievement for underserved K-12 children across the region.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I learned early in my business career to network and bring people together to build programs and promote initiatives and causes. As CEO of SVEF I have brought together leaders of the business, technology, academic and civic communities to build fundraising campaigns, promote partnerships with business to sponsor academic programs and community education forums, and to advance SVEF policy and public policy issues in general around education.   
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Through our summer, after-school and weekend math & science support programs—called Elevate [Math] and Elevate [Science]—SVEF IS changing the learning landscape by significantly improving student achievement in these areas of STEM. Students who struggle with these subjects enroll in the programs as 7th and 8th graders to build a foundation in math and science before entering high school. This gives them a leg up and a shot at taking the progression of high school math and science courses through 12th grade that are needed to get into four-year colleges. The programs include an interactive computer lab segment that helps students with problem solving in math & science. Our strong partnerships with technology companies have won us laptop donations for every student (1,200 in 2013) in the program. Our programs are life-changing for students, showing them they can succeed in mastering these two critical subjects and introducing them to the possibility of attending college. SVEF also strongly urges school districts to adopt formal college entrance requirements (in California, they are called "A-G" requirements), which consist of a group of 15 courses that students must take and pass in high school to qualify for California's UC & CSU college systems. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The introduction of Common Core standards in public schools. Common Core is a set of national standards that give students better tools and preparation for college and jobs in the ever-changing global economy. Too many students graduate from high school without the skills for today’s workplace, and too many employers complain about job applicants who aren’t ready to step into jobs without significant training. Common Core was developed to connect classroom lessons with real-world applications, asking students to analyze and use critical thinking to find solutions to problems they’d encounter in the real world at future jobs. Under Common Core, students are challenged to use analytical thinking to solve problems instead of relying on the rote learning system of the past. Included in the new curricula is a strong technology component. The introduction of Common Core is a very different way of learning that will dramatically change what goes on in the classroom, but it will better equip students for the demanding jobs of the future.   
<p> 
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> SVEF is always working on updating and improving our summer math & science programs (listed above) to continue boosting student achievement. For the last several months, we have been working, along with our partner schools, to incorporate the Common Core standards into our program curriculum. A major project we recently helped launch is the East Side Alliance, an effort in which San Jose’s East Side Union High School District and its seven elementary feeder districts joined forces to align goals, courses, and instructional approaches to improve academic achievement in this region of poor-performing students. Previously, the various school districts in this vast area of 85,000 students operated independently, with little or no effort to coordinate courses or goals. As a result, student performance suffered, as well as graduation rates. The East Side Alliance includes the buy-in of San Jose State University and Evergreen Community College to help guide students in the coursework they’ll need as they approach college.
