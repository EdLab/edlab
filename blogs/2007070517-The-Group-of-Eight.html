          <p>
            The Group of Eight (<a href=http://www.g7.utoronto.ca/what_is_g8.html> G8 </a>) is an international forum for the most powerful democratic economies of the world. The eight governments represented in the G8 are from the countries of Canada, the United States, Japan, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. It was originally formed as an informal meeting of heads of state from West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and France in 1975. Canada joined the following year and the forum became known as the G7 for many years. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian officials became involved in meetings with G7 members and finally joined the group in 1997, so as to be officially named the G8. The purpose of the G8 is to discuss international topics including health, law enforcement, labor, economic and social development, energy, environment, foreign affairs, justice, terrorism and trade. These issues, addressed on a global scale, are confronted at the annual summit. 
<p>
	Since the eight governments represented in the G8 are the strongest economic powers in the world, criticism has increased concerning hypocrisy in the issues the summit discusses. Many critics believe that the G8 are responsible for the global issues that should be addressed such as poverty in Africa, unfair trading policies and global warming. In other words, the globalization effects these powerful nations empower are the cause of today's global issues. <a href=http://www1.worldbank.org/economicpolicy/globalization/> Globalization </a> is defined as “the growing integration of economies and societies around the world.” This “integration” is often measured according to corporate interests by the exploitation of poor countries through <a href=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_05/b3969401.htm > outsourcing </a>. This means that unless globalization becomes beneficial to all countries of the world (perhaps a paradox) the aid distributed by the G8 will not resolve the issues. Others have said that the exclusion of rising economic powers, India and especially China, turn the G8 an institution in support of western economic domination. In 2006, the <a href=http://www.live8live.com/ > Live 8 Concert </a> was organized in the eight member countries and South Africa in order to draw attention to the G8 yearly summit and to benefit the global fight of poverty in Africa (forming a total of ten concerts throughout the world in one day). The purpose of the concert was to “make poverty history” by ensuring the G8 keep their promises in their aid to Africa. 
<p>
	Despite these drawbacks, this year's G8 Summit (the <a href=http://www.g-8.de/Webs/G8/EN/Homepage/home.html > 33rd</a>) took place for 3 days in June 2007. The outcome was positive as the eight heads of state “pledged to commit $60 billion to combat AIDS and other diseases around the world in coming years” (from <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/opinion/18mon1.html?ex=1183521600&en=f9324e8b013f8139&ei=5070> NYTIMES </a>). Critics assert that the G8 promises are not nearly close enough to the required amount to treat AIDS in Africa. Concerning trade and globalization, the G8 held at their meeting that they “want to ensure that trade between industrialized and developing countries is made easier. In a joint declaration (G8 Declaration on Trade), they call on all the member states of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to work constructively and flexibly towards that goal.” (Read more <a href=http://www.g-8.de/nn_92160/Content/EN/Artikel/__g8-summit/2007-06-08-g8-gipfel-abschluss__en.html> here </a>). On terrorism, the G8 eloquently <a href=http://www.g-8.de/nsc_true/Content/EN/Artikel/__g8-summit/anlagen/report-on-g8-support-to-the-un-counter-terrorism-efforts,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/report-on-g8-support-to-the-un-counter-terrorism-efforts> state </a> “We renewed our pledge of solidarity in the continuing struggle against the world-wide scourge of terrorism. We highlighted the central role of the UN as the sole organization with the stature and reach to achieve universal agreement on the condemnation of terrorism…” Sure thing, G8. 
<p>
Assuming the West is not a corporate evil, the G8 can be viewed as a relatively positive initiative in combating global issues. However, the downfalls of commercial and cultural globalization are apparent throughout the world and, without severe restrictions, could lead to (have they already?) a global westernization and destruction of a nation's industry and character.
