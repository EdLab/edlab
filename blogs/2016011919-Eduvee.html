<p>When it’s time to gear up for a big study session, it can be daunting to go back to piles upon piles of notes from class with no clear sense of where to start. <a href="https://www.eduvee.com/#!/home/">Eduvee</a> is trying to change that by providing a comprehensive set of study materials, including practice questions, educational videos, and quizzes. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Students can start by adding different courses (e.g., AP Biology, Chemistry, Honors Physics) to their dashboard. Each course offers a categorization of the relevant units, a set of infographics that show progress for the course, as well as a set of review guides, test questions, and relevant videos—which are pulled from various sources such as YouTube and Khan Academy. </p>

<p>When reviewing the test questions, the student can navigate the materials by topic and subtopic. Each subtopic has a series of questions, and the site prompts the user to select an answer and mark their level of confidence—which is then added to the progress infographic to help students visualize their level of comfort with the material. After answering, Eduvee provides an explanation for the question and response, which the student can also use to help review the material, as well as a breakdown in percentages of how other students answered it. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Eduvee is currently working on a beta version for AP U.S. History—its current study material offerings are all in the science fields—so those who want some extra practice for their literature class or other classes are out of luck. Furthermore, the site’s courses are only tailored to the U.S. and the U.K., which means that other countries are left out of the shuffle, leaving EduVee feeling decidedly non-international. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Eduvee is well-organized, easy to navigate, and aesthetically designed. Its thorough offering of materials for each course, unit, and topic will undoubtedly help students studying for an upcoming final exam or AP test. However, because it is only offered for U.S. and U.K. science courses, it unfortunately only hits a narrow range of students who may be looking for a good study resource. If your AP Economics test is next week, you may have to break out the flashcards.</p>
