<p><b>Title:</b> <a href="http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1007138">Design Thinking in Elementary Students' Collaborative Lamp Designing Process</a> (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiju Kangas, Pirita Seitamaa-Hakkarainen, & Kai Hakkarainen</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Design and Technology Education</p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can the design thinking method be used to teach elementary students?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Design thinking is a kind of creative critical thinking process that requires reflection and collaboration. In design thinking, it is essential to create a product and refine it through reflection, but also reflect on the <i>process</i> of creating and refining the product.</p>

<p>Thirty-two students between the ages of ten and eleven were studied in an elementary school in Helsinki, Finland.  In this two-month study, the researchers worked with a class of elementary students and had them design a lamp using the design thinking process. A professional designer was present in all eleven of the design thinking classes to work with and guide the students. The researchers were particularly interested in observing student collaboration, the relationship between the artifacts used and produced and student thinking, and the way thinking was embodied during the lessons.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The researchers found that student learning using the design thinking method was collaborative and materially mediated. Specifically, there was improvement in the studentsâ€™ ability to use design thinking to build out tangible ideas. Sketching helped students move horizontal ideas they had verbalized to vertical iterations. While working on the design, students were collaborating and all their comments were on topic. Having a model to manipulate and change with an eye to improvement as opposed to imagining changes in the abstract was a clear benefit. The experimental, hands-on, reflective nature of design thinking, in which students are constructing meaning as they go along, was extremely positive.</p> 

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The design thinking method allowed students to be more creative and take risks while also seeing a project to completion with a tangible, as opposed to an abstract, result. The required collaboration, dialogue, and reflection also positively impacted the students as they cultivated these skills. As project-based learning and STEM/STEAM projects increasingly find their way into K-12 curriculums, this research may prove useful for any educator seeking to identify a method to support and structure new projects.</p>
