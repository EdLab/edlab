          <p>
            The task of building successful teachers in education is difficult than ever before due to the flawed institutionalized <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/nyregion/education-commission-recommends-core-reforms.html?ref=education">word educational system</a> as teacher are trained to teach in away that test scores are valued far more than the students understanding. Recently, the New York Educational commission has proposed to reform the educational system practiced in the state. An outline to the Governor Andrew Cuomo was designed to restructure and shape the system. The commission created an outline that will force teachers to take a bar like exam, which is usually designed for aspiring lawyers and doctors. Furthermore, a plan to extend the school year by breaking the traditional agrarian academic calendar is laid out as part of the reform. Children 4 years or younger in poor areas will have access to full prekindergarten education.  In order to complete this reform the main obstacle stated by the commission's chairman, Richard D. Persons is funding for these programs and making them part of school structure.  Much of what the commission had planned will be very expensive as New York holds one of the country's largest state educational systems. Consolidating schools was also a major proposal towards changing the school system but with many communities happy with their locally run schools.
