          <p>
            For those who were unaware, yesterday was D-Day (decision day) for high school seniors applying to Ivy League and other elite schools. My Facebook news-feed displayed some triumphs and some heartbreak, but on the whole, I was hearing the same anecdotes about the same schools that I heard last year. The well-rounded middle-class student with a 2300+ SAT score getting rejected while the rather underqualified wealthy student with a <1900 SAT score gaining acceptance. Obviously SAT scores are not the only things that matter; I'm just using SAT scores as a rough first-order approximation to illustrate a greater narrative that might be at play. 

The narrative has become increasingly prevalent in the past two years from my personal observations and I have become increasingly suspicious of need-blind policies as a result. Since the 2008 financial crisis and throughout 2009, endowments at elite schools, such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia, have endured significant losses. I would not be surprised if admissions offices have thus had an incentive to choose a slightly less qualified student who has the ability to pay for full tuition over a qualified student who might require substantial financial aid. The fact of the matter is that universities are dealing with finite financial resources, and thus incentives are at play. As my intermediate macro professor says, incentives matter.

I am shocked by the lack of research into whether colleges are actually need-blind, especially given how easy it is to test for it. Such research would require extensive survey data, but that's not impossible to generate. Am I just working off anecdotal evidence rooted in biased narrative or if my suspicions have any truth to them?
