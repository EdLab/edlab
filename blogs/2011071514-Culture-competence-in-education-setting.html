            Q. What is cultural competence?

"<strong>Cultural competence</strong> refers to an ability to interact effectively  with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four  components: (a) Awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) Attitude  towards cultural differences, (c) Knowledge of different cultural  practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing  cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate  with, and effectively interact with people across cultures."---wikipedia

Q. Why is cultural competence important in education settings?

Research shows that minority/disadvantage students who are giving up on education are not because they are dumb or disinterested. Rather, they can't relate themselves to a field in which people from their own communities are not apparent. They don't have enough skills and confidence to cope with the challenges.

For those who come from the dominant culture, it can be hard for them to recognize other cultures because their own culture is so pervasive and dominant. We, as teachers, need to escape those constraints and to build awareness and understandings of cultural differences.

Q. How do teachers develop their own cultural competence?

"In education, cultural competence is focused on how effective a teacher  is for those students who do not share the same personal  characteristics (i.e. ethnicity, gender, religion, etc.) or the same  cultural background of the teacher.Â  It entails mastering certain  personal and interpersonal awareness and sensitivities, learning  specific bodies of cultural knowledge, and mastering a set of skills  that underlie effective cross-cultural teaching."

-integrating cultural relevance and diverse role models into curricula

-confronting and revising differing expectations and stereotypes of students
