          <p>
            The recruitment process for high school athletes is a very essential and sometimes daunting process. However, as highlighted by this <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~tfakehany/mistakes.html">article</a>, parents make certain mistakes that eventually affect their children. For instance, some parents assume they know the athletic abilities of their children to the extent that they will not want to listen to scouts or coaches. Some parents believe their children are talented enough to land an athletic scholarship. Also, some parents also forget that academics should be the top priority for their children in college. Parents tend to stay too focused on their children's athletics they often forget to the importance of academics. They is a great chance their child will not go pro in their respective sport. 
<p>
As a college athlete, I believe it is always good to have moral support from family and friends. The recruiting process is very essential. In order to make the right decision, both the athlete and the parents should choose the school that best fits both academic and athletic goals. There are several schools that make sure class schedules do not collide with practice and game schedules of student athletes. This and other factors are important elements that parents need to consider before and during the recruiting process.
