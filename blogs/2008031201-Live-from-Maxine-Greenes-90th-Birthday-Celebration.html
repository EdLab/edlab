I had the great pleasure of attending Maxine Greene's 90th birthday celebration and talk this evening (thanks to Dr. St. John for allowing us to go as a class!).  Here is a quick run down of the event:

6:00 PM  This place is packed!  We got there right before 6pm and were actually ushered to the balcony, since the orchestra was full. Hoping to get some good pictures, I was fortunately able to squeeze my way into the orchestra section, taking one of the last available seats. 

6:05 PM  President Fuhrman makes a beautiful introduction for Maxine Greene, summarizing her incredible career and the impact she has made in the world of the arts,  education and at Teachers College.

6:12 PM  Maxine Greene begins her talk with a poem, and then makes a very strong point about the growing danger of indifference and apathy in our society, and the way that we need to think about this epidemic in terms of how we teach.  She challenges us with the question, “How can we help children develop a trust in society and at the same time develop the ability for outrage?”  She makes references to the book, “The Plague”, among others, making commentary on society's carelessness and distance. She calls for the need to overcome our indifference, and to combat this in the classroom, working towards enabling children to think, feel, and react to reality.  “We can't be glossed over by this sweet teaching, telling them that everything is well,” she explained.  She challenged teachers to think about how to engage students in the unanswered questions of our time, as disinterest is on the rise.  She calls for an opening of doors for new possibilities, not being so set in finding concrete answers, and to find ways to include this in our pedagogy. 

6:28 PM  She talks about the arts and imagination, and the way in which imagination and thoughtfulness enables us to find solutions and possibilities in society.  She refers to Martin Luther King, Jr. as an example of what imagination can do in opening up possibilities.  She declared that his response was the best kind of response to indifference.  

<img src="http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg272/jtaira/DSC00589-1.jpg" style="float:left; margin-top:10px; margin-left:0px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-right:10px;" />Personally, I couldn't agree with her more.  Where are the Martin Luther Kings, the social leaders and innovators of our time?  I think of events like Hurricane Katrina, and am astounded by America's ability to be so indifferent.  The days of protests and sit-ins seem to be long gone, and replaced by an era of (time permitting) email forwards, websites and blogs.   Somehow, as the world becomes more personalized with more personal choices, it seems that the world is equally becoming more impersonal.  I hope that we take Maxine Greene's message to heart and truly embark on creating a new era of citizens, enabling once again a passion for imagination, dreams, and a life that "could be" for humanity.
