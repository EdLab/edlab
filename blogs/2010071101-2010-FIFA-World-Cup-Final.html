          <p>
            On Sunday, July 11, the FIFA World Cup Final will be held for the first time on African soil. Although there were many surprises at this year's tournament, as the
tournament played out with controversial refereeing and the Adidas Jabulani Ball, the tournament still has one more show to offer for it to be a complete success and that is the final match against Spain and the Netherlands for the Jules Aimet Trophy.

What makes this so final special are the two teams who will be competing for the title. The Netherlands has been dubbed “the best team to have never won the cup” by
many pundits though they played for the title twice before with back-to-back appearances in the 1974 and 1978 finals. 

The now famous Dutch theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Football">“total football”</a> will be put to the test for a third shot at winning the Cup against Spain. Does the ‘Oranje' have what it takes to win their first ever World Cup Trophy?

La Furia Rojas of Spain won't give them the Cup without a fight. Spain's current national team is considered their golden generation. With one of the top leagues in the world, Spain is home to renowned clubs such as Barcelona and Real Madrid, but the national team still has never produced a World Cup winning squad. Even though they won Euro 2008 with an impressive 6-0-0 record, they failed to bring that winning touch
to the 2009 Confederations Cup where they lost 2-0 to the U.S. Men's National Team to end a long unbeaten run. Spain lost its first game at this summer's World Cup but ended up winning the group and making an impressive run to the final. Will La Roja be able to overcome the Dutch's total football and get their hands on the World Cup trophy?

Things You Should Know:
1 . This World Cup will produce a first time winner as neither team has ever won the
cup.

2 . This will be the first time an European team has won the cup outside of Europe

3 . The Dutch enter the final with a 25 game winning streak

4 . Both teams have never met in a major tournament but have played in international
friendlies, European Championship qualifying matches and the 1920 Summer
Olympics. They have both won four games each.

5 Key Players to look at:
- Netherlands: Arjen Robben 11, Dirk Kuyt 7, Wesley Sneijder 10, Giovanni Van
Bronckhorst 5(Captain) and Maarten Stekelenburg 1
- Spain: David Villa 7, Carles Puyol 5, Xavi 8, Iniesta 6 and Iker Cassillas
1(Captain)
