<strong>Online Catalogs</strong>

•TC Catalog – <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/">EDUCAT </a>– searches print and electronic materials available through the TC Library, which may not always be available in other college libraries in Columbia

•CU Catalog – <a href="http://clio.columbia.edu/catalog">CLIO </a>– searches the other university libraries and includes over 7 million items: books, journals, audio &amp; video recordings, musical scores, government docs, maps &amp; atlases, etc.

•Note: 15% of our libraries holdings are not available through CLIO!

<strong>Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)</strong>

•LC Subject headings are the official subject terms prescribed by the Library of Congress for the cataloging of books and are in use in essentially all academic libraries.

•To find works in comparative international education, international educational development, and related subjects, it may be useful to keep a short list of some key subject terms in your research area.

Here are some key subject terms for topics in Gender, Education &amp; Development:

•Feminism and education

•Gender identity in education

•Sex discrimination against women

•Sex discrimination in education

•Sex role

•Women — Education

•Women in development

<strong>Finding Subject Terms for your Research</strong>

•The records for items in EDUCAT and other academic library catalogs offer valuable information you can use for further research

•Under the catalog record for a particular item, see the tab “find similar items” for linked subject headings that let you explore other works on similar themes and subject areas.

<strong>Federated Search Engines</strong>

•Search across many types of library resources simultaneously, from print materials to journals to e-resources and more

•<a href="http://clio.columbia.edu/">Quicksearch </a>is Columbia University Libraries’ Federated Search which combs CLIO, as well as multiple periodical indexes, and other web resources simultaneously

<strong>Databases and Periodical Indexes</strong>

There are many databases and periodical indexes available for doing research about gender, education and international development issues.

Tip: Start your research with multidisciplinary databases available through Proquest, EBSCO

Remember: Each database or periodical index has its own “classification scheme” or method of organizing articles within its collection. Use the Thesaurus to search for subject terms that will allow you to retrieve <span style="text-decoration: underline">all </span>materials on your topic.
