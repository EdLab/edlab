<p><a href="http://factitious.augamestudio.com/#/">Factitious</a> is intended for everyone, which makes sense because everyone should know how to detect fake news from real news. Produced by <a href="https://edspace.american.edu/jolt/"> JoLT</a> and the <a href="http://www.american.edu/gamelab/">American University Game Lab</a>, Factitious is the brainchild of journalist Maggie Farley, who wanted to teach people how to identify propaganda. Playing this game stirs appreciation for how difficult it is to actually spot fake news.<a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil"></a></p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game is free. It's interface mimics the dating app Tinder, making it easy to use. On a phone players swipe left if an article seems fake, and right if it feels real. The game offers good tips for detecting fake news through questions like: What's the source? Do you recognize the news outlet? Is the article trying to inform, inflame, persuade, entertain? You get a drumroll if you’re correct and if you’re wrong, an inoffensive buzzer accompanies a friendly pop-up: "Sorry that was actually a fake article. But don’t worry this tricky click-bait also fooled other news sites." As you progress through each round, a series of helpful hints teaches players how to think about the content; eventually you stop guessing and start making informed decisions, and your score improves.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The creators acknowledge the conundrum players face when trying to identify fake news, and provide links to sites like Snopes.com, factcheck.org, politifact.com and the Washington Post Fact Checker to see if the story has been verified or debunked. They also provide a definition of fake news: stories fabricated for fun, influence, or profit, as well as satire, opinion, and spin; which is fine until you disagree with the game. Factitious caught me swiping right on a satirical piece from The Onion. It's worth noting that this app is not good at capturing the nuance of satire, which is indeed the use of falsities in order to gesture at truth.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Factitious is clever, thought provoking, and informative, and it has the potential to be more than just a game. It is well placed as an educational tool to teach players the difference between news that harms and news that is designed to be funny. In the next phase, which is currently in development, its creators have planned upgrades allowing newsrooms and schools to adapt versions for their own use. As educators continue to integrate technology into curriculums, it’s easy to imagine teachers building Factitious into classroom discussions about democracy, freedom of speech, and the importance of satire in understanding our differences as we appreciate our similarities.</p>
