<i>I've probably learned as much in a few weeks here as I did all year on my own.</i> (Student testimony on the App Academy site)
<p>
<b>Pay only if you Find Work</b><br>
<a href="http://www.appacademy.io/#p-home">App Academy</a> is a full-time web development program in San Francisco and New York City.  The 12-week program costs 12K and allows learners to create a digital portfolio of work developed in App Academy classes.  The program also offers job placement assistance after graduation.  In fact, unlike other programing courses (both online and in-person) App Academy offers a truly unique payment model (one most often found in law firms), stating on their site, "You only pay us if you find a job as a developer after the program. In that case, the fee is 18% of your first year salary, payable over the first 6 months after you start working." Further building on this unique payment plan, the program offers additional job-based enticement… results, and cites the following statistic on their homepage, "95% of our graduates have offers or are working in tech jobs now at an average salary of $91,000."  This unusually high "rate of return" on tuition investment is due in part to the group’s structured opportunities for participants to interact with partner companies ranging from Facebook to <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/">ZenDesk</a>.  App Academy further incentivizes employment with these leading technology companies by offering to refund 5K of a participant’s tuition if they choose an App Academy partner company as a new employer.
<p>

<b>Innovative CS Curriculum</b><br>
Beyond offering interesting incentives and a relatively low-risk programmer training program, App Academy also stands-out from the growing herd of programs (both online and in-person) dedicated to teaching computer science, by offering a uniquely straight-forward, <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/#p-curriculum"> modular curriculum</a>.  App Academy courses are held over an intense twelve-week period, during which learners focus their time on real-world projects that hone a variety of skills necessary to begin their careers as web developers.  Weekly in-person lessons focus on topics that include, "prototypal inheritance" and "web application architecture," as well as interview skills and preparation.  The emphasis is on building applications using programming languages that are the up-to-the-minute industry standard, including <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. Graduates are not only trained to immediately fill entry-level computer science positions, but are also prepared to fill positions that focus on specializations that are so new, they are often not included in traditional computer science programs at leading universities.  This is another unique benefit of an accelerated CS program like App Academy; as technology and programming languages continue to evolve rapidly and companies struggle to fill highly specialized needs, those with the most updated training will have an advantage.  Unlike more traditional computer science programs at leading universities, App Academy is able to offer the most focused and up-to-date curriculum to prepare workers to fill <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2013/08/02/can-we-fix-the-skills-gap/">quickly growing gaps in the US job market.</a>  
<p>
Beyond specific programming skills, App Academy claims to provide broad training in a "way of thinking" regarding how to solve real-world problems across many industries, noting that "...software development is as much about a way of thinking as a set of tools. The skills we teach will serve you well no matter what you may want to do in the future: back-end engineering, iOS development, big data, etc."  App Academy is an interesting model of the benefits of providing a "just-in-time" 21st century "learning toolkit" that includes not only a set of specific technical skills, but also, more broadly applicable critical thinking expertise.
