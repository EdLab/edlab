<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I started out as a computer scientist, did my master's in the Media Lab at MIT, and retrained under anthropologists for my PhD. I moved between industry, non-profits, and academia. In short, I purposefully worked to obtain as wide a perspective as possible. I also worked the entire time that I was in school, both out of necessity and also because it allowed me to better engage with the dynamics I was seeking to understand.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> I want people to understand youth and the cultural context in which they are operating. And I believe that we have a responsibility to help young people engage more productively with this world.  To make that happen, we need to start by listening to them.  In this way, I see my role as translation.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Even when I was a teenager, getting access to information was hard. Today, people have unprecedented access. As a result, what youth desperately need is media literacy and computational skills to critically make sense of the information that's available to them.  But all of this comes from the trend of unprecedented quantities of information.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I'm starting a new research institute called Data & Society to address the social, cultural, ethical, and legal issues that emerge because of data-driven technologies (a.k.a. "big data").  I want to enable deep thinkers to bridge the conversations happening in academia and advocacy and to help build roadmaps for dealing with a data-saturated world. It's a <a href="http://bit.ly/1vXEigg"target="blank">fun project</a>!  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Well, I'm most interested in my close family and friends but I doubt that you'd be as enamored with their posts as I am. <grin>
