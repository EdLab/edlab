<p>The overlap between music and learning is clear. Syncopated rhythms, percussive beats, and time signatures all have distinct mathematical principles embedded within their musical core. <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yodeloh-math-mountain/id634946225?mt=8">YodelOh Math Mountain</a> tests young students’ basic math skills in an Alpine Adventure accompanied by an inviting yodelling soundtrack. It’s a carnival game that combines screen interaction and delightful music to help kids learn math. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>YodelOh Math Mountain provides mathematical features that are very useful to young learners. It offers five different game modes that are based on basic math operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Charts displaying high scores track the best 15 games for all five operators, providing a fun motivational tool for individual players and in the classroom. Multilingual options allow for game play across languages and for English language learners.. It also helps parents who want their kids to learn the rudiments of other languages including French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, as well as Simplified and Traditional Chinese. </p>

<p>YodelOh has a fantastic design with a whimsical interface winningly designed for young students. The colors are bold—the rich blue skies melt into grey peaks as the bright yellow sun warms the mountains. The characters wear traditional garb—gleaming white lederhosen and pointy green hats give the game a classic Swiss Alps feel. Game scores are clearly displayed with high contrast whites written on pitch-black backgrounds; chimes and buzzes alternatively convey success and failure. Winning players can become the next "King of the Alps," incentivizing play. Buttons and icons are large and easy to manipulate for kids with less refined motor skills. Students can tap, earn points, and hum along to their heart’s content while learning math. Yodelay-hee-hoo! </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although useful for young players, YodelOh Math Mountain doesn’t have the necessary content scalability to expand its reach to older students. For example, YodelOh only offers addition and subtraction binomial equations for numbers 1–20, as well as multiplication and division binomial equations for numbers 1–12. As a result, older students would easily lose interest in the content as their mathematical skills surpass those offered by the app. Also, although the game is indisputably fun, students who want to just play games can interact with the interface while ignoring some of the math.  </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>YodelOh Math Mountain is a well-designed, fun game. All of its multimedia is appealing and it has high quality interactivity. The app is unfortunately limited to younger age groups due to the narrow range of mathematical concepts covered. However, if you know youngsters who are musically inclined and like goofy games, YodelOh Math Mountain would be a good choice to help them develop their mathematical skills and climb the mountain to academic success. </p>
