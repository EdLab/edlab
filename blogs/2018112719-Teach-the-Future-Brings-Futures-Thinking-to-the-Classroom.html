<p><i>"By giving young people the tools to engage with the future early in life, we are equipping them to face uncertainties and challenges and helping them discover their role in shaping the future."</i> (<a href="http://www.teachthefuture.org/what-we-do/">Teach the Future</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Educating for Agency</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.teachthefuture.org">Teach the Future</a> is a non-profit organization that helps teachers and administrators educate their students with an eye toward the future. This means creating activities and lesson plans that require students to consider the trajectory of different aspects of society. The goal of futures thinking within education is to teach students that they can make an impact in the future of a community instead of tacitly accepting what is to come.</p>

<p><b>Resources for Educators</b></p>
 
<p>Teach the Future offers various resources to help educators implement futures thinking in their classrooms from the elementary school level through college. There is an online library of free teaching materials, which includes lessons and activities that fit into a range of school subjects. For example, teachers can choose a lesson on the future of the American dream, which fits into language arts and history, or a lesson on the future of transportation, which fits into arts and design. Overall, Teach the Future offers 66 lessons. Also available are the Futures Thinking Playbook, professional development opportunities for educators, and workshops for students.</p>

<p><b>Origin and Mission</b></p>
 
<p>Founded by Peter Bishop, Teach the Future partners with schools around the world, including a recent partnership with a school in Germany. For 30 years, Bishop directed the University of Houston’s Master’s in Foresight program, where he also co-authored a book on the topic called <i>Teaching About the Future</i>. He, like all members of Teach the Future, believes that futures thinking should teach students how to challenge assumptions about the future, think critically about the kind of society they want to create, and feel prepared to make it happen.</p>
