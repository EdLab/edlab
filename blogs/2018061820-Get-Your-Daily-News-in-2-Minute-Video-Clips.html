<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/circa-experience-news/id517114354?mt=8">Circa News</a> is a video-based news app that provides original clips to your newsfeed every day. Acquired by <a href="http://sbgi.net">Sinclair Broadcast Group</a> in 2016, Circa News has its own team of producers, live show hosts, and journalists generating the app’s content. There is also a <a href="https://www.circa.com">website version of Circa</a> that provides text-based articles and live broadcast shows in addition to videos.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Circa jumped on the crest of the video trend a couple years ago and is now riding the wave with a dedicated user base. When you create an account on Circa, you first curate your interests based on topics such as global news, politics, fashion, and entertainment. Most of the content on Circa has been edited and annotated by the Circa team to include overlaid text for easier viewing. Some clips, such as ones from press conferences or speeches, remain untouched. In both cases, the videos are generally high quality and easy to watch. Circa hosts a few live news shows too, which mainly focus on entertainment topics.</p>
 
<p>The videos on Circa are generally 1–2 minutes long, making them ideal for mobile viewing and social media sharing. In addition, Circa’s interface is simple, straightforward, and easily searchable. I was pleased with the number of news stories I found on any given topic. The app doesn’t provide an overwhelming number of stories, but it generally provides at least a few videos on any recent major event.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While Circa does provide stories on serious issues, it seems like most of the app’s content is devoted to the kind of pop news stories that currently dominate social media. Scrolling through the main Circa feed, stories of the Iran Nuclear Deal are couched between live chats on the Taylor Swift/Katy Perry feud and a "Husband Willing to Trade His Pickup to Save His Wife’s Life." I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing because sometimes this is the kind of story you most want to read or share online. But it is likely to dissuade people looking for more serious news stories. Even though you can customize your news feed to only show stories you’re interested in, it doesn’t feel like serious stories are the app’s main focus.</p>

<p>Also, if you are less interested in watching than reading news, the Circa app is not for you, as the only content available is in video form. As mentioned above though, the website version also contains text-based articles.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Circa is smart to offer bite-sized, video-based news stories that are high quality, informative, and easily shared. That said, the app seems more focused on shareable rather than serious content. Because the news feed can be customized, that might not be a problem for some, especially people interested in both serious and feel-good news stories.</p>
