            **Private

Last night, Brian S., Meredith, Yang and I ventured to a packed room at the CUNY Graduate Center for a book talk by Emeritus Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at University College London, Arthur I. Miller. The book he was discussing was “Colliding Worlds: How Cutting-Edge Science is Redefining Contemporary Art.” 

In what was a concise-yet-comprehensive walkthrough of Dr. Miller's thesis, we were exposed to exemplary works of collaborations between artists and scientists (who sometimes were one in the same). They were transfixing. Actually, the projects were very reminiscent of those born out of <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/1887" target="_blank">EdLab's Digital Art Residency program</a> (see pics <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/edlabdesigner/sets/72157622618568122/" target="_blank">here</a>). But I digress. 

When it came time for Q&A, we quickly realized that many in the audience took issue (to put it lightly) with some of the claims Dr. Miller made throughout the talk. Ish got <a href="http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/schauble.gif" target="_blank">REAL.</a> To his credit, he answered every shot fired at him with grace, intellect, and maybe only the slightest bit of indignation. But I don't fault him for that. 

One of the most controversial assertions that Dr. Miller made was that the “establishment art world” routinely rejects artsci because artsci is not viewed as unique. It is reproducible. He then compared the plight of artsci with that of past avant-garde art movements like Cubism and Impressionism. Do you agree? Is artsci on the fringe and is it poised to become mainstream? 

Overall, I thought the talk was extremely educational and interesting. That means a lot coming from someone with a track record of dozing off in art history lectures.

<b>TL;DR</b> We went to a talk about artsci and we left with added respect for the art form (as well as an appreciation for the crowds at EdLab seminars). 

I would be remiss if I described the event without sharing the art that Dr. Miller shared with us so I've done my best to dig up some of the projects he mentioned. I've separated them into the divisions that Dr. Miller grouped them in. If you know of others, do share!
