          <p>
            I just came across some great discussions of gaming which might be useful as we continue to think of the use of this medium in the lab's work.</br></br>

The first, posted on a <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/">regular blog read of mine</a>, discusses a recent push to channel some of the enthusiasm around games to solve very real problems and harness some ‘free labor'! <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/theres-free-labor-in-video-games/#more-3251">Two specific projects</a> are highlighted: the first is called the ESP game and it challenges users to tag random images (this project is actually the predecessor of the <a href="http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/">Google Image Labeler</a> game that Stephanie talked out in a recent Edlab seminar). The second, called <a href="http://fold.it/portal/">Fold.it</a>, invites gamers to “solve puzzles for science” by solving puzzles which are actually complex protein shapes. Both games share two commonalities: they are fun (and thus ‘played' a lot) but more importantly, they are harnessing both the time, and the brain power of the user for a ‘greater good'; the ESP/Google Labeler game is being used to categorize thousands of online images which would otherwise remain untagged, whilst Fold.it is attempting to uncover the ideal shape of many complex proteins, a task that powerful computers even struggle with. </br></br>

What is interesting here is the idea that with clever design, we can channel the energy present in gaming (it is proposed that 9 billion hours were spent playing solitaire in 2003!) to achieve very constructive outcomes! Fold.it even has an educational component, teaching the interested user about protein construction.</br></br>

The challenge as always is how to create games such as these which are popular and have the potential to go viral. <a href="http://www.changingthegamebook.com/">Changing the Game</a>
is a book which has been written about “how video games are transforming the future of business”. <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/blogs/advergames-can-communicate?page=0%2C1">Here is an excerpt</a> which gives ideas on how to make video games viral and also a brief discussion on how businesses are using these ideas to gain insight into their customer's opinions and preferences.  For example, an advergame created by Nike, allows users to customize their avatars' Nike Shox sneakers before taking part in a simulated slam-dunk contest. What is a fun game intended to advertise Nike to the user, also provides Nike with free design ideas and information straight from their consumers. Brilliant! Is there an After.Ed game we can create which will help us learn what our viewers want to see?! And is there a way we utilize these ideas to inform our work on adaptive learning environments and HBO asset games?
