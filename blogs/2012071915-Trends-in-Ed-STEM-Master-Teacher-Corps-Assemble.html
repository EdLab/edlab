          <p>
            By now we're probably all familiar with how students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) classes  are struggling to understand the concepts taught in class, which leads to more students being discourage and not pursuing careers in STEM fields. Well help for this problem is on the way, from the White House of all places. The Obama Administration is forming a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/17/president-obama-announces-plans-new-national-corps-recognize-and-reward-?utm_source=wh.gov&utm_medium=shorturl&utm_campaign=shorturl">STEM Master Teacher Corps</a>, this group of people will include 50 exceptional STEM teachers in 50 sites, and is planning to expand to 10,000 STEM Master Teachers in 4 years. Exceptional teachers would be selected based on several criteria such as demonstrated effectiveness in teaching one or more STEM subjects, their content knowledge, and their contributions to the continuous improvement of teaching and learning both within their schools and across the community of STEM teachers. These STEM Master Teachers will work with their fellow teachers to improve STEM classroom instruction and set an example, inspire both students and teachers, and get support from each other through this STEM Master Teacher network. 

This initiative will cost Washington $1 billion and part of this money will go to the STEM Master Teachers, for participating each teacher will receive an extra $20,000 on top of their base salary. It sounds like a large amount of money but the Obama Administration must think it's worth it to prepare our students to compete in the global economy. 

The STEM Master Teacher Corps seems to be giving STEM teachers much more support to better teach the STEM subjects and maybe get more students interested in pursuing STEM careers. It's great that these teachers will be able to receive more support and knowledge from each other, as it is through working in groups where genius ideas will arise. Although in the end, as they say "the more things change the more they stay the same", students will still need to pass standardize test which may hinder getting students engaged, and may still tempt teachers to teach to the tests. 

This is a start to some improvement to STEM education and hopefully the extra help that teachers will receive will be passed on to the students. The best part of this piece of news is that even Washington is now actually trying to do something to strengthen our STEM education. Even with this start we must continue to find ways to optimize the way we educate our students and attend to each student's educational needs and aspirations.
