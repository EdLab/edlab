<p><b>Title:</b> Using Technology in Higher Education: The Influence of Gender Roles on Technology Self-Efficacy (2013)</p>

<b>Authors:</b> Ann Hergatt Huffman, Jason Whetten, & William H. Huffman</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000782">Computers in Human Behavior</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> What factors explain differences in computer self-efficacy between men and women?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> According to the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>, women only represent 12% of all computer science graduates, which is significantly down from 37% in 1984. As non-profits, entrepreneurs, and academic institutions prioritize closing the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math, researchers are also exploring the causes of this disparity.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055690500416025#.UlLLLWSke8s">Other</a> <a href=" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563299000369 ">studies</a> have established a relationship between biological sex and perceptions of technological aptitude; however, researchers at the University of Arizona were specifically interested in exploring how gender roles affect attitudes toward computer use. Because gender establishes expectations and characteristics for performance in society, it was hypothesized to be a more accurate predictor of attitudes.</p>

<p>The authors of this study measured students’ perceptions of their capabilities (referred to as self-efficacy) in accomplishing computer related tasks. Using four previously established measurement scales, they administered surveys to 750 undergraduate students (58.2% female) in an intro-level psychology class at a medium-sized public university in the Southwest. Students were asked to rate themselves on: masculinity traits, confidence in learning and using technology, encounters with technical hassles, and experiences with tech support.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> While males in the study generally reported higher levels of perceived technological ability than females, masculinity was a more accurate predictor of self-efficacy than any other factor, including: sex, previous experience with technology, technical hassles, tech support, or even preparation for class. The authors concluded that gender roles mediate the relationship between sex and technological self-efficacy and provide a link between gender role theory and technology use.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Self-efficacy is worth studying because it can be a predictor of <a href=" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131508000201">academic and career success</a>. Demonstrating a verifiable relationship between masculinity and computer confidence is an important step in identifying the underlying causes of male-dominated fields and understanding how to level the playing field. In order to increase students’ perceptions of their computer abilities regardless of their masculinity, the authors recommend that universities employ gender diverse staff members who are technologically competent. They also suggest that both masculine and feminine teachers receive adequate technical training and that training language and style don’t reinforce gender stereotypes.</p>

<p>Although this study pertained to general attitudes toward computer use, other studies on self-efficacy in more specific contexts, such as online learning, have found that women hold advantages in completing work on time and communicating with instructors (see <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/949"> The Keys to Success in Online Learning</a>). It would be informative to see work analyzing how gender roles affect self-efficacy across various scenarios and determining why there are differences. Areas for further research include comparing self-efficacy scores to actual performance metrics, studying gender dynamics among teachers and faculty, and collecting information on how gender roles affect students of different ages and backgrounds.</p>
