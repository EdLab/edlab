            One of the most important contributions a person can make is giving back to their community. It demonstrates the commitment to help make the world a better place. Furthermore, giving back to the community provides opportunity for those who are less fortunate. Such has been the story of Valentino Deng, a Sudanese native who gave back to his community by building a high school. According to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-a-lost-boy-battles-ak-47s-with-education.html?_r=1">piece</a> from the New York Times, Deng  fled from his hometown in South Sudan at the age of seven, and eventually ended up in America. His accomplishments in the US propelled him to give back to his homeland. After all, education transformed his life, and made him the person he is today so it seemed right his efforts should be focused there.

The school is in such high demand that it receives 1,000 students from around the nation each year. The students contend for 150 places in ninth grade classes. This is a perfect illustration of why the school is labeled as one of the best in South Sudan. Nonetheless, the schools faces enormous challenges. The lack of female enrollment remains the greatest challenge. Deng's intention to enroll 50 percent girls has failed. But I do not think that that will be the end of the story. That is, if Deng has been able to use the power of education to overshadow South Sudan's civil war; he is likely to do the same for girlsâ€™ education.
