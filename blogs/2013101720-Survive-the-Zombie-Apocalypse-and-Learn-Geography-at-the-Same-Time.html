Need to spice up your classroom curriculum? Why not zombies? <p>

David Hunter, a humanities teacher at Big Picture School in Bellevue, Washington, has a knack for getting students’ attention. His strategy is simple yet powerful: he teaches to their interests while exercising his own talents.  As an example of his pedagogical prowess, he created the sensation that is zombie-based learning (ZBL). <p>

ZBL puts students in the middle of the zombie apocalypse with their only salvation their daily geography lessons. After all, once you have been forced to create an entirely new settlement in a brave new world, factors like climate and landforms will be of the utmost importance to you and your fellow survivors. David argues that by putting the learning into this context, the lessons are more memorable and the learning experience more enjoyable. The curriculum itself is project-based and a corresponding textbook is notably absent. <p>

In lieu of a textbook, David created a graphic novel, Dead Reckon, that takes place during various stages of the apocalypse. The novel is meant to act as a guide, providing the backstory and rationale for the various projects that students engage in over the course of the curriculum. <p>

David’s spin on a tired subject is refreshing, but could the novelty of teaching around a pop culture phenomenon wear off, or does it have staying power? Weigh in on the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10688">on Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:25 Brian.Sweeting:</b> Knowing your students' interests sounds so basic, yet many teachers don't take the time to do this.<p>


<b>@01:34 Clark:</b> He mentions gamification... does the curriculum play out as such? In other words, do students compete against each other in any way, or are they just recognized for individual achievements?
