They say experience is the best teacher, and MC2 STEM High School is living proof. <p>

MC2 (pronounced "MC squared") STEM is a project-based public high school in Cleveland, Ohio that boasts a 95% graduation rate. As part of the pedagogy, students are paired with STEM professionals who provide mentorship, academic support, and career planning help. Each grade of students is headquartered at different workplaces throughout the city, including the Great Lakes Science Center and General Electric. This workplace-as-classroom model allows students to put into practice the real-world applications of their educational experiences. <p>

At MC2 STEM, "real world work" relates to 21st century skills; namely, addressing how students think (e.g., creativity, problem-solving), how they work (e.g., collaboration), their resourcefulness with tools (e.g., information literacy), and life and career skills (e.g., social responsibility).  There is research to suggest that teaching real world work works. <a href="http://thegallupblog.gallup.com/2013/05/what-works-in-schools-is-real-work_30.html">A recent Gallup poll</a> found a link between people who learned these skills in school and perceived higher work quality later in life.   <p>

MC2 STEM High School aims to provide its students with the knowledge to help them navigate life confidently. What other initiatives have you come across that have professed to do the same? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9700"> Join the ongoing discussion </a> on Vialogues to share your thoughts. <p>

<b>@1:17 MartinPaper:</b> The rocket launch analogy here is particularly poignant, given the research on the role of motivation and engagement in student learning. By building bridges between learning material and career choices, students can more clearly see the impact their education will have on their future.<p>

<b>@4:07 sesackey:</b> This way of teaching students is very effective. What [MC2] STEM is doing is actually placing students in the environment of the fields in which they are interested in. This gives a student the chance to really put the maths and the sciences they are being taught to work. I can see this method of teaching and variations of it becoming widespread in the near future.
