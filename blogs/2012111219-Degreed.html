 <p><a href="http://degreed.com/">Degreed</a> is an online service that tallies up learning, whether through traditional schools or online courses, and gives the user a full breakdown of what they have learned from wherever they’ve learned it. Degreed’s mission is to allow users to get validation for all of their learning experiences, online or offline, so that users can have more professional and educational opportunities. Degreed also issues degree equivalencies, such as d.Associates, d.Bachelors, and d.Masters. These degrees are intended to be equivalent to a user graduating from the best universities and taking the toughest courses. The site is currently in beta mode, but the general public can get access to it by signing up with a Facebook account.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b><br>Degreed offers a very visually pleasing dashboard of a user’s educational experience. After users register for the site and input academic career information, Degreed automatically generates a breakdown of what users have learned by subject, and how far they must go to reach 100% mastery. If the user clicks on one subject they may see a further breakdown by sub-area.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b><br>The way Degreed finds out what courses the user has taken at a traditional school seems incomplete. For example, if a user inputs the college attended and the major, Degreed will look up what courses are required to complete the major, never examining the user’s own transcript which may include additional classes. This may be because Degreed is in beta, but for now it seems that the most users can do is input their educational history and view its subject breakdown.</p>
 
<p><b>Relevance:</b><br>Degreed is setting out to change the way people look at credentials. The team behind the site believes that traditional degrees do not give the whole story on what a person has learned and that there should be an easy way to look at a more detailed report of learning from any meaningful course. They also believe in learning at one’s own pace and will validate learning whenever the user has completed a degree, according to the site specifications. Degreed is actively working to change credentialing by validating learning from multiple physical institutions and/or multiple online educational courses. This is similar in spirit to the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges">Mozilla Open Badges</a> project, which encourages lifelong learning and recognizes accomplishments for future education or employment. With projects like these and others popping up, the days of traditional educational institutions holding a monopoly on the validation of learning achievements may be nearing an end.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>Degreed is a way to tell the whole story of your learning career.</p>
