<p>Produced by Clockwork Fox Studios, <a href="https://www.zorbitsmath.com/">Zorbit’s Math Adventure</a> is a game-based math learning platform for students in kindergarten through third grade. The game follows three characters in a space-themed storyline wherein players must help the characters solve math emergencies across the galaxy. The platform features a teacher dashboard for instructors to see real-time student performance, track progress, and manipulate game controls, and also includes teaching activities and worksheets to foster a blended learning environment.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The creative energy that clearly went into the development of Zorbit’s Math Adventure is a big part of why this platform is so effective. Beyond the fun, high production value animations, the storyline, gamification of tasks, and dozens of unique characters show that the creators have really put their imaginations to work. From spooky Ida the Spida (who has a strong Jersey accent) to an inventor caveman named DUH-vinci, the game definitely creates memorable experiences.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best result of this creativity is the wide variety of unique games in Zorbit’s Math Adventure. At each grade level there are three to five planets to explore, each corresponding to a different strand of math concepts. Each planet’s inhabitants have a different problem which players work to solve through a series of games increasing in difficulty. The fact that each planet features a variety of new, unique games is impressive, and the variation keeps the player’s interest.</p>
 
<p>Since Zorbit’s Math includes a comprehensive teacher dashboard with live updates, customization, and personalization, the game is also quite practical for classroom use. Teachers can see what math concepts students are struggling with based on their scores for each game. Content aligns with Common Core and Canadian curriculum standards, and its aim to foster positive problem-solving experiences has the real potential to build students’ self-confidence in math. Additionally, worksheets and other activities are provided so that teachers can easily connect online learning to in-class learning.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>When talking to some of the Zorbit’s Math team, they mentioned that the robot Serena is the "imbedded help button," which is clever. However, Serena’s tips are largely retroactive; there are few verbal instructions at the beginning of the games, and having the ability to click on Serena for more thorough or repeated instructions, or for examples, could help prevent frustration and confusion.</p>

<p>There were also a few minor technical mistakes I encountered in the game (stating a picture was above a dinosaur’s head when it wasn’t, characters’ mouths not moving when they speak), and the loading screen in the first grade game kept flashing a line of text about "asteroids destroyed" which made no sense and felt like a glitch.</p>

<p>The Zorbit’s Math team is currently working on updating several features of the game, so the other concerns I had, such as the ability to move between different concepts in a strand instead of linearly, are being addressed.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Both as a platform and as a series of fun learning games, Zorbit’s Math Adventure delivers on what it promises. While there are a few things that still need to be worked out, I was impressed by the games and the teacher dashboard, and think it has great potential to be a valuable classroom learning tool.</p>
