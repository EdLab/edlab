          <p>
            A few years ago, I was talking with a friend who attended one of NYC's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_high_schools_in_New_York_City">specialized public high schools</a>, which require an admissions test called the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/YearlyTesting/TestInformation/Specialized+High+School+Admissions.htm">SHSAT.</a>  She told me that a lot of the kids she knew hadn't gotten into high school by doing well on the test, but rather had found clever ways to use technology to cheat the system. I remember her saying "It doesn't really matter, it's just the way they prove that they're smart. And they'll just keep doing it."

<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10267489-94.html?tag=mncol;txt">Surveys</a> released last week reported that using mobile devices and other technologies to cheat on tests is now common practice among teens. Furthermore, many of these students don't view these actions as cheating at all (or so they reported in the surveys).

Columnist Larry Magid remarks, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19518_3-10270987-238.html?tag=newsFeaturedBlogArea.0">"I'm appalled that kids may be using technology to cheat in school, but I'm just as appalled at how schools are cheating kids when it comes to technology."</a> Is this cheating behavior just evidence of the fact that schools need to change their teaching methods to account for new technology and to emphasize the use of these tools within the classroom?  

Additionally, how much should schools be changing their testing practices to assess not only what students know but how they use technology to access and analyze this knowledge?  Will students someday need to display their technological aptitude on college applications in addition to their SAT scores?
