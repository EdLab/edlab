<p>"This clothing test will reveal if you’re an extrovert or introvert." "This quiz will determine if you’re an optimist or a pessimist." Those are some examples of the <i>self-discovery</i> quizzes you can find on Buzzfeed or your Facebook News Feed. However, these gimmicky tests don’t tell us much about ourselves. In fact, it can be said that most people only take these questionnaires to confirm ideas they already believe about themselves. But what if our self-perception is inaccurate? The new <a href="https://2gno.me/experts/">2gnō.me platform</a> is a research-based personality assessment that helps professionals identify their soft skills. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>2gnō.me allows users to assess their soft skills collaboratively. The premise of the project is that people see themselves in different ways than they are perceived. The system asks users to input their understanding of their soft skills; it then assesses them and provides qualitative and quantitative results. The platform also allows users' coworkers and peers to evaluate them to provide a more comprehensive and objective understanding of how their actions are perceived. For example, when identifying your <i>innovation</i> skills, you may answer a question like, "My CEO sends a memo about the new vision for the company's future. After reading it during a break, I will . . ." The platform is simple to use and full of tips and tricks to help users develop their soft skills. There is also a special quiz section for educators. This helps them understand their teaching styles so they can learn how much their work style aligns with the UNICEF approved <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards/standards-for-teachers">ISTE Standards</a>.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>2gnō.me is relatively new, so there are a few bugs. For example, some of its links do not work. Also, the specialty quizzes for educators are not free. To view the results, you must pay a fee. Each soft skill evaluation only consists of 7 to 10 questions before the results come up based on your responses. Some might wonder if you need more than a few questions to determine whether someone is courageous or innovative.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p> Soft skills have been cited as the power skills edtech entrepreneurs are looking for in their new hires. However, more often than not, regular curriculum and standardized testing ignore these skills. Though 2gnō.me still needs some development, the concept is promising, and the current platform is worth exploring.</p>
