          <p>
            The end of the 2010 marked a turning point in the proud and rich history of the Middle East. No one could have imagined that when a disenchanted Tunisian doused himself in flames outside a government office that a full-blown regional revolution was underway. We all know what has happened since then. Ben Ali of Tunisia was forced after over two decades in power. Neighboring Egypt, the largest and arguably most influential country in the Arab world, and its longtime leader Hosni Mubarak, was next to fall. The peaceful revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, amicably called the Arab Spring, has since given way to brutal crackdowns in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and Libya.

Though the fate of the region still hangs in the balance, one constant throughout these revolutions has been the role of young people. With constant protest, rallies and demonstration, along with the use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, they have been able to raise awareness and organize demonstrations on a large scale. More importantly, they have led the movement on the ground with many sacrificing their lives as a result. The hopes and aspirations of young Arabs have been highlighted by the New York Times in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/03/20/world/middleeast/middle-east-voices.html#0">video/slideshow</a> feature in which they share a few words with outsiders. I found their views and ideas not different from those of any oppressed person, however I was really impressed by their willingness to essentially die for a better tomorrow.
