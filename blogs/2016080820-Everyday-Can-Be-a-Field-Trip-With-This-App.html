<p>Are you the type of person who enjoyed class trips when you were younger? If so, you’ll likely enjoy <a href="https://www.fieldtripper.com">Field Trip</a>, an app that highlights the learning possibilities in everyday life. Field Trip combines data from dozens of online databases, such as <a href="http://architizer.com">Architizer</a> and <a href="http://nerdtrips.net">Nerd Trips</a>, and alerts you about noteworthy locations nearby. Users are able to view the sites on Google Maps and read information on each.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Field Trip is chock-full of interesting trivia, from historical sites to movie locations to hidden gem restaurants. Granted, New York City provides a denser informational landscape than most cities, but for any given five-block radius span in the city, Field Trip provided dozens of interesting facts. I learned that I walk by Humphrey Bogart’s childhood home on a regular basis and that an American Revolution battle happened two blocks from work. The app also alerted me as I walked by an unassuming French restaurant in the West Village that serves <i>vin chaud</i> (hot wine) in the winter and lets customers play <i>pétanque</i> (French bocce). Not that the app knew about my love of French culture, but the coincidence was greatly appreciated.</p>
 
 <p>Notifications can be catered to individual interests. Whether you want frequent alerts, none at all, or only for interesting architecture sites, Field Trip is adaptable. In addition to notification banners, users can also receive audio alerts as they walk by interesting locations, detailing the site’s name and description.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Field Trip touts itself as an augmented reality app, I didn’t notice anything particularly augmented. I suppose the creators are referring to the app’s voice notification capabilities, but that counts as augmented reality as much as listening to music via headphones does. That aside, while I enjoyed the text notification banners popping up on my phone’s screen, the voice notifications were less agreeable. They appeared at random moments, even when the app was off (though the settings can be changed on this), and drowned out the sound of the podcast I had playing.</p>
 
<p>In addition, the voice would be much more enjoyable to listen to if it were spoken by a human rather than a Siri-esque bot. If you plan to use the voice notification feature of this app, I recommend doing so with earphones on and no music or podcasts playing, at least not any you mind periodically cutting out around historical facts.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Whether you’re traveling to a new city or just want to explore the one you’re in, Field Trip is a great way to discover hidden gems and long-lost histories that you might never know otherwise. Though I’m never sure what pieces of information will pop up on my screen as I travel from neighborhood to neighborhood, one things is certain: I’ll be keeping this one on my phone.</p>
