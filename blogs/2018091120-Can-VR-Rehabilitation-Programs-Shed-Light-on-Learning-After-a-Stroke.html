<p>Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm">has a stroke</a>. With strokes being a leading cause of death and serious <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/135/10/e146.long#sec-250"> long-term disability</a>, finding ways to reteach motor skills and cognitive processes is critical. Though there are of course many traditional rehabilitation strategies, researchers in Portugal were curious about the feasibility of a newer tool in aiding stroke recovery with greater success: virtual reality.</p>
 
<p>In a pilot study, researchers attempted to use VR to reteach certain motor competencies as well as cognitive tasks related to attention, memory, and executive functioning to stroke patients. Typically, cognitive rehab relies on paper-and-pencil tasks, but as the researchers point out, this method doesn’t deliver immediate feedback or reinforcement of progress, and so may lead to decreasing motivation. In addition, written tasks prevent individuals whose dominant arm mobility was affected by the stroke from improving their cognitive abilities. Therefore, VR could offer a positive alternative.</p>

<p>The study featured 24 participants in the chronic stage of stroke with both cognitive and motor deficits. 12 participants were guided through a VR program consisting of 12 sessions of 45 minutes three times a week for one month, while the other 12 participants received standard training and therapy over the same period of time. The VR program, designed with input from 20 health professionals, consisted of different tasks requiring identification of targets in the form of symbols, numbers, and letters as would typically be used in paper-and-pencil tasks with different levels of difficulty.</p>
 
<p>After a month of rehab, while both groups improved motor skills, those that went through VR rehabilitation saw improvement in motor function double that of the control group. Cognitive improvements were high in both groups, particularly when it came to recall, but interestingly, the control group saw a greater increase in language abilities while the VR group saw a greater increase in orientation. Therefore, while the VR program was able to improve upon some aspects of traditional rehabilitation, other areas require further attention. </p>

<p>Though this initial study was small, it has generated important data for the further development of effective rehabilitation tools. With continued work, larger-scale adoptions of VR to reteach those who have suffered strokes might just change the future of rehabilitation.</p>
