<p>Humans of New York (HONY) has been one of the internet’s most popular blogs since 2010. On it, photographer Brandon Stanton features the stories of ordinary people he meets on the streets in NYC. This blog is an example of an emerging field of storytelling called networked narratives: stories told on social media that readers are able to like, share, and comment on. Because of this, these stories offer real-time, two-way communication between reader and content creator.</p>
 
<p>The authors of a recent study examined what factors contribute to the popularity of a networked narrative by conducting content analyses on 390 HONY posts spanning five months in 2015. They were looking for the most common topics featured on the HONY blog, as well as the relationship between those topics and social media engagement, which was measured in number of likes, comments, and shares. In addition, they examined how tone and length affect social media engagement.</p>
 
<p>Regarding their first question, and perhaps unsurprising to any avid HONY readers, the researchers found that the three most common topics featured on the blog were family, career, and romantic relationships. Regarding social media engagement, they found that people who talked about having or achieving their dreams received the most likes (above careers and friendship) and that posts concerning education were shared the greatest number of times (above career, family, and romantic relationships). In addition, they found that characters seemed more likable when they discussed education and romantic relationships than any other topic.</p>

<p>Finally, the researchers found that the tone of posts, but not the length, affects the number of likes ireceived. In other words, the more positive the tone, the more likes a post is likely to receive. Both tone and length, however, affect the number of shares. Lengthy posts with positive tones were more likely to be shared than others.</p>
 
<p>Although this research specifically focused on HONY, it has implications for networked narratives at large. The most successful networked narratives have the most social media engagement, so an analysis of what increases a blog’s popularity could help other content creators achieve greater success.</p>
