<p><b>Title:</b> Structural and Cognitive Bottlenecks to Information Access in Social Networks (2013)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Jeon-Hyung Kang & Kristina Lerman</p>
<b>Source:</b> 
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2481492">Proceedings of the 24th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media</a>
</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
There are several influential theories that examine social network structure, particularly the role of the individual in distributing information within a network and the flow of information between weak and strong ties. These theories have been validated by many studies, but it is not clear that we can apply them to online networks. Social media enables users to broadcast messages to their followers quickly and effectively. This unique and trackable action encouraged the authors of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0861">Structural and Cognitive Bottlenecks to Information Access in Social Networks</a> to test information brokerage theories in the context of online communities. The paper examines the ways users of social news aggregator <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> adopt stories recommended by friends and users they follow. To examine the dynamics of network structure, user activity, and information content, the authors measured the impact of several factors including network position, activity rate, the asymmetry of social links, and access to novel content.</p> 

<p>The authors examined data generated in 2009-2010 which consisted of nearly 82,000 users and 3 million social links in the follower graph. They selected users for the study who voted on Digg at least ten times during the study period, which represented around 5,000 users. For each user, the authors took into consideration network size, network diversity, average friend activity, overall activity, topic diversity, novel information, and novel information potential. Novel information potential was set up by the researchers to measure the novel information adoption rate of a participant’s friends. The rest of the variables followed definitions based on existing literature. The authors conducted several correlation analyses within the variables.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The authors divided users into three different population groups based on number of active friends. The network size and average friend activity for these three groups were significantly negatively correlated. Users with bigger and more diverse networks received fewer average story recommendations from any particular friend than users with smaller and less diverse networks. There was also a strong negative relationship between friend activity and topic diversity. This demonstrated that users in small and strongly-tied networks had similar topical interests, not because of uniform preferences in the general network for particular topics but because of similarities between friends’ topic preferences in a tightly clustered network. This means that users in networks full of active friends increase their access to novel information because their friends adopt a large portion of the circulating information. While increasing network diversity or size can provide access to more topically diverse friends, it does not necessarily result in increased access to novel information. These results suggest that there are bottlenecks that limit access to novel information in online social networks. Users' network size is highly related to topic diversity, and thus the mechanisms to help users adopt novel information become even more important in diverse networks.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
It is valuable to be aware of the pitfalls and hidden structure hampering information access in online social networks. The edtech community should be cautious about building learning platforms purely based on social networks because these groups tend to restrict the flow of diverse information. This research warns of similar problems as Eli Pariser’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Filter-Bubble-Personalized-Changing-Think/dp/0143121235">filter bubble</a> theory of the personalized web. Network planners, especially in education communities, should endeavor to facilitate the sharing of diverse information because it does not seem that this happens naturally in social networks.</p>
