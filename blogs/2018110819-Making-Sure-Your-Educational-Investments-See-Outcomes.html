<p><i>"Student outcomes are your primary goal. Maximizing your Education Return on Investment is ours." </i> (<a href="http://www.glimpsek12.com/">Glimpse</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>A Way to Evaluate and Improve a School’s Investments</b></p>

<p>The number of different educational tools and touted solutions offered to schools each year can be overwhelming; how do administrators know which of the programs they chose to implement are a good fit for their district? Glimpse is a company that was created after its founders realized exactly how difficult it is for administrators to answer this question. Because many are unaware of how to determine which programs, products, and services legitimately contribute to student achievement, administrators often implement improvement plans that have been developed without sufficient or accurate information. Glimpse wants to prevent this waste of time and resources by helping school districts look at their Education Return on Investment (eROI).</p>

<p>Through an online platform, Glimpse helps administrators evaluate which programs and tools impact student achievement to maximize a district or school’s eROI. Glimpse's scalable eROI model leads to more intelligent spending and allocation of resources in order to promote better student performance and achievement.</p>

<p><b>Looking at the Past to Determine the Future</b></p>

<p>Glimpse follows a three step process when working with a school: identify the current eROI, evaluate how good that eROI is, and determine the best plan of action to make long term investments pay off. Identifying and evaluating current practices are crucial, but Glimpse also recognizes the importance of creating a plan for administrators to engage in more effective spending based on the specific goals they desire, such as higher graduation rate, improved social-emotional learning, better use of technology, and increased personalized learning.</p> 

<p>The Glimpse platform features a dashboard that tracks spending and budget while monitoring the effectiveness of the tools, programs, and curricula employed in a given school or district. In this way, administrators can optimize their budgets by investing only in services that prove to increase student outcomes. In tracking all expenditures, Glimpse also helps increase transparency. Glimpse hopes that it can make administrators more accountable to their district and make the programs the district utilizes accountable to its administrators.</p>
