          <p>
            Shortly after I posted my last post, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8847">a primer on being a woman in engineering</a>, it seems there were some both exciting and disappointing developments in our very own sector.

First off, Jessica of fellow edtech start-up Khan Academy <a href="http://life.khanacademy.org/post/43028679096/girls-girls-girls">posted about how at the time, twice as many women had accepted summer internship offers as men</a> and talked a little about what it's like to be a woman at their company. (The bottom line: it sounds pretty darn great! Very much like our culture here at EdLab.)

Then <a href="http://twitter.com/jeresig">John Resig</a> posted a link to her blog post on his Twitter, and the responses were... well... I'll just let you see for yourself:

<a href="http://imgur.com/tnmgl7B"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tnmgl7B.png" alt="" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a>

This prompted Ben Kamens, their lead dev, to <a href="http://bjk5.com/post/43249906199/meritocracy-and-discrimination-in-tech">write a very thoughtful post on his own blog about meritocracy and discrimination in tech</a>. His point is that it's both justified and a good idea to celebrate milestones for underrepresented groups like women and young people; I like how he frames the backlash:
<blockquote>It doesn't help to be an industry obsessed with meritocracy if the first reaction to an altered status quo is that OUR MERITOCRACY MUST BE BROKEN, SOUND THE ALARMS. That's an [...] old-timer's club.</blockquote>

(A couple of good reads on some of the topics Ben brings up: <a href="http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/06/03/faq-arent-feminists-just-sexists-towards-men/">Aren't Feminists Just Sexists Towards Men?</a> and <a href="http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/10/18/phmt-argument/">But What About The Menz?</a> from Feminism101.)

Anyway, rather than dwelling on the negative incidents... I'm just going to focus on the good news that Khan Academy, like Etsy, has become another company that has wholeheartedly proven its commitment to creating a better world for women in tech. And it's exciting that this is a company in our own field! Hopefully both Khan Academy and EdLab together can help make sure that edtech is one part of the tech world where women engineers continue to feel comfortable and accepted. :)
