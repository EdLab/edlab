<p><i>"We are helping to build a community — including parents, educators, caregivers, researchers, and leaders — united by a belief in the importance of creative free play to help our children grow up happy and healthy."</i> (from the <a href="http://www.imaginationplayground.com/">Imagination Playground</a> site)</p>

<p>Brought to you by the designers of The Oscars awards ceremony, the restaurant design of Nobo, Broadway musical set design, and countless other examples of design and theatrically, understated or overstated as the occasion demands, is <a href="http://www.rockwellgroup.com/">David Rockwell</a>’s latest venture into education: the <a href="http://www.imaginationplayground.com/">Imagination Playground</a>. This dynamic space, when seen out of place, looks like a collection of oversized, Smurf blue noodles for the beginning swimmer. Actually, these blue blocks are expertly crafted to enable children and adults to build out imagined environments that they can play in, on, and around.</p>

<p><b>Inspiration</b><br>
David Rockwell, founder of the Rockwell Architect Group, was inspired by watching his daughter at play to design a playground that could be constructed by its users. Rockwell firmly believes in the place of the playground in education, both for exercise and for imaginative play. He also <a href=" http://www.imaginationplayground.com/">recognizes</a> that when budgets and space are cut, the playground is the first to go. As such, his design is affordable and easily scalable. For context, traditional playgrounds typically cost in the millions to build. The Imagination Playground costs $6,000 and is flexible to accommodate many different uses.</p>

<p><b>Educational Benefits</b><br>
Beyond play and exercise, the Imagination Playground "combines the sensory, motor, and intellectual development benefits of block play in a flexible and adaptable format that encourages greater collaboration and physical activity."  This kind of play is proven to create pathways for release of creative energies that lead to an increased ability to focus. The Rockwell group cites research, including a 2001 study in the <a href=" http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02568540109594958 ">Journal of Research in Childhood Education</a> which tracked 37 preschoolers to show a correlation between sophisticated block play and higher grades in math continuously through high school.  Other benefits include increased collaboration among students, better mathematical understanding, and enhanced spatial awareness as students engage in building. </p>
 
<p><b>In and Around Town</b><br>
Currently in New York there is a <a href=" http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/design/extraordinary-playgrounds-in-new-york-city-boroughs.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& ">public Imagination Playground</a> made up of 350 pieces on Fulton Street in downtown Manhattan. In addition, a number of schools in New York City have purchased the playground.</p>
