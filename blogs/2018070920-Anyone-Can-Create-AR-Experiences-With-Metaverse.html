<p><a href="https://gometa.io/">Metaverse</a> is a free tool for augmented reality exploration and creation. The platform allows creators to make or use interactive exhibitions, scavenger hunts, and other experiences in augmented reality (AR).</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The Metaverse library is free to access via a phone or tablet. Simply download the app, search the library, and choose an AR experience to explore. The library is sorted by various categories, such as education, trivia, challenges, and other experiences.</p>  

<p>The real innovative feature to Metaverse is that it allows anyone to easily create AR experiences. Content can be created through <a href="
https://studio.gometa.io">Metaverse Studios</a>, which can be accessed via a computer instead of a phone or tablet. Before using this tool, I suggest first watching the <a href="
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=N4hNoo5g_Is">short introduction video</a> just to get familiar with the system. But, it’s actually fairly straightforward to use, with many point-and-click or drag-and-drop features. There is no coding required.</p>

 <p>I created a simple scavenger hunt for my colleagues where they had to find a few items for a robot visitor, Robert Boterson the III. The platform has a seemingly unlimited number of AR characters, but I picked a robot because <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/search?q=robots">of our affinity for them</a>. In my simple challenge, they had to take a picture of a plant and then their <i>NLT</i> favorite article, which Metaverse was able to easily detect. The challenge was surprisingly easy to make, and my colleagues had some good laughs playing through it!</p>    

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Metaverse’s biggest con is its library, which is mostly full of low-quality content. Most of the games or challenges do not make use of the platform’s innovative features and seem to be filler content. For instance, the top trending item in Metaverse’s library is the "Zombie Challenge," which asks users to take a picture of themselves walking like a zombie, and that’s it. Nothing else! The library could really benefit from some serious quality control. </p>

<p>Another drawback is the lack of explanations and sample templates for more advanced customization in experience creation. While I found it fairly easy to use the basic functions on Metaverse Studios, I could never figure out some of the more complicated features.</p>

<p>There are also a few minor bugs in Metaverse. For instance, the virtual characters seemingly appear at random when using the AR, so there is a lot of spinning around to find them during challenges and exhibitions.</p>   

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Without considerable training, creating AR experiences is impossible for most people on complicated apps like Apple’s ARKit. Metaverse makes this process very simple and accessible to basically anyone. While the library is not worthwhile, the free customizable AR platform is a tool that innovative teachers and curious learners should check out.  </p>
