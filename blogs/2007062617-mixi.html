          <p>
            I would like you to take a look at the biggest Social networking service in Japan, mixi, launched in 2004. The active users total more than 10 million now, or 1 out of 12 Japanese. You can imagine how popular the system is.  

Thanks to Christine, who blogged about this before, you have already gotten the idea of mixi. Let me take you to real mixi web-page.

<a href="http://mixi.jp/home.pl">mixi site</a> 
log in: mdc@tc.edu
password: tcedlab

You will get to the top page of "edlab" account. 

It displays a selection of our friends (under the edlab image: Joachim, Naoko and Nobi are our friends, "My mixi," so far), a list of their latest blog posts and photos and the latest news from our communities (Communities are showed under "My mixi"). You can also see the most recent visitors to our page( Second from the right of second tool bar, on the top). 

Mixi also includes user reviews. Users can rate and review books, CDs, DVDs, games, electronics and other items. Clicking on a product takes you to the relevant page on Amazon Japan. 

The biggest difference between mixi and other networking sites is its anti-anonymousness. You invite people to mixi only if you know him/her in the real world. You select who can read your blog from your friends. People feel comfortable putting their names, photos and, personal information because they can trace who is visiting their pages. 

We use mixi to keep in touch with our old acquaintances, while adding our new ones and then introducing them to each other (both online and offline). This way of knowing each other is based on Japanese customs. We feel more comfortable when someone introduce his/her new friend to us than being contacted by a stranger directly.  

What's more, we are well known for "shy" nationality. Even though we want someone to know what we're thinking about and how we really feel, we aren't accustomed to exchange opinions frankly in public. Therefore we need some contrary spaces to be a little bit honest.

These elements seem to have been making mixi bigger and bigger.  

I hope you will enjoy exploring it!
