          <p>
            Unless you haven’t been on the internet in a few years, you’ve probably come across an article written in list form. Although the most notorious of the list-donning news websites is Buzzfeed, the trend has created dozens of lesser-known spinoffs and spread to sites such as the Huffington Post and the Atlantic. B.J. Novak even created an app specifically for this phenomenon, <a href="https://li.st/">The List App</a>, where people communicate with others exclusively through lists. As more articles and other interactions take on a listed form, I can’t help but ask what is it about the list that captivates us so much<sup>1</sup>? 

Maria Konnikova, author of Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes (a book that has been on my to-read list for far too long) <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-list-of-reasons-why-our-brains-love-lists">wrote an article about list-loving</a> and thinks that one reason we’re drawn to lists comes from our inherent longing for organizing the world. From the moment we first see something, our brains try to categorize it into a field of already known knowledge in order to make sense of it. This is trickier to do with text written in paragraphs (sorry, readers). When we see a list, however, the hard work of analyzing and categorizing has already been done for us. Things already have an order, meaning we can relax into a relative mindlessness as we scan through. To put it as concisely as Konnikova, “lists simply feel better.”

It’s not the case, however, that lists feel better because they are pleasant, but rather because they are pleasurable. It doesn’t just feel nice to reach the end of a list—it feels good. Everyone who has ever worked through a to-do list knows the rush of satisfaction attached to checking off each item<sup>2</sup>.  Yet this rush isn’t just something we imagine—it’s actually the reward system of our brains releasing dopamine, giving us the chemical equivalent of a thumbs up. Interestingly, dopamine is released in our brains when we think we are being productive, <a href="http://www.papermag.com/neuroscientist-daniel-levitin-explains-why-multitasking-is-a-harmful-a-1427418237.html">such as when we’re multitasking</a>, even if we aren’t necessarily completing things efficiently. In other words, regardless of whether or not we’re actually being productive, as long as we feel like we are, ours brain will fire away dopamine. This means that when we work our way through lists in articles, we could be subconsciously checking items off one-by-one, causing a small release of dopamine at the completion of each task.

The feeling is even greater when we work our way to the end of a listed article. If we make it through all <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/bennyjohnson/things-conservatives-would-rather-do-than-watch-obamas-state#.iqMj0bLv">37 Things Conservatives Would Rather Do Than Watch Obama's State Of The Union Speech</a> (e.g., do the Harlem shake) and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/things-that-will-make-you-say-nooooooo">20 Things That Will Make You Say NOOOOOOO</a>, we feel like we’ve accomplished something and been productive, even if we’ve lost an IQ point or two in the process.

Of course, there’s the fact that lists just seem to fit into our busy lifestyles, too. While we might not be interested in delving into a multi-page article on the subway ride home<sup>3</sup>,  a 15-piece list feels manageable to scroll through. Plus, if you lose your place because you have to shirk off a fellow passenger that feel asleep on your shoulder, it’s easy to find again.

Basically, there are many reasons that lists are an attractive form of journalism right now. Not only does it fit into our fast-paced lives, it also gives us the sense of being productive and the rush of dopamine that comes with it. Even the most pointless Buzzfeed articles are orderly and to the point—everything has already been analyzed into bite-sized bits we can’t help but sink our teeth into.

I know, I know. All this talk about why lists feel good to read, and I’m not giving the people what they want. Fear not, readers. Because I believe that where a list is like a pack of Reese’s Pieces, an article is like a full meal. It might take longer to digest, but hopefully is more filling and nourishing in the end.



Footnotes
<ol>
<li>I say this with to-do list close at hand.
<li>I have even heard people say they include “make a to-do list” to the top of their to-do lists just so they have something to immediately cross off.
<li>I can’t be the only one who finds it difficult to concentrate stuffed in between a stroller and a man cleanly his ears VERY efficiently with a q-tip. Like, what is even in your ear that it takes so long to do this? Also, why choose to do this surrounded by people in between 72nd and 96th?
