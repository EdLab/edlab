Russell Stannard has made his mission to improve the way teachers learn. Stannard is the founder of <a href="http://www.teachertrainingvideos.com/">Teacher Training Videos</a> a site that provides free help videos to teachers who want to use information and communications technology (ICT) in their teaching. The site averages 350,000 visits per year. Stannard has won three major education awards from the British Council, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/"> the Times Higher Education</a> and the University of Westminster. He currently works part-time at the University of Warwick as Principal Teaching Fellow and spends the rest of his time travelling the world giving presentations and workshops. He has worked in no less than 26 countries in various capacities.

<p><b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I started <a href="http://www.teachertrainingvideos.com/">Teacher Training Videos</a> because I write a column in a magazine called the <a href=" http://www.etprofessional.com/etp/default.aspx">English Teaching Professional </a> and teachers kept asking me questions about technologies. They didn't know how to create a blog, a wiki, a podcast etc., so I began making help videos to show them what to do. I got a lot of positive reaction from the videos and so I decided to put them all online and make them free. So I created a website called www.teachertrainingvideos.com. The website took off almost instantly and within a year I had won the Times Higher 'Outstanding Initiative in ICT', which is a pretty prestigious award here in the UK and that was followed by the British Council ELTons Technology award and one from the University of Westminster too. It generated lots of publicity.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Well, in all honesty, it is the fact I don't find technology easy. I always have to work at it and I think that makes me conscious of the problems that teachers might have if they learn the technologies too. Teachers always tell me that the videos are really clear and that I seem to anticipate the tricky bits. That is probably because I found them tricky too. People who use the videos probably get the impression that I am a natural with technology. Actually it often takes me ages to make a set of videos, it rarely comes easy.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think ICT has a lot of value. Students use ICT in their working lives and in their social lives and yet a lot of teachers are still making very little use of it in schools. We must look at the lives our students live and develop an education around them. John Dewey was saying this over 100 years ago. Students will need skills in ICT more and more. Much of the communication they do will be through ICT, much of their social lives will be based around ICT. Our job as teachers is to get 'in' there and guide them and make them aware of effective ways to use technology, how to be safe with it, how to be aware of copyright, and how to use it for learning etc. If we don't, I honestly think we are doing our students an injustice.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Funny, I just did a closing plenary about this very topic. Our role as teachers will change massively in the future. The information and knowledge is out there. Our job will be more and more about helping students to become better learners so that they can make use of the incredible amount of information and learning opportunities that now exist.  It won't be about teachers imparting knowledge; it will be about teachers helping students to be more autonomous in their approach to learning and to be better learners. These learners will be good at finding content, good at evaluating its relevance, aware of how the information may be manipulating, good at re purposing it etc.,
<p>
They will have the skills necessary to work in teams. Whether it is asking their peers for help while studying or doing projects in groups, collaboration will be at the heart of much of our education. The ability to work in teams and collaborate is a skill that companies need and one that will take them a long way. Employers need employees who are able to work with different types of people, drawing on different skills and sharing and communicating their ideas. In the past, education has been very atomized. We learn math, English, history as if there is no relationship between them. Education and learning will be about finding the connections, bringing information and knowledge from different fields and using it.  
<p>
These are two huge challenges that will keep teachers very busy. First, helping and supporting students to become more autonomous in their attitude to learning and more independent/interdependent in their approach. Second, fostering the skills of teamwork and collaboration.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am working on an online project with Norwich Institute of Languages around Autonomous Learning. I am working on a European Union project with teachers from all over Europe on a project to help teachers use video in their teaching. I am developing online learning content for the Indian market with the British Council and also doing a book on ICT and Language teaching. So keeping really busy and of course I am continually making new videos for my own website. There are about 350,000 visits to the site each year, so people expect to see new content on-line all the time. At the moment I am making videos on Edmodo, Moodle and also Techsmith Camtasia.
