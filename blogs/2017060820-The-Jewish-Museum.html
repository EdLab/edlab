About once every other month on a Wednesday afternoon, the only sound you'll hear floating through <a href= "http://thejewishmuseum.org/">The Jewish Museum </a>
is the gentle voice of art educator Olivia Swisher as she leads a group of art admirers, and a few dogs, through the cavernous space located in the center of Museum Mile. They have the exhibition space all to themselves for the intimate <a href= "http://thejewishmuseum.org/programs/visitors-with-disabilities#blind 
">Verbal Description Tour </a> which is designed for those who are blind or have low vision. In late November of 2016, the tour featured the exhibition "Memphis does Hanukkah," an iteration of the Masterpieces and Curiosities series meant to generate discussion around relationships and dissonances between art and design, tradition and innovation, ceremony and interpretation.</p>

<p>The Jewish Museum itself is a coalition of ideas. While the name of the museum may suggest a narrow focus, the institution is "all about removing barriers" according to Senior Manager of School Programs and outreach, Dara Cohen-Vasquez. The Jewish Museum offers universal appeal through its expansive art collection spanning 4,000 years, connection to culture, and its exploration of broad themes. Access programming, or equal opportunities for people of all abilities, is another component of this aspirational vision of total inclusion and inspired by the Americans with Disabilities Act passed in 1990. To help bring the experience of art closer to those who cannot see it, educators at The Jewish Museum accompany their detailed vocal explanations with something called touch objects that turn visual art into a tactile experience. These can include raised line drawings of paintings or sections of paintings, miniatures, or full recreations of works. With a collection of effective tools on hand and a commitment to accessibility, The Jewish Museum is making the opportunity to engage with artwork available to everyone.</p>
