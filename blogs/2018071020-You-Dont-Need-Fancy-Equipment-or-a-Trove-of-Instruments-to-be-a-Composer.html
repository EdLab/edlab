<p><a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/">Song Maker</a>,the newest addition to <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/">Chrome Music Lab</a>, allows users to create music by simply clicking spaces on a grid that correspond to notes on a scale. With the ability to change instrumentation, scale type, time signature, tempo, and range, Song Maker is a fun introduction to basic composing that is both sharable and free.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Chrome Song Maker is a very intuitive tool, making it an easy way to jump into composing no matter your musical background. While the program might start off as a simple distraction, after giving in to the temptation to randomly tap the brightly colored tiles or create some sort of pattern out of them, it can become addictive as you learn what actually sounds good. Through a mixture of creative experimentation and an introduction to the mathematics of music, Song Maker can inspire truly good compositions.</p>

<p>One thing I loved about Chrome Song Maker is that it is a scalable tool; if you have no prior experience with music, or if you are a child, you can learn through experimentation, and create content however it makes sense to you. If, however, you know a bit about music, you can also make more rhythmically complex pieces, add countermelodies, and adjust scale and length settings.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While I was pleasantly surprised by how many settings I could adjust in Song Maker, there were a few functions that were lacking. First, a better playback feature would be appreciated. As it stands, the program doesn’t allow you to listen to a single segment of your composition; you can only play the piece in its entirety every time. Additionally, I would have liked the ability to compose with more than one type of instrument at a time and create sustained pitches.</p>
 
 <p>Chrome Song Maker does a decent job of simulating composition without requiring an actual instrument, but it is important to remember that this is an introductory tool for amateurs and doesn’t replicate the experience of professional composers.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Chrome Song Maker is a great program for anyone wanting to try some low-stakes composing or introduce their children to the art of songwriting. For the rest of us, it’s simply good fun.</p>
