<p><a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> is a brain training program that claims to help users improve memory, attention, and even intelligence. The site collects game play data for its own R&D and for outside research studies in brain plasticity. For example, a recently published study <a href="http://static.sl.lumosity.com/pdf/hardy_drescher_sarkar_kellet_scanlon_2011.pdf">paper</a> in the <i>MENSA Research Journal</i> found memory and attention benefits for participants after 10 hours of Lumosity game play. Though it is characterized as a game, <a href="http://stories.lumosity.com/">many users</a> schedule daily play as a way to improve cognitive function or as a remedy for age-related decline. The system is popular, with over 100,000 users per day and 35 million registered users.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Lumosityâ€™s games are challenging and varied. Manageable in the beginning, the games quickly escalate in difficulty. The system is filled with gamified reward elements like Lumosity points, which users accrue for improvement and frequency of play. The main game interface is easy to understand and navigate with a prominent calendar for keeping track of play in each week.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Though new users will likely be able to navigate the site easily, some elements of Lumosity might cause confusion. The basic free account is very restricted with most games and analytics behind a paywall. The play page uses the euphemism "unblock full access" to mask account types until users reach the payment page. The Lumosity points seem to have no clear purpose and might seem condescending to users.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Lumosity offers a great theory and a compelling practice that could benefit from more explanation. It is unclear whether Lumosity has sold or intends to sell user data to outside researchers. So far it appears that the data has been used for internal research, but it seems a violation of internet etiquette to charge users and sell their data in turn. Systems like <a href="http://duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> and <a href="http://www.grantoo.org/">Grantoo</a> have taken natural user activity to market in their products; Duolingo has built a translation service into its language learning tools and Grantoo has corralled like users to compete for ad revenue. A more thorough explanation of the business model or a justification for the paywall might help attract more users. That said, plenty of users seem interested in the cognitive benefits of systems like Lumosity, and the combination of gaming and proven brain improvement could have significant impact on the role of technology and games in education.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Lumosity promises cognitive benefits and delivers challenging games.</p>
