            What is the value of a college degree these days? Most recent college graduates cannot find a job after graduating. This problem is even worse when you consider most of these recent graduates must find a way to pay back student loans. Student loans amount to an investment in one's future as college has been historically seen as the path to success. However, with tuition at an all time high, students are taking out more loans to finance their education. A lack of job prospects for recent graduates couple with overwhelming student loans have led many to reconsider the value of a college education.
 
In this <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/12/27/college-degrees-are-vastly-overrated-as-todays-entrepreneurial-dropouts-routinely-reveal/">op-ed</a> piece from Forbes, the author makes a case against college noting that some of the most successful entrepreneurs didn't even graduate college. We know household names like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Virgin's Richard Bronson and Bill Gates didn't graduate college but lesser known entrepreneurs such as Digg founder Kevin Rose and Spotify's Daniel Ek also did not graduate college. As a current college freshman, I have yet to decide on a major as I have varied academic and personal interests. I definitely do plan on graduating college but with the aforementioned financial and career problems associated with higher education these days, is a college degree worth it?
