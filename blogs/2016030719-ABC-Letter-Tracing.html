<p>Mastery implies facility. However, it often conveniently ignores the lengthy struggle necessary to achieve excellence. Even seemingly simple skills require commitment and a dedication to craft—this includes something as humble as good old-fashioned handwriting. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc-letter-tracing-free-writing/id416326981?mt=8
">ABC Letter Tracing</a> is a free app that helps kids learn to write letters and begin to recognize their ABCs. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>ABC Letter Tracing is easy. No stylus is required, just use your fingers or thumbs to trace uppercase and lowercase letters on your device. Illustrations of familiar everyday objects that kids should recognize share screen space with outlines of individual letters that they trace over. For example, "a" is paired on-screen with an apple, "b" with a ball, and "c" with a car. These little artistic objects should motivate youngsters to keep at it when the tracing gets tough. What better inspiration to make your letters look smooth and pretty than delightful illustrations on your device? </p>

<p>Multimedia is included too. A narrator reinforces letter learning and pronunciation. She warmly says the letter out loud in a traditional American English tone. This could be particularly useful for English Language Learners (ELLs) who want to learn the conventional way to pronounce a letter. As such, children can explore multiple modes of expression using the app. Also, the drawing experience is fun and satisfying. The letter shape that you trace over is composed of a dotted gray outline. When you trace on this letter template, gray dots become vivid red lines. The rote routine of learning letters becomes more fun with ABC Letter Tracing. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>ABC Letter Tracing may quickly become a little <i>too</i> rote despite its affordances. There are only 26 letters after all, and no numbers are included. As such, in its current form, after exploring basic letter creation, kids could easily become bored with the app. If your children are fidgety and restless and like fighting more than writing, ABC Letter Tracing may prove insufficient in keeping their boundless energy from bursting out into a wrestling match. </p>
 
<p>Also, although the narrator pronounces the individual letters, this does not extend to the name of the object that accompanies the letter (e.g., "a" but not "apple") which seems like a lost opportunity to expand learning. Moreover, there is no underlying music bed. Even a simple tune or two would make the experience more playful and less repetitive. Similarly, a satisfying bell sound could help poor tracers learn when they have successfully outlined their letter. Unfortunately, the eraser function is a binary affair, (either you leave your letter fully intact or delete it entirely), which could be annoying for those with poor fine motor skills and little patience for starting over. Finally, there doesn’t appear to be an option for changing the color of your tracing line.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>ABC Letter Tracing is a cute app for young learners. It has limited functionality, but its bare bones, lo-fi approach lets your child trace letters exactly as it promises, no more, no less. If you have a youngster who yearns to learn the alphabet, ABC Letter Tracing is an easy way to help them begin their journey. Just remember to load up some songs on your iPad to keep them humming along while they trace. The word makes the world; let your child imagine more beautiful surroundings letter-by-letter. </p>
