<p><b>Title:</b> <a href=" http://ecl.sagepub.com/content/14/2/147.abstract"> "Smart" Technologies in Early Years Literacy Education: A Meta-Narrative of Paradigmatic Tensions in iPad Use in an Australian Preparatory Classroom</a> (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julianne Lynch & Terri Redpath</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> Journal of Early Childhood Literacy</p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How does an early childhood classroom use the iPad for teaching and learning?</p> 

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The authors conducted an ethnographic study to examine how an early childhood classroom used iPads as part of the enacted digital literacy curriculum during 2010-2011. The classroom was located in a public school in Australia that purchased iPads for student use; the classroom teacher used iPad apps as an experiment with her students for literacy activities. Data included interviews with twelve young children, teacher interviews, and videotaped classroom observations.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors found that that iPads could support young learners’ independent, multimodal learning; students showed a high level of motivation and independence while using these mobile devices compared to desktop and laptop computers in the classroom. The classroom teacher included a variety of literacy apps that provided different levels of interactivity and user choices and positioned students as producers of their own content. However, despite the potential transformative impact, the student-centered classroom curriculum was so different from the print-based, skill-focused learning model mandated by state guidelines that institutionally it was not considered a good teaching practice by the state.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> This study serves as an preliminary example for practitioners and researchers to develop practical mobile learning plans for early literacy classrooms. It further encourages teachers to be "rebellious" in enacting creative digital spaces for students’ literacy expressions. In addition, under the broader state-mandated curricular environment, there is a need for teachers to be aware of the danger of using digital technologies as content delivery tools to complement the current print-oriented curricula; additional studies may shed light on the best approaches for designing integrated digital literacy practices beyond school mandated curricula. </p>
