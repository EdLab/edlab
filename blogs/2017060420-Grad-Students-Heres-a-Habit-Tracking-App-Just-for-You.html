<p>If you’re a graduate student, you probably understand why it’s so common to feel <a href="http://berkeleysciencereview.com/article/mind-grad-school/">overwhelmed, exhausted, or depressed</a> throughout your academic journey. In fact, it’s probably not even a surprise that <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/PhD-Attrition-How-Much-Is/140045/">50% of doctoral students leave graduate school</a> without finishing. Instead of succumbing to the stress, however, doctoral candidate Luka Negoita found a stress-relieving system to work toward personal wellbeing. When he decided to turn it into an app that others could benefit from, <a href="http://www.habituapp.com">HabitU</a> was born.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>HabitU is a habit-tracking app that relies on behavioral psychology and a simple interface to help reduce stress and increase wellbeing. It’s incredibly easy to use, and the app comes with a guide to help you make realistic goals. You create a list of habits you imagine your ideal self would complete every day, anything from difficult habits (e.g., waking up at your first alarm) to easy ones (e.g., taking a multivitamin). For each habit, you assign a level of difficulty connected to a point value. The more difficult the habit is, the more points you get for completing it.</p>
 
<p>HabitU gives you a personal point goal each day that adapts to your past behavior. The best part about HabitU is that it doesn’t pressure you to complete all your good habits in a day. By giving you a personal point goal well below the total possible, the app only expects you to achieve some of your ideal habits each day, and they can vary between days. Because of this, while some habit-tracking apps increase your stress by adding more pressure onto an already packed day, HabitU adds all the structure of a regular habit-tracking app, but none of the stress. Also, HabitU’s simple interface is a welcome sight for graduate students like me who can feel overwhelmed by even too many stimuli, sounds, or images at the end of a long day.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>HabitU’s simplicity and seeming effectiveness make it difficult to criticize. But there’s always the concern that HabitU might be too simple for some users who need more enthusiastic motivation or stimuli to keep them going. Also, personally, I think the app could be improved if I could have multiple lists for different areas of my life I wanted to improve. For instance, if I could have both an academic list and a social list instead of combining it into one could help me prioritize different aspects of my life at different times. I certainly hope that all my ideal habits this summer don’t remain the same as they were in the midst of finals season!</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Simple, effective, and pleasant-to-use, HabitU is for graduate students looking to gain better control of their lives and improve their wellbeing. The stress-free, achievable goal helps you strengthen good habits and feel accomplished daily, and the app’s progress charts allow you to reflect on your improvements. While the app is currently in its beta phase, it will soon be officially released. As a graduate student, I’ll be keeping this one.</p>
