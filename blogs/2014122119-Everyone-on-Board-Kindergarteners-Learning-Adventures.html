What would project-based learning look like if it were the entire curriculum? And on top of that, what if technology was available to enhance learning experiences? The young students at Alabama Auburn’s Early Education Center thoroughly explore topics that bring their learning to life. They develop projects for weeks on end, from taking an imaginary flight to Brazil to planning a funeral for their pet bug. In order to further the research part of their projects, students, with the guidance of teachers, often to turn to technology to learn more. The learning adventures of these children are endless, self-directed, and supported by teachers. 

The school serves five hundred three to five year olds. Despite the numbers, it firmly believes in kicking off lifelong learning early through long-term learning projects. Commonly known as project-based learning, the school curriculum is based on the belief that student-driven activities should encourage learning. This latter idea is known as student-centered learning. William H. Kilpatrick is one of the founding fathers of student-centered, project-based learning in the United States (though the concept has its roots in Italian arts classes). Kilpatrick’s seminal piece, <a href= "http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=3606">"The Project Method," was published in 1918. </a>

Can you see this method being used at your school? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18007">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@0:44 Sappho:</b> Ha, it does look a bit chaotic--but also fun!.<p>

<b>@01:55 Sappho:</b> "Project-based learning first was introduced to United States famously by Kilpatrick in his 1918 piece "The Project Method." Read more here: http://www.tcreco...."<p>

<b>@01:55 Anthony124:</b> This is an interesting connection! A 2012 TC Record article shares that Kilpatrick said he made some "mistakes" in his project based learning philosophy. It would be interesting to compare and contrast the original with his later view and see if the change would effect practice. http://www.tcreco...<p>
