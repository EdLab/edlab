<p><a href="https://www.urban-x.com">Urban-X</a> is a tech accelerator in Brooklyn, NY that invests in startups that combine technology and design to improve life in cities. Unlike companies that look to replace humans with robots in the workplace, these groups are trying to make the human work experience better through technology that supports and enhances worker experience and performance. Every six months, Urban-X invests $100,000 in up to 10 companies.</p>

<p>The most recent cycle of investments saw a wide range of startups. One, <a href="http://www.wear.works">WearWorks</a>, is a haptics design company (i.e., touch related) that created a wearable device that communicates to users via a vibration-based language. Instead of relying on a regular map app, the visually impaired can use a WearWorks device to navigate the streets by receiving different sets of vibrations through the bracelet telling them when to turn or continue straight. Another startup, <a href="http://contextere.com"><i>contextere</i></a>, is bringing augmented reality and the internet of things into blue collar work spaces. Their aim is to make this line of work more effective, safer, and more fulfilling for employees. Finally, <a href="http://www.upcycles.biz">UpCycles</a> wants to merge human and electric power to transform city deliveries using a vehicle that is half bicycle, half truck.</p>

<p>Do you think efforts like these make it feasible to keep humans in the workforce rather than replacing them with robots? How are these tech and design startups, as well as others you might know, fulfilling needs that people living in cities have? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/38335/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@02:16 RuthS:</b> I appreciate the idea of enhancing human productivity and work experience with technology rather than finding ways to replace humans with tech in the workplace. These companies seem to be championing a hybrid of human and tech capabilities to create some really innovative products and services.</p>

<p><b>@02:38 Cinthia.Fabian:</b> In an economy pervaded by robots and high tech and AI (oh my!), might we then be prompted to reevaluate what makes a person valuable? Maybe an individual's worth won't be (solely) contingent upon their economic productivity â€“ maybe we, as a society, will begin to see the worth in other, less tangible human qualities.</p>
