<p>Wes Moore is the CEO of <a href="http://bridgeedu.com/">BridgeEDU</a>, a national initiative focusing on addressing the college completion and career placement crisis by reinventing the Freshman Year of college. He is also the author of two New York Times bestselling books, The Other Wes Moore, and The Work. Moore is the host of "Beyond Belief" on the Oprah Winfrey Network and Executive Producer and host of "Coming Back with Wes Moore," which follows veterans as they reintegrate back into society.  Moore is also the executive producer for the PBS documentary, "All the Difference", which follows two African-American teens from the South Side of Chicago on their journey to achieve their dream of graduating from college.</p>

<p>Moore graduated Phi Theta Kappa from Valley Forge Military College and in 1998 received his bachelor’s degree with honors from Johns Hopkins University. He completed an MLitt from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar in 2004. Upon graduation, Wes served as a paratrooper and Captain in the United States Army, serving in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at BridgeEdu?</b><br>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to experience many different aspects of our work in education before starting BridgeEdU. I served as a combat army officer, a White House Fellow, and later on I worked in corporate finance. Together all of these experiences helped me see the different approaches to solving the learning divide. For example, one thing that the military does really well is introduce leadership into the lives of young people, something which I think matters significantly. Because the one thing we know about our young people is that they’re going to learn. The only questions are what are they learning and who are they learning from?</p>
    
<p>We have kids who have Type A personalities. They want to be recognized and be responsible. They want to be leaders. If we don’t come up with positive aspects and elements that allow them to partake in that, then other people will fill that void and not necessarily in good ways. That’s where I think that the military was really helpful to me; it allowed that void to be filled in a way that was not just positive, but also gave me a greater sense of where I wanted to go. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at BridgeEdu will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I see BridgeEdu altering the conversation around what is happening for so many students when transitioning into higher education. The pursuit of higher education was originally only meant for the wealthiest individuals in a society. Even though access to education has expanded through the help of Pell Grants, the structure of higher education has remained stagnant. BridgeEdu seeks to help change that structure by integrating more experiential learning opportunities, academic coaching and advising, etc. When you have so many students who are differently prepared than the traditional population of students who have always excelled in higher education, then you need to have different approaches to help them integrate. And that’s what BridgeEdu wants to offer: we want to not just change the narrative around which different preparations are necessary. We also want to be able to provide those different preparations.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>One of the biggest trends in education right now is experiential learning, where students apply what they learn in the classroom to real-world situations. This can happen through service learning, internships, and externships; basically any space where a student uses their education in a professional setting. Experiential Learning truly bridges the gap between theory and practice by encouraging students to use critical thinking and decision making skills in real-time.</p> 

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>We started BridgeEdU to completely restructure the freshman year because, in many ways, colleges don’t have a college completion crisis. Instead, what they have is a freshman year crisis. At BridgeEdU we combine high touch with high tech to produce higher college completion rates. One thing that we're excited about is working with high schools and universities on our new app, YesU. YesU is a first of its kind mobile platform that provides students with all the financial literacy and financial aid that they merit. It's an incredible platform that guides students through what can be an intimidating process in a smoother and more manageable way. Learn more about <a href="http://yesuapp.com/">the app here</a>. </p>
