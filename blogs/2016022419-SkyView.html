<p>The heavens are a persistent wonder we often ignore due to the busy nature of our lives. In the days of yesteryear, philosophers and scientists looked upwards, pondered the mysteries of the heavens, reminding themselves of the splendor of what was beyond their normal field of vision. We need to re-embrace the antiquated inclination to ignore things beyond the naked eye, otherwise we could begin to lose something precious. The app <a href=
"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skyview-free-explore-universe/id413936865?mt=8">SkyView</a> helps us reclaim the worlds beyond our reach. In short, it is an app that democratizes stargazing. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>SkyView is incredibly easy to use. Venture outside to your favorite outdoor vantage point, tilt your device skyward, and the app identifies everything in the heavens. SkyView works on iPhones, iPads, or iPods and functions automatically, working without pressing a button. Although I wasn’t able to capture it, the app reputedly can identify the International Space Station. Maybe during my next astronomical investigation I will have more luck! </p>
 
<p>SkyView is an excellent example of augmented reality in a low-cost, hand-held form. It provides a wealth of information regarding the celestial bodies that you capture above. For example, SkyView communicates the type of object you are looking at, such as a satellite or a star, as well as where it is located. It also gives you highly specific information like the body’s abbreviation, translation, the person who discovered it, as well as links to more information. SkyView even provides a lifelike outline for bodies like constellations, automatically enhancing the reality you see in front of you. For example, the Sagittarius constellation is displayed with its stars connected by blue lines but also the archer character it forms with gray lines. As a result, keen stargazers can learn a great deal about whatever they shoot. </p>

<p>SkyView would be particularly useful when on the road during summer vacation. For children who become readily bored, it gives them a real example of science to explore. As such, it can help fend off some of the erosion in scientific thinking that often occurs during prolonged breaks from school. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>SkyView does not allow a lot of interaction with the constellations, satellites, and stars that you record. Basically, they are locked in as simple images on your device with the associated information. You can toggle on the information button to discover additional facts, but that’s about it. </p>
 
<p>SkyView provides a wealth of textual information regarding your astral image. However, it appears as though it might give too much. Younger people could easily become overwhelmed with the amount of information that the app provides. Although there is haunting background music that puts you in the stargazing mood, it might better serve the app’s educational appeal to provide oral explanations or leverage other types of multimedia instead. </p>
 
<p>I used SkyView when there was a relatively clear sky with a few clouds overhead. As such, heavy rain, thick fog, and other challenging meteorological conditions could hamper your use of this app. On a similar note, your sky surveying is limited by the camera that is enabled on your device. If you have a low quality camera or poor image processing abilities on your mobile device, your use of SkyView could be significantly hampered. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>SkyView is a magical app that prompts you to re-engage with the environment around you. If you want to ensure a uniformly excellent experience, you may not want to use it during inclement weather. I was fascinated by astronomy, planets, and stars as a kid—it was an interest I just seemed to outgrow. SkyView has reignited my passion for the stars. I hope it does so for you as well. </p>
