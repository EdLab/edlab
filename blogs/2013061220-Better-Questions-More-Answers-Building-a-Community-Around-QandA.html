<p><b>Title:</b> When Relevance is not Enough: Promoting Diversity and Freshness in Personalized Question Recommendation (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Idan Szpektor, Yoelle Maarek, & Dan Pelleg</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www2013.org/program/when-relevance-is-not-enough-promoting-diversity-and-freshness-in-personalized-question-recommendation/">International World Wide Web Conference 2013</a></p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Sites like <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>, <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/">WikiAnswers</a> specialize in crowdsourced answers to  interpretive or recommendation-based queries that search engines can’t readily answer.  These sites require a devoted answering community to be effective. <a href="http://www2013.wwwconference.org/proceedings/p1249.pdf">When Relevance is not Enough: Promoting Diversity and Freshness in Personalized Question Recommendation</a> examined question answering behaviors on Yahoo! Answers with the aim of increasing the number of questions answered by each user. Previous studies on this subject have focused on the way experts answer questions, but according to a Yahoo! Answers sample of four million replies, non-expert users contributed more than half of all answers on the site. The authors focused on novice users and tested strategies for increasing answering on the site. The variables for testing included question topic diversity, time between question and answer, and the user’s experience of suggested question topic flow.</p> 

<p>The authors developed an algorithm to produce question topics based on user-generated profiles which suggested potentially related topics and adapted based on the questions users chose to answer. They then conducted two experiments to test the accuracy of their algorithm. The offline test examined existing behavior data from the Yahoo! Answers system and compared the question choice strategy to predictions from the algorithm. This test confirmed that the algorithm predicted behavior similar to the natural preferences of users on the site. The second experiment was performed live online with controlled and experimental groups that answered as many questions as they chose based on the algorithm’s suggestions for freshness, relevance, and diversity.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The online experiment showed that question freshness was important to users. When the most recent questions were tested, users submitted 4% more answers. Combining recency with greater diversity improved the number of answers by 17% and also had a positive impact on non-answering activities like voting on the relevance of others’ answers. These results confirmed that stated topic preferences in profiles submitted by users had no impact on the types of questions users chose to answer. These profiles represented a starting point for questions, but the authors found that users’ topic preferences evolved. Adaptive topic flow based on user question choice increased question answering, dwell time in the platform, and rating of other users’ answers.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This work revealed some important characteristics of a significant user category in the Yahoo! Answers platform and has implications for the many educational recommenders currently in use. Further study is needed to balance the relevancy needs of novice users and the higher diversity and freshness benefits for experienced users. This study may be useful, not only for researchers, but for general users interested in early expectations of relevance in web platforms and the power of diversity for greater engagement. The tested algorithm described in this paper is currently deployed in production on Yahoo! Answers</p>
