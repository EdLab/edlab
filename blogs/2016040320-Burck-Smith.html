Burck Smith is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://bit.ly/1S3uvBU">StraighterLine</a>. Ten years before launching StraighterLine in 2009, he co-founded <a href="http://bit.ly/1NSLH5s">SMARTHINKING</a>, the largest online tutoring provider for schools and colleges. Smith has written chapters for three books on education policy for the <a href="http://bit.ly/1TH3ALT">American Enterprise Institute (AEI)</a>. Prior to starting SMARTHINKING, Smith was an independent consultant and journalist whose clients included the Gates Foundation, Microsoft, the CEO Forum on Education and Technology, the Milken Exchange on Education and Technology, Converge Magazine, Wired Magazine, Wired News, University Business, the National School Boards Association and more. Smith holds a Master's Degree in Public Policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and a B.A. from Williams College.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
 <p>My background is in public policy. I’ve been writing in magazines and journals about education, technology and public policy since the late 90s. At one level, public policy is the study of how government regulation and subsidization affect private markets. Understanding the interplay between consumer choice, regulation, subsidization, and politics is a terrific lens through which to view an industry historically treated as a public good with a cost of delivery (not price of delivery) that has plummeted. </p>

 <p>At the tactical level, I’ve watched how new ideas move through the adoption cycle in heavily regulated markets. For instance, SMARTHINKING—the online tutoring company I co-founded in 1999—was very controversial at its inception. The early adopters were the colleges experimenting with online delivery in the early 00's while more conservative colleges criticized the willingness of colleges to outsource academic service delivery. Today online service outsourcing—whether tutoring, coaching, advising, marketing, technology or other services—is widespread. The same thing happened with <a href="http://bit.ly/1nQa9Qh">StraighterLine</a>. When we started our competency based academic model with subscription pricing, we were widely criticized. Today, competency based education and subscription pricing are being pushed by the Department of Education. Central to the spread of new models is the willingness of colleges to respond to student choice.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
 <p>Eventually we want to make the benefits, quality, and price of higher education much more transparent to students prior to enrollment. Accredited higher education has become the Gordian knot for the American middle class. A degree is more necessary and more expensive than ever, but students and families have less to spend. The result is $1.3 trillion (and growing) in national student debt. New technologies combined with new business models should lower the price of education, but that hasn’t happened. By approaching the problem with a business model deliberately situated outside of <a href="http://bit.ly/1SvPP3x">accreditation</a>, we are able to innovate in ways that colleges can’t. Therefore, we’re able to drive the cost savings provided by new technologies to students rather than being captured by colleges.</p>
 
 <p>For example, we’re able to <a href="http://bit.ly/1TH4Jmz">reduce the price</a> and risk of starting college by pricing online courses closer to their cost of delivery and letting students start with a <a href=http://bit.ly/1SLQfkI">free trial</a> and then, if desired, a month-to-month subscription. Further, we deliberately sign transfer agreements with colleges so we can guarantee that the credits they take from us will transfer. Students get lower prices, lower start-up risk and credit transfer guarantees—all of which starts to bring transparency to higher education pricing.</p>
 
 <p>We’ve also begun to bring standard "product improvement" methodologies into higher education. For instance, we run A/B tests for any changes in the student experience—new courseware, new user interface, additional support services, etc. We use course completion percentages and a cross-industry metric of customer satisfaction called Net Promoter Score (NOS) to determine successful improvements. </p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
 <p>The market for higher education has moved from one characterized by scarcity to one characterized by abundance. To date, higher education’s subsidy structure has been built upon the desire to create more colleges (hence public colleges) and the desire to spur demand (hence Title IV financing). Now, students can be educated by hundreds of residential and online accredited colleges and hundreds of <a href="http://bit.ly/1SvQrGm">unaccredited offerings</a>. This level of choice creates unprecedented competition among education providers. It also requires policymakers to consider how to best use taxpayer subsidies. These two dynamics will shape a higher education system that has far greater choice and is ultimately much more affordable for students. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
 <p>Using continuous improvement methodologies, we’re rapidly improving the student experience. We’re also working closely with willing colleges who <a href="http://bit.ly/1KsOlnJ">refer</a> students to us to prepare them prior to enrollment at the referring college. Lastly, we’re very excited about the Department of Education’s intention to run an experimental program called <a href="http://bit.ly/1PVdN1q">EQUIP</a> that would enable financial aid to flow to providers like ourselves.</p>
