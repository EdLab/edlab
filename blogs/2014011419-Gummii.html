<p>Gummii is an adaptive game-based math tutoring system for the iPad that attempts to combine introductory math problems with an interactive Minecraft-style world. By completing very simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems, users earn rewards that help them build objects in a virtual environment. Founded by an admittedly "exasperated parent," Gummii tries to construct a custom-tailored tutoring experience for kids struggling with math concepts.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Players of Minecraft will be very familiar with the block world of Gummii. After installation, users are guided through an avatar setup by an inexplicably floating robot dog named Zoom and placed in a mountainous cube landscape. Zoom provides setup and navigation advice and explains the basics of building blocks and math challenges that unlock tools that can be monitored by parents for signs of learning progress.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite tutorials, the overall objectives of the game aren’t immediately evident or well-explained, nor are the navigation icons or hierarchy of rewards. The lack of a narrative and an incohesive design make features feel disconnected. Not only are math challenges thematically isolated from the building experience, but they are not preceded by a lesson, they are limited in quantity and skill level (four exercises for addition/subtraction and one for multiplication), and questions are often repetitive. It seems as though math exercises were neglected for the development of graphics that are visually identical to Minecraft.</p>

<p>Further perplexing and irritating for users is a repetitive techno buzzing noise emitted by Zoom (who is constantly blocking the camera’s point of view), and a shockingly expensive fee structure; booster packs that multiply rewards range in price from $2.99 to $24.99 and <i>only last 24 hours</i>.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how the name Gummii relates to math, flying robot dogs, counting bananas, or block mountains, and visiting the site does little to clarify the overall vision for this product; the ‘our principles’ section is a disconnected list of educational mantras that anyone would agree with, and unfortunately the ‘how does it work section’ fails to explain how it works. Overall the entire user experience feels like testing a hastily designed beta product that is in early stages of development.</p>



<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The site repeatedly stresses the importance of kids learning math in a new way without specifically identifying how the app is new or different. Many of the math problems are digitized duplicates of paper versions. There are no unique or significant advantages of asking a student to answer "2 x 2= ___ ?" on an iPad rather than a piece of paper, and this exemplifies how Gummii has failed to utilize the capabilities of an internet connected tablet that can record touch, audio, and visuals for playback and sharing. For a better example of how technology can effectively engage students, readers should look to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1003">Kyle Counts</a>, a more thoughtfully designed counting app that helps children creatively re-imagine number sense.</p>

<p>As the game stands right now, the shortcomings that make Gummii a delete-able app can serve as a cautionary tale for other game-based education apps.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>There might be a number of good ideas in Gummii, but they don’t add up to a useful math app.</p>
