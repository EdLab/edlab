          <p>
            In light of all the blogging Skanda has been doing on higher education, I thought I'd highlight the recent publication of a couple books on the subject.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/books/in-the-basement-of-the-ivory-tower-by-professor-x-review.html?partner=rss&emc=rss/">The first</a>, by an adjunct professor writing under the nom de plume "Professor X," is billed as an expose of the underside of higher education.  Professor X writes: “No one is thinking about the larger implications, or even the morality... of admitting so many students to classes they cannot possibly pass.”  He views the school he teaches at as exploitative; it accepts marginal students who are incapable of the coursework and will inevitably drop out.
<!--break-->
The second, by Andrew Ferguson, is a personal narrative of a dad shepherding his son through the admission process.  From this book, "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704005404576176710554613954.html">Crazy U</a>," the Wall Street Journal learns of the corrupting power of the admissions process: "It's a process that discourages reticence by requiring students to write revealing and disingenuous personal essays; discourages thrift by regarding parental savings as fair game in the financial-aid evaluation; discourages intellectual curiosity by encouraging students to pursue grades rather than knowledge; and discourages honesty by transforming adolescence into a period of cynical calculation."

Juxtaposing these accounts may provide concrete illustration of the two opposed attitudes to college education that Skanda has just described. Ferguson, viewing college as an institution for the development of personality, is dismayed by the moral and intellectual compromises his son is required to make right off the bat.  "Professor X" (and what a dumb name that is) works primarily with those who are in college to advance their careers, and evaluates the service his institution provides accordingly.  

Unfortunately, if these two men are to be believed, we are not doing a particularly good job on either rubric.  As Skanda implies, by trying to fulfill two divergent functions with one institution we may be getting the worst of both worlds.
