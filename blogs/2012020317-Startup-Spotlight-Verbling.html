<b>The Details and Backstory</b>
For anyone who has every tried to learn a language, you know that the biggest turning point is in carrying out a verbal conversation. Once you do that, you're on your way to fluency. It is this level of competency that <a href="http://verbling.com">Verbling</a> seeks to provide with its unique service.  

The founders of Verbling, Jake Jolis, Fred Wulff, and Mikael Bernstein, each have personal experiences with second (and in some cases fourth) language acquisition that colored their perception of the learning process.  All agreed that grammar lessons could only take you so far; immersion is the true key to fluency. Short of actually traveling to your country of choice, Verbling offers budding linguists another, more cost-effective, option: video chat!

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>
Verbling's video chat premise is reminiscent of the notorious site, ChatRoulette.  In this case, though, instead of having pre-chat anxiety about <a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/5086/slide_5086_70265_large.jpg">what your partner might be doing when you show up</a>, you'll be more concerned about keeping up with what they are saying.

You are paired up based on what languages you both want to learn. So, if you (a native English-speaker) wanted to learn Mandarin, you would be paired with a native Mandarin-speaking person interested in learning English. Conversations last 10 minutes: the first half is in one language and the second half in the next. To help you and your partner get through the inevitable awkward silence, Verbling provides a deck of conversation starters (e.g. “Â¿CuÃ¡l es tu programa de televisiÃ³n favorito y por quÃ©?”).  Currently, Verbling only supports English-Spanish exchanges but plans to increase the language options in the future.  

<b>EdLab Takeaway</b>
In order to reap the full benefits of this service, you do need to have a basic grasp of the language you are learning.  While there are a few opportunities to learn within the site (e.g. flashcard decks), the main focus is on the conversation. This situation lends itself to a potentially interesting teaching dynamic; with the onus of learning on the participants, of course. If Verbling was able to somehow suggest effective teaching strategies to its participants while they are in the “expert/teacher” role,  it would only strengthen its use as tool to acquire a foreign language.  People are Verbling's greatest asset; teaching them better ways of interacting with each other may create a more sustainable product.
