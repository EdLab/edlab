            **Private**

I started messing around with mSchool initial concept for the UX design today. I began by exploring the root definitions of <i>metaphor</i> and <i>school</i> which combine into mSchool, followed by translating them to spatial concept.

Note how philosophers, educators and students in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens">the School of Athens</a> above mingle, discuss and learn in "temporal" places which transformed into impromptu classrooms, defining the etymology of school as we know.

and lastly, I've come up with a fun terminology instead of module:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/tW8kRee.png" title="source: imgur.com" />

With the initial concept, I played around with in-browser CSS and modified the "create module" page from this:

to this:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/EWipO3C.png" title="source: imgur.com" />

I simply followed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> rule. Here are changes I've made:

<b>Background color</b>
Changed the dark background to white. Text suffers on gray and so does the user.

<b>Menu Icons</b>
The current icons are small and misleading. ("setting gears" for permission, "download" for forking another module) I adopted the line icons for cleaner look
and made them bigger. I used circles to symbolize a "cloning" action (sort of like amoebas I suppose) for better predictability.

<b>Border Radius</b>
Border radius have to go. It was the first quirk I noticed. It makes everything looks like an iPhone app icon but doesn't serve the same purpose and distract the purity of forms. I minimized the border to minimal dotted lines. The concept of a plane is just a boundary humans can make sense as a space for actions. I think "soft" boundary i.e. a change of texture or tone can ease the experience and keep the focus on content creation.

<b>Add button</b>
Buttons are less button-like now. Our elements should be more <i>intangible</i>, merging into the context rather than standing out as isolated elements that can overload users with information such as borders and shadings. Moreover, <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~detrie/msj.uc_daap/article.html">a button is a dot from afar, no matter what form it takes</a>. This will also make mSchool more similar to a native app on mobile devices like the iPad, which is the device educators and students are using in classrooms.

<b>Tooltips</b>
They are like manual in disguise. With mSchool's complexity, I suggest we have tooltips everywhere within our application, holding user's hand along the way.

<b>Module</b>
With the initial concept of a <i>meta-space</i> of a school, I use textures to define boundaries instead of hard borders and solid colors.

With this concept I think it's easier and simpler to develop the user interfaces and focus more on elements of interactions rather than how things should look like. This is just a very early concept but I really love to hear your feedbacks.
