<p>The newest app created by Yatatoy, <a href="http://www.yatatoy.com/bandimal">Bandimal</a>, is a new way to introduce children to musical composition. Through a collection of dancing animals standing in for musical instruments, children can mix different sounds, beats, and tempos to learn how composition works. It costs $3.99 and can be used on an iphone or ipad.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>I think my favorite part of this app is how cleverly it utilizes animated animals to symbolize and illustrate music making in action. Each animal has unique instrumentation correlating to its size and characteristics; for example, the whale sounds like a tuba, the jellyfish resembles a synthesizer, and the sheep emits an organ-like ‘baa!’ With each sound, every animal has its own set of moves as well, ranging from bulging bodies and eyes to bouncing, spinning, jumping, twisting, and emitting air out of blowholes. It’s both silly and demonstrative of how each note is timed in relation with the others.</p>

<p>The design of Bandimal itself is very fun and intuitive. With its pastel color palette and clean lines, it is definitely inviting and child friendly, and its simplicity makes it easy to navigate, change musical elements, and start new projects. Despite its basic format, this app is capable of allowing those with no real musical experience to create something quite complex sounding.</p>

<p>I also appreciate how this app is designed to encourage discovery. As stated in the "info" session of the app for parents, "there is no right or wrong," and the absence of instructions allows children to play around with different elements of composition without restriction. With a goal to "bring the fun of creating music closer to your child," Bandimal certainly delivers, as it creates a much more inviting, accessible environment than a keyboard or set of instruments might.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Granted, I am an adult, but I would have liked a few more elements to play around with. Having only three animal instruments didn’t quite feel like enough. I think even just the addition of one more would enhance the experience and challenge kids to move their compositions even further along. Also, the ability to manipulate the rhythm could be a fun feature as well.</p>
 
<p>One thing that parents should be aware of is that if their child is taking music lessons, Bandimal will build upon skills of musicianship, but it is not directly related to technical foundational skills. While all animal instruments are based on the pentatonic scale, it varies from animal to animal what kinds of notes they can "play." Therefore, looking for specific notes is not possible.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Though Bandimal is not free, I believe it’s worth its value in fun and musical experimentation and learning.</p>
