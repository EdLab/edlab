<a href="http://classtivity.com/">Classtivity</a> (currently in private Beta) aims to create an efficient, location-based search for "classtivities"... hybrids of classes and one-time activities. Ranging from computer science and language arts to yoga, the site has a wide-range of classes that can be sought out using granular search options such as neighborhood, price, and duration.

<b>Pros:</b> 
Personalization and tracking. Logged in users can save classes in their account to take later and add user ratings that will help in guiding the selections of other students. Although I have not tested it, Classtivity also offers  user support via live chat with their "chat with us" feature!

<b>Cons:</b>
Discovery. I found it difficult at best to find a complete listing of courses offered through the system in my area. Instead, you need a specific subject name in order to search for a course, instead of using your location to see what courses were being offered near you. The site lists over 3K courses for NYC and so it was frustrating to have to search more narrowly from the start. From a purely exploratory perspective this limited search makes discovery difficult, while users who already know what courses they want to take might find this narrowed focus to be a bonus.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we develop both our course discovery platform as well as courses themselves, it is helpful to explore ways that other systems share and aid in the discovery of content. Regardless of whether the courses are asynchronous or in-person, the users goals are still often the same: 1) to learn something valuable 2) to get the best value and to 3) find this information quickly. One area where our platform can excel and differentiate is in personalized recommendations. By harnessing the power of platforms like <a href="http://pundit.tc.columbia.edu/">Pundit</a> we are able to make recommendations to users whereas other platforms simply offer enhanced search. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Classtivity is a fun and easy way to find courses in your area; just be sure you have a specific subject in mind before you start your search.
