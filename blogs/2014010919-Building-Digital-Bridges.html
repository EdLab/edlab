<b>Title:</b> Effects of Thinking Style on Design Strategies: Using Bridge Construction  Simulation Programs (2013)
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Chuen-Tsai Sun, Dai-Yi Wang, & Yu-Yeh Chang
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://www.ifets.info/journals/16_1/27.pdf">Education Technology and Society</a>
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Although there already exists a vast and rapidly growing library of online learning tools, very few of them have been designed with the proper learning processes in mind. Implementing these tools in a classroom setting can require a fair amount of preparatory work and adjustment by the instructor.
<p>
This study was designed to investigate the relationships among thinking styles, design strategies, and design tool preferences for a group of students given a common design task.  The authors took a task and computer tool (which provided both a graphical interface and a list of available components) developed to simulate the construction of a truss bridge with certain specified requirements, and offered this lesson to a class of Taiwanese freshmen students. Their learning styles and design strategies and preferences were queried with questionnaires and rater scores, and the results compared to determine the relationship.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
The study found that students with different learning and thinking styles tended to utilize different aspects of the program. Judicial thinkers, for instance, were much more likely to take advantage of system-generated messages to modify their design, whereas local thinkers appreciated the pop-up displays for specific components. In addition, it appeared that students implementing a bottom-up design strategy (developing solutions during implementation, rather than breaking down the problem at the beginning) made better use of the tool by switching easily back and forth between the graphical interface and the component list, while the top-down designers often got stuck on one side or the other.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study serves to emphasize that it isnâ€™t enough simply to build a learning tool. Educational designers must be continually mindful of the different learning strategies and methods that will be applied to their tool, and incorporate that knowledge into the design. That is, tools must have the scope both to accommodate different learning styles, and to nudge all learners towards more productive learning strategies.
