          <p>
            I've had my Nook Color for about 5 months now. It's been an exciting time for e-books with <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/889452-264/harpercollins_puts_26_loan_cap.html.csp">HarperCollins lending limits</a>, <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/04/amazon-to-launch-library-lending-for-kindle-books/1">Amazon library lending</a>, Kindle book sales finally <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/20/136490774/amazon-e-book-sales-eclipse-books-in-print">exceeding paper book sales</a> on Amazon and a boon of <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2011/tc20110425_444318.htm">grassroots publishing</a> success. It's been personally exciting too as I rooted my Nook into an adorable Android tablet:

<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2011/05/angrybird.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9834" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2011/05/angrybird.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="89" /></a>

Now there are even more distractions! It's lovely. After a strict months-long purge I've finally begun to reintegrate paper books into my life. I've had mixed feelings about this, as nothing so essential as reading could be easy. I've been reading e-versions of the George R. Martin's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345529057/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0553573403&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=14N7RMZCM4P86DP4SKB6">Song of Ice and Fire</a> series and luckily need only experience the figurative heaviness of these tomes. Unfortunately, the books are so diverting and the appendices so bountiful that the ending always punches me in the face. The Nook has a little page countdown in the upper right corner, but I pay about as much attention to that as I do to page numbers in traditional books. Without the heft and physical progression of my bookmark I often have no idea how close I am to the end. It's a little poetic! The end could come at any time, so I always try to read as if it's the last page.

The wonderful inverse of this is that I can jump from my current page to the appendix at any time. These books should really come with a "who the heck is this?" button built in. There are approximately 11 million characters and they're weirdly interconnected and float in and out of the action at will. Looking at the appendix is something I would only do if strictly necessary in a physical book but it's just so e-easy! TheÂ  hilarious endnotes in the newest Mary Roach book I read were even hyperlinked into the text! Fancy! I'm an e-book convert, people. In the event of an e-book rapture you can have my Nook.
