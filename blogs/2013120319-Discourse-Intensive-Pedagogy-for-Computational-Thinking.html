<p><b>Title:</b> Using a Discourse-Intensive Pedagogy and Android’s App Inventor for Introducing Computational Concepts to Middle School Students (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchi Grover & Roy Pea</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2445196.2445404">Proceeding of the 44th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How does computational discourse and discourse-intensive pedagogy facilitate students' development of computational thinking? How does App Inventor fare as a tool for fostering discourse and computational learning?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Scholars have been interested in how children learn programming since the 1980s and there is an increasing interest in computing education in K-12 classrooms today. However, few studies explore effective pedagogies for teaching computational thinking and programming to children. Grounded in Vygotsky's social learning theory, which emphasizes the importance of social interactions for learning, this study investigated the effectiveness of discourse-intensive pedagogy for teaching computational thinking to middle school students through programming mobile apps in <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">App Inventor</a>.</p> 

<p>Seven middle school students with little to no programming experience participated in a day long pilot workshop called <i>Build Your Own Mobile App</i> that employed discourse-intensive pedagogy. Students took pre-and post-workshop surveys. Video and audio of students attending the workshop along with students' screen activities were recorded through videocast software and screenshots. Survey data provided an understanding of these students' backgrounds and their workshop experiences, and qualitative data from both video and audio transcripts were coded to identify discourse moves in the workshop.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Findings suggest that discourse-intensive pedagogy facilitates computational discourse and helps children learn the fundamentals of programming and computational concepts and skills. In addition, this pedagogy encourages more questions from students and thus creates teachable moments that allow instructors to address advanced computational concepts. In some instances students’ questions resulted from critical omissions in the curriculum design. Based on the findings from this study, the authors recommend App Inventor for teaching programming because of its event-based architecture that fits children’s problem solving approaches. App Inventor also engages students with mobile app building activities and exposes them to complex computational thinking concepts such as data abstraction, and iterative and recursive thinking.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Programming is becoming a key literacy for the 21st century. Effective pedagogy to introduce programming and computational thinking to students is critical for the growth of this new literacy in youth. Discourse-intensive pedagogy is one useful approach that could help students gain greater computational thinking skills from their regular programming classes.</p>
