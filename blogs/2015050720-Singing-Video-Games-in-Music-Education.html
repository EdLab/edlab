<p>The ability to match pitch is a fundamental aspect of music instruction that is usually addressed by a voice teacher early in the development process to hone and improve musical skills. Generally, teachers give immediate verbal feedback upon hearing a student in order to correct the sound or emulate the desired result. Music-learning research over the last decade has found that incorporating visual feedback technologies into a music lesson provides heightened accuracy diagnostics to individuals learning how to sing. An issue with some of these technologies, however, is their proprietary licensing and the software expertise needed to operate them successfully. This article explores the value of commercially available singing video games that provide real-time visual feedback to improve singing skills.</p>

<p>Harmonix Music Systems develops popular music video games, and the company's 2008 production <i>Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore</i> features in this study of pitch-matching improvement. In order to gauge the amount of progress made after playing Karaoke Revolution, participants were recorded singing "Happy Birthday" in pre- and post-tests measuring target tone frequency with a hertz-to-cents conversion. A tone was considered out-of-tune if the sung pitch was greater than 50 cents from the target note. In between recordings of "Happy Birthday," participants played Karaoke Revolution, repeating a familiar song as many times as possible in ten minutes and learning from the visual feedback display.</p>

<p>Of the 28 participants in the study, 19 were considered inaccurate based on the pre-test of greater than 50 cents from a target pitch and accruing more than four out-of-tune notes. After only ten minutes playing Karaoke Revolution, however, overall improvement was seen in this user group either through drops in cents deviation, drops in the number of out-of-tune pitches, or a combination of both. More accurate pitch-matching singers maintained comparable results in the pre- and post-test. While this study focused on ten-minute sessions of instant computer feedback, the author stipulates that longer use of these programs can significantly improve singing skills when coupled with verbal instruction.</p>

<p>The current research into pitch-matching technologies utilized in addition to traditional vocal instruction shows impacts on both music students and teachers. These visual feedback video games can encourage efficient and frequent independent practice as well as help singers overcome psychological barriers to performance. If students use the games outside of lessons, the teacher is free to pursue advanced topics and make the most of one-on-one sessions.</p>
