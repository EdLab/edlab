ClassBadges is a free digital platform for teachers to award badges to students for their mastery of certain skills and knowledge aligned with their teaching goals. The badges can be awarded for both in-class and out-of-class learning experiences. New badge themes are being updated constantly to a badge art database so that teachers can freely choose what badges they would like to use for their own classes. Additionally, ClassBadges provides a digital record of what students have learned, showing a clear overview for teachers to keep track of the individual progress of students in their class.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The system is free and engaging. Using badges to reward students for their progress in achieving learning goals is a classic motivational technique. This idea is clearly related to the trend of learning gamification both in and out of class. As learning can happen anywhere, a proper badge system is necessary as a way of recognizing the skills and progress of students during their learning process. ClassBadges also makes it easier for teachers to manage classes. Teachers can set up different badges for learning goals they would like their students to achieve. Through records kept in their class profile, it is easy for teachers to keep track of the progress each student has made, based on the badges a student has earned. The studentsâ€™ data is visualized and accessible.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Teachers can request that the ClassBadges support team create new badges for their classes if they cannot find suitable badges in the database, but it would be nice to add the option for teachers to create their own badges. Both the ClassBadges team and the community of teachers might learn a good deal about how student capacities are being conceived from badges created by teachers. <p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Can educators use badging efficiently and effectively? This remains a question for thousands of educators and developers to think about when creating gamified education technologies. ClassBadges is boldly on trend with both its gamification and data visualization elements. There is an increasing diversity in education credentials and learning spaces, and ClassBadges offers a way to recognize new types of achievement.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>ClassBadges is anticipating a new era of learning gamification, class management, and learning credential recognition.</p>
