          <p>
            In what can only be seen as an attempt to change the narrative on the reporting of the student debt crisis, a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/upshot/the-reality-of-student-debt-is-different-from-the-cliches.html?ref=education&_r=0">new study by the Brookings Institutions</a> brings up several points of data about student debt burdens. The study found that debt burden placed on lower-middle and lower class families remains largely unchanged and only wealthier Americans have had a significant spike in debt burden. It also notes that the number of students with enormous debt above $50k constitute only 7% of the student debtors. The piece claims that despite the debt, college graduates are still benefiting from their degrees enough to warrant the cost. The real cause of concern, it says, is the number of drop outs incurring debt with no reward. The percentage of drop outs with debt has grown from 11% to 41%. 

The piece brings up many interesting points, but should be taken with a grain of salt. Many of the statistics used were adjusted in a misleading way. The debt burden on many remains the same because of longer loan payment plans. It does not take into account debt taken on by parents on behalf of their children. It claims tuition has not risen above the rate of inflation, but only when financial aid is taken into account. Financial aid grants do not appear out of thin air. It doesn't address the rising cost of student housing, which in many places, exceeds the tuition. It blames the rise in tuition of public Universities to cuts in government funding in certain states, but ignores that other states have not made those cuts and still find themselves with quickly rising tuition. The number of dropouts with debt is concerning, but also likely to be connected to the increasing cost of education. The inflation is real. The bubble is real. We cannot afford to pretend everything is as it once was through manipulations of data.
