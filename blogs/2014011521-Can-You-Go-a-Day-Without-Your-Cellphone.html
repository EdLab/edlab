          <p>
            Smartphones have become more than just electronic devices; they've become a part of our daily routine. According to this <a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1113021890/smartphone-detox-can-cause-serious-anxiety-120613/">article</a>, people tend to become very agitated when trying to live a day without their cellphones. Everything seems to go wrong without a cellphone and anxiety and frustration levels increase, as they are unable to check emails, social media and make phone calls or text.

Last summer I took a course as part of my program at Alfred University. The course was meant to "detoxicate" us from our electronics. We had our devices taken away from at 7AM and handed back at 10PM everyday. We also had no computer access, expect Sundays. This was the case over the duration of the summer program. I witnessed that people were more productive and communicated frequently without their cellphones. However, the frustration level was remarkably high during the first week.
I believe that parents and schools could better students' interest in books and other activities if access to electronic devices were restrained to them until a fix average or an objective is reached.

How attached are you to your smartphone? Do you think you could go a day without it?
