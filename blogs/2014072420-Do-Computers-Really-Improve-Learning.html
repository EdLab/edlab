<p><b>Title:</b> Does Recreational Computer Use Affect High School Achievement? (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex J. Bowers & Matthew Berland</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11423-012-9274-1">Educational Technology Research and Development</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Does recreational computer use in grades 11 and 12 affect high school achievement?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Many studies claim that computers positively impact student learning, but the authors of <i>Does Recreational Computer Use Affect High School Achievement?</i> set out to see if the assumption holds true across a very large sample. The authors separated student recreational computer users into two groups: students who use social media, browse the internet, and listen to music online, and students who play video games. The first group’s computer use was characterized as "fun" and the second’s as "gaming," though the researchers recognized that those who use computers for gaming do so because it is fun. The study used data from the <a href=" http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/">Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002</a>, which surveyed 15,400 students in 10th grade across 750 schools in 2002 and then resurveyed them in 2004. The authors used data only from students who had reached grade level performance on state English and math tests.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Controlling for multiple covariates of achievement, the authors found that students in both groups were positively impacted. The results showed a significant and positive impact on reading and mathematics grades in high school. However, there was no impact on Grade 10 and Grade 12 standardized mathematics test scores.</p>

<p>The researchers found that while the positive effect of computers for fun or for gaming is small; it is analogous to the small, but positive association between student academic success and participation in positive after school activities like homework, school sponsored extracurricular activities, and reading for pleasure.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> The researchers say they hope their research will have an impact on curriculum design. Rather than simplistically view computer use as supporting student achievement, they hope the study provides empirical evidence to show the impact of recreational computer use on student achievement and helps gain acceptance of recreational computer use as part of a balanced information diet. With this research in hand, education technology designers and educators can engage in a more informed process of developing programs to support student success. While many may already believe <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/14203">computer use is great for student learning</a>, this study provides the hard data to support such a belief.</p>
