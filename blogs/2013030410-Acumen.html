            *KEEP PRIVATE** 

Kate and I continue to participate in the 6-week Acumen online leadership course, which is geared toward folks interested in addressing poverty from a social entrepreneurial approach. As a reminder we are going through the course to experience first-hand an entrepreneurial leadership online course that utilizes the Internet to make their curriculum available across the globe, but that also demands face-to-face weekly meetings with team members. We want to see if there might be lessons learned as we think about Launchpad.

 During week two we were assigned a number of articles that focused on the debate of whether traditional international development/aid versus a more entrepreneurial approach is more effective in alleviating poverty.  Some bulleted points from our conversation included: 
- A major criticism of traditional development/aid approaches is that it actually encourages dependency among oppressed populations, further exacerbating social issues versus empowerment. Could fostering entrepreneurship be an alternative?
- On the flip side, it is important not to romanticize a business model approach. I.e. One of the articles questioned if China's business relations with Africa is doing more for the continent than the Western Aid movement. One concern we had was who in the long-run will have control of Africa's private sector? Where do  issues of basic human rights play in this picture? Are China's relations just a modern version of colonialism (I.e. Extract, export and deplete the natural resources of Africa for the benefit of an external player)?  OR is there potential to encourage development within Africa in a way that can empower its population through the private sector? 

-  One of the articles pointed out how the Aid movement unintentionally reinforces negative stereotypes and images of Africa (i.e. images of poor Africans, war-torn Africa etc.) in an effort to raise Aid money. Could this ultimately be doing more harm than good? 

In thinking about how this week's assignments could inform our work on Launchpad, 
we liked that the assigned articles aimed to provide a social, political and economic context. When addressing any social issue, whether it be poverty, educational crisis, inequality etc. it is critical to have a contextualized perspective and an understanding of how these said factors influence the issues at hand.  We also find it interesting how through the course not only are we learning about current global debates re; approaches on how to address poverty, but also  about Acumen's approach and about their organization in general.

 Food for thought on how, through Launchpad, we potentially can foster educational entrepreneurial learning, and also make participants aware of EdLab's philosophy, values and practices.
