            <i>My favorite of Fred's posts is  "Mo' College, Mo' Problems." Economic specialization has done wonders for us as a species. But as our knowledge of any field deepens, the amount of information the next generation has to absorb to truly participate in our economy and society grows in turn. As schooling, or at least knowledge, becomes more vital to our survival, the question of how to fund this becomes increasingly important. Both this and the perhaps inefficient BA-for-all movement are essential issues when we consider how to prepare people for an economy that's increasingly high-skill only. Also, I appreciated the Animal Collective song. </i>

<b><a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6291">Mo' College, Mo' Problems</a></b>

Two reports released this week take aim at our current higher education system, and get in some good shots.

First, from the think tank “Education Sector” (mentioned <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5850">before</a> on the EdLab blog), a <a href="http://www.quickanded.com/2011/08/introducing-the-borrowing-to-credential-ratio.html">report</a> that looks at the ratio of total debt accrued by college students to the total number of degrees conferred.  The conclusion? “Nationwide, the overall borrowing to credential ratio has risen sharply in recent years, from $13,334 in 2007 to $14,560 in 2008 to $18,102 in 2009. The national enterprise of producing college degrees is increasingly being floated on a sea of debt.” One discovery, relevant to the conversation Skanda and I had this week, is that for-profit colleges have a much worse ratio than traditional higher education institutions.

Second, a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/multiple-pathways-from-high-school-to-success/29877">report</a> by James Rosenbaum, highlighted in the Chronicle of Higher Education, argues that our current practice of encouraging every high school student to get a B.A. is wasteful and counterproductive.  The paper identifies “three elements of the BA-for-all movement that are potentially harmful: (1) the idealization of the BA degree...;(2) the promise of college access, which results in high school students seeing their slightly older peers go off to college, but not seeing the trouble many have once on campus; and (3) the cultivation of stigma-free remediation, which results in many “college” students not even knowing that they are in remedial, noncredit courses.”  Given the amount of problems that marginal students encounter when they get to college, they argue that it would be better to explore other options.

Unfortunately, my guess is that reports such as these will have no effect on the future, which will rather involve more debt, more B.A.'s, and more problems.  It's just very hard for us as a society to tell people: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuYMsDwl2xw&amp;feature=related">"You don't have to go to college."</a>
