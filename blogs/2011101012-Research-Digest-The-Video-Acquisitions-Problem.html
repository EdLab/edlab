<b>Description:</b>
This article describes current structures and best practices in video acquisition. The author first discusses the move from developed collections to video on demand, a process that echos current practice for e-book acquisitions in many libraries. Though many libraries have adopted a VOD model, unlike e-book acquisitions, few video providers have created subscription structures to support this move. This, coupled with the demand for increasingly esoteric material, has led to a large-scale splintering in best practices for acquisitions in this area. 

The author discusses the current suite of delivery modes offered through video providers, digital files can be produced or purchased by the library and streamed through library or vendor resources. We're lucky that we have Vialogues as a platform for hosting and restricting the privacy of our purchased titles, many libraries struggle with restricting access to purchased streaming video and setting this up is a lot of work on the back end for the unfortunate EdLabless library. Licensing for streaming video is going through a similar transformation as e-book and journal resources, though film seems to focus less on simultaneous user licenses and more on whether a video will be personal use or shared. Semester licensing is common and problematic from a collection-building perspective. While we want to provide immediate course support it's also important to establish a circulating collection, this may not be the case for video purchasing in future library iterations. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
I often think of the current structure of e-book acquisitions as the wild west: there's plenty of space to grow, room to establish your own rules, and personal morality trumps the long arm of the law. In contrast, current e-video acquisition is a group of enraged cavemen hitting each other with clubs. Video disappears and reappears seemingly at random, there's absolutely no standard of quality or source, and attempts to bar piracy are more violent and less effective. I approached this article to try and get some perspective about the current situation, but the system is still incomprehensible and screams for standardization. E-journals are severely over bureaucratized, with negotiations usually going through a publisher, a vendor, and a consortium before making it to the library. With video, I often have to approach the production company directly to negotiate licensing and purchasing for institutions. 

It shouldn't surprise me that current institutional policies are so scattershot, when personal video acquisitions are similarly diverse. We've seen the collapse or complete transformation of several major film vendors within the past 5 years and success in this area doesn't seem to guarantee sustainability. The business of video, since our migration from the VCR, seems inherently turbulent. The expectation that faculty will be able to stream library-purchased video to distance students does not yet intersect with current availability and widespread policy. I'm anxiously awaiting an industry evolution that will make clear the position of lending institutions in video streaming, but until that happens, watch out for clubs.
