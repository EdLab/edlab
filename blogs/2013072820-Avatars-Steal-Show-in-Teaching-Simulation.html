As pre-service teachers near the moment that finds them leading their first solo class, their anxiety-levels peak. It’s hard to know what to expect; for example, it’s one thing to study classroom management but entirely different when you’re forced to put it into practice. What if kids start whipping out their cell phones in the middle of class, disrespecting your authority? On another worrying note, what if the lesson that was so carefully planned over the last week falls apart within minutes? How do you know the best way to address these issues if you’ve never had to before?<p>

One answer to that question comes in the form of a virtual simulation known as <a href="http://sreal.ucf.edu/teachlive/">TeachLive</a>. TeachLive allows student teachers to practice their craft without fear of making mistakes in front of a live student audience. They can also repeat lessons until they feel effective as educators (without fatiguing their subjects). As demonstrated in the video above, practicing student teachers stand before a small class of student avatars. These avatars respond to the teacher in real time and even simulate the disruptive behavior common to actual classrooms. <p>

TeachLive helps to prepare novice teachers for the challenges that await them in the blackboard jungle. Could such a simulation work for any other profession?  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9820">Add your thoughts</a> to the ongoing discussion on Vialogues. <p>

<b>@00:37 yiu.mable:</b> Great how they don't have to worry about making mistakes! It's always scary to speak when you're nervous you are taking up other students' time. Seems great for teachers too, because each virtual student is different and has their own personality. <p>

<b>@2:07 MartinPaper:</b> I can already imagine a spin off of this idea that features simulations of job roles throughout various industries. Think of how useful this would be for young people to use when choosing their career paths!
