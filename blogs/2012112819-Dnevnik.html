<a href="http://www.dnevnik.ru/">Dnevnik</a> is an educational social network, meant to connect teachers, students, parents, and administrators to improve communication among these groups in the learning process. An all inclusive learning management system, it offers document management and content hosting alongside social components. Dnevnik has been doing quite well abroad; they are currently used in over <a href="http://goaleurope.com/2012/09/04/startup-russia-online-education-network-for-school-dnevnik-ru-raises-5-million-from-runa-capital/">31,000</a> schools across Russia and Ukraine and have secured a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/03/runa-capital-puts-5-million-into-education-platform-with-expansion-plans/">contract</a> with the Russian Ministry of Education. They recently <a href="http://www.arcticstartup.com/2012/09/06/social-educational-network-dnevnik-ru-raises-5-m-for-international-expansion">acquired $5 million in funding</a> to expand into Europe, China, Israel, and the United States under the name <a href="http://classedin.com/">ClassedIn.</a></p>

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
Founder Gabriel Levi, a 2004 <a href="http://company.dnevnik.ru/presscenter/194582">Columbia University</a> graduate, was inspired by Facebook to create a social platform that was exclusive, private, and dedicated. Dnevnik has remained true to this mission, and the result is a communication engine tailored to the needs of K-12 schools. The site innovates in very subtle ways: a profile and blog allow students to experiment with online identity in a highly controlled environment and a library of public domain art and music encourages digital creation and remixing.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
Most of the siteâ€™s features are not groundbreaking, but it manages to digitize and standardize several basic processes that are still largely done on paper. Dnevnik provides an official digital place for calendar sharing, grading, document delivery, and communication among parents, school officials, and students. Unfortunately US schools may need to wait awhile for ClassedIn to catch-up; at this point the information on the site is relatively scant and the instructional screenshots have not quite made the leap from Russian to English.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
Schools will go digital both socially and administratively, and an all-inclusive network like Dnevnik seems poised to compete with platforms like <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2012/09/edmodo_evolves_closer_to_in-school_social_network.html">Edmodo</a> for adoption in the US K-12 market. These networks will become important for efficiency, but also for their own sake as a learning technology. School social networks will give students a safe space to begin growing an online persona which has become <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Start-up-You-Transform-ebook/dp/B0050DIWHU">increasingly important</a> for professional success.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b><br>
If Dnevnik can quickly leap the language barrier, it will be a major competitor for K-12 digitization.</p>
