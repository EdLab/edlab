            Learning Analytics Seminar Series
Mike Tissenbaum
University of Wisconsin
Tuesday Dec. 9, 1pm
449 Grace Dodge

<b>Abstract</b>
There is a growing call by educators and policy makers to engage students in the kinds of authentic inquiry and scientific practices that will prepare them to be productive members of the 21st century “knowledge society”. Despite this, traditional learning environments have remained largely unchanged from century ago.

This talk introduces a collection of specially designed technology enhanced learning environments in which the physical space itself (e.g., the walls, furniture, and students locations in the room) plays a critical role in supporting them as they engage in distributed and collective inquiry.

<b>Bio</b>
Mike Tissenbaum is a designer and researcher of classroom spaces to support students investigating and building knowledge through authentic inquiry. He is interested in how technology can transform physical spaces into dynamic environments that promote new forms of immersive and collective learning.

Currently, Mike is a postdoctoral research associate at the Wisconsin
Institutes for Discovery and the Complex Play Lab (University of
Wisconsin-Madison), where he is helping develop interactive museum
exhibits to teach engineering and science.

Mike received his PhD from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the
University of Toronto, and a Masters from the Faculty of Information and the
Knowledge Media Design Institute.

He is also an avid tinkerer, builder, and maker — often working with Arduino and
other interactive technologies to investigate how we can challenge our
traditional systems of meaning, communication, and sense making. His work has been exhibited at international conferences and national science museums.
