<p>Minecraft is a 3D game about creation and exploration through building and breaking blocks. Unlike most other popular games that use points and levels as the major ingredients to engage players, Minecraft features an open platform that makes it easy for players to create their dream worlds. As such, it has drawn young people from around the world who want to participate in virtual adventures. Educators have joined this mania by using it to teach various subjects: some ask students <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2013/08/14/14502/minecraft-blowing-up-the-classroom-educators-say-t/">to build their own virtual civilizations</a>, helping them learn about power structures and economic systems in a society, while others build <a href="http://www.academia.edu/1891072/Teaching_Scientific_Concepts_Using_a_Virtual_World_-_Minecraft"> Fantastic Voyage-style worlds</a> for students to explore the human body and learn about biology. The openness of Minecraft continues to drive innovative educational applications, and Operacraft is another promising one.</p>

<p>Operacraft was produced by a group of high school and Virginia Tech students. First, they came up with the story and wrote the libretto. Then, instead of creating a real-world stage for the opera performance, students employed their Minecraft building and programming skills to create virtual sets and avatars in a customized version of Minecraft. The opera was performed by a group of singers and musicians along with Minecraft players. One high school participant stated in the video, "I knew a lot about Minecraft but I didnâ€™t know anything about opera, so it [Operacraft] helped me get a general idea of what opera was and how to write an opera."</p>

<p>What do you think of Operacraft and the learning experiences it provided? What are other ways to use Minecraft for learning?

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:51 Sappho:</b> Learning coding and music education at the same time seems a fantastic way for students to learn new skills and disciplines. <p>

<b>@01:46 Telio01:</b> Stupendous project that epitomizes mashup culture and hybridization of performance across disciplines. <p>
