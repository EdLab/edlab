<p><b>Title:</b> Video Self-Modeling on an iPad to Teach Functional Math Skills to Adolescents With Autism and Intellectual Disability (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianwei Zhanga, Marlene Scardamalia, Richard Reevec, & Richard Messinad </p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://foa.sagepub.com/content/28/2/67.full.pdf+html
">Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
Can self-modeling videos help low performing autistic adolescents improve their math skills?<p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Schools provide students with opportunities to learn life skills. This is particularly important for students whose mental faculties put them at a disadvantage in real life settings. Through simple video technology the four intellectually low performing, autistic junior high students in this study developed mathematical skills to help themselves avoid being overcharged while shopping. The participants in the study received instruction through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_self-modeling">video self-modeling</a> (VSM) technique. They were filmed performing seven steps toward the specific mathematical task of estimating the amount of money needed to pay for a given item and the amount of money to be received as change.</p>

<p>Students were given a script of seven steps for completing the task successfully. With prompting, the students were filmed reading the steps and performing the task correctly. A video was then produced of each student reading each step and correctly performing the task with the prompts edited out. Twice daily for four weeks, the students used an iPad to watch the edited video of themselves correctly performing the task without prompts. The students were then allowed to use the videos to assist in solving the same problem on paper. The students were given five similar math problems and allowed to watch the video for assistance in task completion. When the student was able to achieve an 80% performance level in three consecutive sessions, VSM was systematically phased out as the student continued to solve known and novel problems.</p> 

<p><b>Findings:</b> 
Proper performance of the task significantly increased after students viewed themselves modeling successful completion of the task on video. There was little deterioration of studentsâ€™ skill levels on similar but novel math problems when VSM was phased out in subsequent sessions. These outcomes demonstrated the use of VSM for extending competencies in not only life skills but also the core curriculum.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The use and effectiveness of video technology to provide students with footage of themselves accurately performing tasks beyond their current abilities provides opportunities to teach students skills that can only be acquired through repetitive sessions of instruction. A library of videos of skills to be learned could be assembled and tailored for individual students, focusing on priority skills for students to learn. In the future, the use of hand held devices such as an iPad could prove to be an effective tool for focusing autistic students' attention when giving instruction in a variety of other subjects such as science, reading or writing.</p>
