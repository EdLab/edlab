            The rapid growth in privately owned schools in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya is due to lack of quality public education. More and more poor children in the slums of Nairobi are enrolling in privately held schools. However, most of the private schools are not registered with Kenya’s Ministry of Education. As a result, students in private schools who may qualify for the country’s free education grants are not receiving it. Most of the private schools in the slums are low-fee private schools, while the higher-fee private schools are found in more affluent areas. Although the Kenyan government provides free primary and secondary education, parents in the slums often ditch that option in favor of private education. 

However, parents in the country’s middle and elite classes send their children to public primary schools. I believe that parents who send their children to private schools may be happy because research shows that students in low-fee private schools tend to perform better than those from government schools in the slums. Students in low-fee private schools may be performing well but their parents will be financially struggling. This only increases the gap between the poor and rich. It appears as the wealthy people in Kenya have a choice when it comes to education, whereas the poor has none.
