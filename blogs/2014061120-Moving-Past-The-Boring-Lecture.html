<p><b>Title:</b> Using Technology Supported Learning to Develop Active Learning in Higher Education: A Case Study</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> Rohan Jowallah</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED503885">US-China Education Review</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How can online learning experiences support student engagement in higher education?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The study was designed to assess the use of online learning during the first year of a student’s experience at a higher education institution. Students engaged in online tasks as part of the first year course. The tasks included "video presentation, reading of articles, discussion, posting of comments, responding to comments, responding to questions and web quests." Students were assessed on their involvement in the tasks using a questionnaire. Based on the responses, the study seeks to improve active learning online in higher education settings. <p>

<p>The first year class used for this case study was made up of 93 individuals, thirty  of whom were selected for the study, and all of whom attended class once a week. Each class was held in a lecture hall for one hour followed by an hour of small group discussion. Past examinations found that students were not very engaged with the material in this format. Online tasks and activities were introduced to increase participation.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The researchers collected thirty questionnaires.  Of the thirty students, 29 engaged in two or more of the tasks and all reported that the tasks were connected to the outcomes of the course. These students’ views suggest that they have developed or are developing into active learners."</p>

<p>Fifteen of the students said the tasks increased their self-esteem as learners and only ten of the students said the tasks allowed them to interact with other students in the course. The researchers highlight this as an important area to improve; since online learning can be isolating, collaboration must be brought about intentionally. Seventeen respondents thought the online tasks were a good option for the course, thirteen students disagreed, which means, according to the researchers, more work must be done to integrate the online learning experience with the class. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> According to the researchers "there is an urgent need for our education system to foster flexible, creative, self-aware and dynamic learners who have the capacity to apply what is learned." It is not clear from this study how the tasks the researchers developed address these goals. One idea is to consider interviewing and observing students first and developing tasks based on their interest and needs. The bottom line is more work will need to be done in this area to enhance student engagement.</p>
