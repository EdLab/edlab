            What are some factors that determines the quality of an education system? Is it determined by teachers’ salary, the curriculum , or style of teaching? According to this <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-06/best-education-system-putting-stress-on-singaporean-children/6831964">piece</a>, Singapore’s education system is considered to be the best because of its style of teaching. One reason that has contributed to the country’s remarkable performance in education rankings is mental arithmetic. Countries such as South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong have also adopted similar ideas, which also serve as key methods of assessment. In Singapore, children are introduced to mental arithmetic at a very young age, and before they reach their teens, they are able to mentally add up ten-digit numbers. 

For example, Cherlyn Lee has won countless awards at mental arithmetic competitions, and she is only 11 years old. Although this style of learning or teaching helps students in mathematics and science, many students believe that it is extremely intense. Not only that, students also feels stressed because of the two major annual examinations and monthly tests. As a result, there have been complaints that the education system place a lot of emphasis on grades, and therefore does not make learning fun. 

As part of the solution to make learning more fun, the government has made a decision to stop relying so much on examinations. As a student or someone who once went to school, what are some ideas or activities that you think can make learning fun and effective? Also, do you think that the decision to rely less on examinations will affect the country's rank in international education assessments?
