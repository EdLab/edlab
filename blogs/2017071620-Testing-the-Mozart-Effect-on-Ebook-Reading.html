<p>Classical music has a reputation for making people smarter. There’s even something called the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1281386/">Mozart Effect</a>, which refers to the fact that while listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT9gT5bqi6Y">Mozart’s K.448 sonata for two pianos</a>, people are better able to perform mental tasks, such as piecing together puzzles and studying for exams. His sonata has also been shown to reduce learning anxiety in students. Few studies, however, have tested the Mozart effect on learning with modern technology. Yet a recent research team took up the task by observing how K.448 affected ebook reading. Mozart was a genius, yes, but can his musical works really bring ebook-wielding students to new mental heights?</p>
 
<p>Researchers wanted to examine the effects of Mozart’s K.448 on learning anxiety, reading rate, comprehension, and cognitive load as students read on their ebooks. Because each ebook had a touch interface, the research team was able to gather more precise data than they would in using print books. Participants included 62 fifth and sixth grade students, split into two groups, who completed three reading tasks on an ebook reader. One group did so silently; the other read while listening to Mozart’s K.448. After each task, the students were given questionnaires and quizzes that tested their anxiety levels, reading comprehension, and cognitive load.</p>
 
<p>Overall, students in the music group reported much lower levels of learning anxiety than students in the silent group. In fact, 93% reported that listening to Mozart helped them relax. Students listening to Mozart also read more quickly than those without music. On top of that, students in the music group had significantly greater levels of reading comprehension; their post-task quiz scores were much higher than those of their non-music peers. Despite these benefits, the researchers also found one downside to the music: students listening to Mozart carried a greater cognitive load, which means that they were less able to focus on and interpret the text. This is likely because their attention was split between the reading task and the music.</p>
 
<p>These findings echo other similar studies: Mozart might make your mind work better. In this case, it decreased learning anxiety and improved reading rates and comprehension in elementary school students reading on ebooks. Because the music also increases students’ cognitive loads, however, the researchers recommend that teachers use it only when students are already familiar with a learning task rather than heaping on tons of new stimuli all at once.</p>
 
<p>Perhaps another study can test how Mozart’s K.448 affects writing. Future researchers, I submit this article as preliminary evidence because, yes, I was listening to the sonata while writing this piece.</p>
