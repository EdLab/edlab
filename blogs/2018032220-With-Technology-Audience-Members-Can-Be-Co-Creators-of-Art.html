<p>In the Cloud Machine, the audience is as much a creator of the artwork as the designers themselves. This life-size visual installation uses the thoughts and emotions of viewers to shift shapes and display new colors, bending itself to new reactions and feelings as they arise. Each audience member enters the space with a controller tightly in hand that monitors their skin electricity, heat, and moisture. The data collected is fed into the cloud generator, allowing the audience members to see a visual representation of their collective feelings.</p>

<p>Created by Peder Bjurman and Leif Jordansson and displayed in Sweden, the Cloud Machine ensures every viewer experience is different. The designers can’t control what shapes the cloud takes; only the unique collection of individuals in the room can. Bjurman and Jordansson call their project a <i><a href="http://bohmbohmroom.com/2016/05/the-cloud-machine/">social sculpture</i></a> and say their goal was to create an artistic work where the audience served as co-creators just by inhabiting the space. By changing shape according to real-time data, the Cloud Machine demonstrates the unique possibilities of blending technology and art.</p>

<p>What do you think it would be like to see a cloud that represents your feelings and emotions? Do you think this project has educational potential for audience members? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41744">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:04 Dyranda:</b> This is extraordinary, an entire audience making an emotional story off of their bodily reactions to emotion... love that the cloud can also be volatile.</p>

<p><b>@02:03 RyanAllen:</b> I feel like the lead was kind of buried here. The cloud is interesting, but the technology of capturing a person’s mood/feeling seems much more innovative. Adding to that, grouping whatever data that is and matching it with everyone else in the audience is fascinating. The application of that tech seems quite relevant to educators, as we are often tasked with engaging an entire classroom.</p>
