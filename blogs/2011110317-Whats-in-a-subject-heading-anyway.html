          <p>
            <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/refman/fail-again-fail-better">A  post by Allen Foresta </a>on this very same blog inspired me to reconsider  (positively) my love of subject headings assigned by the Library of  Congress.  A quick explanation of what these are, for the uninitiated:  as a form of bibliographic control, the Library of Congress assigns books subject  headings, which enable users to search for books by subject, rather than  simply by author or title.  What’s fantastic about subject headings is  that books on similar topics are then linked by being described by the  same terms (and searchable by hyperlink when in an online OPAC, like  Educat or CLIO).  Subject headings work because the descriptive options  are finite, but they’re tricky for the same reason: we’re relying on  human subjectivity to determine the core meaning or salient features of  any given work.  No two people tend to describe anything the same way.   And while certain books--like textbooks, for instance--seem straight  forward, other books--like fiction or memoirs--aren’t, necessarily.   Aside from being an incredibly useful tool for searching for books on  research topics, I also find it intriguing to know what facets of the  book I’m about to read the LOC finds most pressing.  The publisher, the  editor, the publicist, and the book’s reviewers all put their markings  on the exterior of the book--their interpretations. But subject headings  affect where the book lives on the shelf <em>for the rest of the book’s  library life</em>.  Which description is most crucial to the book?  And then  there’s the author, who spends the entire mid-section of the book--the  pages between the jacket--trying to explain what the book is <em>really</em> about.  Who’s correct? And what about the reader; doesn’t each person  who encounters a text transform it through their personal  interpretation? Ah, philosophy!

Anyway.

The  first thing I do when I open a new book is check out the subject  headings printed on the back of the title page.  It’s such a precise and  sometimes erratic-seeming sliver of what’s in store for me next.  For  example, the subject headings describing Mary Karr’s memoir, LIT:

Poets, American–20th century–Biography.
Recovering alcoholics–United States–Biography.
Mental illness–United States–Case studies.
Alcoholism–United States–Case studies.
Dysfunctional families–Texas.
Texas–Biography.

This  book has it all: poetry, mental illness, alcohol, Texas.  I doubt Mary  Karr would be surprised by these headings, but might she be surprised by  “Dysfunctional families--Texas”?  As it is, if someone is doing  research on dysfunctional families in Texas via a subject search, Karr’s  life story should pop up on the list.  She must have high-fived someone  when she saw that.

But  here’s an interesting counterpoint to the above... Augusten Burroughs’  DRY, his follow-up memoir to RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, has the following  subject headings:

Advertising agencies --New York (State) --New York.
Novelists, American --20th century --Biography.
Copy writers --United States --Biography.
Manhattan (New York, N.Y.) --Social life and customs.

Sounds  fairly regal, no?  Manhattan, it’s social life and customs.  Novelists;  ad agencies; the 20th century.  I imagine walks around Central Park  with an Irish setter.  What’s odd is that this book is explicitly about  alcoholism and his recovery (the book is called Dry!) but you would  never know from the subject terms that his memoir and Karr’s cover the  same terrain.  What’s the story behind that story?  Only the catalogers  can explain.

Well, what subject headings describe <em>your</em> favorite books?
