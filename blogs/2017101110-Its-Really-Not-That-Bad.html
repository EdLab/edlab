          <p>
            <p>I recently came across a paper titled &quot;Spatial Ability for STEM Domains: Aligning Over 50 Years of Cumulative Psychological Knowledge Solidifies Its Importance&quot; in Journal of Educational Psychology. The main point of the paper is trying to tie the spatial ability to the identification of potential STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) talents. Not a big surprise, given the popularity of STEM education. But then several graphs from their results caught my attention. Now, by sharing these graphs, I'm probably going to offend almost every single person here. But, it's really not that bad. I'll explain later. </p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Lubinski's research group at Vanderbilt analyzed a large scale longitudinal dataset from the TALENT project. The TALENT project was initiated in 1960 by AIR (American Institutes for Research). They collected data from over 400,000 U.S. high school students. The participants are a stratified sample of the U.S. high school student population which means they are representative of the demographics. Each student was given a series of questionnaires and tests over one week. Among them, three instruments were intended to measure students' math ability, verbal ability, and spatial ability. Follow up surveys were taken 1, 5, and 11 years after high school. Outcomes like highest degree received, major, and occupation was reported. Lubinski's group analyzed these data and plotted the relationships between cognitive abilities measure in high school (math, verbal, and spatial) and outcomes (majors, occupations, or even GRE scores). </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span></p><p><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20171011095201-screen_shot_2017_10_11_at_9_28_16_am_png_95dfb2c584eba0012442eafb11813740.png" style /><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><br /></span><img src="https://img.tc-library.org/w750/EdLab-blog/20171011095227-screen_shot_2017_10_11_at_9_28_28_am_png_51fb94f9e09d95d372da9a9669a05f38.png" style /></p><p>By the way, the units are standard deviations. Within expectation, STEM fields have some of the highest math and spatial abilities. And their verbal ability is not bad either. Some people might wonder what is up with biological sciences. They are not part of STEM? Well, don't get me started on the stereotypical intellectual bullying that might exist in the science cycle.  But then you found the real eyesore. What is up with Education?! Almost left along in the lower left quadrant? low math ability, low verbal ability, and low spatial ability? And even worse, they singled out EdD from Ph.D. in Education and it's sitting nowhere near the rest of the group.</p><p><br /></p><p>I bet you are pretty depressed by now. But it's actually not that bad. 0.5 standard deviation below the average isn't really that bad. In fact, about 68% of the people are expected to be within 1 standard deviation from the average, and about 97% of the people are expected to be within 2 standard deviations. More importantly, the interpretation of these results should take the relative population into consideration. For example, when you look at the terminal doctorate graph, you are looking at people who obtained doctorates. Those people very likely already possess higher math, verbal, and spatial abilities.</p><p><br /></p><p>So it's really not that bad!</p>
