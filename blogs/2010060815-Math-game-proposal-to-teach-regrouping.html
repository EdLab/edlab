          <p>
            Today I presented at the D&R meeting proposing a math game for K-3 children which teaches the regrouping concept and strategies. This game will utilize the multitouch technologies such as on iPad and HP TouchSmart to give children an intuitive, hands-on gameplay experience. In addition, this game will differ from 95% of the existing math games on iPhone/iPad in the following ways:

1. Gameplay is highly relevant to math learning
2. Game scaffolds strategy development
3. Flexible play, adaptive learning goals
4. Brain-finger coordination on multitouch screen
5. Assessment integration

For more details including the rationale for the game, the "regrouping" math concept, and the (simple) market research, please see the attached presentation slides.

I was debating with myself whether to make this game for iPhone/iPad or PC. To make the game available to a lot of children is a big goal of us. In this sense the PC-based Flash platform suites our needs best (at least at this point of time). But we also want to create a game that is innovative and contribute to our future research and production. In this sense, iPhone/iPad with the most advanced mobile and multitouch technologies is our best hardware available.

Based on the feedback I received in the D&R meeting, it seems we probably will go for an iPad app. We will do further research on this issue.

Some other feedback I received are that this game should have an attractive storyline so as to engage young children, that the game interface should be simple but easy to operate, and that a lot of attention should be paid to the game design process. 

Jeannie, Faisal, and I are currently the three members of this project team. With Jeannie specialized in game design, Faisal in programming, and I in something between, I really have a high expectation to the outcome of this project.

If any other colleague have any suggestion, or have interest in collaborating on this project, please do let us know!
