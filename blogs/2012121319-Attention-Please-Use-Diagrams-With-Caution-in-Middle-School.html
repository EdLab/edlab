<b>Title:</b> Are diagrams always helpful tools? Developmental and individual differences in the effect of presentation format on student problem solving (2011)<p>
<b>Author(s):</b> Julie L. Booth & Kenneth R. Koedinger
</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The use of visualizations and diagrams in the classroom has been exhaustively studied. Most research in this area has discovered that diagrams, especially those added to text, are beneficial but only if they are highly relevant to the information being taught. Diagrams and visualizations applied to math instruction are often used in Singapore and Japan, two countries in which mathematics achievement is <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/">consistently outstanding</a> by world standards. In the USA, studies of high school and college students have found that story-type algebra problems are easier to solve. Diagrams may help enhance this visualization effect and the results might be meaningful for younger and at-risk students. 
</p>

<p>
The authors of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02041.x/full">Are Diagrams Always Helpful Tools? Developmental and Individual Differences in the Effect of Presentation Format on Student Problem Solving</a> ran a longitudinal experiment on 373 sixth to eighth graders at an ethnically diverse school in the Midwest. The students solved three different types of equations that corresponded to instructional styles: classic equation, story-type problems, and story problems with an added diagram.
</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The study replicated past findings on older students in that story problems were met with more success than classic equations across all grade levels. The study also found that the diagrams only enhanced the performance of older and higher ability students in the study, and younger and lower-ability students did not benefit from the addition of a diagram. The diagram also did not reduce conceptual errors. Diagrams don’t seem to be the magic bullet for math understanding and should be used with caution, especially for younger students.
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> It’s intriguing that diagrams, though an essential element of math instruction in Japan and Singapore, proved ineffective in this study. More research should be done on countries that are successfully using visualizations in the curriculum; perhaps these elements could be more effective if deployed in another stage of the learning process; or perhaps there is an important developmental threshold for visual understanding that this study was unable to identify. There could also be cultural and contextual differences that impact the effectiveness of diagrams. Instructional diagrams and visualizations seem to be an important component of many online systems but, as our understanding of these systems is limited, these components should be examined and used cautiously by teachers and instructional designers.
