<p>Even before children are of age to attend school, the number of mobile device apps marketed to them is impressive. Beyond entertainment, educational apps have intrigued both parents and teachers in their ability to capture the attention of young learners. When utilized in classrooms, these apps can create more varied ways to learn, but they are used in different combinations over time and little is known about young children's real and varied use of them. In order to better understand how multiple app use affects the learning process, researchers in Australia set out to collect data in primary schools across the country.</p>
 
<p>The researchers were interested in determining what app types were used most frequently in classrooms, what patterns in app use exist, and how multiple app use relates to learning. Because of Austria’s national one-to-one tablet program, the researchers were able to collect data from 15,000 Android devices in use in 148 primary schools over the course of three years. Data was collected on which apps were used on children’s tablets and the frequency of each app used. Apps were categorized based on purpose (such as brain games or creativity) and those that were educational were classified as learning skills apps, informational management apps, and content learning apps.</p>
 
<p>Results revealed that students were using over 30,000 apps (including different versions of the same app), but despite this wide range of combined app use, there were noticeable patterns in the types of apps used. Five clusters of schools emerged; those that most heavily utilized free education apps (27), those primarily using paid education apps (43), those using apps focusing on personalization (48), those using few educational apps alongside highly gendered games (6), and those defined by a lack of educational app use (24).</p>

<p>Students in the first cluster of schools used the highest amount of content learning apps (known for emphasizing a drill-and-practice model), but they also utilized apps that focused on information management and learning skills. Those primarily using paid education apps used fewer apps, but they tended to be of higher learning quality, while those in the personalization cluster utilized a wide variety of apps, from numeracy and literacy content learning platforms to puzzles, personalization programs, and APK creation.</p>

<p>Across the clusters, the most common types of educational apps used were content learning apps, which the researchers of this study point out tend to be less effective than informational management and learning skills apps. Therefore, clusters that utilized a wider variety of quality, skill development-focused apps probably featured schools with students exposed to greater and more effective learning opportunities. Though this research just illuminates the tip of the iceberg, it does illustrate the importance of being able to recognize not just what makes a good app, but what combination of apps is best for student success.</p>
