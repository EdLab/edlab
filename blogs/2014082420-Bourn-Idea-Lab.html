<p><i>"The Bourn Idea Lab is our school's digital fabrication studio, where girls (and teachers!) come to tinker, build, and prototype. We have a laser cutter, a 3D printer, programmable microcontrollers, vacuum former, vinyl cutter, 3D mill, and assorted hand tools. Oh, and lots and lots of cardboard and other prototyping materials."</i> (via <a href="http://www.castilleja.org/page.cfm?p=941600"> Bourn Idea Lab site</a>)</p>

<p><b>Connecting girls with technology</b><br>
The Bourn Idea Lab is housed in the Castilleja school, an all-girl, grades 6-12, independent school in Palo Alto, California dedicated to innovation and cultivating the female leaders of tomorrow. The Bourn Idea Lab, a digital fabrication studio, also houses the school’s robotics programs complete with a robotics and Lego League team. The Lab partners regularly with Stanford University, hosting, for example, a faculty workshop in partnership with Stanford’s Transformative Learning Technologies Lab.</p>

<p>At the lab, students "tinker, build, and prototype" with, among other things, a laser cutter, a 3D printer, programmable microcontrollers, vacuum former, vinyl cutter, and 3D mill. Recent projects include an interactive museum and an exhibit on Cancer Biology designed by high school students. In six weeks students produced a wide range of exhibit components, including a 3D printed heart complete with tubes and strings of Arduino controlled pulsing LED lights to represent blood flow. This is one of many innovative project-based learning experiences students of all ages have engaged in at the Lab.</p>

<p><b>A space for teaching problem solving</b><br>
Faculty members think carefully about the methodology of teaching innovation with their students. In <a href=" http://abc7news.com/archive/9104405/ ">an interview</a>, Bourn Idea Lab director Angi Chau, Ph.D., shares, "It's not about boxes and drills. It's about getting them to think spatially, and getting them to solve problems." She continues, "There's actually a lot of intricate problems you have to solve like, 'Wait, where should the hinge go? What side should it fit in? Which side of the box should open? How do all these pieces fit together?' And the more practice we give them, the more advantage these girls will gain," said Chau. Dialogue and inquiry as part of learning and building marks the curriculum design behind all of the Lab’s projects.</p>
