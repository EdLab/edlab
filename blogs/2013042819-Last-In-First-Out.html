          <p>
            I find this <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/why-teachers-ones-pink-slips-203016161.html">article</a> very engaging because of the name of the procedure that the NYC Board of Education uses to cut teachers from a particular district. The name of the procedure, <b>Last in, First out</b>, is a policy that teachers hired last are the first ones to lose their job.  The name of the policy reminds me of a method used in accounting when determining the cost flow of a company. In accounting, the term is shorten as LIFO (Last in, First Out), but using LIFO in accounting does not cause a person to lose his/her job, it enables a company to determine inventories that are available to use and the amount of money the company spent on goods that were sold.

When I read the article, I felt that it is unethical for the Board to stand on such a procedure to make this kind of decision. Why should it be that teachers hired last are the ones to lose their job when there is a cut? Is it because of the lack of experience? If that is the case, then this last in, first out method is not good enough because as a student, I have witnessed experienced teachers who have shown signs that they are not very good at the subject that they teach.  According to the article, “If promoting the best educational experience is the answer, Last in, First out needs to be reconsidered.” In other words, if the Board of Education is looking forward to improving a good educational experience, then there should be a better solution to cut teachers off, rather than the last in, first out method. I firmly believe that what matters is the quality of the teacher and their expertise in their subject area, not the longevity.
