The goal of <a href="http://braingenie.com/">BrainGenie</a> is to engage math and science students in grades 1-7 through differentiated learning activities. The online platform allows instructors to easily set goals for their students and track mastery, while students are given video-based activities to complete independently to reach these bench-marked goals. The subjects covered in the tutorials include Math, Science, and Physics.

<b>Pros:</b>
Game dynamics, like leaderboards and badges, make interaction fun for students. Additionally, classes are easy for instructors to set up using a CSV file to upload all participants at once. A free library of course modules is easy to navigate and use without an account, providing a simple way for instructors and students to access activities on a trial basis. Lessons are clearly linked to standards based on grade level and, like the whole site, are easy to discover and intuitive to navigate.

<b>Cons:</b>
The instructor analytics easily track student progress and engagement; however, the student-facing metrics seem too complicated to easily understand (see the "progress" image below). I am not sure what the direct ramifications of the graph really mean for me as a learner. Perhaps it would be more helpful to provide a top-level view of completion on my way to a goal and save the deeper dive into analytics for the instructor view. As an instructor, I wish the platform linked more clearly to other learning management systems. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we explore mSchool development, it seems worthwhile to explore how our platform will communicate with or link to (if at all) other LMSs. This ability to extend functionality across platforms could mean the difference between temporary and long-term instructor adoption. Also, keeping analytics simple for learners and saving the more powerful assessment for instructors seems like a better use of development resources. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Game dynamics and clear linking to standards are important, but extensibility may really make the difference for long-term adoption.
