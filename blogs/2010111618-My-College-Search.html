          <p>
            As a current high school junior, I am currently researching colleges and universities I am aiming to gain admittance come next year. In doing so, I have followed certain criterion which now has me looking at nine colleges of immense interest to me. This number seemed unimaginable during the very beginning stages of my search. As we all know, the sheer number of colleges and universities in this country can be seen both as a blessing and a curse. A blessing in that there are various options for one to choose from and a curse in that the strenuous task of narrowing or choosing the few to apply to can be daunting.
 
With this in mind, I began my search using the search tool on College Board's website. My search initially returned over 3,500 colleges but I gradually narrowed it down based on certain factors. These factors include location/region, size, cost, private or public, degrees offered, and extracurricular activities among others. Upon my observation, I've noticed there is no such thing as a “perfect” college: one that meets all of my preferences. I prioritized as to which factor (s) was most important to me. The two primary factors in my college search is the size of the school and the degrees they offer. My preferred size is a mid-level size school ranging from 15,000 and below and my degree of interest is international business and/or mathematics. Although it is possible that I might do a complete U-turn on what I want to major in, at the moment I am very settled on pursuing a degree in the aforementioned programs.
 
The least most important factor to me is location. I see myself as a cosmopolitan individual and wouldn't mind attending a college in any specific region of the country as long as it meets my two primary factors. Also a school's ranking doesn't really bother me as long as it has a good postgraduate job placement rate.
 
When I enter my senior year next fall, I'll start looking more into other factors such as financial aid and housing in ranking my nine choices. The school currently at the top of my wish list is Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. Their majors are made in such that they are very flexible, which means you can earn a major with a minor relating to that major or double major on two completely unrelated subjects. Also one feature of the school that caught my attention was its CO-OP program. This program places students on six-month internships during the school year mostly correlating to their intended major. This not only helps students in deciding if they really want to pursue a career that correlates to their major but it also gives them working experience that may eventually prove useful when vying for a job after graduation. The rest of the nine colleges include George Washington University, Georgetown University, Boston University, University of Pennsylvania, Butler University, CUNY Baruch College, Roger Williams University, and University of Scranton. This is where I currently stand with my college search process and will provide more updates as the search continues.
