<p><i>"HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory) is an interdisciplinary community of humanists, artists, social scientists, scientists, and technologists, and they are changing the way we teach and learn. Our 13,000+ members from over 400+ affiliate organizations share news, tools, research, insights, pedagogy, methods, and projects--including Digital Humanities and other born-digital scholarship--and collaborate on various HASTAC initiatives."</i> (<a href="https://www.hastac.org/about-hastac">About HASTAC</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Community and Resources</b></p>

<p>The humanities are often perceived as a discipline examined through a historical lens, particularly with subjects like classics, literature, and philosophy; however, the founders of <a href="https://www.hastac.org">HASTAC</a> argue that the humanities not only exist in the context of the digital age, but also thrive when integrated with technology and the sciences.</p>

<p>HASTAC is a community comprised of both individuals and organizations, all of whom are all working with aspect of humanities, learning, and technology. Members of HASTAC are invited to post in the community blog—discussing issues such as revisionism and educational equality, highlighting relevant seminars and initiatives, and posting resources for the community.</p>

<p><b>Higher Education and Scholars</b></p>
 
<p>The organization also takes part in initiatives beyond just providing its members with a platform to discuss and collaborate. Its FutureEd Initiative, for example, is a crowdsourced compilation of courses, workshops, and resources that focus specifically on the future of higher education. HASTAC invites its members to contribute to the expanding list of scholarly articles on new pedagogical changes to higher ed classrooms.</p>
 
<p>Beyond resource aggregation, HASTAC also engages its members through its HASTAC Scholars program, which brings together university students from various disciplines to discuss pedagogy in the context of technology and develop new projects together. Each year comes with its own new cohort, and the members are encouraged to compare higher education experiences at their respective campuses. This program, along with HASTAC’s other avenues for communication, serves as a community for individuals invested in digital humanities to come together.</p>
