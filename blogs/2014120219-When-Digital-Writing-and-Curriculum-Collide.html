<p>What happens when teachers and students take up digital composing? A recent study from an Australian elementary school focused on the experiences of three fourth-grade English teachers who began to use different types of digital texts, such as web pages, podcasts, digital comics, videos, and blogs over the course of a school year. The authors found that the teachers, who started out viewing digital writing as time-consuming and challenging, began to see the composition of digital texts as a strategy to reinforce their pedagogic practices within the school curriculum. </p>

<p>Students' digital literacy practices also had an effect on the flexibility of their official and unofficial learning spaces. Students grew into active agents who transformed social and material classroom spaces. For example, students adapted spaces to meet the needs of their digital projects, such as filming and audio recording in various locations.</p>

<p>Though students produced a rich variety of digital texts in the program, the three teachers differed in their ability to assess students’ multimodal creations due to the complex, fluid remixes of media in the student projects. In addition, teachers tended to prioritize students’ conventional written text created with and in the digital platforms over the other media products created by students because they more closely aligned with the academic requirements of the school curriculum.</p>

<p>The findings of the study demonstrate that regulative school discourses still play a role in shaping the teaching practices of digital writing in elementary classrooms. Though teachers in the study were open-minded in experimenting with innovative integration of digital literacies into their own classrooms, their ways of teaching mostly aligned with conventional written text rather than students’ new authoring experiences with/in digital media.</p>
