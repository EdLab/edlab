Last night, I was at Google's NYC office, where <a href="http://incubatenyc.com/" target="_blank">IncubateNYC</a> had one of their MVP Fairs. The MVP Fair marked the end of a 5-week bootcamp for a cohort of about a dozen budding entrepreneurs. Their final task was to pitch their incubated ideas!

The format was like a networking event: beer, pitches, and more ideas. I saw cut and paste bristol-board presentations... iPads loaded with photographs, landing pages, and even functional websites! I even saw a good old printout of Powerpoint slides. People pitched with whatever they had.

Originally, I went in looking to see if there were any new edtech ideas, but I didn't see any education-focused ideas. Overall, this cohort was comprised mostly of fashion, real estate, and lifestyle startups. So I pivoted my own agenda, and began asking the bootcamp graduates about what they thought was the most valuable lesson learned in the last 5 weeks. Here's what some said:

<b>Invest in customer development.</b> Make something the consumers really need and want. And don't be afraid to pivot when you find out it just won't work. One of the startups, I learned, began as a digital soap opera, and only 7 days ago was pivoted into a lifestyle app. This makes me even more eager to try to get on the list for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank" target="_blank">Steve Blank</a>'s Lean Launchpad block course at Columbia. After all, he's the guy who came up with "Customer Development" in the first place...

<b>Get a mantra (not to be mistaken for slogan).</b> A mantra is sometimes not even a sentence-long, but a catchy phrase that guides many of the daily decisions of a company. I learned that Nike, whose slogan is, "Just do it", has a completely different mantra for its employees: "Authentic Athletic Performance".  Check out this recent <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3000236/repeat-after-me-your-company-needs-mantra" target="_blank">Fast Company article about mantras</a>. I think we ourselves need a mantra, for EdLab and even for individual products, which each act like its own startup.
