Matthew Israel is an art historian with a special interest in genetics, but not the kind of Watson and Crick DNA that you might imagine. Israel is mapping genes of creation in works of art through <a href="http://theartgenomeproject.tumblr.com/">The Art Genome Project</a> at <a href="http://art.sy/">Artsy</a>. This search tool creates a catalogue of nuanced metadata made for art search and education. There are over five hundred genes that incorporate knowledge from over hundreds of years of historical art scholarship with the aim of making "all of the world's art accessible to anyone with an internet connection." Israel calls this a "new pedagogical experience for art history." As he puts it, "we're trying to map out the serendipity of learning." Israel filled in the details about his fascinating work during an interview in the Fall of 2012.  
<p>
<b> EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW </b> <p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I completed a Ph.D. in Art History and Archaeology at the <a href=" http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/">Institute of Fine Arts, NYU</a> and expected to go into teaching, but then I began working with Artsy. I see Artsy as a dynamic teaching tool that enables a wide audience to learn about art in an accessible and dynamic, but still nuanced and sophisticated, way.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>  

<b>Answer: </b>I would say all of my professional experiences inform my current work with Artsy in some way. But I would say teaching--I was an adjunct at NYU and Parsons and I taught adult education classes at MoMA--has probably informed my work at Artsy the most. Creating lectures on a huge variety of subjects; deciding how to get an audience excited; figuring out what to leave in and leave out of a class; and trying to create a narrative around art and artists that doesn’t oversimplify--made teaching the most challenging thing I have ever done and the most comparable to the educational work we are trying to do at Artsy and with The Art Genome Project. 
<p>
<b>Question: </b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>   
 
<b>Answer: </b>In general, I hope lots of people--both those involved in the art world and those who have had limited access to art--will use Artsy and enjoy it and learn from it. I also hope The Art Genome Project enhances the art learning experience as it is an altogether new pedagogical experience that is self-motivated and non-linear--quite unlike the traditional tools of art education. At the same time, I should say that The Art Genome Project is just the most recent outgrowth of art-historical education. Art historians have always been primarily concerned in mapping out historical connections between art and artists and exploring new ones.
 
<p>
<b>Question: </b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br> 
<b>Answer: </b>
Right now, like a lot of people, I’m really curious about how online classes will affect traditional classroom learning, the campus environment and the role of the traditional educator. (For a great post on this subject, <a href="http://benjaminlima.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/massive-online-learning-and-the-unbundling-of-undergraduate-education/">see Benjamin Lima’s blog post</a>.) I think these types of courses will have a great impact, and I hope that we don’t look at them in fear (due to fear of losing jobs or a belief in the sanctity of traditional academic structure) but try to focus on what we are really supposed to be doing here--teaching at the highest level and facilitating learning--and seriously evaluate how and if new tools can improve the learning experience. 
<p>
<b>Question: </b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer: </b>I am currently 150% involved in The Art Genome Project. Yet I do pursue my own research and writing. Primarily, I am completing my first book, <a href=" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0292745427/ref=kinw_rke_rti_1">which concerns American art and the Vietnam War</a>.

<i> Matthew is an art historian and is currently the Director of The Art Genome Project at Artsy. He received his Ph.D. in Art History and Archaeology from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University and has taught modern and contemporary art history, as well as critical reading and writing at: New York University; Parsons The New School for Design; and The Museum of Modern Art, New York. His book,
<a href=" http://www.amazon.com/Kill-Peace-American-Artists-Against/dp/0292745427">Kill for Peace: American Artists Against the Vietnam War</a>, will be released in Spring 2013 from University of Texas Press. <i/>
