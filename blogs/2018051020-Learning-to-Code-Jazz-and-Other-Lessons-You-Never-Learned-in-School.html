<p>A product of a 2016 initiative launched by the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, <a href="https://mathsciencemusic.org/#/">MathScienceMusic</a> is a site that aims to teach young people math and science concepts through music, recognizing that in the real world, these subjects aren't separated the way they are in school. In collaboration with leading math, science, music, and education experts, this organization has worked to develop free materials to be used in or outside a classroom.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The MathScienceMusic site is an expansive collection of games, lesson plans, lectures, and other resources that excited me on behalf of all math, science, and music teachers. As a teacher who has tried to make connections across academic disciplines before, I know the challenge of coming up with your own materials and fitting interdisciplinary learning into standardized, required curriculum. Having a site like this that makes those important connections for you is truly a godsend.</p>

<p>The site caters to all age ranges, and each section lists its intended audience, the concepts covered (such as neuroscience, rhythm, fractions, and listening), and the processes that will be learned (such as cognition, improvisation, geometry, and composing). The activities themselves are creative, age-appropriate, and extremely fun. For older users, there are video lectures and music and culture case studies. For younger audiences, there are interactive platforms like <i>Groove Pizza</i>, which lets users manipulate different symbols and drum beats based on shapes and angles. I spent longer than I’d like to admit on <i>Scratch Jazz</i>, a platform that combines coding and jazz, by programming a dance number for an oompah band and a barking frog. As someone who knows a lot about music but not coding, I came out of this program feeling excited and inspired.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It is difficult to offer many critiques of MathScienceMusic, but I do have minor complaints related to specific programs. <i>Scratch Jazz</i> emphasizes the sequencing and iterative aspects of composing, and I think there is an expectation that users code the same way they compose. This ignores a lot of important factors in music-making, so I was frustrated when I was limited in ways I typically wouldn’t be when composing.</p>
 
<p><i>Groove Pizza</i> could benefit from a tutorial. It took a lot of trial and error to figure out how to move, remove, and change different shapes, and I would have liked more control over the different tracks to create a beat not dictated by genre. These lapses in controllability were frustrating at times.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>MathScienceMusic is a truly wonderful collection of resources for parents, teachers, and students of all ages. For any aspiring musician struggling to understand the relevance of math in their daily life, or for an aspiring mathematician certain they have no musical talent, this platform is a gamechanger.</p>
