<b>Title:</b> Can You See Me Thinking (About My Answers)? Using Eye-Tracking to Illuminate Developmental Differences in Monitoring and Control Skills and Their Relation to Performance (2014)
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Thomas Roderer & Claudia M. Robers
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11409-013-9109-4#page-1"> Metacognition Learning</a>
<p>
<b> Research Question:</b> How do metacognitive control behavior and student age affect learning?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b>  Metacognitive control behavior (all those things we do to make sure we’re handling a problem or series of problems correctly) can play a key role in learning and development. Unfortunately, it’s hard to get a good handle on what’s going on in people’s heads when they apply these behaviors. The authors of this study decided to track learners’ eye movements to examine their attentional focus (a key metacognitive control behavior), and correlate these movements with learning, retention and age.
<p>
Their study sample was a group of 150 children and adults, all attempting to memorize a series of Japanese characters (Kanji) with no prior knowledge while an eye-tracking system hidden in the computer recorded where their gazes fell, and for how long. After these trials, participants were tested on their recognition of the Kanji, and given opportunities to indicate how confident they were in their answers.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b> Confirming previous research, older participants, when giving a wrong answer, were less confident in their responses.  More generally, the importance of where participants focused their thoughts (as indicated by eye-tracking data) for getting the right answer declined as participants aged, indicating that mega-cognitive strategies like attentional focus may become less important (although, for participants of any age, spending a lot of time looking at the wrong answer did end up being correlated with guessing the wrong answer).
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b> That our learning styles change as we age may seem a truism, but what this paper provides is a more focused sense of how they change. Most importantly, it gives us a better idea of how important cognitive monitoring can be for young learners, and therefore of how useful metacognitive support might be for future learning tools for young learners.
