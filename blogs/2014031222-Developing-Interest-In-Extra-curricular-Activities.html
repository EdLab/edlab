            As children grow so do their interest in most things such as favorite school subject, food, music and extra-curricular activity, among others. However, when it comes to picking a sport to play, most children are influenced by their parents. This <a href="http://activeforlife.com/ask-the-expert-should-i-push-my-child-into-sport/">article</a> highlights some ways parents could carefully assist their children in finding a sport that will find interesting and fun. One of the advantages of playing sports is that it can help a child overcome shyness and gain confidence. One of the recommendations from the articles is that parents should not impose their personal interests in helping their children choose a sport. Additionally, they should also know when to pull their child from a sport once they show a lack of interest or are no longer fun. 
<p>
Sports can help an individual become active and more sociable. It is a way for children to learn the value of teamwork (if they play a team sport), sportsmanship, and discipline. All of these are valuable skills and traits that will have a positive effect on other aspects of their lives such as school and eventual professional life. As a child, I was not influenced by my parents to play soccer but I wanted to be like my father (a former pro). Luckily for me, my parents were very helpful in motivating and nurturing my love for soccer; a passion I still maintain. 
<p>
How did you become interested in a passion you have? Did your parents play a role in nurturing that passion?
