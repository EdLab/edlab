          <p>
            With education receiving its share of cuts as a result of budget constraints, many school <a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/education/22619665/detail.html">districts</a> have decided to eliminate music from its curriculum as a means of balancing the books. This is an alarming trend considering the true educational value that the music curriculum holds. School districts argue that music is not a core subject for students and thus for economic reasons, it makes sense to discard the course. In doing so, I feel school districts have unknowingly eliminated a subject that not only breeds creativity but also improves student performance.
 
Composing music takes a degree of creativity and organization, a task as critical as the subjects that are deemed important. Also, reading a musical composition requires a student to focus on a particular piece while simultaneously playing an instrument. Such mental multi-tasking trains fundamental skills such as concentration, memory and critical thinking. In doing so, it illustrates how it is one of the rare subjects that teach students vital learning concepts that other subjects fail to address. In addition to this, it is a universal subject that is practiced by every culture around the world; there is not a single country or culture that does not have music implemented as a critical component of their culture. Teaching students music as a result gives them one more tool in which they can use to connect and relate with people of different backgrounds.
 
Music has always been an important subject in a student's educational development, starting from kindergarten, so eliminating it essentially takes away a vital component of a student's education. 

Nowhere have these budget cuts hit the hardest than in inner city schools across the nation. Along with facing the greatest risk of having their music programs dropped, they also have the least available resources. It's a shame though that music programs are been scrapped considering the proven benefits, education and otherwise, that has been associated with music and its potential to help alleviate some of the education deficiencies that has plagued inner city <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/education/26child.html?_r=1">students</a> for decades. For instance, data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 showed that students who participated in music programs received more academic honors and awards than non-music students, and that the percentage of music participants receiving As, As/Bs, and Bs were higher than non- participants.
 
With all the proven benefits that accompany music, it is quite astonishing as to why school districts are dropping it as a way to save money. It is worth noting that music was excluded as a core subject in the guidelines outlined in the No Child Left Behind Act. Non-for-profit organizations such as the aptly named <a href="http://www.vh1savethemusic.com/">Vh1's Save The Music Foundation</a> have taken notice of the educational benefits of music and as a result, have made it their mission to try and preserve it in those schools that are at risk of losing it.

As a practicing musician, I've witnessed the many educational values that music provides and I hope every child has the opportunity to experience those educational values. In order for it to occur though, school districts need to rethink and come up with other means of making up for the budget and leave music untouched.
