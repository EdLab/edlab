            Today's generation is often referred to as “the technology generation” simply because of the fast growth and the importance of technology in our culture. In other words, anything that we do these days involves technology one way or another. Come to think of it, I don't remember the last time I received a hand written letter from an acquaintance or turned in a hand written assignment to any of my professors. We depend so much on technology that we sometimes feel vulnerable when we do something that does not involve it. In today's world, we socialize and learn with technology devices. However, some people from previous generations feel that this generation has become very lazy due to the excess usage of technology.

In terms of learning, one thing that concerns people the most is the effectiveness of using technology as a tool to teach children. <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/03/teachers-students-digital-games-whats-the-right-mix/">Jenny Kavanaugh</a>, a fifth grade teacher from St-Louis, reflects on how her students are able to solve division problems in an online game but are not able to verbally tell what they are doing or “what is the division of fraction.” In this case, she wonders how games are enhancing students learning.

Additionally, Kavanaugh observed that her students are more proactive and aggressive with their learning when they are engaged in serious problem solving than an online game. This brings up the question: can children become effective learners if they learn through technology devices than the old fashion way, which involves more hands-on activities?
