<p> Digital games have become an omnipresent influence in adolescents’ lives, with a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2008/09/16/teens-video-games-and-civics/">2008 study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project</a> reporting that 97% of children ages 12-17 engage in web, portable, or console games. One of the places teenagers encounter digital games is in the classroom. While many studies focus on future possibilities for educational gaming, one team of researchers recently chose instead to test the effectiveness of games already in classroom use.</p>
 
<p>In this study, thirteen social studies teachers from ten urban, suburban, and rural schools integrated 55 digital games into their Jacksonian democracy curriculum. The researchers recruited 16 studios to create games with the primary purpose of supporting the learning of specific content. Each teacher in the study taught at least one class using the games and one class without digital games. In the game classrooms, teachers were required to spend at least 50% of class time during the three-week unit engaged with the games.</p>
 
<p>The post-unit tests reported slightly higher factual knowledge and evidentiary depth in students from the gaming classrooms, but these results were not significant. However, survey responses revealed significantly higher student engagement in classrooms using the games. Additionally, special education students in game classrooms reported higher confidence than those in non-game classrooms. Surveys revealed that teachers both wanted to continue using the games regularly and would recommend similar games to others, although they would prefer dedicating less time to games. Teachers with the most success in their use of games balanced task structure and student agency, and framed the games as educational and not recreational.</p>
 
<p>Despite the positive findings of this study, teachers reported several challenges of implementing games into their social studies curricula. Some students’ impatience to play the games resulted in decreased engagement in instruction. Additionally, some students gravitated only toward games that reinforced knowledge, avoiding those that promoted depth of learning. However, teachers found even the reinforcing games enhanced students’ confidence and supported further questions and connections to current events. The researchers concluded that while digital games show promise in the classroom, their effectiveness is closely linked to teachers’ intentional implementations of these learning tools.</p>
