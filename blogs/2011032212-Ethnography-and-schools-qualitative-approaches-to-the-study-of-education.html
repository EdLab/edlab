<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

The ethnographic experience is an indelible venture that continuously redefines one's life. Bringing together important cross-currents in the national debate on education, this book introduces the student or practitioner to the challenges, resources, and skills informing ethnographic research today. From the first chapter describing the cultural foundations of ethnographic research, by George Spindler, the book traces both traditional and new approaches to the study of schools and their communities.

<strong>About the Authors</strong>

<strong>Yali Zou</strong> is Professor of Educational Leadership and Cultural Studies at the University of Houston. She is also director of two initiatives: the Asian American Studies Center and the Asian International Programs. She received her Masters and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California Davis. Her research focuses on minority education, multicultural issues, immigration theory,  cross cultural and transnational issues, and ethnic identity formation.

Dr. Zou works with national and international organizations ranging from the Third World Conference Foundation, Houston Ballet Foundation's Board of Trustees,  National Minority Educational Association in China, Asia Society in the State of Texas, the College of Social Sciences of the Governors University in Chicago. She is also a guest professor for the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing, Tian Jun University, Changchun University and serves as an economic advisor for He Chi City of Guang Xi and Pulandian City of Liao Ning Province in China.

<strong>Enrique (Henry) T. Trueba</strong> was Regents                 Professor and Chair of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Texas-Austin,                 before moving to the University of Texas-Pan American where he                 held the position of special guest professor in the College of                 Education. His visiting appointments further included stays at the University                 of Alaska, Fairbanks; Stanford University; Michigan State University;                 New Mexico State University; La Universidad de Colima (Mexico);                 Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven (Belgium); National Taiwan                 Normal University (Taipei); Rice University; and Harvard University.
Dr. Trueba’s work addressed the experiences of ethnic                 minorities in education. His ethnographic                 research provided the foundations for a generation of researchers                 on bilingual education, for social policy on minority school                 retention, and for the basis of our thinking about cultural diversity                 in education. His special focus was on Latino/a immigrants and                 their families. Being an immigrant himself, Dr. Trueba was an                 ardent chronicler of the strength and resiliency of immigrant                 families and communities.
