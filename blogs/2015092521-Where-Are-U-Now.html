            <p><b>Perfect Plastic Pop: Bieber, Skrillex + Diplo’s Fabulous Fabrication</b></p>
<p>Where Are Ü Now <i>pushes the boundaries of digital media creation to create the summer’s biggest hit</i></p>

<p>Student multimodal media production has never been easier. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> provides music, images, and video licenses that promote youth multimedia creation. <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> is a freely distributed image manipulation program similar to Adobe Photoshop. <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> is a professional vector graphics program like Illustrator. <a href="http://audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> is open source software for recording and editing sound. This increasingly rich diversity of digital media combined with readily available software to mix and match these elements opens up boundless possibilities for youth expression. Lemke (1998) argues that combining multiple modes “shows us how we can mean more, mean new kinds of meaning never before meant and not otherwise mean-able, when this process occurs both within and across different semiotic modalities” (p. 93). This is especially important for students who may be limited in the nuance and extent of their normal expressive force. The endless combinability of these constantly shifting pieces of digital media act as welcome surrogates for youth meaning making; embodying malleable representations of their deepest thoughts and dearest hopes, best wishes and worst fears. The signs of these multimodal times have never been more expressive than those provided by the infinite permutations of the digital realm. </p>

<p>Why is multimodal digital media production particularly important at this time? A 2013 report stated that <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm"> 90% of the world’s data </a>had been generated in the previous two years. Given this paradigmatic shift, there will be exponentially more data, and digital media, shared online than ever before. Research centers at Facebook and Google have emerged due to the overwhelming volume of data they collect. Other tech companies will inevitably follow suit. Call it an<i> information race </i>if you will. From these developments, it is easy to deduce that a major reason for this media deluge is that more information than ever before is born digital. When data, information, and media is natively digital, it is correspondingly easier to aggregate, shape, deliver, and curate this content than ever before. As a result, everyone needs to think about the idea of multimodal manipulation, including students. Even professional mainstream artists. </p>

<p><i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nntGTK2Fhb0">Where Are Ü Now </a></i>is one of summer 2015’s biggest musical hits. The ubiquitous track is an unlikely collaboration between tween mega idol Justin Bieber, electronic dance music superstar Skrillex and producer/DJ Diplo. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting facets of this song is its digital provenance. Besides Bieber’s voice, this song is as digital as a piece of mainstream music has ever been. A pre-recorded vocal track, provided courtesy of Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun, is sampled and resampled, processed and reprocessed, over and over again, becoming not only the embodiment of the lyrics but also a separate musical sound on its own. For example, a dolphin-like flute sound at the beginning of the song was a pitch-shifted version of Bieber’s voice. This sound was pitched a couple of octaves higher than the originally-recorded track. Afterwards, it was processed through equalization, distortion effects, and reverb to manipulate the vocals in ways that are both highly innovative and completely characteristic of today’s digital music production. </p>

<p>We have reached a potential tipping point where we need to ask ourselves some fundamental questions about our art. How purely digital can our content be? And are there any divisions remaining between the person conceiving the content and the machine that brings it to life? For example, a program named <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won"> WordSmith </a>creates simple news stores using financial news and sporting events as source material. If offered in a free or discounted version, I am  sure that some students who do not like writing would be tempted. The process of writing is becoming digitally outsourced.

</p><p>Despite the deep digital imprints carved into the DNA of their production, the collaboration between Bieber, Skrillex, and Diplo also points to the amount of human agency involved. It is enormous. These musicians chose which Bieber track to sample, its pitch, equalization levels, type of distortion, and amount of reverb among many other critically important choices. When broken down, the number of decisions is astounding. Although songs can be edited down to literally fractions of a second, and soundwaves manipulated in seemingly endless permutations, the final decision makers are still human beings. And although their summer song <i>Where Are Ü Now</i> is an eminently catchy combination of pop and EDM, there will always be room for good old fashioned analog art. It has a warmth and humanity that is difficult to duplicate in 1s and 0s, bits and byte, knobs and dials. At the end of a scorching summer, some teens will always want to be serenaded by the strum of an acoustic guitar on a moonlit lake as the heat gives way to the cool chill of autumn. </p>
