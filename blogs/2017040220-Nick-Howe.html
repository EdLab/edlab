<p>Nick Howe is Chief Learning Officer at <a href="http://area9learning.com/">Area9 Learning</a>, a global leader in adaptive learning technology. He is also a strategic advisor at the Institute of Simulation and Training at the University of Central Florida and board advisor to multiple edtech startups. Howe previously served as Chief Learning Officer at Hitachi Data Systems where he built and led the corporate university and online communities serving over 50,000 employees, resellers, and customers. Howe is a business leader with a particular focus on the application of innovative education technologies.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Area9 Learning?</b><br>
<p>The career paths to be a leader in corporate education seem to be as varied as the companies in which we work. I started out as a chemical engineer, made my way into IT via computer-aided design, and then into IT outsourcing, professional services, consulting, and finally education. The common thread that seems to unite all of us in the learning space is a feeling of belonging. Learning just seems the right place to be. There is huge job satisfaction driven, I think, by the ability to make a difference in people's lives. I consider myself a change agent and what better way to influence change than to empower personal development at all levels of an organization.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Area9 Learning will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>As a Chief Learning Officer in a Fortune Global 50 company (Hitachi), I was frustrated by the lack of scientific basis for most of corporate education. The industry is plagued by a <i>herd mentality</i> and a desire to chase the latest buzzword, rather than focus on evidence-based approaches to personal development. At Area9, the work we do is based on 20 years of research into human factors, cognition, and computer science. It has wide applicability across the talent development spectrum. Although it isn't a panacea, this work heralds a new generation of learning technologies and approaches that can make a real difference to people and businesses.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>As chief evangelist at an adaptive learning company, I guess I'd have to say adaptive learning! More specifically, the personalization of learning. Sir Ken Burns and others have railed against the demoralizing impact of mass education when instead it should enable creativity and growth. Personalized learning is a new approach that treats everyone as individuals with unique needs, potential, capabilities, and that can adapt to those needs. It has the potential to be transformative, especially when powered by AI.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Area9 Learning, what are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I would characterize myself as a technophile and <i>early adopter</i>. Four years ago I bought a Tesla electric car and I am an absolute convert when it comes to hybrid cars. I am also a great believer in Elon Musk's vision to accelerate the transition to a renewable-electric economy. When I'm not championing adaptive learning, I am working on my second book about Musk and Tesla.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldClark">Donald Clark</a> is on a personal crusade to banish bad education practices and dispel education myths. He's funny, innovative, and informative. <a href="https://twitter.com/DougLynch">Doug Lynch</a> is not a frequent tweeter, but he is another crusader against the herd mentality prevalent in corporate education. Doug gave me a huge wake-up call while I was at Hitachi and forced me to re-evaluate my approach to many things. <a href="https://twitter.com/bmosh">Bob Mosher</a> also informed my thinking on corporate education. He's always challenging and has an interesting point of view.</p>
