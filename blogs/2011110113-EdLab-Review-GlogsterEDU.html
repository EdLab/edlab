          <p>
            Glogster and GlogsterEDU have been around for awhile, but I heard that they've recently made some changes to their tools that I thought were worthy of a fresh review. GlogsterEDU is a tool to create online multimedia "posters" that can incorporate all types of elements into a visual space: links, images, text, videos, music, and more. 

Here's one that I made in 25 minutes, with no prior knowledge of the tools. I like how the video plays right on the poster.

<iframe src="http://edu.glogster.com/glog.php?glog_id=24814851&scale=50" width="500" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" style="overflow: hidden;"></iframe>

There are social networking aspects of it too, where students can express themselves creatively online and interact with their peers as well as their teachers. 

<b>Pros:</b> I remember making a "glog" for the first time a couple years back, and there has been a lot of improvements since then. There was a much bigger graphics library and just the technical aspects of making the poster was a lot more user-friendly than before. Even a teacher/student who is just learning to use edtech tools would be able to figure this tool out easily. 

<b>Cons:</b> Not all school districts or homes have servers which can handle the load from Glogster; server crashes or a slow network could make students and teachers very frustrated. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> Multimedia tools have always been used by educators and are increasingly growing in popularity. Vialogues is our beat in that rhythm and I think there's a lot of room for growth there as well. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> As a future teacher, I'd definitely use this tool for lessons and lectures. I am a little anxious about how students (let's say, middle schoolers) could use or... abuse the social-networking aspect of this tool and how this can affect classroom management.
