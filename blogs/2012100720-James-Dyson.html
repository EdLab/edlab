<b> James Dyson, Founder/Inventor</b> 
<p>

<i>Sadly, engineering is often only seen as repairing, which is possibly why fewer young people choose it as a career. For James, engineering is about invention and technology. The James Dyson Foundation runs workshops across the globe where young people solve engineering challenges in a practical, hands-on way.</i> (<a href="http://www.dyson.com/">Dyson site</a>)

<p>

<b>Art, Science... and Vacuums</b>
<p>
Sir James Dyson is best known as the father of the high-design vacuum, but what you might not know is that his journey to founding one of the world’s leading consumer products companies was anything but business-as-usual. Dyson began this journey at a small college of art and design in London, Byam Shaw, before transferring to a larger research-focused school to
study furniture and interior design, and later marine engineering.  It was during this time as a student that he launched his first commercially successful product, <a href="http://rotork.imcl.ru/boat.php">The Rotork Sea Truck</a> (a lightweight fiberglass boat still in production). Not too long after the success of the Rotork, he launched his next product, a "ball-based" wheelbarrow that avoided the common problem of sinking in mud. Dyson’s early trajectory is evidenced in the development of his company, <a href="http://www.dyson.com/"> Dyson</a>, which seeks to create both beautifully designed products and revolutionary engineering solutions. Dyson strove to solve a simple question that many consumers asked everyday, "Why does my vacuum lose suction?" And it is this questioning of the status quo that drives the work of the <a href="http://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/">James Dyson Foundation </a> as it seeks to challenge young people to rethink and re-imagine the field of engineering.
<p>
<b>Shaking the Foundations of Engineering Education</b>
<p>
"Why?" and "How does this work?" were central questions in Dyson’s five-year journey to develop the world’s first "dual cyclone" vacuum and it is these questions that he asks of young learners through his foundation and eventually hopes to ask through a school focused on getting young people "into engineering." The James Dyson Foundation, which recently launched in  
the US, engages young people through free workshops, design challenges and boxes shipped free-of-charge to schools that contain open- ended engineering materials meant to encourage creative inquiry, project-based learning, and most importantly, to challenge the assumption that engineering and ultimately STEM-related subjects are "unimaginative." These connections between art and science are highlighted by the foundation’s work and embodied in Dyson’s own educational trajectory and corporate philosophy that engineering is the "middle ground" between these fields.  Dyson was wrong many times on his journey to becoming one of the most successful inventors and engineers of his time, and it is this celebration of failure, risk-taking and divergent thinking that could be most informative to future schools. Instead of an emphasis on finding the right answers, imagine if we emphasized finding the right questions. Perhaps like his early revolutionary product prototypes, Dyson just might create a blueprint for the school of the future through questioning the current education paradigm.
