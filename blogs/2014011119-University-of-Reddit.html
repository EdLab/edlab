<i>University of reddit is a community project that has grown organically over the past few years into a place for anyone looking to learn or teach. It was created by redditors for redditors. It now features a variety of classes spanning Art, Computer Science, Fun & Games, General Studies, Language, Mathematics & Statistics, Music, Philosophy, Science, and Social Sciences. Thousands of students have participated and many people have dedicated their free time to teaching something they are passionate about.</i> (Source <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2012/08/university-of-reddit-explore-any.html

<YOUniversity</b><br>
Described on the groupâ€™s <a href="https://twitter.com/uofreddit">Twitter page</a> as, "An experimental open-source, peer-to-peer teaching and learning platform," <a href="http://ureddit.com/">University of Reddit</a> is an interesting opportunity for informal learning.  With courses spanning a diverse range of subjects, from <a href="http://ureddit.com/archive/category/23441/art ">Art</a> to <a href="http://ureddit.com/archive/category/23442/computer-science">Computer Science</a> and even "<a href="http://ureddit.com/archive/category/23443/fun-and-games">Fun and Games</a>," a Reddit learning experience is a largely unstructured event for life-long fans of new knowledge.  Following a similar format as all Reddit content with a simple, text-based UI and the ability to "crowdvote" content and tutorials "up" and "down" (learn more about Reddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq">here</a>), the platform promises to allow registered users to enroll in courses easily and gain new knowledge in an "a la carte" fashion.  For example, potential instructors can submit "<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/jjxpx/interest_check_microsoft_excel_course/">interest checks</a>" to gauge interest within the community for a potential topic before creating a course.  This informal crowdsourcing, which Reddit has helped pioneer, is an innovative point of difference as opposed to other more top-down models of online learning, in which learner feedback is usually only taken into account at the end of a course experience and does not often directly guide the creation of a specific course.
<p>


<b>Intersection of Content and Community</b><br>  
Beyond crowdsourcing, UofReddit is a unique statement of the move away from centralized institutions or groups and into a realm of open, free learning opportunities for all.  UofReddit has entered a unique partnership with <a href="http://opencompass.org/">http://opencompass.org</a>, a non-profit focused on "exploring new, more effective paradigms in contemporary education," to develop a platform that would lead to a hybridization of content delivery-driven online learning and crowdsourced, community-led engagement.  It is this model of community-driven content delivery and potential evolution of U of Reddit that might in fact become one of the most transformational to the learning landscape.
