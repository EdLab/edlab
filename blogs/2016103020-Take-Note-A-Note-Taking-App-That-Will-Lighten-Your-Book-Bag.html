<p>Electronic books are cheaper, lighter weight, and more environmentally friendly than traditional textbooks, yet many students still prefer paper. Why? In part it’s because marking up an ebook is awkward, and alternating between an ereader and a physical notebook is cumbersome. <a href="https://www.flexcil.com">Flexcil</a>, a free app for iPad, seeks to resolve this problem by making it easier to annotate and create digital notes using a set of intuitive gestures.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> What makes Flexcil different than other reading apps is a set of stylus gestures. Using a generic stylus pen, readers can quickly underline and highlight blocks of text within the document without creating unintentional marks. Perhaps most uniquely, Flexcil makes it easy to drag and drop selections of text, and even images, straight out of a book or document and into an in-app notepad where they can be resized and rearranged. Meanwhile, the app’s multi-touch navigation prevents users from scrolling or turning the page by accident. It took me a few minutes to get the hang of things, but once I did, I found Flexcil’s user interactions to be extremely intuitive. Overall, I love being able to take comprehensive virtual notes while reading on mobile!</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite all the things Flexcil gets right, there are still some kinks that need to be worked out before I’ll become a convert. Right now, Flexcil only works with PDF files, yet most textbook publishers don’t offer their products in PDF format. This puts the onus on users to convert their own files, which is a bit of a pain. The app’s notebook feature is also in need of some revision. Most glaringly, copied selections of images or texts cannot be moved on the notepad once they have been initially set in place. This means that if you mistakenly cover up one image with another and then tap away, there’s no way (at least that I could find) to correct the mistake. It also means that you can’t reorganize your notes after you’ve created them except by retyping them manually. What’s more, there doesn’t appear to be any way to export the notes when you’re finished, which is not ideal. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> I really love the feel of Flexcil, and most of the user interface and interactions are smooth and seamless.  Still, if this company wants to revolutionize the way people use textbooks, they will need to accommodate more file formats and make it easier to edit, rearrange, and export notes. </p>
