          <p>
            I was watching CNN this evening and saw this very unusual commercial for the website <a href="http://www.ashleymadison.com/">ashleymadison.com</a>.  Intrigued by this unusual commercial, I discovered that it was a website for people to have affairs: "Life is Short.  Have An Affair."  So much for the sanctity of marriage.  I wonder what the correlation is between a bad economy (CNN was talking about the "Misery Index") and increased extra-marital affairs?  It would make perfect sense if there was one: like an alcoholic binge, you get a quick burst of short-term pleasure followed by a really bad hangover.  Interesting thing to study, but I suspect IRB might have a problem with it...

Every ICT has its secret sauce: Facebook has the News feed; MySpace has the music, and I would suspect, if done right, Ashley Madison would have to figure out a way for one's spouse, friends, or family to never be able to find out one was on there.  It seems like from a technical standpoint, this could be pretty difficult, if impossible (how do you keep people from tattling on each other?).  If we were only French, we could have our affairs out in the open and do away with all this online nonsense.  All kidding aside, if done right, they could do really well by being really bad.
