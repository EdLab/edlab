If you’re working on a project, study, or prototype, among other things, at some point you may need user feedback.  Disciplines tend to have their own standards when it comes to how a study is conducted, so that is something to be mindful of.  If you would like to incorporate user input or use it to inform decisions for your project this is a guide to conduct user research with resources from the Gottesman Libraries.

<i>Research question</i>:
<blockquote>How can I go about including user input in my project or research?</blockquote>
