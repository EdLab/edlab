            As Steve and Hui Soo know, I take a lot of pride in my geographic knowledge (just quiz me on any geography trivia)...maybe even a tad boastful. So I was quite curious to see what the latest report from the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/main2010/2011467.pdf">NAEP said</a> about the state of geography education. Turns out we are doing a better job of educating our young'uns (grade 4), as there have been statistically significant gains from 1994 test scores. Moreover, low-performing students of grades 4, 8, and 12 all showed improvements from 1994 scores. On the other hand, there was virtually no change on aggregate for eighth grade students and significantly lower (statistically speaking) for twelfth grade students from 1994 to 2010. Given the large intervals between each set of test scores (1994, 2001, 2010), it's hard to say many good things about the results of this report. We might be doing a better job of educating our fourth graders in geography, but that is not leading to future gains for students by the time they reach senior year of high school.

As a huge geography geek, I have to wonder what social studies educators and educational psychologists have to say about what makes for an enriching geography education. When I prepared for the National Geographic Bee in my middle school years, I used rote memorization as my primary tool, as did most participants who found success. And yet, the actual questions asked tested my reasoning skills and my ability make connections from the facts memorized. Moreover, this rote memorization paid huge dividends in my history and government courses in high school and gave me great context for understanding rather political issues and obscure current events. It seems to me that if you want a rich, diverse curriculum and rounded, informed students, some drill-and-kill (which testing can easily capture) is necessary because you can't exactly derive all of the world capitals from first principles.
