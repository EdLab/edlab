<p><a href=" https://www.zondle.com/">Zondle</a> is a game-based education platform designed to enhance learning for students of all ages. Teachers can create games based on their lessons, share games with other teachers, and view student progress all on the same interface. Zondle makes learning fun by engaging students in interactive games that promote information retention and automaticity. The platform is grounded in neuroscience and education research from some of the top universities in the UK and allows teachers to create, modify, and deliver relevant questions to their students on a gaming platform. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Zondle offers teachers a plethora of options to facilitate learning in the classroom and at home. Educators can create modules for each of their classrooms, award "badges" to students based on performance, create teaching games that can be used to track students’ information retention and understanding, and even record grades in Zondle’s detailed gradebook. Zondle also allows students to view other classrooms’ progress on a "zollars leaderboard," intended to encourage friendly competition among classmates. If teachers do not want to spend time creating their own questions and quizzes, a variety of pre-made subjects are available for purchase within the platform. Additionally, educators can connect with colleagues in an online forum specifically created for their school.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Zondle’s website needs a serious makeover. Buttons, links, colors, shapes, pictures, and more litter the educator dashboard, making it extremely difficult to locate, or even focus, on any one element. Visually, the dashboard is overwhelming. It appears this design is a new implementation, as educators have the option of toggling back to an older and more comprehensive layout. Zondle almost offers its users too many features, attempting to cram every possible educator need or tool into its interface. Returning to the previous layout and consolidating or removing some features could add to the platform's usability.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Zondle is a great classroom and homework tool for educators with some major design and usability flaws. Ultimately, the platform has everything an educator could want in a teaching aid – grade books, classroom analysis features, badges for individual students, game-based lesson reviews, collaborative teacher forums, competition-inducing classroom displays, tutorials and FAQs, and pre-fabricated quizzes. With a little organization and a complete design makeover, this resource has the potential to be valuable to educators.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b> Zondle is bursting with tools for every educator.</b></p>
