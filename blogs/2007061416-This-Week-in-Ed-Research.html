          <p>
            Following the (second or third) call for Channel ideas I'd like to suggest a piece which captures the last week (or month) of educational research.  

I've noticed that every magazine and newspaper I've ever read does an occasional piece on interesting research results.  They also often report results a few months prior to the publishing of the academic article.  It seems this has two advantages: 
<ol>
<li>It eliminates the need to obtain journal subscriptions for non-technical readers;</li>
<li>It provides a short summary which is often more engaging than the academic article</li>
</ol>
Following this model for the channel, I would like to see a piece which follows the interesting research of the <i>x</i> time period.  An engaging host would be critical; and the show could be spiced up further.  I envision a charismatic human host presenting the research (at newspaper level depth).  The host would have our two favorite puppets on either side, whose reactions would be entertaining and serve as the impetus for further clarification.  For instance, given a research result, one puppet could over-react in disagreement, leading our host to discuss the history of the problem and the subtleties of the findings.

Also, have you noticed that we are all remarkably comfortable calling the project "The Channel" or "Channel?"  It's certainly not a specific name, but it's direct and catchy.  I might consider naming the project that.
