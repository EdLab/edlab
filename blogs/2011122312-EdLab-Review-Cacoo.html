<b>Description:</b> <a href="https://cacoo.com/">Cacoo</a> is an online service for creating, publishing, and sharing diagrams. The diagrams that you can create could be anything from a workflow chart to maps. There is also a sharing feature as well where you can email your diagrams to family, friends and colleagues, and you can also have other people edit your diagrams. While the basic features of the website is free, there are two payment plans a user can choose such as unlimited sharing, unlimited editing contributors, more users to one account, and more ways to export a diagram, among others.

<b>Pros:</b> It's easy to create diagrams and you also have plenty of options. I just created a map of the desk arrangement on the Ground Floor (my second home) which you can see below. This sharing and contributing features are excellent additions and I can definitely see those features being utilized in classrooms. This is especially true for STEM subjects! Another great thing is that teachers and students can use Cacoo for free until June 30, 2012, as part of their Academic Plan.

<b>Cons:</b> The only thing that concerned me was the lack of help on some of the tools. This would be especially helpful for new users who have never created any sort of diagram before.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This is one of the many websites that are adding the social element to tasks like creating a diagram online. This social element would help students collaborate more and thus learn more about a certain project. When people work together on a project, there is a higher probability that they will learn more and create a greater product than when people work alone.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> It's interesting to see the pricing model for this site and should be a model for our own EdLab products.
