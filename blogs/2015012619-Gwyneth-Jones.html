<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
Though I’ve been doing it for more than 20 years, being a teacher librarian is my third career since college. I started my career in public relations, advertising, marketing, and special events. It gave me a unique perspective on how to promote and market the values I have for research, transliteracy, librarianship, and being a change agent in education in a school setting. I’ve really tried to leverage the effective communication skills gained through my corporate experiences in the business world, to communicate my love of research and information gathering, reading, and technology with my students, parents, and the community.
<p>
When I made the career switch, I went to graduate school full time to become a library media specialist or teacher librarian, or whatever you want to call us.  The name of school library and what we provide to the community has changed a great deal over the past 20 years. School libraries are becoming more of a learning hub, or a learning commons within the schools. 
<p>
The learning commons I have helped to create with my students and community in my MHMS Daring School Library is not only the physical center of the school but, philosophically, its heart. We abound with books, digital audio, and media materials...places to comfortably read or study, tables that are easily moved and reconfigured for project-based learning as well as an adjacent TV studio for multimedia re-mix, mash-up, and video production. We are part classroom, gaming arcade, VIP lounge, art gallery, performance stage, makerspace, and a rowdy learning space where shushing rarely happens and kids are our number one customers. We crowdsource constantly to make sure their needs and wants are being served. We embrace mobile and social media and our facility has a web presence that makes our services available to students 24/7/365.  We are ever evolving and always open to change.   
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I hope to inspire librarians and school based educators everywhere to be a daring defender of kiddos, books, libraries, and lifelong learning; to take it as a calling rather than a job. If they have gotten into a rut or become a library zombie, I want them to wake up and start giving their very best to the community - because our kiddos only deserve the best!  School librarians really need to be enthusiastic champions of curation, transliteracy, and creative commons. We need to be shameless sharers with our personal learning network and create a personal learning network. I want to be the kind of educator that shows that you can't be a great educator in isolation. You really need to build a network of educators globally to help you in your district and in your school because together we are stronger. We become a tribe of learners together. We started a geek tribe of teacher librarians a few years back because sometimes teacher librarians feel so isolated. We are usually the only ones in our schools, and it can feel very isolated sometimes. When the network goes down, a teacher cleans an LCD filter in the water fountain,  a teacher needs help to set up a blog, vlog, or vine; or you need help with your SLO’s - you’re all alone.  
<p>
I really want to be a proponent of global connectivity for librarians and educators using vehicles such as Twitter, blogging, and Vine. I also use <a href="http://bit.ly/1E8ycwD">Scoop.it</a>, which is a super-charged triple-duty social media tool that bookmarks and curates what I am sharing while simultaneously shares with Twitter, Facebook (which I don’t personally use) LinkedIn and publishes a glossy digital magazine. This is a great way to manage my social media outlet.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
It goes back to curation, which is part of blogging because Scoop.it is a microblog and Twitter is also a microblog if you look at it that way. I think the fact that we are changing the way we organize, save and share information that we are finding with our personal learning networks is going to be huge. With my blog, I take time to write longer opinion pieces. I try to do it three to four times a month. I enjoy the longer blog format, which expands on my Tweets. I have a wonderful following and an amazing community of learners on Twitter but Twitter is only 140 characters. The blog provides an opportunity to express opinions, graphics, and share cool information with my readers, which is really important to me. It is also important to stay timely and be the kind of person who shares both your successes and failures. When I fail at something, I want to be able to share that so other people can hopefully learn from my mistakes. I will always make new ones! 
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
I've been working a lot with Vine with my students. We have been creating <a href="http://bit.ly/1DUiKSN">Vine video book trailers.</a> Vine is a really popular app and there are "viners" out there who are huge. People have become celebrities and have a Vine following of millions so it is an instant engagement with my students. It is a way of distilling what they've learned in six seconds and that becomes the product. I am trying to show my teachers how you can use things like Vine to create a product that demonstrates information mastery. So instead of having the boring book report, we provide students the option to create something like book trailers, which we did last Spring. The cool thing about Vine, is that if you tap it, you can also easily create a stop action video. The students are so wonderfully creative coming up with neat ideas to convey interest in a book in six seconds using that app. Since they are middle school students, I didn't let them post their own Vines. I had them use my devices, both my personal cell phone and iPads to create their vine videos. I posted the videos on our <a href="http://bit.ly/10P0WfE">Daring School Library Media Edublog</a>, our MHMS <a href="http://bit.ly/10P112Q">Learning Wikispaces page</a> (along with lesson, rubric, and storyboard), and on my personal professional blog - The Daring Librarian. Each website has a different purpose; my personal professional blog is geared towards helping teachers and other librarians with lesson ideas and tech help, our Learning Wikispaces provides education resources for kids, and our Daring School Library Edublog is a celebration of what our students create. It also focuses on things that will help them and their parents with Internet awareness and creating a positive digital footprint.
