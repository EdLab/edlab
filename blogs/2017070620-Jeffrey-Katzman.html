<p>Jeffrey Katzman is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.corelearningexchange.com/">Core Learning Exchange</a>, a business that matches crowd-sourced learning and teaching materials with teachers to implement Common Core, 1:1 technology initiatives, flipped classrooms, personalized learning, and blended learning programs. He previously founded Xyleme, a Learning Content Management System that allows organizations to create and deliver personalized learning content.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work as CEO of Core Learning Exchange?</b><br>
<p>I began my career in the early nineties when I was a graduate student in Broadcast Communication Arts at San Francisco State. I saw an opportunity to re-imagine the market leading textbook on film and video production as an interactive multimedia product. I took it to my advisor, Herb Zettl, who asked me to create a one-page treatment which he took to his publisher. At that moment, my career took a turn from TV and Film to interactive media. Those early years were very exciting. I and 4 other partners started up our company Cooperative Media (later renamed CourseNet) and got a loft space above a sewing factory in the Mission District in SF where we pioneered a new art form and won a lot of awards for our Higher Ed CD-ROM products.</p>
 
<p>In those early years, I cut my teeth on digital media production, coding, XML, and instructional design; I  was steeped in object-oriented programming, the emerging internet, and distributed computing. All of these ideas were floating around in my head and in a moment it was like the secret to the illusion was revealed to me. I eventually came up with a fully formed concept for a reusable learning object single source publishing system. We invented the first Learning Content Management System (LCMS). The big innovation was that we enabled people to create Learning Objects that could be reused and remixed to create different publications that shared common content. Also, the content was XML which separated the content from the presentation so that the same source content could be run through a different publishing process to generate HTML, PDF, ePub, SCORM, AICC, QTI. This decision allowed us to adapt as new formats emerged.</p>
 
<p>We developed an early version of this LCMS and sold the company. A couple of years later, I founded Xyleme with the same basic idea. However, the technology infrastructure had matured and the tools to accomplish our vision were a lot better in the early 2000s than a decade before. Xyleme grew from a couple of employees to over a hundred and we were selling large deals to Fortune 100 companies.</p>
 
<p>The idea for Core Learning Exchange also came to me in a flash. It integrated all of my ideas about learning technology with economic concepts I studied as an undergrad. The company enables mastery-based personalized learning. To really achieve personalized learning, there has to be a large quantity of different content using a variety of instructional modalities. This allows you to truly be able to personalize learning experiences to the needs and preferences of each student. I asked myself where will all this content come from and how do we build a sustainable model to make sure that the content is always refreshing and updating. That is how I came up with the idea of a revenue sharing marketplace: the <i>Spotify of Digital Curriculum</i>. We charge a flat rate subscription and offer royalties to content providers with bonuses for lessons that serve learners outside of the mainstream.</p>
 
<p>The jump from corporate to public education has been a huge lesson in patience! While corporations do take the time to evaluate investments, the Kâ€“12 education space moves even more slowly. Even as my kids live on their phones and computers, all through elementary and middle school they were still coming home with paper worksheets, overloaded backpacks, and seriously outdated learning materials. </p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Core Learning Exchange will change the way schools approach how they buy educational content?</b><br>

<p>Core Learning Exchange believes that each and every student deserves the right learning materials at the right time to meet his or her individual needs. To achieve this goal, we provide teachers with revolutionary capacity to individualize instruction easily.</p>
 
<p>Our ambitious mastery-based platform seamlessly integrates cutting edge technology and concepts. This includes a multi-publisher digital curriculum and assessment marketplace, pre-built mix-and-match playlists, high-end authoring capability for teacher-driven curriculum development, micro-credentialing, and badging. These features are driven by a comprehensive set of personalization tools, enabling teachers to optimize instructional delivery to the needs of each student distinctly.</p>
 
<p>We believe that the combined flat subscription fee and marketplace approach, with initial curation based on standards compliance and quality followed by teacher reviews of learning objects, will spark creativity in both learning and lesson creation. Our royalty-based model means schools only pay for what they use and what they use is based on quantifiable measures.</p>
 
<p>We support the many schools that have invested in curriculum development by offering them a cloud-based, device-independent, global platform for sharing their work and receiving royalties for it. We call this the virtuous cycle. Think of this scenario: a rural community is rarely served by the large publishers. Now, a farming community, for example, can benefit from work that may have been done by a district of similar demographics, but very different geography. Or think of an urban school with students who live in a very different reality from kids a couple of towns, and a world apart. And all for a fixed per-student price that does not favor the richer districts. This applies to special needs students as well.  We envision a marketplace model that offers a cost-effective, diverse, and valuable curriculum for many students outside the mainstream.</p>	
 
<p>Procurement, however, is the essential challenge for my business. From my perspective, the entire ecosystem of school procurement, LMS, and curriculum providers is perpetuating a broken model. Our advisor Steven Hodas wrote compellingly about this in his paper, <a href="http://www.crpe.org/publications/changing-methods-and-mindsets-lessons-innovate-nyc">Changing Methods and Mindsets: Lessons from Innovate NYC</a>. He outlines challenges facing innovators who attempt to break into a procurement ecosystem that favors the deeply entrenched players who influence requirements development. We see requests for proposals (RFPs) that are asking technology questions appropriate to the previous century and requirement checklists that are biased toward an <i>all students in lockstep</i>, factory-based model of education. Our radical approach does not fit that structure, nor do we want to. However, until procurement processes catch up with innovative thinking, little will change for students, the citizens they will become, and the economy that they will live and work in.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>

<ul>
<li>21st-century skills</li>
<li>Lifelong learning and micro-credential badging</li>
<li>The rise of mastery-based learning as the antidote to the failed factory model</li>
<li>The sharing economy will disrupt the educational market and re-align the ecosystem</li>
</ul>
