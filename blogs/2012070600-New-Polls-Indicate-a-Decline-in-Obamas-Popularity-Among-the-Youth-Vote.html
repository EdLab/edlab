            With the 2012 Presidential elections fast approaching, newly released polls indicate that incumbent President Barack Obama's popularity with the youth population is quickly waning.  This is significant considering that the youth vote, 18-24 age group, was instrumental in electing him into office during the 2008 election. Researchers cite the current state of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/us/politics/economy-cuts-into-obamas-youth-support.html">economy</a> as the primary factor that is spurring his decline among this particular demographic.  

The national unemployment rate is at its highest in decades and the youth have especially been affected. Employers are reluctant to hire recent graduates considering their lack of job experience and thus prefer hiring older more experienced individuals. As a result, these newly graduates are left with no option but to work at low end minimum wage jobs which don't require a college degree.  Income earned from these jobs is often not enough to support a self sufficient, independent lifestyle thus causing many to move in back home with their parents.  The situation is far direr for those with student loans as their debt continues to accumulate due to ever rising interest rates. Faced with these underling issues, the youth feel the President is not doing enough to address their needs. Therefore, a significant number are switching their allegiance by opting to vote for the more conservative candidate, Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Others are simply choosing not to vote citing that their vote doesn't matter.

Although Obama still currently enjoys a respectable lead over Romney among the youth population, it will be interesting to see whether this holds true in the upcoming months as the election draws near.  As a soon to be qualified voter, I will be taking these issues in account as I cast my vast and I'm sure so will the millions of youth voters.
