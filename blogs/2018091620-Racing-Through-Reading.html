<p>In a world of information-overload, <a href="http://www.story-chaser.com/">Story Chaser</a> intends to offer teenagers and adults a fun, interactive way to improve their reading speed and comprehension. The designers propose their app as a way to enhance our ability to sift through the multiple sources of information that bombard us every day. They cite <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-013-0605-z?__hstc=48988217.d480b0896ec071bae4c3d40c40ec7d57.1410048000113.1410048000114.1410048000115.1&__hssc=48988217.1.1410048000116&__hsfp=1314462730">neuroscience research</a> suggesting that the human brain can process information incredibly quickly, and that practice can enhance our ability to synthesize meaning. The app also seeks to promote appreciation for classic literature, incorporating adaptations of works such as Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo and Hans Christian Andersen’s "The Ugly Duckling." </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Story Chaser is serious about promoting efficiency, and presents a challenge to even the most advanced readers. Moving to higher levels requires not only identifying target words, but also tapping illustrated animations and answering comprehension questions, all before time runs out. As a graduate student, I spend hours reading every day, and it took me ten tries to pass level five of eighteen. Story Chaser pushes the user to the limit of her reading efficiency; playing the game felt like an intense cardio workout for the brain. It was hard work, but maybe the effort will pay off and I’ll achieve a new personal record for processing speed.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>A few small hiccups hindered my play, such as the app registering a misstap when I tried to hit the correct word, causing me to lose points and precious time, but more troublesome experiences also occurred. As the user reads a classic story such as The Count of Monte Cristo, words pop up that she must search for and click. She is simultaneously scanning illustrations to tap any animations that appear. Then, when the level ends, the user answers multiple choice comprehension questions. When I played the game, I didn’t know the answer to a single question and found myself guessing primarily based on the illustrations. According to Story Chaser, I am a fantastic reader of The Count of Monte Cristo, yet I cannot honestly say I read the piece at all. I just looked at pictures and tapped words. While this may have been enough to glean cursory information, it seems an injustice to the masterpiece to claim literary interaction with the book.</p>

<p>For an app that claims to help children and adults achieve literacy, Story Chaser risks teaching that what matters most in reading is rapid information synthesis. Understanding, analysis, and reflection make no appearance in this abridged account of classic literature. While there is certainly a time and place for efficient reading, I doubt a high school teacher would present processing a soliloquy from Hamlet in under 30 seconds as a learning target. For those who want to improve their literacy, I recommend reading stories, not chasing them.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Story Chaser offers a challenging way to push processing speed to the limit. However, my experience with the app made me question whether efficiency should be the only goal in reading.</p>
