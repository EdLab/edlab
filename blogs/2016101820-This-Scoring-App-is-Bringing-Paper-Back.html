<p>Companies like Apple and Google are racing to make their products the first choice for educators, and some developers are riding the wave by creating app add-ons to make implementation simpler. The developers of <a href="http://www.paperscorer.com">Paperscorer</a> have created a platform designed to make grading Google Classroom forms easier. The only problem is that this add-on seems to make the process a bit more tedious than it originally was. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>Paperscorer has a relatively simple interface, making it easy to interpret. With a few simple clicks you can add it to any Google form  and generate a customized optical mark recognition form (OMR, commonly known as a Scantron) for a specific student. When the form is generated you must print it out, and it will have the unique identifier for each student. Once the students fill out the OMR, you snap a photo of the document and it uploads onto the Paperscorer system, capturing the score of the class and a more detailed report of each individual. There is no need for a red pen, and results can easily be shared with students.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>Despite what seems like a simple process, it actually takes longer than you might expect and can be tedious for a few reasons. First, if students would simply respond to questions online without printing the OMR, Google automatically gives you similar results without the hassle of paper scoring. Second, the process of printing and taking photos requires teachers to go from desktop to printer to iPhone or iPad and then back to desktop. They also must align papers properly, and take photos (with a newer camera) one-by-one; this is a much more involved process than simply throwing the papers into the OMR machine. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p> Though Paperscorer does a decent job in its attempt to allow educators to transfer parts of Google Classroom out of the digital realm, overall I found it more difficult than helpful. While working from desktop to printer to iPad, I could not help but think of how busy a teacherâ€™s schedule normally is, and the need for any technology entering the education market to make things easier and faster, not slower and more tedious.</p>
