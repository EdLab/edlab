            The current revolution in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html?scp=14&sq=Egypt&st=cse">Egypt</a> has touched of a series of discussions in classrooms all across nation. This can be attributed to the fact that we've just witnessed a rare instance of history taking place right before our eyes. As President Obama himself stated, “we are witnessing the Berlin Wall moment for Egypt and possibly the entire Middle East.”

In general though, I feel that current events are seldom discussed in American classrooms. In the years that I've attended school in the US, there has never been a day where a teacher committed an entire class period to discuss major world events. The Egyptian crisis for example, was barely discussed in any of my classes with the longest discussion lasting merely a quarter of the class period. In addition, when the Haiti earthquake struck earlier last year, there were only brief references to it in my classes.  I think one of the primary reasons current events doesn't make it to the classroom is that some teachers have a hard time incorporating it into their lesson plans; there is little room for them to fit current events into the classroom. However, I still feel it is vital that teachers, regardless of subject, incorporate current events into lesson plans since it engages students to understand, interpret, analyze, and connect with events occurring domestically and globally. This broadens students' understanding of key domestic and global issues and as a result enables them to better grasp issues that will undoubtedly affect them in the future. 

Such understanding could be particularly useful to American students. According to <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2010/10/13/07levine_ep.h30.html">studies</a> conducted by the National Geographic Society and Asia Society, young Americans are next to last in their knowledge of geography and current affairs compared to peers in eight other countries. Prolonged discussions in classrooms about current events though can help improve that statistic and broaden a student's global outlook. Global events occur all the time and with civil unrest gaining momentum in several Middle Eastern countries, there are plenty of opportunities for educators to start incorporating more current events in the classroom.
