          <p>
            Last night, I decided to watch <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7359538n&tag=related;photovideo">60 Minutes</a> immediately following NCAA's Selection Sunday program since one of its featured stories was on the interesting charter school, <a href="http://www.tepcharter.org/">The Equity Project (TEP)</a>, which is famous for paying its teachers up to $125,000 annually. TEP, located in Washington Heights in New York City, is publicly funded but privately ran. The school opened nearly 18 months ago and currently boasts 247 fifth and sixth graders and 15 teachers with classes expected to run through the eighth grade. 

TEP founder and principal Zeke Vanderhoek believes the huge amount paid to its teachers (which is nearly twice the national average) shouldn't come as a surprise. “Because they're worth it, because teachers are the key, and if we can pay them this with the existing dollars, why aren't we doing it,” he explained to Katie Couric. Vanderhoek is the one solely responsible for hiring teachers, deciding how much they should earn and eventually determining their fate at the end of the school year. Teachers hired at TEP are not entitled to tenure and their contracts can be cancelled at anytime during the school year.  

TEP offers no precise guidelines for evaluating teachers, a point most school officials across the country often highlight in the debate surrounding teacher evaluations. At least two of the 15 teachers are relieved of their duties every year. Though TEP has seen mixed results thus far in its attempt to change the conversation about closing the achievement gap between affluent public schools and their counterparts in the inner cities.
