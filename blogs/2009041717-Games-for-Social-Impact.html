          <p>
            <a href="http://www.joey-lee.net/">Joey Lee</a> gave a good presentation here at Teachers College a few weeks ago and discussed his dissertation, which is a design-based research study of a video game he developed to teach students about the misconceptions facing Asian Americans.  He described the problem of having stereotypes forced onto Asian American students as being detrimental to their healthy development, leading to stress, anxiety, and depression.  In the design of the game, he came up with some interesting strategies to teach kids about these issues.

Reading <a href="http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/who-are-you-calling-gay/?em">Judith Warner's blog post over at the <em>Times</em></a>, I wonder if a similar strategy could be used to deal with the masculinity problem in schools.  She describes how concepts of masculinity have shifted little over time and in today's school "to be something other than the narrowest, stupidest sort of guy's guy, is to be unworthy of even being alive."  I totally hear her loud and clear: the "gay" label is often attributed in cases where it has nothing to do with homosexuality.  I can remember in seventh grade making it a point to count how many times I was called gay (I stopped counting at 50).  At this time, this had really nothing to do with homosexuality but rather with the fact of being a goody-goody who made it a point to dress well (a few years later it had a lot more to do with it, but by then no one cared so much). <p> 

I do wonder if a game could be developed that could teach kids to expand their notions of masculinity.  Joey had mentioned that he thought that a similar strategy could be used with women (e.g., women in science), but didn't make an explicit point regarding masculinity.  Although Asian men don't often get the "gay" label (for some reason, people will tolerate Asians to be a bit more effeminate), it seems like the problems that Joey describes are fairly similar to the masculinity problems that Warner describes.  I might nudge him to take things in this direction....
