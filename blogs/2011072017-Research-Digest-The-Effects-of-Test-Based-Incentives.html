A little while ago Skanda and I debated the uses (and abuses) of testing in we talked about the use of high-stakes testing.  One point <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5859">I made</a> (that I thought was rather good) was that we should be paying more attention to the second-order effects of relying more heavily on test performance in our school system.  In the hopes of taking my own medicine I found on the internet “Incentives and Test-Based Accountability in Education,” which contains a chapter entitled <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12521&page=41">“Evidence on the Use of Test-Based Incentives.”</a>  This is a literature review on the effects of implementing test-based incentives in primary and secondary education.
<!--break-->
Description:
The authors look at a variety of studies involving the implementation of incentives tied to student performance on tests.  This could involve rewarding (or punishing) students, parents, teachers, or schools based on this performance, or simply requiring an exit-exam for graduation.  As part of the evaluation of these changes, they focus on low-stakes tests not directly tied to the incentives under review to figure out whether improvements signify wider knowledge gains or are simply the result of teaching to the test (not to mention other, more creative solutions like excluding low-performing students from the test, handing out high calorie meals on the day of the test, or even blatant in-test coaching).  The data from other countries are not particularly helpful, given how vastly different, for example, India's educational system is to ours, but the do look at a variety of studies within America (some focusing on the effects of No Child Left Behind) in coming to their conclusions.

They conclude: “Test-based incentive programs…have not increased student achievement enough to bring the United States close to the levels of the highest achieving countries… The overall effects on achievement tend to be small and are effectively zero for a number of programs.  Even when evaluated using the tests attached to the incentives, a number of programs show only small effects. School-level incentives like those of NCLB produce some of the larger estimates of achievement effects, with effect sizes around 0.08 standard deviations, but the measured effects to date tend to be concentrated in elementary grade mathematics and the effects are small compared to the improvements the nation hopes to achieve.”

On the other hand, in a finding that is both good and bad, graduate rates appear to be much more malleable.  Bad in that they discovered that high school exit exam programs seem to “decrease the rate of high school graduation without increasing achievement,” but good in that “several experiments with providing incentives for graduation in the form of rewards, while keeping graduation standards constant, suggest that such incentives might be used to increase high school completion.”

Edlab Relevance:
This literature review reduces my confidence in the effectiveness of either a. offering stronger incentives for better student performance, or b. relying on more rigorous testing evaluations to increase student performance.  I am growing more and more convinced that traditional policy measures aren't going to be much help in improving our educational system, and furthermore, that the priority should rather go to making it more efficient (same student achievement for less money).  This is, of course, where online-based learning comes in.
