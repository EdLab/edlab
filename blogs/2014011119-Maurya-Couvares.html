<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maurya-couvares/4/1b0/85a">Maurya Couvares</a> is the Co-founder and Executive Director of education nonprofit  <a href="http://www.scripted.org">ScriptEd</a>.  ScriptEd provides computer programming training to young people in low-income communities.  As the US and global job market moves more towards 21st century skills like programming and highly technically specific training, ScriptEd is uniquely poised to help increase access to careers in technology by providing mentorships and placing students in paid summer internships with established technology firms.  Couvares draws on her experience with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton's global pro bono legal practice group, whose volunteers contribute over 90,000 hours of pro bono and public service time annually. Before arriving at Cleary Gottlieb, Couvares was a Teach for America corps member and taught United States history at the middle school level in West Philadelphia.  Couvares is also an <a href="http://ignite-good.org/">IgniteGood / Huffington Post Millennial Impact Challenge Award</a> winner, an <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/partners/amex">Ashoka and American Express Emerging Innovator</a>, and was a featured speaker at <a href="http://tedxnyed.com/2013/#.UjjHZGSidZ8">TEDxNYED</a>.  Couvares holds a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from Boston College, spent a year as a visiting student at Oxford University (Mansfield College), and completed coursework in Urban Education at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> My experiences at Boston College had a large impact on my current work.  As a Jesuit institution, BC’s faculty and students hold a strong belief in the idea of ‘men and women for others.’  At BC, I learned that my educational experiences were a means to help me serve other people and transform the world around me.  
<p>
I also was fortunate to spend a lot of time studying inequality in the United States while I was at BC.  This experience in the classroom encouraged me to join Teach for America after graduation.  Since then, I’ve worked tirelessly towards helping students from low-income communities achieve successful futures.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> After my time teaching in Philadelphia, I moved to New York City to work for Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, a large international law firm.  I served as Cleary Gottlieb’s liaison with Washington Irving High School for four years and worked with volunteers from the Firm to bring students SAT tutoring classes, a mentoring program, a mock trial and Model United Nations team, and other extracurricular activities. This experience helped me learn the ins and outs of volunteer management, especially in the context of working with low-income students.  After four years of managing the program, I became the Firm’s pro bono coordinator.  In this role, I began to learn a lot about nonprofit law and management from working with our pro bono clients.  Both of these experiences gave me the skills I needed to begin a nonprofit focused on educational equity.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I hope that the work that I’m doing at <a href="http://www.scripted.org"> ScriptEd</a> will help people broaden their definitions of what an educator is. In order to solve some of the biggest problems we have in education, we need to look beyond our teachers and parents as the solution to our problems.   At ScriptEd, we engage volunteers from the technology industry to teach our students computer science. 
<p>
In most states, it’s nearly impossible to become certified as a computer science teacher, and only 1 in 10 schools offer computer science as a course to students.  To begin to solve this problem immediately, we must expand our definition of what an educator is and start to rely on our coaches, mentors and volunteers within this definition.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I think that the incorporation of technology in the classroom has already started to have a large impact on the way students learn and consume information.  I think technology will allow for more self-organized learning, and will force educators to change their approaches to teaching.
<p>


<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Currently, I’m serving as the Executive Director of ScriptEd, a nonprofit I co-founded that aims to increase access to careers in technology by offering computer-programming classes in low-income high schools.  ScriptEd’s courses are taught by experienced computer programming professionals on a volunteer basis, ensuring that students not only have exposure to the most up-to-date knowledge available, but also role models and potential mentors in the field. In addition, ScriptEd links students to internship opportunities to gain professional experience in which to apply their coding skills.
<p>
In its first year, ScriptEd’s program served 25 students in two high schools in Harlem, New York, and placed four of its students in internships at technology firms. Our students learned the fundamentals of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and participated in field trip and job shadowing opportunities throughout the year.  Next year, ScriptEd will expand to three additional high schools in New York City.
My next big project is to continue to grow and perfect ScriptEd’s model over the next few years.
