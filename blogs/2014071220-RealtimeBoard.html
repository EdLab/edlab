<p><a href="https://realtimeboard.com/">RealtimeBoard</a> is bringing the whiteboard experience online for easy sharing and collaboration. It reimagines the traditional whiteboard to meet the needs of todayâ€™s highly interconnected work environment. Traditional whiteboards cannot be shared with anyone outside of the room, they cannot be saved over a period of time, and they are limited in their canvas space. By bringing the whiteboard into a web browser, RealtimeBoard attempts to solve all three problems at once.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>RealtimeBoard allows users to share their whiteboards with other members of their team for real-time collaboration and feedback. With a suite of design tools, users can easily create drawings and diagrams, post notes, and map out their ideas visually. Users can upload files from Google Docs, as well as pictures and videos. All whiteboard designs are saved in the cloud, so users can access their projects at anytime, from any place. They can also be exported as PDFs, images, or web links for sharing on social media sites.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>While it is free to sign up for RealtimeBoard as an individual user, the basic membership does not allow for sharing and can only be used for non-commercial projects. Individuals can also go Pro for $10 a month to access unlimited whiteboards and 3GB of storage space. To truly take advantage of the collaboration function, users will need to sign up as a team, at a cost of $10 per user per month. Teams have access to 5GB of storage and unlimited whiteboards.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>RealtimeBoard is certainly a great option for group sharing, brainstorming, and project collaboration. With an extension for Google Chrome, users will be notified every time a member of their team makes an update to the whiteboard. There is also a Support Forum and Blog to assist users with designing their canvases and troubleshooting solutions. Aside from the standard pricing options, a free group license is available to teachers and educators to encourage them to use RealtimeBoard with their students.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Gone are the days of Post-It notes and markers. The whiteboard goes digital.</p>
