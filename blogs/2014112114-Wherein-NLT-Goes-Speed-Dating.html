          <p>
            I attended my second <a href="http://www.meetup.com/testtube" target="_blank">Test Tube</a> event a few nights ago and it delivered; I got a lot of feedback in a little time. For this go-round I was testing NLT. Because you only have 7 minutes with each person, I couldn't go too in depth with any one task, but I did get some telling first impressions. Quite a few pain points surfaced; namely, 
<ul>
<li>The hassle of having to sign up
<ul><li>Only one person said that they would leave the site immediately once the wall came up. The rest (4 people) felt it appeared too soon and of these people, 3 suggested allowing people to sign up through Facebook or Google. 
People also wanted more emphasis on the site being free. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Not understanding the featured stories block
<ul><li>Overall, it seems people need more context about this section. They weren't sure why these stories were being featured (one person thought it meant they were breaking news stories).</li>
<li>Two people thought this section was a video. One person said because of this, and because they peruse news sites while at work, they definitely wouldn't click on it. Interesting/troubling? </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Not understanding or caring about our sections
<ul><li>Despite having descriptions for each section, people didn't want to be bothered to read them (it could have been because we were in a time crunch). Interestingly, one person wasn't sure if “High five” referred to the best stories on our site, or the best on the web. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Needing more information, less icons
<ul><li>A couple testers were confused about having the bookmark,Twitter, and mail icons on the front page next to stories. They felt they needed to first read the story in order to decide whether to bookmark, tweet, or send it.  </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Trying to use it as a mobile site but finding it didn't embrace touchscreen functionalities (I was showing it on an iPad)
<ul><li>There were a lot of impassioned swiping attempts and subsequent sounds of disapproval. </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
There were also a couple notes about content. One tester said our headlines are not gripping and our subheads don't help. Another said our articles were just long enough (he was looking at an NLS) while someone else would actually like them to be a smidge longer (he was looking at an RD). 

If there's anything you can count on in life, it's that a handful of startup strangers will be brutally honest when given the chance. I've deposited their thoughts into my feedback bank. I have no doubt they'll accrue some interest and will pay out in full someday soon (I'll see myself out.).
