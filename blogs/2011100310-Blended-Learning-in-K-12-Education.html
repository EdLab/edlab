            "Blended Learning" has been on the lips of educators for decades.  Previously known simply as any teaching that included more than one method of delivery, from television to AV to slides.  However, in the last decade “Blended” has been defined by <a href="http://www.innosightinstitute.org/blended_learning_models/">Innosight </a> as, “any time a student learns at least in part at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from home and at least in part through online delivery with some element of student control over time, place, path, and/or pace.”  What does this new definition mean exactly and how does this concept play-out in existent schools throughout the country?  

Innosight's recent white paper (cited above), The Rise of K-12 Blended Learning, surveyed, forty schools across the country from charter to public and everything in-between during the 2010-11 school year.  The dominant models included Face-to-face Driver, Rotation and the Online Lab models.  Self-Blend & Online Driver structures were also present, but in only a fraction of the schools profiled.  Examples of each of these models include, Face-to-Face Driver -  <a href="http://q2l.org/">Quest to Learn</a>, Rotation - <a href="http://www.kippla.org/"> KIPP LA</a>, Flex -  <a href="http://uschybridhigh.uscannenberg.org/?p=509">USC Hybrid High School</a>, Online Lab - <a href="http://www.flvs.net/educators/Pages/Virtual-Learning-Lab.aspx">Florida Virtual School: Learning Labs</a>, Self-Blend - <a href="http://www.mivhs.org/">Michigan Virtual School </a> and Online Driver - <a href="http://www.nohum.k12.ca.us/srcs/ebridge/">Six Rivers Charter High School: Learning Center</a>. 

<b>What are the Key Components of these Models?</b>  
The main attributes of the Face-to-Face Driver model are characterized by a physical teacher who delivers the majority of the content, using online resources as a supplemental “back channel.”  Rotation is characterized by students rotating between face-to-face learning and time spent in a classroom with a teacher, this model is split evenly between physical and virtual learning. Flex models are dominated by an online platform for content delivery with teachers provided additional support as needed.  This is the model most often used in drop-out recovery programs.  Online Labs also deliver all course material via an online platform, however, in this model teachers are almost never involved in a physical sense, and instead assistance is available online.  This model is still delivered in a traditional school setting, but delivered completely through a dedicated lab, often to students who have other physically delivered classes & block schedules.  Finally, Online Driver models are delivered completely online & often from remote locations.  

<b>Results</b>
Many of the schools profiled are in preliminary pilot programs to test the success of these “blended learning” models and felt it was too early to assess results.  However, many institutions did cite measurable increases in graduation rate and decreased costs.  For example, Big Picture Learning in Rhode Island, who use a Face-to-Face Driver model, report that on average 90% of their students graduate on-time and outperform their peers in public education in areas ranging from college acceptance to achievement-test results. Additionally, Alliance College-Ready Public schools in LA , who employ both a Rotation & Online Lab models noted reduced labor, textbook & facility costs.  Additionally, many of the institutions studied cited “increased learning time” as teachers are freed-up in class to focus on content areas that are usually glossed-over in favor of remedial instruction, which is now handled, in many cases, online. 

<b>Critics & Future?</b>
Critics of “Blended Learning” programs question whether educators are too reliant on the actual technology used and as a result, skimp on content.  Ulrike Tipp, a professor of commercial information technology at the Wildau Polytechnic University in Germany points-out in <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5359341,00.html">this article</a>, "That means that we've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine."  Tipp goes-on to explain the proliferation of “empty” online platforms, "But technology alone doesn't do it. And that's what we've seen. Many teaching platforms were empty platforms. Meaning that no one was really moved to use them. You have to ask why that is."  Are we creating an empty learning experience that is tech-heavy, but content deficient?  Based on the preliminary findings of the institutions surveyed by Innosight, in the study listed above, I would argue, no.
