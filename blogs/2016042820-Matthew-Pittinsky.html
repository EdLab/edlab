Matthew Pittinsky is the CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1O70oSt">Parchment</a> and co-founder and former CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/20ZGfHq">Blackboard Inc</a>. Matthew is on the faculty of Arizona State University and serves on the Board of Trustees of The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. In 2012 Teachers College at Columbia University awarded him The President’s Medal of Excellence to recognize his impact and innovation in the field of education technology and entrepreneurship. He holds a B.S. in Political Science from American University, an Ed.M. in Education Policy from Harvard University Graduate School of Education, and a Ph.D. in Sociology of Education from Teachers College, Columbia University.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>One week after co-founding Blackboard, I took the GREs for doctoral programs in sociology of education. I guess that says something about how confident I was that we’d be around a year later! At the point I had completed so much graduate education coursework as an undergrad and in the master's program at Harvard Graduate School of Education. I can’t overstate how fundamental my sociological understanding of schools and universities (and the crosscutting expectations of education in society) was to the way we positioned Blackboard early on. Parchment follows my doctoral work at Teachers College and is a direct outgrowth of the literature on credentials. Collins, Labaree and others are all voice in my head as I think about what we are doing at Parchment to move academic credentials into the digital world and make them more effective as a currency for opportunity. In short, my education has given me an analytical framework for thinking about our market and how we position ourselves within it.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I believe that schools and universities teach more than what the formal curriculum documents in a transcript. And what they teach is directly responsive to many of the knowledge economy skills employers say they want. The problem is we don’t document all the learning that happens. We need academic credentials that more fully capture what a student knows and how well they know it, that foster reflection by the learner, and that promote evaluation by the education institutions and employers that rely on credentials.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>It is difficult for me to point to one broad trend. Big data and data science would be on the top of the list. But so too are the immersive learning environments that are enabled by virtual reality.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>My current work is Parchment, which is about moving paper academic credentials to digital and then taking advantage of what digital can do to transform the form and function of academic credentials. Ideally, digital transformation can extend academic credentials with additional data elements, as well as make them more visual, more personal, and more actionable online.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>Alas, I am not on any social media platforms. I get my news and opinion pieces through digests and the like. On the entrepreneur side of the table, <a href="http://bit.ly/1mxj47K">John Katzman</a> remains someone whose smarts, experience, and tireless work to fix problems deserves even more visibility in academic circles.</p>
