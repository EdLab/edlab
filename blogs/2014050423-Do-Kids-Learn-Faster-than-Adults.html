            It might be very strange to take a minute or two to discover that 'kids' could learn faster than adults. Most sports have teams for kids and also teams for adults as well. It is very interesting to discover that in some cases, children learn very fast compared to adults who might also be learning the same thing. This <a href="http://sportscoachuk.org/blog/how-do-kids-learn-faster-adults">article</a> gives a brief overview of how kids are able to learn faster in some cases than adults. Kids learn faster than adults because the prefrontal cortex of the brain, where working memory is stored, is more developed more in adults than children. 
<p>
Due to the development of the prefrontal cortex, adults experience functional fixedness and that makes adults see everything exactly as it is. For instance, an adult will see a tennis racket exactly as it is. In contrast, a child will see a broomstick as a javelin stick. The creativity of children is caused by their prefrontal cortex, which gives them the ability to be flexible and inventive. Kids have minds that are designed to learn and adults have minds designed to perform.
<p>
It is very fascinating to discover that kids actually have the ability to be very creative and learn new things. This might be a great way to help kids develop their talents while they are still young. It might be the best option for a parent to make a child try different activities because it will help the child develop their abilities through creativity.
