            <a href ="http://alh.sagepub.com/content/12/1/35.short"> Hargis, Jace and Marotta, Sebastian (2011).Using Flip camcorders for active classroom metacognitive reflection. Active Learning in Higher Education 12(1), 35â€”44.</a>

This paper talks about an experiment at the Center for Teaching and Learning in which they provided ten new faculty members with a <a href ="http://www.amazon.com/Flip-UltraHD-Video-Camera-Generation/dp/B0040702HA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1317218237&sr=8-1"> Flip camera</a> to use in their classrooms as a teaching tool. The different school subjects that were involved were mathematics, political science, computer engineering, psychology, business, music and dance. The goal of this experiment was how this technology tool helped the faculty explore new ways of improving their teaching and to have a better understanding of how we learn.
     
<b>Description:</b> According to the author, the first time we had technology in the classroom was when the first portable calculator was in the hands of students. Of course we have come a long way since then, now we have cellphones that can make calls, take video and pictures, store all kinds of data, and I know every single cell phone has a calculator, even the very old ones. The technology being used in this experiment is a Flip camera, a small digital camera (4 inches high, 2 inches wide), and it's a simple point and shoot camera which only has five buttons. The one unique feature with the Flip camera is a built-in USB arm so you can easily upload your video onto a Mac or PC.

Once the new faculty members had their Flip cameras, they were trained on how to operate the device, followed by a brief brainstorming session on ideas to capture student activities and ways to use the data for reflection, remediation, and insights. For each of the subjects, when the camera was introduced to the students, they used it to film presentations, dance rehearsals, and record the construction of a project. With a quick upload of the video into their computers, students can watch what they did and have instant feedback on their presentations, dance rehearsals, and project. The author believes that the whole experience can lead to an environment where students will want to learn and also lead to long term learning. The Flip camera in the classroom was easy use, cost effective and most importantly a way to increase engagement and student reflection. This experiment showed us that the teachers from different schools were able to change the way they teach by integrating the camera use into their classrooms, and they will see the effects of the new technology's use on their student's learning.
   
<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> It's always heartwarming to me to read about how new technology can help students become more engaged in the learning process. The point of the paper was not to promote the Flip camera's use in classroom, but to show how teachers can take a piece technology that is used by many people everywhere, and be opened to exploring new ways for students to learn using it. This is something we can learn from when we promote our products or introduce new ones. When doing so, we should keep in mind that most teachers will be interested in using new technology to teach their students and would integrate the use of new technology in their curriculum, so let's give them even more technology to use.
