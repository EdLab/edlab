<i>We are trying to crack the code on turning university innovation into commercialization. And we are working with many other universities to help them. And you will be seeing that we are going to be rolling out some form of national expansion where it’s going to help other places. And at the end of the day we can help all founders of any university learn better and faster so that they can get to actually impact the world in a better way.</i>

<b>Let Dreams Roll!</b>
<br>
In his often cited speech at the 2005 Stanford commencement Steve Jobs shared a key insight from his own career: "I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did… the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do." Jobs presented a powerful example for those in pursuit of their dreams. One year after Jobs’ speech, Cameron Teitelman began his studies at Stanford in Management Science and Engineering. During his college years Teitelman kept looking for his passions. He was the founder and CEO of a discounted card company, worked for private equity, had professional background in the entertainment industry, and was actively involved in the school wrestling team. Teitelman’s diverse experiences ignited his passion for helping others pursue their dreams. He became the General Manager of Stanford Student Enterprises Ventures where he managed a fund to invest in student businesses.  From this vantage point, he foresaw a growing need among campus entrepreneurs who lacked resources to make their dreams come true. Building on his expanding network of mentors, angel investors and seasoned entrepreneurs, Teitelman developed a solution for those passionate dream catchers at the university – StartX, a "student startup accelerator" that provides various resources, connections, and opportunities for on-campus entrepreneurs who would like to start a career that they really love.

<b>Unlimited Possibilities: Revisiting the Definition of University</b>
<br>
At a time when the historic meaning of the university as a "school of universal learning" is sometimes eclipsed by the growing importance of the university degree as a necessary credential in an increasingly competitive marketplace, Teitelman’s work to support the innovative ideas of budding entrepreneurs offers an alternative. By providing a formal hands-on educational program with resources ranging from free legal advice to computer-server infrastructure, his efforts have fostered a new set of possibilities in universities where like-minded young people gather together spurring each other on with innovative ideas and support to turn those ideas into practice. All the resources provided by Teitelman’s venture are directly accessible to students. As the founder of <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu/">StartX</a> and a student entrepreneur himself, Teitelman leads an effort to revisit the very foundations of the university: universal learning; this time not from the classroom, but via experiential education programs and an ever-expanding community of campus entrepreneurs driven to make their dreams come true. Teitelman, together with his team, has so far supported more than 240 founders and 90 companies across diverse fields and industries. And his business is likely to benefit more university students as discussions about expanding to other universities have already begun. Teitelman is a tireless advocate for university-based entrepreneurship as part of a new vision of higher education in the current age.
