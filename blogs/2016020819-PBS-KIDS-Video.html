All concerned parents want to provide their kids with high quality, safe content. <a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pbs-kids-video/id435138734?mt=8">PBS KIDS Video</a> makes achieving this goal much easier for them. This app curates the absolute finest in children's television. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>PBS KIDS Video is comprehensive and offers thousands of videos from their top children’s TV series. This includes widely acclaimed hits such as Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood, Dinosaur Train, Odd Squad, Peg + Cat, The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!, Wild Kratts, and so much more. For kids who are keen video watchers, they can browse and watch these videos anywhere—on the road, in their room, at their friend's house. The site is consistently updated—a "Weekly Pick" keeps content fresh. Picks focus on the fundamentals—math, science, and reading—giving parents who want to make the most out of their child’s free time a welcome resource. In short, the app is both fun and educational. </p> 

<p>The aesthetics of PBS KIDS Video are cartoon perfect; colors pop, and sound effects sing when kids interact with the app. The user experience is pleasant and straight-forward, simple enough for youngsters who have experience on an iPad to navigate. Icons, arrows, and type are all big and clear, made specifically for little ones. Due to the app’s exclusive link to PBS KIDS content, parents can be sure that videos are child-friendly and age-appropriate.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, PBS KIDS Video is only available in the U.S.; foreign fans be forewarned. Also, the suggested age range is limited; it is only for kids 5 and under. If you have older ones at home, you’re out of luck. Currently, you do not need a television subscription to watch videos, but that could change as cable companies adjust to consumer cord-cutting. Stay tuned. </p>
 
<p>PBS KIDS Video’s focus on video content limits learning to this single multimedia model. If your child is hyperactive and doesn’t respond well to fast-paced educational videos, this app may have limited use, leaving it as more of an entertainment opportunity than a learning tool. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>PBS KIDS Video is a joyful and easy way for young kids to access a diverse library of television content in the palms of their little hands. If your kid learns best by watching TV, or if you need a little break from the non-stop demands of parenting, it’s a great way for your tiny ones to spend time with many of the engaging characters on PBS KIDS, the gold standard in public educational television. </p>
