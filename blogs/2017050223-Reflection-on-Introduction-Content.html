After completing my first set of readings and videos assigned in the online class I am currently taking, I now understand why online classes are convenient, especially for individuals with busy schedules. This is my first experience taking an online class without a professor, but I am already convinced it won’t be my last. The class is very appealing because it allows me to balance priorities and responsibilities without making any drastic changes as oppose to if I were enrolled in physical classes.

The first reading and video focuses on victims of police shootings. As I expected, the story of Michael Brown’s shooting in Ferguson, Missouri was one of the use cases. The Ferguson incident seemed the catalyst for subsequent police shootings that drew widespread media and public condemnation. The readings and the video were interesting in that it highlighted statistics and other information that I didn’t previously know about law enforcement. As someone who follows and know quite a bit about law enforcement policy, I was amazed at how much funding certain states provided their policing units.

The video (see above) was interesting and grabbed my attention immediately because it was informative but delivered in a funny and amusing way. One of the challenges of taking a self-directed course (especially for no credit) is motivation and keeping engaged. The way in which the content is delivered therefore becomes super important and keeps the learner interested in the course.
