<i>When you look back at history, all the great moments that defined the human race were about education – Greco-Roman civilization, the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution. I’m convinced that we’re on the verge of the fourth big revolution</i> (<a href=" http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a>).
<p>
<b>Started as a tutor, ended up jailbreaking the GRE</b><br>
Jose Ferreira is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://www.knewton.com/">Knewton</a>, an adaptive learning company with products used around the world. Ferreira has had a long and interesting career with many twists and turns that led to the founding of Knewton in 2008.  After receiving his Bachelors degree in Philosophy, Ferreria started his professional career as a tutor in Kaplan Educational Centers, and after 2 years he was promoted to an executive position. During this time he came up with rock solid strategies to answer a new type of GRE question correctly every time, without fail. This code cracking would force the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the world’s largest private non-profit educational testing and assessment organization, to destroy hundreds of test questions and test books. A year later Ferreira figured out the GRE scoring algorithm and discovered duplicate questions across different tests. With this information and the fact that Kaplan went public with this error, Ferreira solidified his reputation as a disruptive force and ended up being labeled the "Antichrist" according to the back and forth emails with ETS. It was during this time that Ferriera had the idea for an adaptive online test prep course.  He proposed this idea at Kaplan where it went nowhere, eventually causing him to leave. Ferreira went on to have many diverse jobs, even as he continued to develop his ideas for an adaptive online test prep course.
<p>
<b>Never let go of that idea!</b><br>
Ferreira eventually went to Harvard Business School and then to Goldman Sachs as a derivative trader.  He went on to found an online startup called DizzyCity.   After this initial entrepreneurial venture, Ferreira worked in both politics and venture capital.  Throughout his various careers Ferreria’s initial adaptive online test prep concept continued to grow, and while he was working as a venture capitalist he realized that technology had finally advanced far enough to support his idea of an adaptive online test prep course. Ferreria began raising money to make his idea come to life and received $6 Million from investors like Bessemer Ventures, Accel Partners, First Round Capital, and angel investor Reid Hoffman (best known as the founder of LinkedIn).  The new venture, Knewton, began with adaptive online test prep courses for standardized tests such as the GMAT, the SAT, and the LSAT, and grew to include adaptive online math courses. Publishing giant Pearson became interested and formed a partnership that would lead to the well-respected, <a href=" http://www.knewton.com/asu/">Arizona State "Math Readiness" course</a>.  After 16 years of developing an idea, Ferreira finally turned it into a reality at Knewton. The Knewton system has the power to continuously adapt its learning content to maximize a user’s learning, creating a more personalized learning experience compared to traditional schooling. But Ferreira is not done yet as he pursues his long-term goal to making Knewton’s offerings even more adaptable and accessible to any young learner.
