<p>Amara Humphry is the co-founder and Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://www.goorulearning.org/#home">Gooru</a>, a technology nonprofit dedicated to honoring the human right to education. Amara is passionate about empowering every student with actionable data to realize their full potential. She blends technology and design to create student-centric solutions that bring big data, crowdsourcing, and the support of a global community to students who need it most. Amara received her Bachelors of Science in Product Design from Stanford University. When Amara grows up, she wants to go back to school to continue her education.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
My parents prioritized education above all else, and I was fortunate to have a great education from early on. I attended one of the best schools in Hawaii and went on to one of the best universities in the world. I arrived at Stanford feeling like I could learn anything! I found the wonders of interdisciplinary studies in Product Design, which combined my love for puzzles (Mechanical Engineering) and creative curiosity (Fine Art). </p>

<p>After graduation, I found myself conflicted. Silicon Valley is known for creating amazing products, but for the most part, I only saw cutting-edge technology developed and applied to advance lifestyles for the world’s most fortunate. We can combine maps, cellular communication, and high-resolution cameras to share our geo-tagged vacation pictures with our friends. This wasn’t—and isn’t—the full potential of technology. </p>

<p>I don’t like to ask, "What’s wrong with education?" or "Why is our system is broken?" For me, it wasn't. Instead, I ask, "How can we take an education that works for some and make it work for all?" Pram, who was a Google engineer at the time, and I started Gooru in 2011 with the shared belief that education is a human right. We’ve established our role as "Engineers for Educators" and work with a community of passionate teachers to improve the quality of learning for all. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people teach and learn?</b><br>
We build tools and technology to give students actionable information, empowering them with data and the appropriate resources to take charge of their learning. </p>

<p>We know every student is unique, but educational content has been standardized since the invention of the printing press, and the tradition continues with MOOCs. We believe technology can amplify a teacher’s role and break the cycle of one-size-fits-all education. With the right tools, teachers can tailor learning content to engage and relate to their students. By connecting to the broader community, they can access the expertise of other educators doing the same thing around the country and amplify their individual impact. </p>

<p>Our tools are open for anyone, anywhere to use and benefit from. We hope to change education by using big data and personalized learning to empower every student to reach their full potential. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
The application of both big and real-time data. Education technology makes capturing and analyzing data instantaneous. This will lead to accountability across the board—for example, schools will know where to focus professional development, publishers will know the effectiveness of their learning resources, students and teachers know almost instantaneously where gaps are in students’ learning. Data has great potential to transform learning across the board by making everyone aware and accountable of their impact in the education ecosystem. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>  
As teachers and students return to school, we are focused on understanding how our tools come to life and are adapted in their classrooms. In our next big project this year, we are collaborating with innovative teachers to understand this process and have them share with each other. As individuals, they are developing innovative content and practices to unleash the full potential of personalized learning for their classrooms. As a community, they connect with each other to learn and collaborate together as they understand and rapidly evolve new models to improve learning for every student. We are working closely with them to understand what transformative ways our tools can improve learning, and share what we learn with everyone. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter? </b><br>
I don’t have a Twitter account, but if I did, I’d probably follow Michelle Obama, LeBron James, and Taylor Swift.</p>
