<b>Overview:</b>
<a href="http://powermylearning.com/">PowerMyLearning</a> is an internet portal to online enrichment content for students in K-12. It was designed as a part of the <a href="http://cfy.org/">CFY program</a>. As they describe the relationship:
<blockquote>CFY is a national education nonprofit that helps students in low-income communities, together with their teachers and families, harness the power of digital learning to improve educational outcomes. CFY pursues this mission through the combination of a groundbreaking K-12 learning platform, PowerMyLearning.com, and an on-the-ground direct service initiative, the CFY Digital Learning Program.</blockquote>
While PowerMyLearning is a key component in the CFY program, the platform is open to all parents, teachers, and students.

<!--break-->

<b>Pros:</b>
<li>The resources are all sortable by grade level, and can be further filtered to show only games/interactive resources, videos, and (for teachers) ones with lesson plans and other classroom-related materials</li>
<li>Teachers can create “playlists” of materials that students can work through, customizing materials on a student-by-student basis</li>
<li>Parents can view what their students have worked on recently</li>


<b>Cons:</b>
<li>The content all comes from external sources, embedded in the PML environment. Some of the content lends itself to this, some of it doesn't</li>
<li>In addition, some of the content needs to be downloaded and installed to user's local machine, which is an added hassle when most of the resources are available directly on the web</li>
<li>While the content is curated, it's difficult to discern the selection criteria. I noticed some familiar resources (Sketch, Alice, selected games from MangaHigh and iCivics), but then some other resources didn't seem live up to the same level of quality.</li>


<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
CFY is a multi-faceted program that's been incorporated into several public schools, which is a sector that seems to be difficult to break into in a place like NYC. (The list of schools that benefit from the full CFY program just in NYC is available <a href="http://cfy.org/locations/new-york-city/">here</a>.) The program emphasizes student-centered learning, in which parents and teachers are equally important, another important trend in modern education. The fact that the program targets disadvantaged student populations (at least 75% of students must qualify for the reduced-cost lunch program, along with other criteria), and provides students with computers pre-loaded with educational content and free or reduced-cost broadband has a huge impact. While not every student can benefit from the comprehensive CFY program, PowerMyLearning enables teachers, parents, and students to benefit from a significant component of the program.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
PowerMyLearning exudes the CFY philosophy of providing a digital learning environment designed for student-centered learning. PML and the entire CFY program has already had a substantial impact on public school children, contributing in its own way to the shifting nature of education.
