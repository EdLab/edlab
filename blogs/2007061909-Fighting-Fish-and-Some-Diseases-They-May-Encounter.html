            Fighting fish are very hardy fish. There are many different types. Overall, they have adapted to many different environments. I think that what is the most fascinating aspect to the fighting fish is the ability to breathe air. So when there is very little oxygen in the water, they can swim to the surface and inhale some air. This feature also allows them to avoid dying from contamination in the water. You really have to not take care of the water in order to kill them. 

One way to kill them is by leaving them in a tank for too long, not changing the water, but continuing to feed them. One of the diseases that can kill your fish this way is fin rot. Fin rot is caused by the ammonia in the water slowly eating at the fins of your fish. If not treated immediately, fin rot can eat away the fins on your fish causing infection and eventually killing them.  In my case I had a fish that died of fin rot in one day. The disease literally spread up his back fin and onto his body. The next morning he was dead and half of his body was consumed by the disease. 

Another rather annoying disease that kills fish very easily is fungus. Fungus has a tendency to spread very, very fast. It could be a little on the tip of the fish's mouth one second and the next second he could be covered in from head to fin. The bacteria spreads over the body creating a white coat. The fungus sucks the nutrients out of the body until the fish dies and even then it continues to feast on the carcass. Onset of this problem is usually caused by stress. The fish can get stress from too many water changes, lose of a fish companion, a change in temperature, or a lack of food. Fungus generally starts to grow when the fish is over fed and the food on the bottom doesn't get eaten. Bacteria in the tank then begins to multiply on the surface of the uneaten food and will harm the fish if the uneaten food is not removed soon. 

Both the fin rot and fungus can be treated with chemicals sold at a local pet store. If the diseases are caught in time and treated correctly then your fish will have a fighting chance. This concludes this week's chapter on diseases that fighting fish are susceptible to getting. Just make sure to keep your tank clean at all costs.
