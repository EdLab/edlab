Two weeks ago, at our weekly basketball game, my friend Scott Streiner told me that studying STEM topics in college is the way to go and that going for something like an English Major would probably be a bad idea. From a financial standpoint, he's right. STEM jobs continue to be in demand while jobs in writing fields like journalism are becoming more and more competitive. Oftentimes, good writers are left struggling. Contently aims to change that.

The need for good writing hasn't diminished. In fact, it's growing. However, there are many barriers dividing content publishers from freelance writers. Contently founders Joe Coleman, Dave Goldberg and Shane Show realized this and created Contently. Their website, Contently.com, brings quality freelance writers to publishers without the hassle often involved in the process. Contently gathers a pool of writers they deem as experts in particular fields and puts tags on them to identify their strengths. When a publisher goes to Contently, a form indicating the type of writing desired is filled out. Using this information, Contently finds matches. Both publishers and writers gain from this system. Publishers get quality writing without having to develop an in house editorial team. Using tools Contently provides, they can manage their team of writers and assign specific projects to writers with a calendar to show all deadlines and projects. Writers receive good pay for their hard work, unlike at agencies which pay writers very little. The consumer will encounter good writing across the web. It's a win for everyone. Below is an interview with Contently Co-founder Joe Coleman.
