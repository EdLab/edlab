            I am not sure how many of you have noticed children five years or younger already using gadgets like an iPad and iTouch. It might be that everyone is using them but the question is, are children this age suitable for this type of technology? <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5970745/this-1960s-gadget-is-more-kid+friendly-than-todays">This article</a> talks about this new phenomenon and gives it a chronological evolution of children and technological gadgets and how current gadgets are too fragile for children. The author notes that in the 1960s, the Kenner Close n Play, a lunchbox looking vinyl was an ideal gadget for children because:
<blockquote>
It's brilliant. Vinyl tonearms are delicate mechanical twigs that were just asking to be snapped by eager children. The Close n Play solved this problem–that kiddos like music like everyone else, but might break the hardware necessary to enjoy it–by hiding it all away. Not through some mechanism that made them feel like kids, but by almost making the precaution part of the fun. Close the lid to hide the player's guts–music starts playing automatically! From there it was safe for tots to cart around without damaged needles or scratched discs. Open it up to swap out discs, and the tunes end. And all the while, it still looked like something sophisticated for adults.
</blockquote>
As aforementioned, iPads and iTouch are in use now and these are
worth a great amount of money and I have seen several times where a slight drop essentially messed up the entire gadget. The convenience of these gadgets is great but they are meant more for adults, yet the curiosity of children that age leads them towards these gadgets. Many companies have tried to use this new technology in a way where it is safer for kids but does it really compare to those from the 1960s? What were some of your favorite gadgets growing up and how does it compare to today's?
