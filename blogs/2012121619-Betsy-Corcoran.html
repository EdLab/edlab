<i>We started EdSurge because we felt that teachers needed — and deserved — great, independent information about the quality of technology available to them. We also felt that the emerging entrepreneurial sector would benefit from knowing more about what each other were doing. Good information is a trump card, for everyone!</i>

<b>Bye-Bye Forbes, Hello Educational Technology!</b>
<br>
Betsy Corcoran created <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/">EdSurge</a> to form a bridge between educators and educational entrepreneurs. She believed that if each party knew what they were seeking from the other it would be very beneficial for them both. EdSurge’s mission is to provide educators with information about educational tools and an unbiased independent review of educational products, while also providing the rising generation of educational entrepreneurs with information on what others have done and are doing currently in the educational technology field. Corcoran has considerable experience providing readers with information about technology, only now she has focused her sights on educational technology specifically. A former executive editor of technology coverage at Forbes Media, and writer for the Washington Post and Scientific American, her journey to the educational technology journalism field began, when as a mother she volunteered at an elementary school computer lab. When she started to wonder why new educational technologies weren’t reaching the school, she made the decision to quit her job at Forbes and take a year off to look further into this problem. During this time she met her three future EdSurge co-founders Nick Punt, Agustin Vilaseca, and Matt Bowman. The four created the EdSurge e-newsletter for educational technology and the website that serves as their educational technology news base.
<p>
<b>An Online Newsletter with an Offline Approach</b>
<br>
Corcoran is very engaged on the ground when it comes to finding out what people want to read about in Edsurge. Before launching the site she asked teachers what they would want to learn about educational technologies and how they would like to connect with relevant educational entrepreneurs. Since the launch of Edsurge, Corcoran continues to use the face-to-face approach when it comes to bringing educators and educational entrepreneurs together. For example, EdSurge sponsored a <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/makerfaire">Do It Yourself Learning Pavilion at the Maker Faire</a> at the San Mateo County Expo Center, an event meant for companies to introduce their 
educational technologies to students and teachers. Whether offline or online, Corcoran is on a mission to bring together educators and educational entrepreneurs so they can learn from one another.
