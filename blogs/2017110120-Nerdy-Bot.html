<p><a href="https://gonerdify.com/nerdybot">Nerdy Bot</a> is billed as an artificial intelligence (AI) personal assistant that can answer basic math and fact-based questions. It is not an app that you download; instead, this service by <a href="https://gonerdify.com">Nerdify</a> is used through Facebook Messenger. Nerdy Bot is aimed at getting people to "stop Googling."</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Nerdy Bot can be used for looking up simple bits of information and facts. Using Facebook Messenger, just ask the Nerdy Bot account a question and it will instantly send back an answer, exactly like messaging friends on the platform. For instance, I asked it for the capital of Arizona, and the bot sent back the correct answer of Phoenix. It can even understand some misspellings, as I asked what is the "capitol" of Arizona and also got back the correct response. </p>  

<p>There is no sign-up for using this service and Nerdify does not need to access your contacts, which is nice in an age where most apps or services attempt to scrape every last bit of information from customers. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>A lot of the returned queries through Nerdy Bot are not very helpful. The AI mostly connects the user with a somewhat related Wikipedia page and it can only understand the most basic questions. For instance, I asked who was the president in 1837 and it simply gave me the first paragraph of the U.S. President page from Wikipedia. I think it’s Andrew Jackson, but now I’ll never know. </p> 

<p>I was especially curious to test Nerdy Bot’s advertised graphing capabilities because this is truly a function that cannot be done through Google. I entered the example equation from the app’s homepage, "f(x) = x3/2 plot." It did not graph a plot for me. Instead, I got the plot from the 2006 movie <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> via Wikipedia. I could never figure out how to plot graphs through this messaging service.</p>   

<p>Nerdy Bot’s parent company is Nerdify, which helps to connect college students to tutors or other assistants. In part I suspected that this free Nerdy Bot app might just be a crafty way to herd people toward another paid service. But when I asked it to find a math tutor, I was again given the first paragraph of a Wikipedia page, this time about math software. I tried to focus the search with <i>where</i> can I find a math tutor, but I received information even more unrelated than with the first query, this time on an episode of the animated series <i>Bob's Burgers</i>, entitled "Can't Buy Me Math." 
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Nerdy Bot reminds me of ChaCha. Anyone remember <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/chacha-gives-you-answers-via-text-message/">ChaCha</a>? This was a late 2000s search engine that gained traction through the use of its text messaging search feature. You could text ChaCha a question and it would text you back an answer. Pretty cool back in 2008! But, ChaCha closed down in 2016. We don’t need another ChaCha.</p>     

<p>I don’t really understand the "stop Googling" feature that this app attempts to "fix." Googling is very easy and effective. It seems that this company created a solution and then looked for a problem. Further, with the ubiquity of AI personal assistants, such as Siri or Alexa, I just cannot really see Nerdy Bot being too useful. </p>  

<p>Google search alternatives still turn up better options than Nerdy Bot. If you "Yahoo" or "Bing"  "f(x) = x3/2 plot," the sites also can’t plot the graph, but they certainly won’t provide reference to arguably the worst X-Men movie. I understand that some people might want to escape the Google ecosystem, but moving to a subpar Facebook Messaging personal assistant is not the answer anyone is looking for. </p>
