            I was just watching the August 1 <a href="http://tedblog.typepad.com/tedblog/">Nicholas Negroponte clip</a> on TEDblog.

<blockquote>Negroponte is former Director of the MIT Media Lab, and founder of the non-profit, One Laptop Per Child, dedicated to making the famed "$100 laptop" a reality.</blockquote>

Striking how he hit home the point that theirs is an "educational" enterprise, not a "laptop" enterprise...
<!--break-->
Also of note, his harping on the fact that computers are only getting slower: "they are like obese people who spend most of their energy moving their weight around." And why is that? The recent post about Blackboard raises a relevant point: IP law. Don't you think Apple could be selling $15 iPods by now? Sure, but they are greedy... They call it "pushing the envelope further," but how much is the profit motive driving their innovation? (And meanwhile no one can make a truly generic iPod.)

Enter the $100 laptop. It's weak compared to a new MacBook, but I want one. So why can't I buy one yet? For reasons that are even bigger than IP law: consumer marketing, keeping up with the Joneses, the pleasure drive (re: freud) – we like the bells and whistles. I suppose it's written somewhere that it's not glamorous to sell people the essentials. So we strive to innovate, and be the consumers of innovation.

Could it be we've got it the wrong way around? Negroponte's struggle to push the $100 laptop into the world is an interesting model. What are the odds he couldn't get anyone excited if he just tried to fix American education – he certainly couldn't do it with a computer alone (gasp!). So instead he's aiming larger. Global change! It's counterintuitive (unless you consider the scale of developement and production of the laptop... but remember: this is an educational project). This is not a vision of innovation, but transformation.

I'm motivated by this vision to design differently. We shouldn't be designing fancy glam site for TC folks to get their kicks. We should be designing educational tools for the $100 laptop. What would these be?

Well, Wikipedia, for sure. Google, for sure. But what else?

Archiving tools? Maybe.

Small, social, clever applications? Yes. What do children in developing countries need to do? They need representation. They need collaboration. They need tools for experimenting...

What could these tools be?
