            It was another busy and bustling semester here at the library.

This past fall 7,847 meetings, classes and events were scheduled in the library making up 26,321.5 hours of room usage. This is an increase from the spring of 2013 where the library held 6,817 room bookings with 17,834 hours. The room in the library that was booked the most was RH308 with 2,225 events taking place. RH308 was also the most booked room in the spring with 660 events scheduled.

Our total checkouts for fall 2013 was 10,141. This is a slight decrease from the spring semester when the library had 13,669 checkouts. We attribute this to more and more of our resources being available online.
