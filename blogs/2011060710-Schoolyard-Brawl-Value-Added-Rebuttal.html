            This is the rebuttal to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5826">Skanda's opening post</a>

How is it that this abstruse statistical technique has become such a controversial of the education debate?  The answer is entirely political, and can be neatly summed up as: 

Fear of China 

It is due to “China's peaceful rise” (a nation with 1.3 billion “model-minority” citizens) that our current global ranking in student outcomes, well behind Shanghai in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html">latest PISA scores </a>, has become such an issue.  The fact that our scores are comparable to the vast majority of advanced countries is irrelevant to these 21st century Lothrop Stoddards.
<!--break-->
I begin with this political context because, unfortunately, a crisis mentality is not the best way to approach long-term institutional reform.  Our political and academic establishment, desperate for a silver bullet to solve a contrived crisis in education, has hit upon teacher quality as their savior.  Other obvious factors in the educational process have been measured and found wanting (unable, statistically speaking, to bear the weight of our impractical expectations.)  The problem, as even its proponents will admit, is that value-added modeling has serious issues with precision (value-added modeling has trouble distinguishing with any certainty most teachers from each other) and stability (a given teacher's score can vary enormously from year to year), and its application as “the” measure of teacher quality will result in a variety of negative second-order effects.

Now in an ideal world, where our elite was perfectly objective and competent, it would be trivially true that some value-added measure should be included along with everything else (supervisor evaluations, past experience, etc.) in making retention and salary decisions.  Unfortunately, that is not our elite, and our elite will take what is already a metric of questionable accuracy and use it to turn the public school system into a wasteland, characterized by teaching styles ranging from a narrow “teaching to the test” to outright test fraud (and it should be mentioned that teaching to the test is actually a kind of test fraud, with the added bonus that children are too busy learning how to game the system to learn anything else), no job security, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2258657/pagenum/all/#p2">very high dismissal rates</a>, and a widespread sense that in one more area of human endeavor, we have allowed ourselves to be dominated by what should have been a useful technology.

And at the end of the day, you're not even going to see those miraculous gains in student achievement that were the justification of this reform to begin with.  There aren't enough great teachers out there for the modeling assumptions to work, and even if there were, they certainly won't be signing up to teach in a system with no job security, where their careers are at the whim of a largely arbitrary statistic.  

Disclaimer: Many of the views that will be expressed in this series will be done so for the sake of argument; they do not necessarily reflect the personal views of either Skanda or myself.
