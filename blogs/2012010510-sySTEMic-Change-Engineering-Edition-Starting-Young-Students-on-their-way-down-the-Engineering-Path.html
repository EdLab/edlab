One major issue we have with STEM education, especially with Engineering, is that there are few students who choose and stick with a STEM major, and again in my opinion, this is especially true with Engineering. One way we can start solving this issue is to introduce the basics of engineering to young students just starting out on their educational career. That's right, let's start introducing kindergarten students to the basic concepts of engineering. Although keep in mind that engineering is not just about the planning and creating of technologies like computers and smartphones, it is also about planning and creating buildings, planes, space shuttles, etc. Most young students already have some experience in engineering when building out of plain wooden building blocks but the strange thing is that the engineering experience for younger student ends there. As they progress through elementary school, there is a lot more focus on math, science, history and other subjects, while engineering is not brought up again until maybe the end of high school, at least in my experience in the New York City public school system. It's important to not only fully introduce engineering to younger students but to include it as a major subject like math, science, history, etc.

<b>Potential for sySTEMic Change:</b> Introducing younger students to engineering will be one way of potentially getting more students to drive off into the STEM education sunset. As aforementioned, plain wooden blocks can be a tool for introducing engineering, but we can also use robotics as well. There are many companies that are coming out with robot kits for younger students to play with and explore building a robot like <b><a href="http://www.hexbug.com/">Hexbug</a></b>. We can show more young students the fun that's involved with the planning and building of robots, and maybe students can try to make their own designs of a robot to help solve a problem in the real world. All in all, I believe that if students have a good first impression of engineering they will try to seek out ways to learn more about it on their own. It's also important to continue the education of engineering throughout the rest of the student's academic career like we do with math and science. Let's keep educating everyone.
