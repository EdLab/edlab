            Hi everyone,

    This is my first blog as an intern for EdLab this summer. Although I am not good at any kind of writing, except writing codes, I will try my best to keep my blog not too bad so that you guys will not fall into sleep while just going through half of it :))

    So this is the last day of my first week at EdLab. There were a lot of things happened in just the last four days, but all of them have one thing in common: they were all awesome! Learning a little bit of Yoga on the first day, one hell of a game show on the second day, ice cream and a sweet farewell party on the third day, etc.  Honestly, I had not expected that there would be so much fun at EdLab like that. Before starting here, I was really intimidating by the fact that EdLab was the first serious job that I had had. It made me so nervous that I even could not sleep the night before my first day here. However, witness how friendly and helpful people here are really help me adapt well into the environment. Thanks so much for all of your helps. Communication is always on of my biggest issue. I rarely talk since I am not good at talking and my English is suck anyway, but I just want you guys know that I am always so grateful for whatever thing that you did for me, even if I could not show my gratefulness through my words. I will try my best to improve my communication skill, although there will be no guarantee that I would be successful though (I have not succeeded to do it in the past two year so... ). Anyway, I am still really happy that I am here, and I am looking forward for a great summer with you guys : )
