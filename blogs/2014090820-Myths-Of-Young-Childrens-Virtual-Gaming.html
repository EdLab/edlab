<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebecca W. Black, Ksenia Korobkova, & Alexandra Epler</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href=" http://ecl.sagepub.com/content/14/2/265.refs">Journal of Early Childhood Literacy</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> How do digital games construct available social roles and promote particular values? What opportunities for identity and self-representation do these sites offer to their target users? </p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> Based on the data collected from a larger study on children’s popular virtual worlds, the authors analyzed and compared the community texts created in two virtual gaming sites: <a href=" http://games.barbiegirls.com/virtualworld/en/ ">Barbie Girls</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xtractaurs">Xtractaurs</a>. They investigated how the two virtual spaces might afford, constrain, and shape the learning opportunities for children’s self-representation and social interaction. Barbie Girls is an online virtual world designed for girls (aged six and up) while Xtractaurs is an online site for boys (aged six and up). Specifically, the authors spent extensive hours using both sites to experience children’s virtual play; they also examined the artifacts, distributed texts, and the designed activities in the two games from a qualitative perspective.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> Both virtual worlds reflect market values and assumptions about young children, positioning them as certain types of consumers and literacy users, and severely constraining their opportunities for creative production of content. The patterns of literacy expression promoted by the two sites are static and monadic rather than fluid and hybrid. The authors further found that children’s acts of meaning making online are limited in certain ways anticipated by commercial game companies and the broader societal discourses on childhood.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> In choosing children’s digital literacy "toys," educators and parents need to be conscious about the anticipated identities set up by manufacturers’ product narratives as well as the subtle messages conveyed by societal expectations in regard to childhood, gender, and sexuality. Often times, children’s in-game literacy expressions are limited, as restricted by choices of pre-written texts and pre-designed character interactions in commercial games. For educational developers, more attention needs to be given to children’s greater freedom of self-representation and more sophisticated forms of literate engagement to expand their learning opportunities in virtual worlds. </p>
