<a href="http://www.inkubate.com/">Inkubate</a> aims to digitize the slush pile with a portfolio-building site for writers. Publishers and agents will subscribe to the service and pay to access portfolio materials from authors. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The site is clean, adorable, and simple to navigate. The focus of the frontpage is a visualization of the connection process echoed in the logo. The site also has many librarian-approved features including snippet-view for manuscripts, a hardcore database search, and “document audit” so subscribers can see the portfolios that have attracted attention from other publishers. There's a lot of information on the site for a beta. The <a href="http://www.inkubate.com/">blog</a> is already pretty substantial and is aimed at attracting authors to the site with user profiles, news, and tips for aspiring writers. 

<b>Cons:</b>
If the model proposed by Inkubate does become the new way publishers and agents connect with writers, it makes me think that selection might suffer. A suite of search tools might facilitate or even necessitate publishers and agents targeting specific book content and remove the serendipitous element from the traditional slush pile. This happens to a certain extent already, else we wouldn't have so many YA vampire novels, but I hope Inkubate has build randomizing features into the subscription-end of their service. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
It's actually a very similar idea to ResearchBroker! It is a space to formalize connections between companies and individuals. However, ResearchBroker is a need-born service. The publishing people reacting to the <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/48952-inkubate-plans-to-digitize-the-slush-pile.html">Publisher's Weekly</a> article about Inkubate were puzzled by its premise. The current structure of submissions doesn't call for a paid subscription author-finding service. On the contrary, publishers are inundated with content from would be authors. They're correct that the discovery structure in publishing is “inefficient, expensive, and decreasingly profitable,” but changing this process will be difficult and slow even with the connections Inkubate has to publishers and established writers. 

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Inkubate is an interesting change to publishing process, whether publishing is ready to be changed remains to be seen.
