          <p>
            The effort and time to help countries struggling with their educational system is very challenging. This kind of issue really demands a lot of time and I believe time has been one of the factors delaying the help that many undeveloped countries need. The World Bank, which has created a lot of projects and funded global education, <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2013/11/07/in-armenia-early-education-assures-brighter-future">has recently helped the Armenian government</a> to create 275 new early education facilities across the small Mediterranean country.  After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, preschools and kindergarten either deteriorated or closed altogether in Armenia. The fact that there were no preschools or kindergartens meant children didn't receive the essential tools or skills they need for future studies.

In a nutshell, I believe that soon many developing countries struggling with their educational systems will receive the necessary help. However, the onus is on the government of these nations to show that it is really in need of the help. Most countries do not spend a lot of money on education nor respond to concerns raised by teachers and staff members. This has led to conclusions by citizens and neutral observers that governments don't care about the nation's education system and future of its citizens. In this case, the Armenian government initialized the project for early education while the World Bank provided the extra hand. Help can be given but the receiver must be prepared to build the foundation.
