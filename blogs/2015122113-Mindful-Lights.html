            <p><b>Mindful Lights: An Aesthetic Response to Our Traditional Lived Environment   </b></p>
<p><i>A new installation fosters reflection in our learning spaces </i></p>

<img src=" http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/DSC00625-1-VVV.JPG" alt="“Mindful" lights" />

<p>Our lived environment quickly becomes an assumption. When we enter a new space for the first time, we approach it with curiosity. Inundated by its novelty, we quickly become attuned to its intricate shapes and unique palette of colors, its acoustic signatures and the scents it emits. In short, we are bombarded by an array of stimuli that leave a unique, non-reproducible, sensory imprint.  </p>

<p>But despite its idiosyncratic combination of characteristics, a new venue quickly assumes a fixed identity. When we return once more, we are too busy with the demands of our lives to revisit the splendor of our initial visit—it’s easier to shift our wandering gaze onto something new. And in a market-driven world where everything is for sale, even our time becomes commodified, just another good to be sold. Silence, tranquility, and the reflective space they silently bequeath us are difficult to rationalize in our hectic lives, their restorative benefits perpetually re-scheduled, pushed away, marked off for a later date that never arrives. A perpetually deferred future is always the better choice for something that pays no immediate dividends. We are stuck in limbo, a world of constant now. A gentle pause becomes an afterthought, even an impossibility. Quiet moments of redemptive solitude are the unfortunate victims to a life that is always in motion.  </p>

<p><i><a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/zkl/the-minds-behind-mindful-lights/">Mindful Lights</a></i>, an installation conceived and produced by a highly talented team of thoughtful artists and designers at EdLab, aims to change this regrettable state of affairs. Realized in part as a prototype for Gottesman Library’s soon-to-open Learning Theater, this new artistic project incorporates a series of sensors embedded within a variety of light fixtures to respond to its surrounding learning environment. As library patrons pass, sensors imperceptibly fire. The lighting scheme gently shifts and echoes, ebbs and flows, mimicking the movement in front of it. You live your light. </p>

<p>Traditional lighting schemes are predominantly binary affairs—on/off— with little variation between full brilliant luminance and absolute darkness. Mindful Lights attempts to inhabit the space within these extremes. It creates something more adjustable, conditional, and most importantly, human. <i>Mindful Lights</i> is incredibly effective in its invitational quality. It’s colors are bright and friendly, neither blinding nor gaudy. They are present, not omnipresent, shimmering not shocking. In sum, <i>Mindful Lights</i> succeeds both as an art exhibit on its own but also as a provocation for broader questions regarding our built environment. </p>

<p>How did we settle on current conventions regarding the interiors where we reside? Why are the elements making up this environment so uniform, staid, and static? How can we reconfigure the elements residing in our sensory plane, refashioning them into something other than a direct reflection of our collective past? What is the subtext that our built environment represents—something that is difficult to define despite its omnipresence, a constant companion that still remains foreign and unresponsive despite its familiarity? Can we redesign our environment to reflect our humanity that isn’t a direct outcome of our deliberate choice? In sum, can we create a dynamic lived spaces that responds to who we are, how we are, and what we are, without conscious thought or volition—an imperceptible, immersive, constantly negotiable built environment? </p>

<p>Human beings are inherently collaborative but beholden to the most popular means of communication. Artistic initiatives like <i>Mindful Lights</i> ask us to engage in a more in-depth relationship with the world around us, extending the periphery of our current communicative modes. In an era of heightened awareness of dangers beyond our individual control—like climate change—perhaps we should pay greater attention to the environment that immediately surrounds us. <i>Mindful Lights</i> invites us to begin doing just that. </p>

<p><i>Mindful Lights is currently on display at Teachers College’s Gottesman Library.</i></p>
