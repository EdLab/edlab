          <p>
            This summary is taken directly from the <a href="http://imhe.blogspot.com/2008/03/recruiting-through-social-networks.html">Interactive Media for Higher Education</a> blog. <br>

For those of you unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.zinch.com/">Zinch</a>, it is a social network created by a few innovative undergraduate students who were frustrated with the current admissions search process that starts with the typecasting based on ACT/SAT test scores. Instead, they wanted to empower the prospective student by giving him/her an electronic avenue to display "more than a test score." The result is a social network that works as an intermediary between prospective students and colleges. Prospective students can create an account and colleges can "shop" for students based on self-identified student information (demographic, geographic, etc...).

To date, Zinch boasts:

<li>More than 475 colleges currently recruiting <li>More than 300,000 high school students have already created Zinch profiles.
<li>All 50 states, more than 160 countries, and over 19,000 high schools are represented by students currently on Zinch.</li><br>

The idea behind Zinch is to create more qualified leads. Test purchases are a crap-shoot at best, but are really the most efficient mass-option at this point for lead generation. Tools like Zinch will slowly chip away at the test-score model as will demographic ads by Facebook and MySpace. Social Networks (whether directly like Zinch, or indirectly like Facebook and MySpace) are starting to level the playing field. Expect to see some more services pop up over the next few years, as well as new ways to leverage current services.
