            <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~msu2101/Macleod-Urquiola(2009).pdf">Macleod, W. Bentley & Urquiola, Miguel. (June 2009) NBER Working Paper No. 15112</a>

While this is merely a working paper that has not been fully published in a recognized academic journal, I found this paper to be particularly intriguing because it clearly explains one of the market failures that make education a difficult good to deliver from the private sector. While it's easy to point out how market failures occur with respect to the environment (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externalities</a>) or infrastructure (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good">public goods</a>), in education it is much more difficult. For that reason, many conservatives say education is just like any other good and can be delivered efficiently by the market. Yet when we look at experiments into school choice and privatization of education, as was the case in Chile and certain European countries, the results are no better than what the public education model has to offer. In American culture, there is an existing belief that private schools are inherently better. Yet if we correct for income and the fact that private schools often cherry pick the best, the results are not so flattering.

Macleod and Urquiola's main argument is that a free market for education cannot work as efficiently as free-marketeers would lead you to believe because of the existing information asymmetries. One example of an information asymmetry is the case of lemons in used-car sales. Suppose you are a consumer looking for a used-car. There are two owners seeking to sell their cars to you. Owner 1 knows his car is in great condition and values his car at $800. On the other hand, Owner 2 owns a lemon, and only he knows it's a lemon; he values his car at $200. If you are only able to observe certain features of the cars and cannot distinguish the lemon from the genuinely sound car, you will simply look for the best deal possible. Owner 2, knowing that his car is much worse than Owner 2's car, will seek to accept the highest bid that Owner 1 will not accept. Thus, Owner 2 will get the deal and you will pay $799 for a $200 car; talk about welfare-maximizing car. This problem is known as adverse selection, where the seller has a significant informational advantage over the buyer. 

<b>Description:</b>
Consider the lemon problem in the educational context, where the quality of the buyers, the students, is more significant than the quality of the sellers of the product itself, the schools. Macleod and Urquiola write, "the perceived quality of a school depends upon the quality of the buyers who purchase its services, resulting in a tendency for selective schools to drive non-selective ones from the market." As a result, "What makes education unique is that the industry's output (student achievement) depends upon both ï¬rm (school) productivity and buyer (student) eï¬€ort." When school value-added is largely unobservable but school reputation pushes high-quality students to the most highly reputed schools, high reputation schools win out in the market, even if they might actually be low value-added. If there was a way to identify highly productive schools independent of the quality of students, the information asymmetry would no longer exist. But because schools are place at an informational advantage and school value added is less observable than student achievement and quality, there is no opportunity for highly productive schools to enter the education marketplace.

One of the basic phenomena this model reflects is the reconciliation of school preference among students and families with the failure of school choice. It  implies that high quality students choose high reputation schools for self-fulfilling reasons. Thus, making school choice only works if schools are educating the same quality of students or if schools' value-added is easily identifiable.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
There is obviously a need for better information and observation of the education sector in ways that do not interfere with learning. Using technology to better observe how much impact a school really has on student performance is a key mission of EdLab. Ultimately, as more learning shifts online at all reputation levels, it will be interesting to see how online educational resources accurately track student performance.
