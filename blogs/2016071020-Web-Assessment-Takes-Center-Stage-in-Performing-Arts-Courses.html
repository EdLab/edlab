<p>A new study examined peer assessment on the web to improve learning in one of the most ambiguous subjects: the arts. It compared learning via web-based peer assessment with learning by web video. Teachers presented Chinese folk stories that inspired students to create scripts, modern dance, and music in a performing arts class. Practice was videotaped and some students learned the performances by watching the videos, while others learned with videos and peer assessment data like ratings and comments. </p>
 
<p>The study found that peer assessment via the web significantly improved student motivation, performance, satisfaction, and self-efficacy. In another positive development, the results from student peer assessment ratings were highly correlated with teacher ratings, enhancing confidence in their validity. Student peer assessment ratings were also related to student efforts to improve their own work. So it seems that students take assessment from their classmates seriously. More responsibility to help their peers learn appears to make students more engaged. </p>
 
<p>This study is important because it provides a promising new assessment tool for the arts. By providing assessment for something as ambiguous as the performing arts, it helps students develop metacognitive skills regarding their own learning and higher order evaluative thinking. </p>
