Laine Powell is the founder and executive director of <a href="http://techsassygirlz.org/">Tech Sassy Girlz</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to changing the lives of girls in middle and high school by engaging them in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Tech Sassy Girlz develops the next generation of STEM-savvy, college-bound girls through college preparation, career readiness, mentoring, and entrepreneurship. Powell created the organization in 2012 to address the critical shortage of women and minorities in high-tech STEM careers. She has been recognized as an Orlando Magic Community Champion and has also received the Women in Transportation Rosa Parks Diversity Leadership Award, the Daily Points of Light Award, the National Philanthropy Day Diversity and Inclusion Award, and a host of other community and professional awards. Powell holds a BA in English from the University of Florida, an MEd from the Pennsylvania State University, and an MS in Management from the University of Central Florida. She is currently working on her doctorate in Instructional Technology and Distance Education.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Tech Sassy Girlz?</b><br> 
<p>During my freshman year at the University of Florida, I developed a love for computers. It began when my eldest brother, Israel, a management information systems graduate, built me my first computer. I was fascinated by the process and intrigued by how he assembled the components. While at UF, I also met my future husband, Courtney. He was a computer and electrical engineering major. After we both graduated, Courtney started working for an engineering firm while I continued on to graduate school. I would frequently attend corporate engineering events with him and noticed that there were not many women at these events or in the engineering field, especially women of color. </p>
 
<p>Later, as I began my own professional career, and as a self-taught computer techie, I knew that it was important to see more women represented in the tech and engineering fields. Drawing upon my own background and education, I recognized that to make a change with impact, efforts to generate interest in STEM needed to concentrate on early intervention and mentoring starting in middle and high school. </p>
 
<p><b>How has the response been to Tech Sassy Girlz from participants and their families?</b><br> 
<p>The response from participants and their families is overwhelming. Our students are mostly African American and Hispanic girls from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Their parents are generous with their time and ensure that their daughters are active participants.</p>
 
<p>Additionally, Tech Sassy Girlz, now in its 7th year, has impacted the lives of more than 800 girls. Our volunteers have donated more than 1,000 hours to the program and we have given more than $20,000 in scholarships for students to pursue their STEM degrees at colleges and universities.</p>
 
<p>Our informal learning programs, Tech Sassy Girlz Code (TSG Code) and Pearls in Tech, address the need to train more girls in STEM. TSG Code, an after-school program, is an experiential,
project-based learning program designed to teach girls about computer science and technical skills. Our newest initiative, Pearls in Tech, is designed to equip female students in high school with 21st century digital and technical skills to prepare them for internship and career opportunities in tech. Additionally, we host events such as our annual conference, which provides an opportunity for over 150 girls to code, increase their STEM awareness, learn about STEM careers, and network with women who are industry leaders.</p>
 
<p>My passion is empowering girls to become the best versions of themselves and providing access to opportunities that these girls might not otherwise have. Tech Sassy Girlz is building the future workforce and moving the needle in STEM. </p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>From a super young age, this generation knows how to use, navigate, and leverage technology. As we think about the future of learning, we have to transform our learning spaces to adapt to how students access, absorb, and process information. Game-based, project-based, and skills-based learning plays a large role in the work that we do. We have seen first-hand how gamification can motivate students to pursue a goal, ask more questions, and problem-solve. Some of our students then use those critical thinking skills to determine how to make a game personalized, better, and more efficient. Gamification also provides real-time feedback and can certainly help students improve in areas in which they are not the strongest.</p>
 
<p>The majority of our work is project-based learning to mirror what typically happens in industry. Teams are formed, ideas are presented, and each member has a specific role to play to creatively solve a problem. This collaborative approach ensures that the girls have an opportunity to work in teams, serve in various leadership capacities, and effectively communicate to arrive at a solution. Skills-based learning is also becoming more relevant as some large companies no longer require a degree for certain tech jobs due to the high demand for STEM employees. While the college degree remains relevant, alternative routes to acquire technical skills are increasingly accepted by companies.</p>
 
<p>TSG Code and Pearls in Tech emphasizes these broad trends to prepare our girls for 21st century jobs.</p>
 
<p><b>What, if any, are future plans for Tech Sassy Girlz?</b><br>
<p>We want to expand our reach and to create even more opportunities for the marginalized communities we serve. We will continue to be intentional about intersectionality and increasing opportunities for women of color in STEM. Our future plans include opening a makerspace for girls, speaking more on how we engage girls in STEM, and expanding Tech Sassy Girlz in Florida.</p>
