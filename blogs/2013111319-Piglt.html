<p>Despite increased media attention to the student loan debt crisis, students still face significant financial obstacles to pursuing the education they want and establishing realistic repayment plans. <a href="http://www.piglt.com">Piglt</a> gives students a creative solution for paying for school by applying the popular crowdfunding model to education. Much like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGogo</a>, Piglt enables users to create campaigns, set funding goals, tell their stories, and offer incentives and support for their investors.</p>

<p>Hoping to inspire users to invest in their passions, Piglt divides them into dreamers and believers: individuals, groups, and organizations who are working towards something big and those who share similar goals. While dreamers can’t offer the return on investment typical to crowdfunding sites, Piglt encourage them to creatively offer their talents in a personalized way. The site is geared less toward investors looking for a capital return and more toward empathetic donors wanting to make meaningful connections.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>In many ways this is less risky for investors. There is no guarantee that a new startup or project will reach their production stage even with adequate resources. In this model, the recipient has already graduated with their degree, so every amount helps reduce the cost of debt faster. All money is sent directly to the specified institution, whether that’s a private university or a pilates studio, assuaging concerns about misuse of funds. Dreamers who are enrolling in school must start a tuition campaign and are required to raise the full amount of tuition including site fees, eliminating risk for all parties.</p>

<p>Outside of the startup world, crowdfunding is still a relatively new concept for many, especially in education. Piglt’s introductory video clearly explains this model and places an emphasis on creative presentations and exchanges. Setting up an account and uploading a video are simple processes with helpful instructions along the way, including a succinct FAQ, guidelines for campaigns and incentives, and instructions for non-profits. The platform supports financing goals across diverse subjects including architecture, fashion, food, music and more.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site is currently in beta and there aren’t many live campaigns or active investors. It is not clear how many investors will be interested in contributing to students, but it may be difficult for early adopters to reach their campaign goals until the site attracts more attention. Either way, because raising money and then transferring payments from investors to loan holders can take time, it wouldn’t be prudent for students to rely on crowdfunding as the primary method of financing their education.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Among its other benefits to students and investors, Piglt could be an appealing way for alumni to donate to their alma mater. Without specifying uses for contributions, alumni may not always see the impact of their money. This platform has the potential to strengthen network connections and demonstrate the immediate and positive impact of gifts.</p>

<p>Whether Piglt is successful or not, it represents a well-executed attempt to address the student loan crisis creatively by rewarding talented students for pursuing their passions. It will be interesting to see if similar platforms follow.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Piglt is a creative solution for funding education that enables people with similar passions to share resources and talents.</p>
