<b>Title:</b> The Team Vs. The Individual: Login Activity As A Predictor Of Web-Based Simulation Team Success (2012) 
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> B. Kilburn, & A. Kilburn
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b>
<i>Three heads are better than one.</i> Numerous studies have demonstrated that student groups, in their ability to introduce and utilize a diverse understanding of material, are more productive than individuals working alone. This indicates that <i>group size</i> can be a good predictor of students’ success. There are, however, some natural follow up questions: How do students get involved in the group? Do they contribute evenly to the group’s success? And what is the impact of differential participation on individual learning?
<p>

In the Academy of Educational Leadership journal, Brandon and Ashley Kilburn have published a study designed to find out whether individual or group characteristics matter more for group performance.  To do so, the authors examined the (simulated) financial performance of business school students working on the Capstone Business Simulation system, using login activity as a measure of individual and group involvement.
<p>

<b>Findings:</b> Data analysis revealed that while each individual’s login activity is a significant predictor of group performance, the average of the logins of the whole group taken together is not. This suggests that some students were logging in much more often than others; groups were collections of over and under-achievers. Therefore, in figuring out how to make groups productive, more attention should be paid to identify the <i>key</i> individuals, rather than the average quality of the group. 
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
Studies like this one should motivate educators to expand their research questions to discover whether there is a generic set of predictors of group success. If yes, how can teachers better adapt their pedagogical methods to maximize such success? And how can group success facilitate student learning?
<p>
In recent years, we have generated an unprecedented amount of data on students that should allow educators not only to dissect the effectiveness of students’ learning activities, but also to predict and make appropriate adjustments to their learning settings. <i>Learning Analytics</i> & <i>Predictive Analysis</i> research are now widely and rapidly expanding to understand and supporting learning, and a variety of data-mining techniques (machine learning, modeling, statistical techniques etc.) are beginning to be brought to bear. To answer the questions raised here, more rigorous studies and engagement of educators are required.
