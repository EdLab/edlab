Sometimes the best way to teach children road safety is to get them behind the wheel. That's the philosophy behind <a href="https://www.brookhavenny.gov/Departments/Highway-Department/Wildlife-Ecology-Center/Safety-Town">Safety Town </a>; Brookhaven, Long Island's own miniature village where students can learn bike, car, and pedestrian safety first hand. An initiative of the Highway Department, the Safety Town in Brookhaven is not the first of its kind but rather modeled after Nassau County's Safety Town in Eisenhower Park.  A ten-year analysis of bike accidents showed that students who had received training at the original Safety Town were ten times less likely to be involved in a bike accident than those who did not. </p>

<p>Today, children as young as third grade make their way to Brookhaven for school field trips and summer camps to learn the rules of the road. Children spend the first segment of their visit getting familiar with the signs and signals they'll find out in the real world as well as best practices for crossing the street and proper helmet fit before hitting the road. Students then traverse tunnels, hills, crosswalks, and railroad crossings in the tiny town employing the safety tips and techniques they gained in the classroom. As the potential hazards that face bikers, drivers, and pedestrians evolve over time, Safety Town will continue to provide exceptional education for all ages.</p>
