Shaik Naushad is the CEO and Founder of <a href="https://www.rymm.com/">RyMM Education</a>, a parent-teacher relationship management system that provides parents with access to their child’s data. At age 19, he founded STEAMICON Infotech, a company that specialized in providing web-based solutions for education problems. Programming and education have been Naushad’s interests since his childhood and have inspired him to create RyMM Education. Naushad is currently in Chile launching RyMM Education service for schools there.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role at RyMM Education?</b><br>
<p>I began my first startup during my second year in college, when I developed web and software solutions for education institutions in India. This platform gave me an initial window to interact with educators and school directors. After working for two years and interacting with educators, I realized that teachers and parents are two strong foundations for K-12 students to achieve their best in academic and non-academic activities. But these foundations are not strong enough unless there is a firm collaboration between teachers and parents. Most of the conversations between teachers and parents happen only when kids are not doing well. This is not a healthy environment for a student to grow. In fact, teachers and parents should interact more when kids are doing okay in class, boosting their confidence in doing much better in academic and nonacademic activities.</p>
 
<p>Taking this as a lesson, I started working on RyMM Education to project this relationship on a digital platform, helping parents and teachers support each other for the betterment of kids.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at RyMM Education will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Changing or revolutionizing the learning landscape of a student is a big term for us to use at this stage, but we are working to improve the K-12 student learning environment. When parents and teachers work together it sends a clear, consistent, and positive message to students that school is important, that learning is important and that achievement is expected. We are also working to create the best possible collaboration platform to support this quote.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I firmly believe in practical knowledge over that of theoretical concepts. It’s a fact to accept that the content knowledge achieved from a video lasts longer than that of the knowledge achieved from textbooks. Virtual representation of subject lessons will create a broad change in how students absorb the content. This virtual representation could range from an animated video or through upcoming VR and AR technologies.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at RyMM Education, what are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>With a team of six people, RyMM Education has all my focus. I see that with the rise of messaging platforms, the transparency between teachers and parents has declined to a minimal level. This is good for parents to know how their child is doing in school. But the fact is parents should also be in a position to help their children at home and prepare for school the next day. To make that a possibility and more than a communication platform, teachers and parents need a collaboration platform where they can support each other for the child’s development. And at RyMM Education, we are working to build the best collaboration platform where teachers can support parents and parents can support other parents. Parents can support class teachers for the betterment of student progress in academic and non-academic activities.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>Twitter has been a dear friend of mine in gathering teacher’s opinion from different countries and shape our vision towards RyMM Education. There are some impressive twitter teachers who I follow such as <a href="https://twitter.com/mrkempnz">Craig Kemp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Angela_Watson">Angela Watson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coolcatteacher">Vicki Davis</a>.</p>
