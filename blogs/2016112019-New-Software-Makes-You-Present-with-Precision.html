<p>My public speaking professor was an eloquent instructor, and in a room of over 100 students, he projected perfectly to the crowd. Each of us paid thousands of dollars per credit in hopes we would all speak with the same confidence, power, and authority he had. For many of us that never happened and that experience was the public speaking course of the past. The future looks much different because of technology like <a href="http://www.t3interactive.com">T3 Interactive</a>, a digital public speaking coach that uses motion sensing technology to personalize speaking practice.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>T3 Interactive was developed in 2013 and is receiving an investor boost through the <a href="http://www.dreamit.com/dreamit/#welcome">DreamIT Incubator</a>. This fully comprehensive digital public speaking coach uses Kinect sensors from Microsoft software in combination with a personalized algorithm to assess, score, and provide feedback to individuals looking to build their presentation skills. While demoing the product, I was impressed by the detail that went into the presentation assessment. It monitors your eye contact, posture, gestures, tone, volume, word usage, and pauses. The data is then presented numerically and visually so professors, students, or others interested in improving their public speaking skills can easily interpret scores and receive the solid feedback provided by the software. For example, I found out, to my surprise, that my gestures made me appear closed off to my audience and that opening my arms more while speaking would make me appear more welcoming.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>The Presenter software is not intuitive; you must practice learning how to operate, implement, and interpret results effectively as there is some insider jargon used in the assessment. The terminology can be clarified with icons and video tutorials to supplement the text. In addition, it is important for the software to not only <i>identify</i> things that are wrong but also to <i>state why</i> it is wrong, as many people might not understand why it is problematic to cross your arms while giving a speech. It is also important for the user to be hyper-aware of the placement of the sensor because it does not read gestures accurately from angles, which can lead to data reliability issues.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p> Overall, I do believe I learned more about presenting from the Presenter software demo than I did in my $3000+ college course. Though the product is still going through upgrades, the design is precise and they have promising new features to look forward to, including the ability to learn to present in particular styles like Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton. Presentation skills have always been essential for work and education which is why I look forward to using the product again.</p>
