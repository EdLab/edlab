          <p>
            I came across this journal called <i>Open Journal per la Formazione in Pete
</i> in which a recent article about video annotation tools studied Vialogues. <b><a href="http://formare.erickson.it/wordpress/it/2012/la-video-annotazione-per-osservare-e-riflettere/" target="_blank">Here is the link</a></b> to the original article.

I don't read Italian but I got a general sense about its idea through the help of Google Translate. Below is the Google Translation on the paragraph about Vialogues:

(Joann, is the translation doing alright?)

<blockquote>

Observe, discuss and study Vialogues

Even Vialogues (8), as videoANT, provides the option of anchoring comments to specific moments of scrolling of a video. Vialogues is distinguished by its emphasis on the concept of discussion within a group. The comments are displayed attributes to the nickname of the person who posted them and may, in turn, be commented on by other users. The dialogic sequences that develop the vision of the videos are presented in an indented in the typical shape of the web forum. The discussion, based on the choices made by the person who activates the "vialogues" (dialogue on video), can be private or reserved for a group of people invited, or public and open to anyone who has registered with the site. The system, developed by the Teachers College of Columbia University, is presented as a tool for discussion on video not aimed at a specific purpose (not only available to teachers, lecturers and tutors, but also artists, athletes, politicians and ordinary citizens) . Some functions, such as allowing those who open dialogue to drive looking through the inclusion of questions or multiple-choice questions, however, reveal a clear focus to use in educational contexts. Inserted in the course of the video of verification allows the teacher to assess understanding and observational skills of each student, as well as to manage, through feedback, the process of confirming or appropriate corrective elements or integration.
