          <p>
            For the past decade, South Asian countries have made an effort in expanding access to schooling. However, a recent <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/06/30/how-to-fix-poor-quality-education-in-south-asia?hootPostID=d4a814db1e2672a43089bb418a704008" target = "blank">report</a>  from the World Bank indicate that a lack of quality education is holding the region back. Due to a lack of inadequate school resources, students are not performing at their very best. For instance, up to one-third of students who complete primary school lack basic numeracy and literacy skills. Not only that, nearly 13 million children, ages 8 to 14 years, remain out of school in the region. After all, teachers who barely know more than their students are teaching in rural schools.
<p>
Improving student learning is a difficult task because of different factors such as student background. Challenges faced by the region alone makes the task of improving student learning outcomes more complex. For example, most countries in the region have conflict-affected areas and thus learning remains a extremely challenging. In their report, the World Bank made recommendations on how to improve student learning and establish a better education system. 
<p>
These include making learning outcomes the central goal of education policy, investing in early childhood nutrition, and improving teacher effectiveness and accountability. I believe if these ideas are implemented and followed, the education quality in South Asia can improve.
