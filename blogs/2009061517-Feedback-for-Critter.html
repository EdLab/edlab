          <p>
            When I first started using Critter, I wasn't sure what to do. However, the "Help" tab was very informative and helpful. I find the concept of the Critter tool really cool and useful. The video and sound were both of high quality. It was fun to be able to watch a video and create a discussion about my thoughts on it.

Unfortunately, when I tried to create a discussion on one of the videos, I was unable to do so. The error message that popped up just said that I was unable to start a discussion, and asked me to click 'ok.' This was not helpful to me because I had no idea why it wouldn't let me start a discussion. It was only after I asked for someone for help that I realized that I needed to create an account and sign in before I could do anything except watch videos. It would have been helpful if there had been more of an explanation when the error message popped up.

Overall, I liked the interface for creating groups. It was intuitive to use, and it was really easy to add and remove participants from groups. However, since I was prompted to hit 'create group' after I entered in the name and description, I wasn't sure if it was saving the members I added and removed, since there was no button for me to push after doing so. I was afraid that when I left the groups page, the new members I had added were not going to be saved there. Furthermore, I disliked that I could not change the name or description of the group after I created it. For example, if I had misspelled a word, it would be impossible for me to change it. Also, what if I created a really large group, then decided that a different name or description would be more appropriate?

When I created a discussion, it was disruptive to me that it interrupted the video clip I was watching. It caught me by surprise. Furthermore, since there was no interruption when I posted a comment, I'm not sure why the interruption was necessary when I created a discussion. However, if this interruption is necessary, perhaps it would be helpful to have a warning that posting to the discussion will restart the video.

After creating a new discussion, I went to the 'manage discussion participants' section under the users and groups tab. However, I was not able to add participants to the discussion because it did not show up in the 'select discussion' box. This happened with all of the test discussions I created. I even tried logging out and logging back in to see if it would refresh, but that did not correct the problem.

I wasn't sure why I had to create a description of the discussion I started. I thought the description would show up for everyone to see (perhaps as the first comment), and I was confused when it did not show up anywhere. I had used the description to ask the question that I wanted to be answered/discussed, but that isn't useful right now. It seems superfluous to me that the person who originates the discussion also has to make the first comment in order to explain what the discussion is supposes to entail. I'm wondering if it is just a bug I'm experiencing...

The UI for leaving a comment was a little confusing to me at first. Since the comment box is independent of the discussion tabs, I wasn't sure where the comment would show up. I thought that it might create a comment directly under the video where it was located, but when I did not see a comment section under the discussion tabs, I was able to figure it out.

I love the idea of the thumbs up for recommendations. However, I encountered a situation that seemed to render it useless. I was able to hit the thumbs up multiple time. I could not do it in a row, but if I navigated away from the discussion to another page on the website, then back to the discussion, I was able to leave a thumbs up again. I didn't even have to log out and in again to do so. I think the recommendations feature is helpful in allowing participants to see how many of the other participants find a comment useful. However, it would not be helpful to me as a participant if people were allowed to vote more than once.

I also think it was a great idea to sync a comment with the video. However, I wasn't aware of this feature until I started wondering what the numbers next to my comments meant. When I deduced that they corresponded to the seconds into the video at which I posted the comment, I specifically posted two comments at different points in a video in order to verify this. It was only then that I read through the help section again and saw a small paragraph at the very end about this feature. This is an amazing feature, and I think it requires more prominence and a better explanation. For example, I could not tell from the explanation in the help section that clicking on a comment would actually make the video start playing from that point. I only discovered it because I thought it would be cool if it did so, and I wanted to test it out. I was happily surprised when it worked! 

That's all for now. I hope my feedback is helpful. I think Critter can be an amazing tool with a little refinement!
