<p>In an increasingly crowded marketplace of online classes, <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> stands out as an online front-end development course that pairs students with individual mentors as well as an employer network. Unlike MOOCs, with hundreds (or thousands) of enrollees and fewer opportunities for interaction with the instructor, Thinkful allows students to work directly with industry experts through one-on-one online mentorships. The curriculum is specifically customized to a student’s existing skills and future career needs. In an industry with a very <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/04/why-do-students-enroll-in-but-dont-complete-mooc-courses/">low retention rate</a> (9 out of 10 MOOC students don’t finish their course), this focus on individualization and engagement might incentivize students to stick around longer. And because it is career-focused, Thinkful connects graduates to its employer network of 50 tech companies seeking to hire new developers. This will likely attract professionals seeking new practical skills or making mid-career changes.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Aimed at professionals who want to add coding to their skill sets, Thinkful offers relatively cheap classes at $900 and allows students to work at their own pace over a three month period with a typical time commitment of 7-10 hours per week. They currently boast eight course topics, including design fundamentals, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site layout is clear and easily navigable. After a prompt to sign up via email, a four-unit syllabus is sent that outlines languages covered, project expectations, selected resources (CodeSchool, Codecademy, and Coursera) as well as a portfolio of previous student work. The site also features bios from Thinkful mentors, a seasoned group of front end developers and technologists, and offers a glimpse at some well-known members of their employer network, such as Warby Parker, ebay, okcupid, and CollegeHumor.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Thinkful is competing in a rapidly growing industry with an expanding variety of offerings – every day  Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and edX are adding classes and partnerships -- and might have difficulty standing out amongst competitors. If it were to attract a "massive" student population, its model may be difficult to scale due to the focus on individualization.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The successes and failures of online courses are still being evaluated in a media environment prone to excitement and hype, but Thinkful is a worthwhile venture in that it provides individualized classes to a niche group in the context of professional development.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Thinkful is an affordable option for new developers who want to expand their skills and professional contacts.</p>
