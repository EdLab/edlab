<p><b>Title:</b> Facts or Friends? Distinguishing Informational and Conversational Questions in Social Q&A Sites (2009)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> 	F. Maxwell Harper, Daniel Moy, & Joseph A. Konstan</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518819">SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
How do informational and conversational questions differ in terms of writing quality and archival value? What are the structural differences between conversational questions and informational questions?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Question and answer sites like <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a>, <a href="http://www.answerbag.com/">Answerbag</a>, and <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask MetaFilter</a> offer a platform for users to ask questions on any topic and receive answers from the community. These questions and answers are also meant to be valuable in search results, offering a natural language resource for future users with similar inquiries. However, conversational questioning seems less valuable than informational questioning as an archival resource. The authors sought to determine whether humans could differentiate between conversational and informational style questions in question and answer site data, investigated the qualities of different styles of questions, and explored the use of machine learning techniques to automatically classify questions as conversational or informational.</p> 

<p>The authors obtained data from 1 million users, 4 million questions, and 24 million answers through Yahoo! Answers web API. The Yahoo! Answers community asked an average of 88,122 questions per day during the period of data collection. Data was also obtained from 6 months of user activity on Answerbag. This data set provided the authors with a user-rated "interestingness" metric and relevantly longer lifespan compared to Yahoo! Answers. Finally, the authors also collected 2 years of data from Ask MetaFilter. This was the smallest data set, consisting of an average of 56 questions per day during the collection period. The low frequency of questioning might be due to the fee that the site charges users, but the rate of answers is the highest among the three sites examined: 99.7% of questions had at least one answer.</p> 

<p>The authors designed an online coding tool to help human volunteers evaluate questions for type and quality. A conversational question (i.e. "Do you like Miley Cyrus?") would inspire discussion, but users searching for information probably would not find it helpful. Human coders were given a brief tutorial to help them distinguish between informational and conversational questions and then shown questions from site data without links to the site or answers to the question. After the question was classified as informational or conversational, coders were asked to rate the writing quality and archival value on a Likert scale. 30 people participated as coders, submitting a total of 1,106 evaluations across a set of 490 questions.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results demonstrated that humans are able to distinguish between conversational and informational questions. By analyzing the question types by site, the authors also discovered that conversational questions were a significant negative predictor for writing quality and archival value. Even with high quality answers, it is very unlikely that conversational questions will provide long term value for information seekers. The machine learning classifiers created by the authors correctly identified 79% of conversational content and 95% of informational content for an overall accuracy of 89.7%.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The production of an automatic system for correctly identifying conversational and informational questions bodes well for online learning systems and new question and answer site features. These tools could be used to autosuggest question improvements and help educators more accurately anticipate and moderate discussions. The data gathered, especially on the Yahoo! Answers platform, suggests that content creation is becoming more common on Q&A sites and low-cost methods for improving the quality of this content will help discussion sites reach their full potential as resources. Further research and innovative techniques will help improve the identification and harvesting of archival-quality user contributed content.</p>
