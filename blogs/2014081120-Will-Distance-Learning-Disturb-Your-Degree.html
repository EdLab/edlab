<p><b>Title:</b> Does Online Learning Impede Degree Completion? A National Study of Community College Students (2014)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Shea & Terni Bidjerano</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131514000438">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do online courses or distance learning at community colleges lead to lower rates of degree completion?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The study examines <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/bps/">national data</a> in order to assess the role distance education plays in the education of community college students.  The Beginning Postsecondary Student Survey (BPS) collected data from approximately 16,100 beginning, first-time students at three points in time: the spring of 2004, 2006, and 2009. An initial tabulation of BPS data indicates that students taking some online courses complete degrees at higher rates, but this tabulation does not account for other factors. The current study took steps to control for initial differences between the groups by controlling 40 covariates, including school and work experiences and socio-demographic characteristics. Researchers then created matched sample groups using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching">propensity score</a> analysis in order to mimic randomization in experimental design.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results compared highest degree attained (certificate, associate, and bachelorâ€™s) to "no degree" as an outcome. Many variables contributed significantly to the prediction of degree attainment, including the number of interruptions in continuous enrollment, longevity of full-time enrollment, and students whose goals were to earn a certificate. Yet even with the inclusion of the controls, there was a significant difference between groups, and students who participated in some online/distance courses were 1.25 times as likely to attain a credential.</p>

<p>As for other notable findings, the researchers did not find that students who participated in online/distance education were better prepared academically; the online/distance education students were about the same or maybe less well prepared than their classroom-only counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> One question for future research is whether students who take online courses early in their careers continue to do so; previous <a href="http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-learning-virginia.html">state-level results</a> suggest that online course enrollments increase across the four-year period of study, but evidence at the national level does not yet exist. Furthermore, Shea & Bidjerano describe online/distance learning as a form of adaptation to the needs of non-traditional students, and they provide empirical evidence that this adaptation may offer a pathway to degree attainment. More research is needed to explore other kinds of adaptations, in order for higher education institutions to produce better outcomes. </p>
