<p><i>"E-180 stems from the hard-held belief that all humans possess the power to develop their full potential autonomously, with a little help from their community. We believe that education is a relationship, not an institution, and that one hour of our time may change another person’s life."</i> (<a href="https://www.e-180.com/about/mission">About E-180</a>)</p>
 
<p><b>A New Type of Dating</b></p>

<p>There are dating apps that cater to every demographic (see <a href="https://www.farmersonly.com">Farmers Meet</a> and <a href="https://www.tallfriends.com">Tall Friends</a> for some of the <i>less</i> weird examples). So it shouldn't come as a surprise that a startup has created a matchmaking website that replaces small talk with wisdom sharing. The company, called <a href="https://www.e-180.com">E-180</a>, creates a spark between users by forging knowledge connections, one area of interest at a time. Using matchmaking technology to connect participants, E-180 calls their service "brain dating for learning humans." Their mission is to connect like-minded people interested in sharing knowledge in person. Essentially, it uses technology to bring humanity back to interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p>Similar to members of traditional dating websites, E-180 participants create a profile detailing their interests, including what skills they’d like to learn or teach. Though the website mainly attracts people who seek to share traveling or business advice, skilled cooks, language experts, and outdoor adventurers can also be found. Participants propose meetups in nearby locations to get the knowledge flowing. So far, the website has around 6,000 users throughout Canada, the United States, and Europe.</p>

<p><b>Making an Educator of Everyone</b></p>
 
<p>Whether you want to learn Photoshop, French, or slacklining, E-180 wants to connect you with someone who wants to teach it. E-180 operates under the belief that if people had more opportunities to share their knowledge with others, the world would be a more innovative and connected place. Instead of limiting themselves to information transmitted in the classroom, people can use E-180 to access a wealth of human knowledge from within their own communities.</p>
