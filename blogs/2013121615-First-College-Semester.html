          <p>
            I recently completed my first semester at Sage College of Albany. The semester did not start as I had planned. Unfortunately, I became very ill during late summer though I was able to recover with a clean bill of health during the early days of the semester. I was also recruited to play collegiate soccer for Sage and during one of the first few practice sessions, I was seriously injured and ruled out for the season. Though I was initially upset and frustrated by the injury setback, it allowed me to focus more on my academics and enjoy the college experience. 

I had a chance to meet new friends and I enjoyed most of my classes. The only difficult class was my science. Through the help of classmates, teachers and tutors, I was able to gradually improve in that class. Overall, it has been an interesting and encouraging start to college life. It has reaffirmed my belief in the importance of obtaining a higher education degree. I am still debating majors as I have various personal and academic interests. Will keep you posted on that end.
