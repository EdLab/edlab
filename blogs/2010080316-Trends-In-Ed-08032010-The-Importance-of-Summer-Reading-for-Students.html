            The summer is often a time for students to indulge in some of life's pleasures: ice cream, amusement parks, swimming pool, and playing in the sand at their local beach. However, one activity that students seldom engage during their summers is reading. According to the advocacy group, National Summer Learning Association, different studies have shown that during summers, reading and spelling skills often drop among students, especially low-income students. The lack of reading during the summers amounts to almost two months of school time lost.

In an effort to combat the reading deficiency during the summer, the Department of Education funded a three-year study at the University of Tennessee.  The study included more than 1,300 Florida children from 17 low-income schools. The study surprisingly concluded that giving books to low-income students during spring fairs and books they might be actually read had an effect on their summer reading gap. One of the primary reasons for the research was how much and if any effect summer readings might have on overall student performance. The interesting results of the study can be found here in this <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/summer-must-read-for-kids-any-book/?ref=education">NY Times piece</a>.
