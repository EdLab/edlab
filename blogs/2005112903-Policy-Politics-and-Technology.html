          <p>
            I was starting to respond to <a href="http://blog.tc-library.org/index.php?q=node/246">this post</a> when I decided my response was really a whole new topic.  But to this idea I wanted to point out that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4292854.stm">MIT has been developing ultracheap computers</a> for countries with struggling economies which have "crank" power and the like for maybe 100 bucks.  But the problem is that you can't sell these machines in the US because it would flatten our economy. (sorry, can't find the article for this part)  But this doesn't explain why Mexico isn't on the list.

But Teachers College is (arguably) more policy oriented than many ed schools, and perhaps we can use this to our advantage.  It seems many of the advances we discuss in the EdLab our really catered to countries with America's wealth and at times to areas of particular high standing even within these countries.  Perhaps the EdLab could take up a cause: not just IT innovation, but IT for everyone!  I'm not sure what the political arena for this would be, but maybe this is a call for a little "activism innovation" at TC.  A "Policy and Activism" group at the EdLab?

If we were to do something like this, someone with an economic/business background may be ideal.  We could really push what's feasible and what's fair in educational innovation and redesign our approach with this in mind.  But I'll stop here because I'm talking very far out of class and out of turn.
