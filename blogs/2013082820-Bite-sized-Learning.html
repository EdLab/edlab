<p><b>Title:</b> Review of trends from mobile learning studies: A meta-analysis (2012)<br>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Hsiung Wu, Yen-Chun Jim Wu, Chun-Yu Chen, Hao-Yun Kao, Che-Hung Lin, Sih-Han Huang</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512000735">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Study Design: </b>
As mobile devices have become more widely available, educators and researchers alike are looking into how they can be used to promote both teaching and learning.  Mobile learning may be in our future, but to make that happen researchers have to determine how such systems can be designed to engage rather than distract students during the learning process.  The authors of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512000735"> Review of trends from mobile learning studies: A meta-analysis</a> evaluate a total of 164 studies on mobile learning conducted from 2003-2010.  While the studies vary in terms of what aspect of mobile learning they are examining, most of the studies examine the effectiveness of mobile learning and the development of mobile systems to assist student learning.</p>

<p>The studies used surveys and experiments as research methods to assess the effectiveness of mobile learning systems.  Some researchers also created mobile learning systems, designed to fit with school courses to reinforce studentsâ€™ knowledge. </p>

<p><b>Findings: </b>
The paper found that the results from these mobile learning studies were significantly positive, and that the frequency of published articles on this topic increased greatly from 2003-2010.  Moreover, it found that mobile learning was most popular in higher education, followed by elementary schools, and its effectiveness helped students in applied sciences the most, before humanities and the formal sciences. The paper also discovered that mobile phones and PDAs are the most widely used devices for mobile learning; however, the authors suggest that they may be replaced by new technology, such as iPads and tablets.  Lastly, when the mobile learning system was designed to be used in conjunction with courses, it was shown to improve student achievement, especially with young learners.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward: </b>
These findings do provide some insights for researchers and educators, but there is more to be done. As the interest in mobile learning continues to grow, there will need to be more studies to address issues of how to monitor unproductive use of mobile devices, as well as answering the question of whether mobile learning is more effective within or outside the classroom.</p>
