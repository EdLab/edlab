            The term "embedded librarian" was borrowed from the practice of journalists embedding themselves with troops during during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and its aftermath.  Barbara Dewey, the Dean of Libraries at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, published a seminal article on the subject in 2005:

Dewey, B. I. (2005). <a href="http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=85f62b39-90a3-45d3-bc9a-c4386dd059e8%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=113">The embedded librarian: Strategic campus collaborations</a>.<em> Resource Sharing &amp; Information Networks, </em><em>17</em>(1-2), 5-17.

Dewey writes, "The concept of embedding implies a more comprehensive integration of one group with another to the extent that the group seeking to integrate is experiencing and observing, as nearly as possible, the daily life of the primary group.  Embedding requires more direct and purposeful interaction than acting in parallel with another person, group, or activity.  Overt purposefulness makes embedding an appropriate definition of the most comprehensive collaborations for librarians in the higher education community."  The section headings in her article are illustrative of the aspects of the process Dewey is interested in:
<ul>
	<li>librarians and collaborative campus spaces (i.e., non-library loci for interaction);</li>
	<li>embedded[ness] in research;</li>
	<li>the new academic salon (e.g., the Education Program at Gottesman);</li>
	<li>the pervasive campus librarian (the idea of a ubiquitous or semi-ubiquitous librarian presence outside the library);</li>
	<li>librarians and teaching (involvement in pedagogy, curriculum building, etc.);</li>
	<li>relationship with students;</li>
	<li>embedded[ness] in fundraising (e.g., workshop on grant seeking? active involvement in development outreach?);</li>
	<li>influencing campus virtual space (presence on websites, in online course, via chat, etc.); and</li>
	<li>faculty, students, administrators, and librarians as co-creators (what I've seen referred to in the past as participation in New Learning Communities).</li>
</ul>
Other important articles on the subject include the following:

</ul>
David Shumaker, a professor at the School of Information and Library Science and the Catholic University of America,  is an important specialist on this subject, and his blog,<strong> </strong><em>The Embedded Librarian</em>, at <a href="http://embeddedlibrarian.wordpress.com/">http://embeddedlibrarian.wordpress.com/</a>, is a great resource for tracking the latest trends and developments in librarian embedding.  You might take a look at a PowerPoint presentation he did a few years ago at a library conference:
<ul>
	<li>David Shumaker, Mary Talley, and others. (2009).  <em><a href="http://www.sla.org/PDFs/SLA2009/ModelsofEmbeddedLibrarianshipJune162009.pdf">Models of Embedded Librarianship</a> </em>(presentation at Special Libraries Association Annual Conference, Washington, DC, June 16, 2009).</li>
</ul>
An alternative term for embedded librarians is "personal librarians," and these are a few examples of academic library personal librarian programs already in place:
<ul>
	<li>Barnard College:  <a href="http://library.barnard.edu/contact/personal-librarians">http://library.barnard.edu/contact/personal-librarians</a> (Columbia Spectator news piece at <a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/10/20/barnard-launches-personal-librarian-program">http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/10/20/barnard-launches-personal-librarian-program</a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Drexel University:  <a href="http://www.library.drexel.edu/personal-librarian">http://www.library.drexel.edu/personal-librarian</a> (news piece at <a href="http://www.drexel.edu/news/headlines/a-personal-librarian-for-every-drexel-freshman.aspx">http://www.drexel.edu/news/headlines/a-personal-librarian-for-every-drexel-freshman.aspx</a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Emory University:  Oxford College Library, personal librarian program for faculty:  <a href="http://oxford.library.emory.edu/services/personal-librarians">http://oxford.library.emory.edu/services/personal-librarians</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Yale University:  <a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/pl/">http://www.library.yale.edu/pl </a>; preceded by program at the Yale Medical Library (<a href="http://www.med.yale.edu/library/services/crs/what.html#what">http://www.med.yale.edu/library/services/crs/what.html#what</a>)</li>
</ul>
There are all sorts of fairly self-evident reasons for initiating an embedded librarian program at Gottesman, and in fact we had a personal librarian-like program in place a few years ago in which I participated.  The nine departments were divided up among five librarians, each of whom served as a liaison for a variety of collections- and services-related issues (I was the liaison for Mathematics, Science, and Technology, and to this day there are MST faculty who think of me as their designated librarian).

The reality is that being "on call" to respond to faculty and student problems and needs, whatever this might actually entail, is a challenging assignment, and there are a number of factors that need to be taken into account:
<ul>
	<li>actual available library staff participants;</li>
	<li>means by which library support can be requested/transmitted (in-person consultation? email? chat? in-department presence?);</li>
	<li>time allocation for on-call services;</li>
	<li>implicit or explicit subject expertise;</li>
	<li>types of support to be offered (research/information services? technology support? collaborative instruction?)</li>
</ul>
I would love to hear from you if you have ideas about embeddedness, or have had experience with it, or would be interested in participating in a trial program of some sort.  A term I've seen used in the literature is "informationist," and though not all of us are librarians, certainly all of us are involved in the delivery of information in a variety of areas (hence, are informationists).  I think it would be great to make use of all of the academic subject strengths represented in our part-time and full-time staff, and tapping into our resident expertise could really work to promote the library to the academic community, and also enrich staff members' experience through, as representatives of the library, active collaboration with faculty and staff in the creation of a new teaching and learning community.
