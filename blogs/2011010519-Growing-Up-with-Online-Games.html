          <p>
            On a Saturday evening several weeks ago, as I was working on my dissertation proposal about digital media and civic education, my wife Mei and 6-year-old nephew J had a chance to play <a href="http://www.unicef.org/voy/explore/rights/explore_3142.html ">Ayiti</a>, a popular online social game about the daily struggles of people living in rural Haiti. I didn't know exactly how J came into this online game, but he wanted Mei to play with him. Mei knew that it was my research interest, and was excited to tell me that they were going to play the game. At the time I didn't react passionately to their invitation, partly because I was in the middle of wrapping up a chapter, and also because I was somewhat doubtful about whether J would be interested in that game since I knew it was a difficult game to play as well as lead a rural Haitian family to a happy life throughout a four-year setting in the game. I told them about this, and went back to my writing. In hindsight, I regretted missing one great field observation opportunity about digital media and learning.

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vfhWV7kQQdM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vfhWV7kQQdM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

Later that night on our way home, Mei shared with me what amazed her in their online gaming experience. They spent about 40 minutes playing Ayiti. J took the lead during gameplay, and Mei answered when he had any questions. Not spending much time on any background information on Haiti, they went directly to playing the game and helping this rural Haitian family survive. There are several factors the player need to pay attention to in this game such as education, health, happiness, money and living condition. J invested his resources in education in the first year and explained to Mei that education is important to your future. J thought that private schools will offer children a better education and chose to send them there.

In the second year, not seeing any benefits of  education helping family members on the job market in rural Haiti and in their daily living, J decided to send everyone to work. The third year was difficult for every family member: they were all severely sick but did not have money to go to hospital. In the end, J was frustrated and said that it was so difficult to help this family survive, and had to only let them die. He was kind of sad, but also said that fortunately it was a game. This gaming experience didn't end there. Later as we took J out for dinner, he lamented that he didn't know it was so difficult to survive in some places in the world. 
 
J's gaming experience did surprise me since I did not expect he would go that far in the game and much would come from his playing. I assumed the game would be more engaging for older children because of its social context and difficulty. In fact, in one of my graduate school courses at Teachers College, my group played and presented this game to the class. Only one member (not me) in our group was able to help the rural Haitian family successfully survive the four years in this game. However, with some assistance from Mei (such as the calculation of life expenses and discussions on different choices) Ayiti became a great medium through which Mei and I were able to see J's values and views of the world. For instance, J valued education, and invested resources in private education for children in this rural Haitian family, apparently a decision shaped by his own background. J's frustration with the unhappy ending and severe struggles of this rural Haitian family also leads to another issue of learning in online gaming: what kind of scaffolding or conversation would be helpful for young learners to learn this severe reality in the real world of rural Haiti? Without a good conversation or reflection, this great gaming experience would risk alienating young learners from the real struggles in another part of the world. After all, it can be “just a game” that you can turn off or restart easily at anytime.

For this concern, I was especially happy to hear J's last comment that he realized lives were very difficult in some other places in the world. While he might not get much factual backgrounds about Haiti in this casual playing over a weekend evening, his empathy with other people in the world clearly developed throughout this casual gaming experience, which for me is the most essential disposition for any actions for social good. Great and enjoyable gaming experiences need not always to be about violence and killing, but could be about serious social issues that help young people explore different aspects of a complicated world.
