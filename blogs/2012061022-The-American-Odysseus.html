            The Trojan War was won on the wit of Odysseus: it was He who stole the horses of Rhesus; it was He who recovered the body of Achilles; it was ultimately He who conceived of the Trojan horse.

The Romans, who prided themselves as the descendents of Aeneas, abhorred the Ithacan king. In Roman virtues, valor is prized above wit for good reasons.  In the millennia to follow, literary aesthetics has acquired a distinct Roman disdain for the cunning. That was true even in the retelling of the birth of the U.S.

The accepted folkloric recount is a dyadic mix of two protagonists: a daring, strong, and silent general and a cultured, enlightened, and suave statesman. Few pages were given to Benjamin Franklin, the only signatory of four historic documents that dictate the fortunes of this country beyond today: the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Paris, and the U.S. Constitution.

Franklin makes an unpalatable character for an otherwise straightforward narrative. He never had the stony determination of Washington.  In portraits, his enigmatic stare is forever overshadowed by the statuesque general – in solo or group. His character is a difficult sell in the other direction also. Jefferson’s sagacity takes on the philosophical.  His creative endeavors beamed the power of its wearer in such Rousseuesque grace.  Jefferson is the Apollonian incarnate historians lionized. In contrast, Franklin elicits unease in readers and raconteurs.  Recounts of the kite experiments paint a nutty professor type.  His witty diplomatic maneuvers behind the Treaty of Alliance with France, which eventually led to the Louisiana Purchase, sit uncomfortably with children and scholars alike.  But it <em>was</em> Franklin who realized that a young republic would need a backyard to play as a toddler and more room to roam as a teen, even to the other ocean in time beyond him – all or parts of fifteen current states from Louisiana to Montana were acquired during the purchase, one-third of the U.S. territory.  Napoleon once declared with schadenfreude: "This accession of territory affirms forever the power of the United States, and I have given England a maritime rival who sooner or later will humble her pride."

Franklin’s preoccupation with electricity, ocean currents, and the wave theory of light added more points on his odd meter.  Either he was witty and historians dismissed wit as a virtue, or at best, his wit does not appeal to the vanilla American palate.  He was the American Odysseus that the new Romans choose to keep in the basement.  Only Immanuel Kant visits him there from time to time – another bohemian, the pattern is all too clear.
