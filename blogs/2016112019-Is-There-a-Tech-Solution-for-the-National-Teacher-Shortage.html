<p>Back in 2004, a <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/pdf/govpub/1024teachersal.pdf">New
York City report</a> estimated that unless salary, safety, class sizes, school choices, and resources improved, there would be a drastic shortage in teachers. However, thanks to aggressive retention and recruitment strategies from the city’s Department of Education (DOE), that gap was significantly reduced. Yet with the wide variety of schools hiring and the constant recruitment of educators, it can be difficult for both teachers and employers to sift through all the options. That is why two young developers, upon a recent app pivot, founded <a href="https://www.getselected.co">Selected</a>.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>Selected is a job matching platform that pairs teachers with schools. It seamlessly takes educators through a simple survey covering important employment factors like location and school culture. Then it reveals matching school options with visualized data and detailed insight from <a href="http://insideschools.org">the Inside Schools website</a>. Teachers are instructed to favorite the schools that interest them the most, and are prompted to fill out their own professional profile. If schools take interest in a candidate’s profile, there is a match and an opportunity to interview. This process is simple, intuitive, and easy for any job seeker to use. Unlike the DOE’s new <a href="https://nyc.teacherssupportnetwork.com/ntf/Home.do">Teacher Finder platform</a>, Selected is operational year-round. And unlike platforms like LinkedIn, users are able to <i>hide</i> their profile from particular schools.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>It is unclear if all of the schools listed on Selected are actively hiring. There are also important salary considerations that are not available on the platform, leaving many job seekers in the dark regarding pay. There aren't opportunities to get feedback about potential schools from current employees, as most of the data is self-reported from the schools or generated from the Inside Schools website. It also took a bit of clicking around for me to move from the survey results to the creation of my own profile; with a bit more scaffolding this navigation could be easily re-organized.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>With diversity in school cultures, missions, and models increasing, Selected is an OkCupid-like job matching platform that seems to have a promising future. The founders are currently recruiting candidates from top education institutions and partnering with schools across the city. With the thousands of professionals that move in and out of the education sector every year, this could scale-up to become a national solution.</p>
