<p><a href="https://www.chatallapp.com">ChatAll</a> is a language-learning app that is built into a messaging platform. While you text your contacts, it provides translations of all messages in the language of your choice so you can learn as you chat in your regular daily conversations.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Call me a millennial if you want, but I send a million texts a day (and also exaggerate some), so having an app that incorporates language learning into everyday messaging is incredibly appealing to me. ChatAll is able to translate your messages into over 100 languages, from Icelandic to Vietnamese to (yes, even) Esperanto. When you start messaging one of your contacts through the app, both your messages and your friend’s are translated into the language of your choice directly beside the message. This helps you practice foreign language reading and vocabulary throughout the day.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While the idea behind ChatAll is great, the implementation is not as effective as it could be. For instance, unlike HelloTalk (a language learning platform using a similar idea), ChatAll only allows you to message people already in your contact list. Furthermore, both parties must download the app and communicate through it. ChatAll would be much more effective if it could be used as an add-on to regular text messaging and didn’t require both users to download it.</p>
 
<p>In addition, ChatAll currently only allows you to choose one language to learn. Instead of being able to message multiple contacts with different language settings, you can only choose one language for all your contacts. Unless two friends are both dedicated to learning a new language, it doesn’t seem worth it to open another app just to send texts, let alone convince your friends to download and use the app just so you can practice a language.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>ChatAll could be useful for friends who want to practice a language together. Unfortunately, it does not as seamlessly integrate into users’ lives as the creators think it does. While I would be thrilled to use this app if it acted as an add-on to my normal text messaging, having to convince my friends to download the app and send messages exclusively through it is too much hassle for me.</p>
