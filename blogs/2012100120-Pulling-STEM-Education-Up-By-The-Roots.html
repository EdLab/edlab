<p>In 2010, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a non-profit think tank in Washington, released <a href=" 
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1722822
"> a comprehensive and contentious report </a> on the state of STEM education in America.  Their more controversial ideas and recommendations seem to have slipped under the radar, and a report like this, coming from a group of contributors with extensive experience in STEM education policy and cutting so strongly against the grain of our current thinking on the subject, merits a closer look.</p>

<p>The report can be divided conceptually into three sections.  In the first, they review the evidence that our current system isn’t providing us with the trained STEM practitioners our economy needs.  In the second, they detail why this is so, and why many of the reforms proposed or enacted to fix this gap are misguided.  The third section, capped off by concrete policy recommendations, offers a fresh and iconoclastic approach to reforming STEM education.</p>

<p>This first section lies well within the mainstream of contemporary discourse.  Fear of China and domestic de-industrialization has focused attention on American STEM training and employment to a degree not seen, perhaps, since the launch of Sputnik. The report offers original support for this concern.  Foreign workers make up a large portion of the U.S. STEM labor force, and have constituted something of a quick fix for the potential gap between supply and demand among American citizens that may dry up as demand for STEM workers ramps up in other countries. Ultimately, they conclude that many developed and developing countries have been nurturing their STEM sectors more actively and effectively than the U.S., leading to an eroding domestic position.</p>

<p>This conclusion leads naturally to the second section of the report, examining how and why we’ve failed to provide adequately for our STEM sector.  The authors describe the dominant response for the past few decades to our declining position as a set of practices and policies called "Some STEM for All."  "The central tenet," they write "is that we can increase the quantity of STEM workers by reaching out to more students, more often, and with higher quality STEM education."  Practically speaking, this means increasing the number of candidates entering into the STEM pipeline by ensuring, through higher standards, more rigid curriculum, higher quality teachers, and public media campaigns, that high schools produce students more willing and capable of pursuing a college STEM major. Empirically, the report argues, most of these efforts have been proven to have little effect.  Furthermore, they fail to address the real issues posed by all the barriers and discouragements that lie along the STEM education and career path (e.g. distracting and time-consuming general requirements).</p>

<p>To revamp our STEM education and career-preparation pipeline, the authors have a variety of suggestions that they bundle under a general proposal "All STEM for Some."  This means a narrow focus on increasing the educational support for those students who feel naturally drawn to STEM. It is about plugging the leaks in the STEM pipeline, rather than worrying about how many people enter into it.  Along with a variety of curricular reforms (reducing general requirements to give students flexibility to pursue their interests, focusing more on project-based learning, etc.), this means developing more specialized institutions and structures for the STEM student.</p>

<p>Through a suite of efforts, including magnet high schools, national recruiting, entrepreneurship training, and early research programs for undergraduates, they hope to create a STEM experience that is more rewarding and encouraging for a select number of students. They argue as well for an aggressive use of federal research grants, and a revamped college-ranking system to ensure the cooperation of reluctant universities. In addition, they want to tighten the connection between industry and education with performance-based credits, internships, and credentials targeted for the workforce.</p>

<p>Many of the report’s suggestions for making STEM a more desirable educational choice, and career path, are worth investigating. But after the radical opening, in which the authors position themselves as diametrically opposed to mainstream thinking on the subject, the piecemeal and small-scale policy proposals that follow are somewhat anti-climactic.  The most promising of these looks to be the strengthened connection between industry and education, which, if it can avoid the stigma of "vocational education," might satisfy the report’s demands for a more rewarding and focused STEM education regime. In general, however, what they offer is more a change of emphasis than a fundamental rethinking of the entire system.</p>
