            <b>Reflection</b> 

The seminar given yesterday by Bart Nourse and Sandria Parsons inspires me to think about a potential collaboration within Teachers College. Before moving forward to my new thoughts, I want to share with you some reflection on the seminar: 

I believe <a href="
www.moving2mastery.org">M2M</a> will give great information to those outside the teaching field. I have had previous learning experience at TC's in-service teacher-ed program and relative familiarity with the per-service teacher-ed program (in Curriculum and Teaching). However, I would not embrace the <b>perspective</b> of “promoting ‘master' teachers' teaching” and I feel the video clip shown yesterday doesn't provide in-depth content in either theory or practice, which is not quite in line with its <a href="http://www.moving2mastery.org/AboutUs.html ">rationale</a>. 

First, there are no specific criteria (as an answer to Ching-fu's question) so far for selecting “master teachers” as given in the talk (e.g., recommendations from teachers, principals, and parents). Second, with the aforementioned precondition, the wording of “master teacher” will probably confuse outsiders who want to enter the teaching field with the thought that the teaching shown on the video is the best. But there is no perfect teaching in every classroom and every classroom is different regarding students' previous experience, knowledge, and family background. It might not be a good idea to promote this type of “master teaching”. Third, some details in the video must be applied carefully in other classrooms, such as “he never posts rules in the classroom” and frequent use of “reset”. Instead of not posting rules, student teachers at TC are encouraged to work with students to produce classroom rules and post them up. As further pointed by Jeff, the word “reset” might intimidate students who didn't have much experience with computer. 

I believe the journey of teaching involves a constant “spiral” of theory, reflection, and practice (<i>How we think</i> by Dewey). To view great moments of teaching would be helpful for new teachers, but the importance lies in knowing their own classroom, their students, and how to tailor the teaching to them. 

Please feel free to add to / "criticize" my ideas if you want to join my reflection here. 

<b>New thoughts</b> 

<b>Background</b>: The teacher education programs at TC are facing a future challenge in teacher training in online teaching and learning as once mentioned by
<a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/index.htm?facid=kkz2">Prof. Karen Zumwalt</a>, the in-service program chair in Curriculum and Teaching. Each year about 25-30 experienced teachers attend the in-service program and 25-30 teachers attend the pre-service program. Currently, all in-service and pre-service teachers fulfill written reflections and class discussions to talk about their teaching moments. 

I have the following thoughts about a potential collaboration between the EdLab and the teacher-ed programs at TC, involving Critter: 

1.	Potential digital archiving (e.g., documentaries of 1-3 specific lessons given in different subjects) of experienced and student teachers' teaching;

2.	EdLab staff give training to in-service and pre-service teachers about how to digitalize their teaching and how to use Critter;

3.	Both in-service and pre-service teachers use Critter to share with the class (privately?) to comment and reflect on their teaching moments;

4.	Professors and teachers can decide if they want to share their video conversations in Critter with the public or not. If shared with public, then the documentaries can be further used by researchers, future student teachers, and school leaders; 

5.      Potential future teacher contact for EdLab: AfterEd can contact the teachers to create potential videos for how TC graduates teach in their classroom, their class participation in educational technology, or other topics.
