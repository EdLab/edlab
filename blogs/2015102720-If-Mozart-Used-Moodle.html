<p>When musicians come together for a jam session, no one wants to be the one who has to carry two guitars, an amp, and a drum set to the other side of town. And when the rehearsal is over, there usually isnâ€™t much room for more collaboration once everyone goes their separate ways. With the aid of online platforms and technology, musicians might have another way to make collaborative music composition more accessible and streamlined.</p>
 
<p>A researcher from Italy studied experienced musicians who participated in an online music collaboration process through Moodle, an open-source learning platform; ooVoo, a video calling software; eJAMMING, a collaborative audio network; and Dropbox, a file sharing tool. This study sought to reveal whether virtual environments were conducive to creating music and utilizing metacognition while doing so. The researcher defined metacognition to be the knowledge and monitoring of cognitive processes, which he argues is necessary for collaborative endeavors.</p>
 
<p>The participants reported through qualitative interviews that they found the discussion forum and database most suitable for music composition, whereas the diary tool on the platform was seen as less useful. One of the musicians noted that the virtual environment allowed for more teamwork, stating that "the online situation has permitted a more horizontal process, and less binding." Others added that the online experience was more systematic, better organized, and more flexible. The flexibility was an advantage not only for better time management, but also for avoiding logistical issues involving moving instruments and tools.</p>
 
<p>However, participants also reported that some problems arose from the online platform, including internet connectivity, since a strong signal was necessary for a fully synchronous session with their group members. They also stated that there were occasionally issues with trying to interact visually or gesturally with one another online. In one interview, a musician acknowledged that he felt as though he missed the feeling of physically working in the same location with his group members. Finally, as this research only focused on one music group, the author addresses the importance of doing further research involving more participants, potentially with additional quantitative methods, to determine a better understanding of an optimal model for collaborative music composition online.</p>
