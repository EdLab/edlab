          <p>
            For a while now I have mentioned that while I like value-added, it is limited by what I consider a poor testing system. Let me take some time now to outline the problems I have with the testing system as it stands now

Lower the stakes: We currently evaluate student achievement on a sample size of one. That would be a horrible statistical practice in any other context, so why here? Economies of scale. It's easier for the administration and the testing service provider to have just one large examination to conduct and grade than to have several small tests spread out throughout the year. Yes, this means more tests, but it also means less pressure per test and reveals more information about the student.

Formative-summative balance: Most are unfamiliar with the two terms used to describe tests but summative tests solely serve to summarize what a student has learned and are tied to grades while formative tests aim to indirectly increase understanding and are not tied to grades. Until recently, we have largely relied on summative testing but a rebalancing is starting to take place in RTT applications

Detailed score reports (less discrete, more continuous): This seems like the easiest of changes that can be made. Discrete grades on a scale of 1-4 or 1-5 do no favors. They give little information for teachers, students, or papers. Yet this is a very common scale for scoring. How can we expect teachers to meet detailed test score targets for their students when the test scores themselves are hardly detailed? 

If a student aces or fails a test, don't be afraid to give another test. It is important to know, as closely as possible, where a student's absolute knowledge lies. If a student fails Test 1 and then fails Test 2, is any information revealed? Not really. Said student's achievement could have increased, declined, or stagnated. Same can be said for a student who aces Test 1 and Test 2.

Minimizing Multiple Choice: This one is probably the least impactful of my suggested changes, but it seems practicable, especially to mathematics. I've heard it said that multiple choice questions teach 'test-taking skills'. To me that sounds like a bad thing, since it obscures measurement of actual knowledge and achievement in the subject matter.

If I think of more gripes, I'll list them in the comment section
