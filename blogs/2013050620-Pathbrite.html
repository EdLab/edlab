<p>
<a href="https://pathbrite.com/">Pathbrite</a> is a digital portfolio platform that allows users to gather and store their work and achievements online including media projects such as images, audio, and video. The modern content arrangement of the portfolio is reminiscent of the <a href="http://www.soluto.com/kb/windows-8/what-are-windows-8-live-tiles/">Windows Live Tiles</a>. Pathbrite also allows educators to construct visually pleasing learning management systems (LMS) where they can create their own courses and keep track of their students’ digital learning artifacts. Students and teachers can comment on the contents of student portfolios to provide feedback. Pathbrite aims to replace the paper résumé with an all-media inclusive e-portfolio that users will maintain throughout their learning lifetime.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Pathbrite is a better looking and more engaging alternative to a traditional résumé. With Pathbrite, potential employers will be able to view and interact with an applicant’s work instead of just reading a description of it on a paper résumé. Users can add images, audio, or videos from popular sites such as Youtube, Vimeo, Facebook, Linkedin, Google Drive, Khan Academy, or most other websites. Files from a user’s computer can also be uploaded to their portfolio.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The courses are free for teachers to create but each enrolled student incurs a fee of $10. Fees could escalate quickly; providing the tool to a class of 30 would cost $300, which would make it difficult for teachers who pay for their own software with no support from their schools.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>Pathbrite is an educational portfolio for the 21st century. Storing digital learning artifacts and achievements could encourage <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/hlst/resources/a-zdirectory/reflectivelearning">reflective learning</a>, which can help promote critical thinking, self-awareness, and analytical skills. The feedback mechanism in the portfolio could inspire users to improve their work, promoting student-centered learning. Long a staple of web and graphic design, digital portfolios and credentialing are becoming more essential to all work on the web. Pathbrite provides a cloud-based record that users can maintain and show at any time. Diverse learning methods and a breakdown of traditional certification mean that digital native students will likely have to show learning artifacts and proof of knowledge rather than simply presenting a diploma, grade, or test score.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Pathbrite is a digital media portfolio for educational and professional life.</p>
