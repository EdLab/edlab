Randy Weiner is the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.brainquake.com/">BrainQuake</a>, a two-time U.S. Department of Education Small Business Innovation Award winner. He also co-founded and was the founding Chairman of the Board at <a href="http://www.urbanmontessori.org/">Urban Montessori Charter School (UMCS)</a> in Oakland, CA. It's the nation’s first public Montessori, arts integration, and design thinking school, serving one of the most diverse student populations in California.</p>

<p>A Teach for America alum and father to two elementary school-aged daughters (both attend UMCS), he taught for five years in Oakland and Madagascar. Weiner holds a bachelor's from Middlebury College and a master's in Education from Stanford University’s School of Education.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at BrainQuake?</b><br>
<p>Despite having every seeming mindset advantage (my father worked at Bell Labs and AT&T as an engineer and my mother worked tirelessly to help me understand that productive struggle and failure are critical steps on the path to learning) I still managed to grow up thinking I was not a math person. I took advanced and AP math and sciences courses throughout my education until my senior year in high school. In college, I met coursework minimums in STEM fields, but my focus was on philosophy and language.</p>
 
<p>When I graduated from college, I taught 3rd – 5th grade in Oakland, CA as a Teach For America corps member for three years. I then taught 3rd – 4th grade at the American School of Antananarivo, Madagascar for another two years. Mathematics was the subject I most enjoyed teaching by a very large margin. My enjoyment wasn’t really driven by a desire to ensure my students had a different experience than my own. It was based more in the opportunities I saw to create challenging, concrete experiences with mathematics that provided children with an opportunity to experience mathematics as something other than mere symbols in a book. I didn’t know it then, but that opportunity would inform not only my work at BrainQuake but also my contributions to co-founding Urban Montessori Charter School, in Oakland.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at BrainQuake will change students’ approach to learning math?</b><br>
<p>We at BrainQuake fundamentally believe that math’s interface, especially for K-8 students, and even more so for girls and children of color, is unnecessarily oppressive. We strongly believe that, when able to access interfaces that reflect or embed the considerable, replicated research that’s been around for decades on when, how, and why children are able to demonstrate math proficiency, every child is capable of owning or reclaiming his or her natural capacity to excel in mathematics. There’s just no reason anyone should grow up thinking he or she’s not a math person today. As former educators, academics, scientists, and parents, our team has taken the time necessary to obtain third-party, peer-reviewed published findings (research that we did not fund) to demonstrate as much to ourselves as to others that there is reason to consider seriously the positive impact our work can have on students’ performance, agency, and disposition to learning mathematics. As part of that work, we’ll soon be rolling out new data points regarding math proficiency that our interfaces allow us to measure and share with students, teachers, and families. If we can continue to help students, teachers, and families recognize and reveal children’s true math proficiency and potential, then we’ll feel as though we’ve contributed to the conversation.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
 
<p>I have a hard time engaging in trendspotting before relegating fundamental issues many voices have identified for decades and centuries to the educational graveyard. Too many children still cannot read in this country. Too many children grow up unnecessarily believing they cannot excel in mathematics. Technology’s impact on economic opportunity exacerbates the vitriol that always fills the void when children grow up without learning how to engage in critical, civil discourse across difference. We continue to seek to attach the latest technology to age-old education issues, retreading previous failures in shiny new code. Education legal code and policy, in the main, are not willing to risk challenging the status quo out of fear that such a risk is too high, despite the fact that so many stakeholders know the current state does not serve any one of those stakeholders nearly as well as it should. We are not teaching our children, systematically, how to be innovators. There are plenty of truly life-threatening educational issues that we could address right now that would not require one bit of back-from-the-future insight.</p>

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to BrainQuake?</b><br>
<p>Right around the same time that I co-founded BrainQuake, I also co-founded Urban Montessori Charter School in Oakland, CA. UMCS is the nation’s only public Montessori, Design Thinking, and Arts Integration model. We serve nearly 500 students from Transitional Kindergarten to 7th grade, and our student body nearly reflects Oakland’s own demographics as the second-most diverse city in the nation. We just completed our fifth year and received unanimous approval for our second five-year term. This year we’re launching our middle school model. As a co-founder and former Board Chair, I continue to engage in fundraising and networking for the school, and I am excited to engage in the community’s planned work around equity issues.</p>

<p>I’ve also just recently co-launched <a href="http://www.thegrproject.com/">The GR Project</a>.  Currently, we’re focusing on podcasting, taking the time to go deep with Oakland education innovators whose work may be local, but whose relevance is national. The podcast is long form, as we believe that, at least in Oakland, one of the greatest frustrations the community experiences is a lack of venues that provide the time to really engage deeply in the complex work that is the education of our children. We’ve completed five episodes so far, with many more lined up. Like my work with Urban Montessori, the podcast has been a fantastic way to stay very close to the real-world issues that impact the work I do at BrainQuake.</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you follow on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I do have a <a href="https://twitter.com/randybw15">Twitter account</a>, but I’m not a particularly avid tweeter.</p>
