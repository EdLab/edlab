          <p>
            On Wednesday evening June 17, Laura, Mason, Kate and I went to NYEdTech meetup at Knewton--International: You Say EdTech the Way We Say EdTech, featuring the following panelists who have rich experience working with clients overseas:
<b>Allison Lytton, Scholastic, @lilijing
Andrea Tejedor, educator, researcher and consultant, @AStrategicShift 
Josh Robinson, Knewton, @Knewton </b>

The panelists shared their insights on the scenario of Educational Technology development and market in Middle East, Asia Pacific and Brazil and the trend and priorities in the field. 

The panelists stated that there is growing interest in American education from other countries. On the other hand, the education in some countries is flourishing very quickly, thanks to technology and has a lot that the US can learn from. 

The event had a big turnout and attracted a very diverse group: people who have long been in the EdTech field and people who are about to enter; Founders of startups, staff in big EdTech companies, school principals and teachers and people from all over the world. 

Takeways for EdLab:
<ul>
<li>A quick session in an event giving people chances to shout out their needs and what they have to offer: i.e. I need a developer; I have deep knowledge of European market.
<li>EdLab has the potential in accelerating the resource exchange between American educators and educators from other parts of the world. 
<li>Some new, wonderful organizations and people for us to follow up with and apps to review.
</ul>
<p>
Yue's personal note:

Coming from China, I am always interested in the education in a global context. I witness the new forces in education spreading like a wide fire in developing countries. People are hungry for progressive philosophy and pedagogy from developed countries and study overseas whenever they get a chance. 

I had a very rigid schooling experience which I never liked. My peers and I always dreamt of going to school in the US, which was said to be very interactive, free and above all, fun. Coming to NYC studying education, hearing about testing all the time, sometimes I had to pause and asked myself: am I in the US or China? I think all of us have some misconceptions of each other and more communication is the solution. 

It was my first outreach adventure since I joined EdLab 2 weeks ago. I was in an amazing team with Kate, Laura and Mason. Networking is a useful skill that takes time and practice to develop. I learned a lot by observing Kate and Laura and was advised by Mason with some unconventional tips. 

I feel truly grateful that I get to reinvent myself at EdLab every day, getting better at things that I want to achieve such as developing in-depth connection with people and drawing.
