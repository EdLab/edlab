          <p>
            <p>Today Ryan and I had a good discussion of the existing and potential use cases of Vialogues. I think EdLab blog is a good place to archive and share our discussion. If any of our research associates is motivated, I think expanding this topic can make a good publication on the pedagogical models of video-based discussions. Additions, c<span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">omments, and suggestions are also welcome.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Video Annotation</b></p><p><br /></p><p>Video Annotation is an important tool in anthropology research. Researchers shoot videos about human behaviors and study those behaviors by analyzing the videos. They need to discuss human behaviors in many layers such as psychological, social, cultural, etc. and need to make annotations on specific segments of the video. Therefore, a lot of re-watching and thinking is required, which makes Vialogues the perfect tool for this purpose.</p><p><br /></p><p>Video annotation is also used in discussing and improving procedural skills. Professor Herb Ginsburg at Teachers College asked his class of developmental mathematical thinking to interview children about math thinking and post the interview video recordings to Vialogues. The students then annotate their videos to explain why they did this or that during the clinical interview. The professor and TA also give feedback in the vialogue created by the students. Most of Prof. Ginsburg's class vialogues are private but see <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1781/" target="_blank">this one</a> for example.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Choose Your Own Video Adventure (CYOVA)</b></p><p><br /></p><p>I made up this use case. I want to allow people to embed hyperlinks on top of the video player, which takes the watcher to different points of the same or other video. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XgQEEBnTsY" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> shows an example of what it looks like. But in Vialogues the point of CYOVA is teachers can embed assessments for student learning of the video and decide what is the proper lesson to take based on the student choice. </p><p><br /></p><p><b>Synchronous Video Tutoring / </b><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 0.875rem;">Live Streaming Seminar</span></p><p><br /></p><p>If Vialogues can support live streaming, people can use Vialogues for online tutoring. Live streaming is an expensive technology. But there are ways to reduce the cost and remain Vialogues free for education. For example, we can only allow the teacher to broadcast live video from their webcam but they cannot do bi- or multi-directional video chatting (like in Skype or Google Hangouts) with the class. In this mode, the students will see the teacher talking and playing slides in the video. If they need to interact with the teacher, they shoot a comment. Real-time comment will be available in the upcoming Vialogues release so participants will see new comments and notifications without reloading the page.</p><p><br /></p><p>Existing Vialogues users who demonstrate this need can be found if you <a href="https://vialogues.com/search/general/?query=edtc" target="_blank">search for &quot;EDTC&quot;</a> in Vialogues. You'll find a lot of vialogues from the same university (Seattle Pacific University or SPU) where they first used Google Hangouts On Air to do the class then created vialogues out of the YouTube videos (Google Hangouts On Air videos can be automatically saved to YouTube).</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Live Then Discuss</b></p><p><br /></p><p>This use case is built upon the previous use case. In fact the SPU people are using Vialogues in this model. After live tutoring is done, the video is available in the Vialogues system for future discussion which extends learning to an infinite time. So for example a teacher just completed a live demo for how to write a &quot;Hello World!&quot; C++ class. S/he doesn't have to do the same demo again and again every year for the same class. S/he can assign the archived vialogue to the new class to watch before the class session, and let the classroom flip so students can receive one-on-one help if they need.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many MOOC courses actually do something similar. The professor records their brick-and-mortar class lectures in the whole semester, then upload the whole video series to Coursera. Then they don't need to teach the course again in the classroom because the lectures are online.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Video SlideShare</b></p><div><br /></div><div>Do you know you can export your PowerPoint slides to MP4 format? You can create such a video out of your next presentation and upload it to Vialogues. Then you annotate each slide with notes using the correct timecode. Tomorrow when you stand in front of a large crowd to present your Vialogues slides, simply click the timecodes to switch slides.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/559/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example.</div><div><br /></div><div>Note, some mods of the current system need be done. Such as the video should remain paused after each seek, and the annotations should go to the split screen when you go to the presentation mode.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Video Documentation / Knowledge Share</b></div><div><br /></div><div>The dev team sometimes use Vialogues to archive and share knowledge. We use a screen recording program to record the computer screen when we demo <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">how to do certain software engineering stuff. We talk when we demo the procedures and the voice over is also recorded. Then we upload the demo video to Vialogues to share with colleagues. They can watch the video on their own and ask questions.</span></div>
