Since the summertime, I have had the great privilege of attending edtech meetups and happy hours with <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/2506" target="_blank">Kate</a>, one of EdLab's classy women of edtech! And last night, I also had the privilege of attending with EdLab's newest and most anticipated UX designer, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/4201" target="_blank">Nara</a>, who proved to be such a natural among such a crowd.

Here are a few encouragements to keep in mind if you find yourself going to one of these in the near future, (cue <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8497" target="_blank">plug for this Thursday's meetup</a>):

<b>1. Just jump in.</b> You are never interrupting a conversation at these things. Catch the last thing someone said, ask a question about it, and there you have it: you are now part of an already-developed conversation.

<b>2. Use your diverse background to connect.</b> Just because you are at an edtech event, representing education reform values, perhaps representing specific EdLab products, does not mean that you MUST connect with people on those topics alone. Remove that pressure to remain "literally relevant", and talk about your other competencies and interests (i.e. art, design, science, music, etc...) as they relate to your current work in education. Make an impression now; you can always email them later.
<!--break-->
<b>3. Introduce the people you meet to other EdLab'ers.</b> Kate is SO great at this. She will connect us at the event even! You end up meeting far more people when you're not there alone. 

<b>4. Don't go on an empty stomach.</b> It's loud. You need to concentrate. This could easily become a waste of time if you're not getting business cards or making connections. It's better to grab a bite even it means you arrive a little late, than to find yourself trying to cut the conversations short. 

Finally, my question of the night was: <i>What do you need next, in order to move forward?</i> 

I ask this question to see if there are any EdLab resources that can be of help to the people I meet. It ensures that I sound helpful, and not like an eager salesperson.

Anyways, consider these tips useful for when you attend a future meetup, or even our very own demo night next month!
