            Cloud  storage seems to be the way of the future in our increasingly mobile,  tapped in world. Reasons for wanting cloud storage include: a way to  back up the files on your computer in case it crashes, a way to access  and work on files from multiple devices and have them sync, and a way to  share files with colleagues or friends. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/the-top-concerns-with-cloud-storage-services-7000007512/">Concerns about storing data in the cloud include</a>:  security issues (hacking, leaking), a distrust of company interests  (how much should Google know about me, really?), and server crash  worries. The New York Times, for instance, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?pagewanted=all">recently did an investigative report</a> revealing the power required to cool centralized server centers, which  also questions how safe they are. But despite the concerns, cloud  storage has become an increasingly popular option for both businesses  and individuals. And because my own computer is getting old, I’ve been  wondering whether I should backup my own data on the cloud or stick  with an external hard drive, and if I do pick the cloud, I’m curious  about which service is best.

So,  which cloud service should I choose? The simple answer is that none of them are  obviously best, mainly because each service seems to be better at  something different. Some services focus more on backing up files, while  others focus on synchronized access, others on file sharing. To make  matters more complicated, certain services focus on different types of  media: music, photos, documents, encrypted files. A third factor is  cost: these services vary quite a lot in price. Based on a scouring of  different cloud review roundups, here’s what I’ve discovered.

<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/the-7-best-cloud-storage-services-compared/">Digital Trends reviews</a> the best 7 cloud services, which in their estimation include Dropbox,  Google Drive, Microsoft SkyDrive, Amazon Cloud Drive, iCloud, Box, and  the seventh is Otixo, which is a megadrive allowing you to access your  accounts with the aforementioned six. Amazon and iCloud are both best  for music and not much else (though iCloud’s calendar sync is nifty, I  think). Dropbox, Drive, and SkyDrive all allow you to share and  collaborate files, but Google’s wants you to stay within the Google  world and edit documents with their own docs program. They allow  you to save the document in a variety of file extensions, but this is creates the  complication of having multiples of the same file; once you download it  to your computer, you have to remember to load it back up to save  changes in the cloud. Dropbox can save files of any type, but you can’t  edit them live. Because SkyDrive is Microsoft’s creation, you can edit  your files live with the Microsoft Suite, giving it a possible  advantage. Box is a cleanly designed integrated file system which  supports collaboration and synching, but seems best for businesses  rather than individuals. None of the above options is your answer if  what you want is to backup your entire computer.

In an effort to navigate the overlapping features of the above options, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/255072/top_15_cloud_storage_tips_and_tasks.html">PC World breaks the cloud service decision down by user need</a>,  rather than by cloud provider. They note the difference between synching  your local folders to a cloud and actually placing your folders in a  cloud folder. They offer handy tips, such as how to save all email  attachments in a cloud, or how to retrieve previously saved versions in a  cloud, or how to share a photo and which service to use for this,  versus how to store and share music files. Some of these tips are so  specific and minute it can make your head spin, reading it. I have to  admit I started wondering: shouldn’t all digital software make my life  easier? Isn’t that its purpose? Will I need to hire a personal assistant  to manage my various cloud services?

Thanks.&quot;"]<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2013/01/images.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-17905" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2013/01/images-300x123.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="123" /></a>[/caption]

Well. It’s also possible to abandon your beloved personalized computer entirely and buy <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebooks.html#ss-cb">Google’s $249 Chromebook </a>computer  that contains no storage at all, just access to google’s suite of cloud  computing softwares. Suddenly a computer is nothing more than a gateway  to a life stored online.

For now, for most of us, this option won’t  work, but it’s interesting to consider what a life stored only in the  cloud could look like. To me it seems antithetical to the point of  digital connectivity to buy a computer that limits, rather than expands,  my freedom of choice. But let’s imagine a different product, a computer  that stores nothing but acts only as a conductor to not one but a  variety of internet-stored cloud systems holding my various personal files.  Cloud-based Adobe Suite? Cloud-based iMovie? Cloud-based art collaboration? Cloud communities? What would that world look  like? Would we want this?
