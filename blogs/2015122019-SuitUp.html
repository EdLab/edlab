<p><i>"We created SuitUp to align the incentives of schools and companies—bringing companies into the classroom to increase career awareness for students in low-income communities."</i> (<a href="http://www.suitupnyc.com/our-story/">SuitUp NYC: Our Story</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Companies in the Classroom</b></p>

<p>Usually, the idea of bringing corporations into the classroom is not a welcome event for educators, especially those wary of corporate influence in public education. But <a href="http://www.suitupnyc.com/">Suitup NYC</a> is engaging schools in a deliberate and thoughtful manner. For companies looking to engage in community service, SuitUp organizes a business competition at a school and partners students with the company's employees to create new business solutions and ideas—whether it's imagining a new candy flavor or designing new clothing for a popular brand.</p>

<p><b>Student Impact</b></p>
 
<p>One of SuitUp’s educational goals is to help students in low-income communities learn more about the wide variety of career options that exist. Especially at a younger age, students often have a very narrow scope of what types of jobs they can pursue in the future, usually limited to what their parents do for a living and high-profile occupations like professional athletes and music stars. By learning more about less obvious occupations, students begin to see their education as more relevant and accessible.</p>
 
<p>SuitUp also focuses on bringing transparency to students in schools, giving them insight into what adults mean when they talk about "success." SuitUp’s Chief Academic Officer Casey Miller argues that by making the path from an education to a career more transparent to students they will be more engaged and invested in their education. By inviting a variety of different companies into schools, SuitUp is seeking both to increase corporate service in education and to promote career awareness among students who may not otherwise receive that kind of exposure.</p>
