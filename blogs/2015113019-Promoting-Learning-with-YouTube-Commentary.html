<p>YouTube is a global phenomenon. The popular social media website garners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/en-GB/statistics.html">enviable statistics from across the planet. </a> The site has over a billion users, and 80% of views originate from outside the United States. The site is navigable in 76 different languages, covering 95% of the international internet population. But aside from its obvious ability to entertain a large number of people regardless of place of origin, does YouTube have any demonstrated educational value? A recent study investigated whether student comments on YouTube videos developed language and intercultural learning. </p>
 
<p>The article’s author conducted a case study exploring how discourse analysis tools might uncover incidences of intercultural exchange as well as language learning invoked by comments on Chinese-English YouTube videos. The study focused on exchange structures—acts of interaction between students including the sharing of information. The researcher’s methodology focused on building a data set of videos that included both Chinese and English expressions that highlight attempts by viewers to move between these two languages through commentary. The researcher aggregated 8,850 comments from the most popular videos across 10 unnamed genres of film and television hosted on YouTube. Popularity was defined by the number of comments a video received. These aggregated comments were filtered by exchanges on language and culture in the videos, resulting in 2,840 comments for deeper analysis.  </p>

<p>By focusing on cultural and linguistic exchanges, the study demonstrated that language-based triggers across languages led to comments that were rich with interactions between parties. In turn, these interactions appeared to focus on the exchange of information as well as the negotiation of meaning regarding specific pieces of content. Exploring further YouTube-based interactions across a more diverse linguistic backdrop could prove useful for learning language as well as for developing cross-cultural understanding. </p>
