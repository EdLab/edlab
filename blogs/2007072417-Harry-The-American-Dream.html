          <p>
            “Stupify!” you shout, as you jump from your twin size bed onto the floor, in your tighty-whiteys, bed sheets tied to your neck and a twig in hand. You're battling your arch nemesis within the realm of your imagination (and the privacy of your own room), as you try to live out your life long dream of attending Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and becoming a powerful wizard. 
<P>
Kids (and many adults) look into storybooks to find adventure and to escape the world around them. They dive into the lives of their heroes, and create an experience for themselves that defies the laws of our physical world. Flying cars, mystical creatures and far away lands all seem like a distant vision in a child's imagination–until now that is…<a href= http://harrypotter.warnerbros.co.uk/hogwarts/index_mascot.html>Warner Bros. entertainment</a> announced plans to partner with Universal Orland Resorts to transform the fantasy books of Harry Potter into a reality! Thousands and millions of fans who only dreamt of visiting Hogwarts and the beautiful reality of Rowling's stories, will now be able to experience their greatest wishes come to life in the <a href=http://media.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/>Wizarding World of Harry Potter</a>! 
<P>
Expected to open late in 2009 into early 2010, the attraction will contain shops, restaurants, and rides. Of course this <a href= http://www.chiff.com/a/harry-potter-theme-park.htm>theme park</a> would be nothing without the enchanting Forbidden Forest, the Village of Hogsmeade, and the Hogwarts Castle itself. The theme park will cover over 20 acres of land, and to ensure the authenticity of both the film and books, Stuart Craig who produced the designs for Harry Potter movies will also be designing the scenery for the theme park. 
<P>
And Harry's success within the United States will not be short lived. With over 20 artists and designers devoted to creating the locations, rides, attractions, and shows that will be “second to none,” Harry Potter will be around for years to come in the form of a theme park. These artists are devoted to working on the attractions with the best of their creative abilities so that the fans will not be disappointed. In order to make the theme park as realistic as possible researchers have been studying European cathedrals and English Landmarks so as to create an authentic Hogwarts Castle. 
<P>
In comparison to the limitless boundaries of our minds there are limitations, of course, to how “real” it can be. The technological advances we have to this day are still no match for our imaginations, especially since they exist in two different dimensions. Still, some things that are possible to create and I think should be included within the theme park are:
1.	the creation of a real live quidditch match
2.	the sorting hat, sorting each “visitor” into their houses
3.	the specifics of the castle and the grounds
4.	the mystical creatures said to be in the Forbidden Forest
5.	house colors and shields (Griffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff)
6.	the supposed shops and treats that the village of Hogsmeade has to offer
7.	a real lesson of potions, defense against the dark arts, divination, or transfiguration
8.	Diagon Alley where you can purchase robes, caldrons and wands!
9.	a train ride on platform 9 Â¾ 
10.	moving pictures, posters and the daily prophet on every lamp post!(This should be easily achieved, just use flat screen TV's with recorded imaging) 
<P>
With the opening of the Harry Potter theme park, we as U.S. citizens can clearly state that the American dream is a reality. From our imaginations, to the big screen and now into physical form that we can touch and see! Harry has made it possible for us to live the “American Dream”. Now the child leaping off beds fighting off dementors, may now land in a world that is second only to his/her own fantasies.
