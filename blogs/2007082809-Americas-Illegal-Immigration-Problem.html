          <p>
            Illegal immigration is a very complex situation in America. There is an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. They cross international borders illegally or stay past their visas' intended departure date. A recent event has caused a stir in the news and with the public. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20414211/site/newsweek/">Elvira Arellano</a> was recently deported to her home country, Mexico. She was taking refuge in the Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago. After a year's worth of hiding, Arellano went to Los Angeles, California to speak out for the rights of illegal immigrants to reporters.  The “New Sanctuary Movement” is the group that supports her. That group has religious and political supporters all around the United States who hide illegal immigrants from Immigration and Naturalization Service officials. The illegal immigrants work hard to earn enough money to feed and shelter their children who are born in America. Arellano's 8-year-old son, Saul, is being looked after by Reverend Walter Coleman. They are going to Mexico to see Saul's mother. There will be a march in Los Angeles calling for her return to the U.S. Many protests have been planned for the coming month. Supporters hope that immigration policies will change in the near future. In June, the bill to give contingent visas to illegal immigrants was shot down in the U.S. Senate. In recent months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have raided workshops and plants to deport illegal immigrants. This would separate them from their family members who are here legally. 

Some soldiers in Iraq have partners who are in America illegally. Since the month of July, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19536767/">Army Spec. Alex Jimenez</a> was M.I.A. after his squad was attacked. His wife came to America in 2001 and they married in 2004. An immigration court judge stopped her deportation and granted her permanent residence in America, mainly because her husband served in Iraq and had gone missing. Other soldiers are also concerned because some of their family members are in America illegally. 

The U.S. has become dependent on laborers who cross its borders. Many carpentry organizations and workshops, for example, hire immigrants because employers do not have to pay them minimum wage. 

The United States needs to act swiftly in order to mitigate this problem and make it fair for everyone.
