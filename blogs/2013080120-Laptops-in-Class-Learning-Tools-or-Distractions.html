<p><b>Title:</b> Laptop multitasking hinders classroom learning for both users and nearby peers (2012) <br>

<p><b>Authors:</b>Faria Sana, Tina Weston, Nicholas J. Cepeda
</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254">Science Direct</a> </p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Do students who multitask on laptops during course time display lower levels of comprehension and performance, and does this behavior affect those around them?<p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Teachers who encourage students to use laptops in class recognize that these are tools capable of increasing student motivation and engagement; however, without self-discipline, students can easily become distracted by social networking and non-course-related platforms. This study, performed by researchers at McMaster University and York University in Canada, sought to assess the affects of multitasking on students’ abilities to comprehend course material through two experiments.</p> 

<p>The first experiment tested whether laptops affected learning by measuring the performance of 40 students on comprehension tests after a 45 minute lecture on meteorology. While all students were required to take lecture notes, an experimental group was also required to complete a series of online tasks meant to recreate the type of distractions typically created by online browsing (i.e., what is on TV tonight?). The second experiment tested whether multitasking negatively affected surrounding peers. After placing some participants in seats within direct view of the lecture and others in view of students performing multiple tasks, researchers issued comprehension tests to both groups, hypothesizing that the latter group would receive lower scores. 

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results are consistent with those of other studies on devices and distractions. A comparison of test scores in the first experiment indicated that students who multitasked averaged 11% lower on comprehension tests than students who focused solely on note-taking. After participants in the second experiment completed short exams, students who were in view of a multitasking peer averaged 17% lower than those within direct view of the lecture. The results demonstrate how essential learning processes like encoding during learning, allocating attention resources, and retrieving information are all negatively affected by distractions, whether looking at a screen directly or peripherally. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study, and others like it that highlight the detrimental effects of laptops, tablets, and smartphones, raise serious questions about how to integrate technology effectively and manage classroom behavior. Educators who are reluctant to allow devices in the classroom may feel vindicated by these findings; however, this study also presents the opportunity to discuss methods of effective student engagement. There are many advantages to typing notes, including the ability to capture more content, organize it logically, and access it across multiple devices. Despite the risk of becoming distracted by irrelevant material that laptops pose, it may benefit teachers and students to implement more interactive and engaging uses for technology, rather than persisting with teacher-focused classrooms where a student’s only responsibility is to take notes.</p>
