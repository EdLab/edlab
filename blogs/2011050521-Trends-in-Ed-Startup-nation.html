          <p>
            All startups have at least one thing in common: They were the brainchild of a very motivated, ambitious, entrepreneurial spirit. Â These spirits are being sighted in <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/rejecting-wall-street-graduates-turn-to-entrepreneurship/"> increasing numbers on college campuses</a> nationwide. To go along with this,<a href="http://www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/entrepreneurship-in-american-higher-education.aspx">the number of entrepreneurship classes and programs are also increasing.</a> Â  Perhaps it's a response to the Wall Street crash; more young people are running from the dismal corporate life to forge a more custom made life of their own. Or perhaps college-aged kids are inspired by the multi-billion dollar startups that were founded by people their age. Whatever the reason, let this period forever be known asÂ the "Age of the Entrepreneur."Â 

Countless schools and programs now have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=business+plan+competition&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&client=safari"> business plan competitions</a> that incite young people to think beyond the idea, to make it a product and bring it to market. There are bootcamps and workshops that train students on how to make that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq0tan49rmc&feature=youtube_gdata_player"> perfect pitch,</a> <a href=" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbysbP7Q0aM&feature=youtube_gdata_player"> how to write a business plan,</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glVAR4ohfBU&feature=youtube_gdata_player"> how to impress investors. </a>If you followed any of the links in that last sentence, you'll see that numerous YouTube videos are also dedicated to the subject. Â  Â 

Whether they are going to college to learn how to start a business or whether they are <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5559"> dropping out of college </a>to... well, learn how to start a business... the fact remains: Entrepreneurship has inspired the young minds of a generation and it has instilled in all of us the idea that the "next big thing" is waiting for us to make it so.
