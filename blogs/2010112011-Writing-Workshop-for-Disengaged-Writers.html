            Another workshop that really interested me was the one presented by Chris Lehman called “Win Over Your Disengaged Writers: Tips for Supporting the Writers Who Have Nothing To Write and Are Done Already.” Chris places disengaged writers into four categories: students “allergic to the writing process,” students who “just can’t find anything to write about,” students who only “talk, talk, talk,” and students who “write to know if it’s alright.”

Under each category of disengaged writers, Chris offers specific teaching techniques, targeting students’ specific problems and challenges in writing. Allergic writers are writers who dislike writing. In helping these disengaged writers, teachers have them set both qualitative and quantitative goals. In setting quantitative goals, students think of as many story ideas that they can collect and write about one of them as much as they possibly can. One technique in getting students to write as much as possible about an idea is the “dot and X trick”—point to the last word on the page, slide your finger next to the margin, and put a dot or “X” there. Then, ask the student, “How much more do you think you can write?” The student will then put another dot or “X” down the page where he/she thinks he/she can write up to. This technique is repeated several times, pushing students to come up with as many things that they can possibly say about an idea. Another technique in getting students to write more is by having them compare how much they have written with a partner, setting up competition between students. As for setting qualitative goals, students use what they read in books as motivation for their writing. Through imitation of texts, such as style and characterization, students develop their own writing.

In addressing students who can’t find anything to write about, teachers bring their own stories into the classroom as models for writing. Asking us to think about the kinds of writing we actually do in real life and the kinds of writing we have our students do in the classroom, Chris says that writing in both contexts should be harmonious. We should strive to bring into the classroom the kinds of writing we actually write about and read in real life. One technique that teachers can use to make this happen is by taking a story in their adult life and changing the players in the story. For example, perhaps, I am dealing with a difficult co-worker. For my students, I might substitute my co-workers for my friends or family members, whoever my students can relate to. This technique will allow students who can’t find anything to write about to write about something that they have experienced. Another technique to get these kinds of
students engaged in the writing process is by holding a “compliment conference” with them. In a compliment conference, the teacher finds one specific thing in the student’s writing that the student is not aware of and making the biggest deal of it. This encourages students to keep on doing what they are already doing, but working to make it better.

In getting the “talkers” engaged in the writing process, teachers can do a number of things. Teachers can set aside time for students to talk with a partner after they had done some writing. The time set aside for talking, called “Writer’s Talk Time,” establishes a set routine in the classroom. Teachers need to tell students that the more they write, the more they will have to share. During “Writer’s Talk Time,” teachers need to keep students on task in their conversations by having them underline specific lines in each other’s papers to discuss. If students feel that they must talk during the time that they should be writing, then they can go to the “Talk Spot.” Make sure that there are at most two spots in the classroom where students can go and talk. Set a timer (2 minutes) so that the students at the “Talk Spot” do not end up talking the whole period. Also, have students fill out a record sheet: students’ names, purpose of conference, and where in the students’ writing the teacher will find evidence of students’ conversation. Through these techniques, Chris says that “talkers” will be more engaged in the writing process.

For the students who always need to know if they are doing it right, basically, writing for the teacher and not for themselves, teachers need to have tough love. When dependent students raise their hands, say to them, “Just do what you think you have to do and I’ll come back later.” Teachers may choose to ignore hands altogether or acknowledge them, but never end up helping them. Teachers can also tell students to ask the person sitting next to them for help. In particular, these kinds of writers need to know that the writing process is a messy, recursive one. Teachers should model their own writing and show students the strategies used to work out problems.

I found Chris’s workshop useful in many ways; the techniques were specific and targeted to particular kinds of writers. I especially liked the teaching technique “Writer’s Talk Time” and using mentor texts. What are some of your thoughts about this workshop? Did it give you some good ideas that you can bring into your own classroom? Did you find any troubling? Do you have any questions that I can clarify? Please let me know!
