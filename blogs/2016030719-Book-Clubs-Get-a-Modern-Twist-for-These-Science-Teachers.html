<p>Teachers: if the last time you were in book club was when your grade school English teacher stuck you with five other kits to discuss <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, you may want to consider starting a <i>video</i> club. Researchers from Vanderbilt University recently published a study on improving teaching practices through forming small groups of teachers to review each other’s video recordings of their classrooms.</p>
 
<p>There is an important distinction between content knowledge—for science subjects that would include chemistry, biology, and other specific specializations within the field—and pedagogical content knowledge, which relates more to <i>how to teach</i> that content to students. In this study focused on preservice teachers, that distinction is important, as many teachers are still in the process of improving their instructional practices. The authors argue that video clubs provide teachers with a fitting environment to have organic conversations about teaching practices in order to support each other in pedagogical growth and improvement.</p>
 
<p>The participants—preservice secondary science teachers from an education program at a university—met weekly to discuss the videos through an interpretive, rather than an evaluative, lens. This alternative perspective meant dissecting the clips for evidence of student thinking and learning, rather than directly critiquing the teacher in the video. Throughout the session, the video was played, paused, and rewound, leaving room for comments and questions.</p>
 
<p>The data from this study reveals that preservice teachers in the club were able to work together to unpack problems or important instances from their footage and work together collaboratively to discuss analyses and possible solutions to common problems. The researchers suggest that it's not useful for teachers to sit through lectures that attempt to teach pedagogical practices. Instead instructors benefit more from the open-ended video club format, where they not only analyze pedagogy, but also probe deeper for more robust understandings of the content, which allows them to think of more innovative ways to teach curriculum to their students.</p>
