Cochrane Collegiate Academy was listed as one of the 30 worst-performing schools in North Carolina in the 2006-2007 school year. Now it has more than doubled what their percent on grade level was since then through <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/stw-school-turnaround-student-engagement-video">focused instructional strategies and over 90 hours of professional development for the teachers.</a>

The academic faciliator at this school came up with Interactive Learning Non-Negotiables that teachers must incorporate into their classrooms:

- <b>Essential Question:</b> One "big-idea" question of the lesson that lets the students know what they should learn from the lesson.

- <b>Activating Strategy:</b> Every activity in the lesson has a purpose and solid pegagogy, not just added into the lesson as a filler or because it'll be fun for the students.

- <b>Limited Lecture:</b> Statistics say that students can only maintain their attention span for their age + 3 minutes. 

- <b>Graphic Organizer:</b> Students must be able to conceptualize what they are learning and teachers need to know if students grasped abstract concepts.

The original title of this video is "How to Engage Underperforming Students." Technically, these non-negotiables are strategies to engage all students, so why specify underperforming students? Some blame budget cuts and lack of resources for failing schools, which is a perfectly valid concern about the future welfare of students. However, Cochrane Collegiate Academy shows us that lack of funding is not the reason for failure. It is possible to cultivate high-performing student minds from just simple and focused pedagogy.
