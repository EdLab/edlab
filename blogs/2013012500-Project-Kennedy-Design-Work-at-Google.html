            A few years ago I blogged about <a href="http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html">the departure of Douglas Bowman from Google as Visual Design Lead</a>. Long story short, he left Google because of the emphasis on data and how he believed it was impacting design decisions (a "design philosophy that lives or dies strictly by the sword of data")</i>. Well, Google never did end up identifying a "grand leader of design." Instead, a small team of Google designers (UXA) laid our a vision for Google products that enabled various product teams to develop consistent design. 

How did it this happen? According to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution">the story</a>, it all started when Larry Page became CEO in 2011 and Project Kennedy. Some highlights:

<blockquote>
"Larry said ‘hey everyone, we're going to redesign all of our products,'" recalls Jon Wiley, lead designer on Google Search. Wiley and co had just two months to give Google a fresh coat of paint, and to start thinking holistically about how Google as a whole was perceived. "We had a mandate to make this all look good," Wiley says."

- "Historically at Google there were pockets of designers that said ‘let's bring all of Google together into one beautiful, amazing design,' but because of the way Google is set up – for speed – […] it was hard for any one team to push that Google-wide,"

- "Google's senior designers gathered to decide how a few design principles would be applied evenly and tastefully to dozens of products used by over a billion people."

 "At Google we want to move fast, so a lot of these various products grew up on their own," says Wiley, and so before Kennedy they didn't abide by one design standard across the board. "We had a lot of simple and useful products," Wiley says, "so we turned our focus towards making these products more beautiful, but also more consistent as a suite of products."

- "Google may not have a Jony Ive, but there is nevertheless a coherent process for laying out a design vision across all these multiple teams and platforms."

"…it's all about teams iterating together and sharing information, and making sure we end up in a sweet spot where our design language is very similar, fits well into each platform, but at the same time keeps being Google."

"... the way its work turns into actual product is a curious mix of informality and relentless work ethic. Speaking more generally about how design meetings go at Google, Wiley says "We get together, we have lunch, and we talk endlessly."

"Larry Page mandated that there be a new design focus to get the ball rolling, but instead of micromanaging at every step he let his employees to do the rest – guided by an empowered, core team of designers. They organized themselves in a typically Google structure: cross-discipline, informal, but driven to achieve a goal."

</blockquote>

The story should sound familiar to EdLabers because we have been living through similar changes at EdLab (e.g., relentless focus on 3 Foundational Projects, EdLab Alpha, EdLab Account, EdLab CAS). Just two weeks ago our <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=user/3286">Chief Design Officer Daniel Um</a> led the EdLab D&R team through an exercise around the EdLab Account creation/login pages. There is still work to be done but as the story highlights the institutionalization of a common design framework/language undergirded by a strong vision for "products" is essential to our continued progress.
