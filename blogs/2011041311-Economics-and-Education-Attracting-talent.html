          <p>
            I'm keeping it light today. I was reading some <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/04/michael-burry-notes-from-vanderbilt-speech/">notes</a> on  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry">Michael Burry</a>'s speech at Vanderbilt. Not much in here for us ed-folk but I found this line particularly striking: 

"He was attracted to investing because he was evaluated on performance not whether or not he looked people in the eye or was socially adept"

The first reason people give for the talent drain to finance is the scale of salaries. In fact, that probably is the first reason for why so many are attracted to finance (especially in my Columbia bubble). But as far as secondary reasons for entering finance, Burry's point is certainly worth noting. The ability to objectively evaluate one's performance is unique to only a few industries (finance, professional sports, manufacturing). Evaluating performance in healthcare and education is hella difficult. Yet this should only encourage us ed-folk to build better evaluation systems; talent isn't exactly flocking towards the ed sector currently, as unfortunate as that is. The evaluation systems in place currently are not nearly comprehensive or robust enough for anyone to take seriously the idea of increased accountability . Yet in a future where there is a sound evaluation system, I can certainly see more talented individuals entering the education sector simply because they know they can prove their abilities objectively.
