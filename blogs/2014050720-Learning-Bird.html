<p><a href="https://www.learningbird.com/index">Learning Bird</a> is a platform for educators, parents, and students to share and benefit from a consortium of curriculum and textbook-based digital lessons. Learning Bird provides a space for teachers to share, promote, and profit from their lessons while helping perpetuate a collaborative learning environment. This collection of lessons also gives students the ability to choose what teaching style resonates most with their unique learning style. Students choose their location and textbook, and are automatically paired with lessons appropriate to their local curriculum. In addition, parents and educators alike are able to monitor a student’s progress, manage important deadlines, and receive detailed reporting on overall student performance.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Learning Bird promotes a uniquely collaborative environment designed to give students the opportunity to learn the same concept in multiple ways. Students can choose from an appropriate pool of lessons based on their geographic location and textbook assignment, ensuring relevant and valuable topics. With Learning Bird’s vast collection of perspectives and teaching methods, students are sure to find a style that suits their learning needs.</p>

<p>Learning Bird is a great tool for educators, too. With Learning Bird, teachers have an online outlet to showcase, and profit from, all of their hard work in the classroom. Educators can help facilitate learning for students across North America with their own digital database of lessons while viewing other educators’ teaching methods to improve their own styles.</p>

<p>Parents and educational administrators can also benefit from Learning Bird’s unique platform. The tool features data collection and analysis metrics to help parents and administrators track student progress all while keeping important dates, deadlines, and schedules readily accessible. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although this program promotes educator compensation, the exact amount each teacher will receive for his or her lesson is unclear. The site advertises "up to 50%" revenue share, but the "up to" could mean significantly less than what teachers expect. It is unclear whether contributors can set parameters on who can view their work and this could lead to worries over plagiarism or unauthorized use of one’s work. Students run the risk of learning a concept in a way that their own teacher does not support (e.g., learning a different way of solving a math problem than what is expected), which could lead to issues down the line. It is also not clear if Learning Bird is assessing each lesson for quality and accuracy, which could also prove unsettling.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Learning Bird is a valuable resource for both students and teachers. When used in conjunction with traditional classroom lessons, the tool can really benefit students who may be struggling with a particular concept. Learners should not rely solely on this method of teaching, but it is definitely useful for those looking for a different perspective on the same topic. This is a great resource for teachers and educators interested in sharing their methods with a wider audience while also profiting from their work. It also gives educators a place to create a portfolio of their work that can then be used for professional development and collaboration.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Learning Bird gives teachers and students new opportunities to share and profit from their hard work in the classroom.</p>
