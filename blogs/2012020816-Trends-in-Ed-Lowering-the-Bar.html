          <p>
            A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/education/despite-focus-on-data-standards-for-diploma-may-still-lack-rigor.html?ref=education">NY Times article</a> describes one way in which the data-driven education reform initiatives have failed miserably. Two of these data-driven education reform programs are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act">No Child Left Behind Act</a> by former president George Bush, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_top">Race to the Top</a> program by our current president Barack Obama. One way to see why they have failed is to look at the results of the New York English Regents exam, and how these exams were graded. One part of this two day, three hour exam, contains two short response questions, which is scored from 0 to 2 points. The problem here is that some of these student responses that are riddled with grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and nonsensical questions are getting a score of 1. While in reality these responses show that students don't have a good grasp of basic writing concepts, and probably deserve a lower grade. 

This type of grading could potentially have great negative ramifications. The one that immediately comes to mind is that students will go o college believing that their writing is up to par, and when they find out that it's not, they'll need to take additional classes which will add to their tuition. Instead of focusing on changing the way we grade these tests, or change the requirements needed to pass this test, school administrators should focus on better preparing our students to communicate through writing.
