<p>Video games can change our social lives and friendships and foster specific characteristics or skills within us. For instance, I know I am a more competitive person because of the hundreds of hours I spent playing Nintendo 64 with my two older brothers while growing up. But video games can also affect us in deeper ways than that; neuroscientists claim that they can physically alter our brains.</p>
 
<p>While many studies focus on the negative effects of video games, such as exposure to violence and risk of addiction, a recent literature review traced the positive changes that gaming can develop in a person’s brain. In combing over 100 different studies, the researchers compiled a list of six mental skills that gaming can help develop in an individual; they are: attention, visuospatial skills, cognitive workload distribution, cognitive control, skill acquisition, and reward processing.</p>
 
<p>Across many studies, there was much evidence to suggest that gamers cultivate a greater sense of selective attention than non-gamers, meaning that they are better able to stay focused on one particular task in spite of distractions. In addition, gaming seemed to improve players’ visuospatial skills. This allows them to recognize and manipulate visual stimuli, such as navigating between a map and a road.</p>
 
<p>Playing video games was also tied to greater cognitive workload capabilities; this involves being able to process many different stimuli at the same time, which is often required in more complex games. Gaming has also been connected to greater cognitive control, meaning that players are able to adapt to changing situations quickly, implement alternate strategies, and solve puzzles. Finally, gaming leads to greater skill acquisition and reward processing. This entails a connection between learning and reward systems, which ultimately improves players’ performance levels in gaming.</p>
 
<p>Overall, this literature review highlighted some of the positive developmental effects that gaming can have on a person’s brain. While expert gamers had more developed abilities in these areas, even short and controlled experiments with gaming were shown to improve these specific skills. This demonstrates that while there are some negative risks to gaming, the positive effects could be significant enough to make them useful for learning.</p>
