          <p>
            I've been thinking about ways to increase traction for <a href="http://researchbroker.tc.columbia.edu/">ResearchBroker</a>. Since it is a minimal viable product, should our focus be on improving the UI/UX, adding features or customer development? I came across this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070701074943/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the-pmarca-gu-2.html">article</a> that shares some wisdom on what contributes to a product's/startup's success.

Is it the team, the product itself or the market that correlates with success ? And, what is most dangerous: a bad team, a weak product, or a poor market?

With all permutations of these factors analyzed, it turns out that product/market fit is the single most important element that determines the success of a startup/product and is often times most ignored.

But how can you determine if you have achieved a product/market fit ? According to the <a href="http://www.startup-marketing.com/the-startup-pyramid/">Startup Pyramid</a>, we should ask existing users of our products how they would feel if they could no longer use the product. Around 40 % of users should feel that they'd be "very disappointed" if they did not have your product to use. 

The product/market fit should be measured as soon as possible because it will be critical to operating your product. If you have not achieved product/market fit yet, you should focus all your resources on improving the percentage of users who will be "very disappointed" without your product. You should engage the existing and new users to learn how to develop your product into a "must have". Sometimes, it could be as simple as highlighting a promising characteristic of your product, but often times, it may require significant product revisions or even starting your product idea from the beginning. 

It is important to be flexible and open while understanding a fit for your product in the market.

Once the product/market fit is established, the company should then focus on scaling up the business.

Also, it is interesting to quote here, that the employment of market research analysts is expected to grow 41 percent from 2010 to 2020, which will be much <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Business-and-Financial/Market-research-analysts.htm#tab-6">faster than the average</a> for all occupations.

I think what this means for ResearchBroker is that we need to focus on customer development, continuous outreach, and one-on-one, to really understand the audience and grow our user base. 

If you have any outreach ideas or people who you think might be interested in using <a href="http://researchbroker.tc.columbia.edu/">ResearchBroker</a>, please connect them with me or Janice !
