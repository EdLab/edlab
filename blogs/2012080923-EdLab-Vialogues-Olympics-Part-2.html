            This is the second part of the Vialogues Olympics. That myself and my fellows EdLabbers took part in. As Duncan already created a blog about the first four people, I will be also talking about the last five people, also describing their videos as well.

Haymar Lim

This first Vialogue was created by Haymar and it focused on the universe, basically describing specific things about the universe.

He followed that up with the Human Genome Project Surprises, which talks about human genes.

Khalil Abubakar

The next participant of this Olympic was Khalil. His first Vialogue was titled The TSA is Out Of Control. This video talked looked at the Transportation Security Administration agency.

<iframe src="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play_embedded/4358/?width=540" width="540" height="700" style="border:hidden;overflow:visible;"></iframe>

His second video was called Pro Choice, not Pro Abortion, which looked at both sides of the abortion debate.

Costa Lales

The next participant is Costa and his first Vialogue was called 2000 year old computer. This was about a recreated ancient computer, which I found really interesting. 

<iframe src="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play_embedded/4119/?width=540" width="540" height="700" style="border:hidden;overflow:visible;"></iframe>

He followed that up with a Vialogue called Self-Driving Car Test: Steve Mahan. I thought this Vialogue was also really interesting because it was Google's creation of a car that can drive itself.

Daniel Vergara

The next participant was Danny. His first Vialogue was about the recent tragic incident in Aurora, Colorado where a gunman opened fire on moviegoers at the premier of the Dark Knight.

<iframe src="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play_embedded/4306/?width=540" width="540" height="700" style="border:hidden;overflow:visible;"></iframe>

His next Vialogue was about SanDisk, the flash memory card company.

Mingoro Fanny

The next and last participant was Mingoro. His first Vialogue was titled “Twitter Trolling,” which looked at inappropriate comments on Twitter about a British Olympian.

<iframe src="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play_embedded/4407/?width=540" width="540" height="700" style="border:hidden;overflow:visible;"></iframe>

His next Vialogue was called Technology Transforming Education, which was about technology's impact on education.
