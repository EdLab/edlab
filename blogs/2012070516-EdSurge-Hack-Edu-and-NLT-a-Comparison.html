            Private please! 

The goal of this post is to compare two leading educational technology sites and their newsletters, EdSurge and Hack Education with our soon-to-be released EdLab masterpiece... New Learning Times!  Please do not view this entry as the definitive guide, and instead, please check-out these resources and add your own thoughts in the comments below!  We will have <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7811">upcoming seminars</a> devoted to New Learning Times as well!  If you are completely unsure of what NLT will encompass here is my take (aided by Michelle and Daniel!) on what to expect:  

1) Mobile delivery with a standalone site (they will be very similar - see attachment for a sneak-peek!). 
2) Content streams will mirror the current blog (EdLab Review, Startup Spotlight etc.).
3) We have content experts across a wide variety of fields and most of all, we have Gary leading the charge.

<b>EdSurge...</b>
<b>From Newsletter to Site:</b>
Edsurge<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/</a> came onto the scene with their email-based newsletter just over 6 months ago and has taken the educational technology scene by storm.  The newsletter/site has been described by Joel Klein, EVP, News Corp. and former Chancellor, New York City public schools as, "In a world awash with information, great curators are essential. That's why EdSurge is a must read."  Following the popularity of their newsletter they created a standalone site/application <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/">EdSurge beta</a> and a dedicated <a href="http://www.edsurge.com/assets/EdSurgeInstruct001.html">"Instruct" newsletter/site</a> (confusing I know!) dedicated to educators. 

<b>The Team:</b>
EdSurge is partly funded by both 501C23 organization, <a href="http://www.lucere.org/?page_id=2">The Lucere Foundation</a>, and a grant from the Gates Foundation.  Led by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/betsy-corcoran">Betsy Corcoran</a> the team is made-up of (from their splash page),"educators, developers, innovators, and edtech fans."  

<b>Content...</b>
Content-based contributions and tips from readers seem to play a major role in the success of the site. Requests for tips and content are clearly called-out on the main site page towards the bottom, with an email address listed and linked: feedback@edsurge.com. 
Regular newsletter content streams cover the following topics: "EduPunk Underground," Venture-focused edtech startup developments, new products/apps, partnerships, edtech-focused events, jobs and more...  Newsletter content is delivered in fun, slightly tongue-in-cheek "snippets."  

The semi-standalone site (they call it an "application" b/c you login?! No corresponded app on the Apple Store?) is in beta and covers the following: products (Vialogues is listed, but without very much information) topics, organizations (Gates Foundation Etc.), schools (Mostly charters) - much of this is simply newsletter content reorganized.  Any thoughts on the Instruct Site? I felt it was more of the same.    
   
<b>Pros:</b> 
Newsletter provides fresh, useful content.  You know that their newsletter will provide some of the most current, new edtech-focused applications, events, developments in the world of "eduprenuership" and even job listings.  They really do have many ears and boots covering the ed space and seem to have someone reporting on almost all major edtech-focused conferences (From SXSWedu to MakerFaire).  I also find the simple, black & white icons used to designate categories and topics, to be both effective and distinctive.    

<b>Cons:</b>
Their newsletter(s) and new beta site/app(?!) looks absolutely awful on a mobile device (see 2 screenshots below).  By terrible I mean, endless scrolling, inappropriate aspect ratio for effective mobile viewing and links that are almost impossible to access with my smallish fingertips.  Sadly, the supposed leader in information for "innovative educators" is incompatible with the content delivery device of the future.  Smartphones.  

<b>My Takeaway:</b>
Despite a truly brilliant newsletter, their standalone site and mobile delivery are major disappointments.  Regardless of your browser, the layout seems too reliant on lists, categorization and a re-hashing of the same content featured in newsletters.  I know lists and top-level categories can provide valuable context, but it comes in this case, at the cost of deep, meaningful dives into content.  It is one thing to report the news and provide bucket lists... but if you aren't contributing to the decoding and re-visioning of this information, then you are no better than a Google search.  

<b>Relevance to NLT...</b>
EdSurge provides a great model for creating useful, bite-sized newsletter content, however, where an otherwise brilliant resource seems to fall-apart is with endless lists on their standalone site.  It is unusual that a newsletter would be the primary source of website content, and it seems that EdSurge hasn't quite figured-out how to make that work.  Regardless, NLT will feature a comprehensive database of products (BLT) and perhaps even useful visualizations that provide much needed context to otherwise useless lists.  It is worth noting that while EdSurge's site search has many advanced search options, none of them seemed helpful to me as a user (either too granular or not granular enough - any thoughts on this?). 

Finally, EdSurge has started to develop exclusive interview-based video resources to embed in their newsletter and feature on their site... (see vialogue embedded below), while a great simple, man on-the-street or conference style, they are all so similar in style and scope that I became bored after one... it could also be the production value and interview style.  I appreciate how EdTech Talks and now the new "profile" we are creating gives you both a more intimate feeling and a more highly produced experience (I might be too biased to be objective here!).  A wide assortment of high quality video-based resources seems crucial, especially, as <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7911">Daniel pointed-out recently (in relation to a potential NLT video concept)</a>, on a mobile platform.

<b>Hack Education...</b>
<b>From Site to Newsletter:</b>
Audrey Waters is a leading voice in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edupunk">"EduPunk"</a> movement and her Twitter bio is a perfect exemplar of this: "education writer, rabble-rouser, rambler, folklorist, geek, tattooed beer snob, recovering academic, lifelong learner, serial dropout, part-time badass."  Regardless of her writing style and thoughts on education, Ms. Waters has over <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters">11,000 Twitter followers</a> and has created an exhaustive <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/audreywatters/ed-tech-startups">"list"</a> of edtech startups and applications (Vialogues represents!).  As if being an "EduPunk" weren't enough Waters also pens a highly popular blog, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">Hack Education</a> and now, due to growing demand has recently launched a newsletter (Self-disclosure: I have only just subscribed to this as I usually get her content via an RSS reader and will update this post once I receive the first one!). 

<b>Content...</b>
Hack education is a classic blog.  Classic in the sense that all the typical players are there... ranging from a sidebar with blogrolls, follower icons, podcasts and links to associated content.  While the topics covered in this content seems to be randomly selected and is not clearly organized into categories, Ms. Waters makes-up for this with the quality of her work.  With in-depth screen-shot-heavy reviews (check-out this one on <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/07/03/learningjar/">LearningJar</a>) to a piece aptly named <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/03/17/what-every-techie-should-know-about-education/">"The Audrey Test: Or, What should every Techie Know about Education."</a>    

<b>Pros:</b>
What really sets Audrey's site and content apart (weekly newsletter review forthcoming!) is that she clearly favors the quality of what appears to be well-researched, in-depth coverage over quantity.  She only posts new content 1-2 times a day, but readers are definitely left eagerly (if her Twitter feed is any indication) wanting more.  

<b>Cons:</b>
The layout of her site, and lack of other voices.  With the exception of a weekly <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/02/hack-education-weekly-podcast-6-29-2012/">60-minute, podcast-based interview with an EdSurge reporter</a> (same "reporter" featured in all EdSurge's video content and the vialogue embedded above!), content is created by her.  While a "Pro" for consistency's sake, I definitely view this content as a rather skewed representation of the "real", multifaceted ed-world.  She is representing a very specific view of education, and in a time-pressed situation (most educators seem to be in this boat) I would want a more balanced editorial approach.   

<b>My Takeaway:</b>
While providing a hard-hitting look at "hot-button" topics ranging from alternative credentialing to robots in the classroom, you know you are getting the leading-edge view, if a bit too "fringe" at times.  While being an "EduPunk" may be cool and generate followers, the reality of life in American schools is anything but.  

<b>Relevance to NLT...</b>
Ms. Waters is a "recovering academic." Sounds exciting and edgy, but does this mean she also put time in the schoolyard trenches? Check-out <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/cv.html">her CV</a> - which she gamely shares in the "About" section of her blog.  And while she has taught about a dozen college-level classes as a GA, classroom experience beyond higher ed is limited. Does this really matter?

<b>Final, NLT Takeaways...</b> 
<b>Gary is our Secret Sauce (or at least a main ingredient!)</b>
We have all had the experience of attending school in one form or another and this might be enough to make one an first-hand expert on what is "broken" about education.  Regardless, NLT will be truly unique in that that our content is created by designers, programers educators (with a wide-variety of experience) and helmed by Gary Natriello, our seasoned expert in the fields of both higher ed and assessment.  What all the other sites and newsletters seem to lack and New Learning Times will possess, is someone on-board with both deep experience in the classroom as well, as a vision for a classroom that hasn't yet been imagined.
