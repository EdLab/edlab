(1898) [<a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/viewfile/35133">http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/ home.php/viewfile/35133</a>][/caption]However, looking at these increasingly long gone people, I find it hard not to wonder what the, or a, library's role might have been in sending them forth into a world increasingly long gone.  And certainly the question may well be asked of the Gottesman Libraries' role in helping launch the soon-t0-be departed class of 2015.  Our hope is to have had an effect, an influence, on our friends the students' ability to make sense of the information world, or worlds, they confront already, or will be confronting.  How much does this relate to what their predecessors experienced, leaving or arriving elsewhere?  Was it a different world entirely?  Intuitively we think we know the answer, though to some extent we will probably never know with any degree of certainty.

<ul>
	<li>Senior Librarians and Services Associates fielded 1,277 in-person and telephone reference queries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Services librarians received and responded to 940 queries of various kinds submitted via the library’s email Support Request service, with a growing number of additional queries handled by Services Associates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Research and information services librarians provided 53 research consultations to individuals or small groups during the Spring.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Library Services presented nine course-specific library information sessions, either in the classroom or in library spaces, for a total of 158 students.</li>
</ul>
And what follows is a sampling of research topics and reference queries for which TC students requested  consultations this spring:
