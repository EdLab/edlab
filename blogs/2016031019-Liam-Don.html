Liam Don is co-founder and Chief Product Officer at <a href="http://bit.ly/1T978Hs">ClassDojo</a>. He earned a first-class degree in computer science from Durham, after which he was one of the core game developers at Jagex, creators of Runescape. He then undertook a computer science Ph.D. focused on in-classroom education technologies, which he left to build ClassDojo with his co-founder Sam Chaudhary.</p> 

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>We’ve always believed that change will come from the bottom-up: teachers, parents, and students. That came, in part, from my co-founder Sam Chaudhary’s experience as a teacher and my experience working in a research group focused on classroom technology. So when Sam and I started ClassDojo, we began by asking teachers what their most difficult challenges were, and we tried to understand the problems that were most emotionally draining at the end of a long day. I believe that our focus on true pain points has been the driver of our trajectory as a company and, to this day, it’s how we approach product development. Our recent work around Growth Mindset stemmed from similar research; spending time in classrooms and speaking to teachers helped us better understand how they thought about social and emotional learning (SEL) teaching and how we could best support it.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>ClassDojo is founded on the belief that education will change when teachers, parents, and students are given the power to work together effectively. We think this will happen when classrooms turn into communities that span home and school. For us, communities are where relationships develop, a deep sense of culture is fostered, and ideas can be brought to life and easily shared. That sense of community is what we hope to help create around every classroom—because when people are part of a shared community and culture, it’s much easier to bring about change.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The trend I find most exciting is that increasingly bottom-up technology is getting into the hands of teachers. We are part of that trend, but we’re not the only ones—I’m seeing a huge shift toward teacher choice in what tools and software are deployed. Now that great consumer products have become so widely adopted, we’ll see an increase in expectations for the quality of the software we use in classrooms. Teachers will expect software to be easy to use, and administrators will expect for that software to take radically less professional development time to roll out. That increase in usability, combined with the public sector pushing for more efficacy and nimble solutions, will lead to an edtech landscape that evolves faster. I hope to see such rapid iteration leading to a substantive impact on learning outcomes.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>We’re at a really exciting moment for our company right now—we started out helping to build positive cultures within classrooms and increase teacher and parent communication. The thing that’s been so amazing to watch is how quickly we’ve grown—all through word of mouth—to more than 12,500 districts in the US. Now that we have this platform, we’re exploring our ability to enable access to transformative ideas and information. That’s how our recent work with Stanford PERTS came about. We developed a series of short videos and home/classroom discussion guides on the concept of Growth Mindset and rolled them out on the ClassDojo platform. The reaction has been even greater than we had expected—we had 400,000 views after two-and-a-half weeks. We’re now figuring out what that next phase will be. How can we keep delivering evidence-based research and ideas? If we can deliver these ideas to teachers at scale and let them choose what ideas work for their classroom, we think you’ll really see that bottom-up change take place.</p>
