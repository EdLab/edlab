Dr. Margaret Honey describes inspiring a great love of learning and creative thinking as pivotal to education, "...they should be inspired to embrace learning as a life-long enterprise," and no one more clearly embodies this ideal than her. After a career that has taken her from the early digital technology and early computer-based "edu-tainment" trenches at Children’s Television Workshop (now called Sesame Workshop) to the team responsible for creating the ground-breaking PBS program, <i><a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/13551">Voyage of the Mimi</a></i>, and now, as President and CEO of  <a href="http://nysci.org/">New York Hall of Science</a>, creating innovative STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) learning opportunities is at the core of her work.  Dr. Honey has served as vice president of the Education Development Center and as Director of the Center for Children and Technology. She has presented her work to Congress, authored countless articles, chapters and books and holds a bachelors degree from Hampshire College and a doctorate in Developmental Psychology from Columbia University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I have always been a learner that is most comfortable pressing against the boundaries of disciplines.  No doubt, I owe much of this sensibility to my upbringing and particularly my father.  He believed deeply in the power of science to help us adapt, rework, and ultimately create a more just and productive world.  At the same time, he spent much of his career deliberating and working through the natural tensions that are so clearly at the center of what it means to be human – tensions that involve trying to reconcile the rational with the irrational, science with religion, efficacy with determinism, pleasure with responsibility. My father helped me to understand the importance of complexity, and the importance of embracing contradictory ideas that can often be generative of new insights. 
<p>
How did this translate into my more formal educational trajectory?  In high school there was the English teacher who introduced me to A.S. Neill’s <i>Summerhill School</i>; and then the guidance counselor who listened to me talk, probably endlessly, about Summerhill and told me to look at Hampshire College. At Hampshire I was given the freedom and the tools to think and work deeply on issues that were of interest to me.  I learned those critical habits of mind that continue to inform what I do day in and day out.  And, when I got to Columbia and joined the program in developmental psychology, my mentor, John Broughton, fed my appetite to think and work beyond the boundaries of my chosen field.  I logged a lot of hours in the philosophy department, taking courses in hermeneutics and phenomenology with the late Jim Cummings. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> The year was 1980. I was a graduate student and I needed to find a way to support myself and go to school.  One of the students in the developmental psychology program worked at Children’s Television Workshop (now called Sesame Workshop), and she offered me a job in a new division they were starting called the Computer Workshop.  Computers were brand new and I was deeply intrigued.  The Computer Workshop was at the leading edge of making some of the earliest "edutainment" products. My first assignment was to do pre-production research with young people.  I spent the summer at a computer camp in eastern Connecticut where we engaged kids as our informants, testing different genres of games – shoot-em-ups, art and design tools, build-your-own games, logic games, and fantasy role-playing games.  The later category fascinated me – fantasy role-playing games were micro-worlds that kids could climb inside of and make their own.  They were also microcosms of many of the gender prescriptions that were beginning to intrigue me.  I went on to do my dissertation research on the most popular fantasy role-playing game of the time – <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry">Wizardry</a></i>.  My thesis, which I titled <i>Play in the Phallic Universe</i>, brought together my interests in feminist psychoanalytic theory, play, and interpretive methodologies.  Modeled on <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Dnd/">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, Wizardry was a world that was gendered in the extreme. 
<p>
I stayed at the Workshop until 1985 when I had a chance to join a small research and development group at Bank Street College of Education.  I came to Bank Street to work on an award winning television show, called the <i>Voyage of the Mimi</i>. I had the profound experience of connecting with a community whose core values felt akin to my own fledgling beliefs about education and the growth and development of children.  I remember telling a friend that I felt I had found a home.  Bank Street was a place where there was genuine debate and discussion on significant issues, where people did work that was inspired and creative and yet deeply grounded in what children and schools could embrace.  There was a commitment to respect, recognize, and nurture the strengths and possibilities that reside in everyone, especially children.  Bank Street had a profound and lasting impact on my career – to this day I carry with me a set of core values that I strongly associate with the institution.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> My goal is to ensure that our work, when placed in the hands of skilled educators, is <i>irresistible</i> to children and adults and motivates deeper learning. There’s a story I think about nearly every day that set the bar for me.<br>
<p>
When I first went to Bank Street I was responsible for the formative research for <i>The Voyage of the Mimi</i>. One of our research sites was Debbie Meier’s Central Park East School. Bruce Kanze, who was a 5th-6th grade teacher in the school, had designed his entire curriculum around the ancient Maya. Bruce’s classroom was a wonderful learning environment; he was a masterful teacher; and the kids were deeply engaged in their projects – making hieroglyphic quilts with seniors in the local center, building Maya temples, and helping us create the games that would eventually become the software program <i>Maya Math</i>.  The students anticipated my arrival every week because I was the lady who brought the video.  They loved the show – C.T., Quiche, all the characters – and they could hardly stand it when I would leave them each week with yet another cliffhanger.
<p>
I remember the first time I really understood the connection between what we were creating in <i>Mimi</i> and its impact on student learning.  During the production of the episode in which the major clue to "Site U" ("U" stood for unknown) was found, there had been lots of grumbling around our Bank Street office.  It went like something like this:<br> 
<p>
<i>"Do you know what we went through to get this footage?<br>
It took us two weeks longer than originally scheduled . . .<br>
We went way over budget . . .<br>
Sam wouldn’t fake it – it had to be REAL…"</i><br>
<p> 
That was the episode in which the archeologists had to figure out how to get the giant Maya stele off the ocean floor. Sam Gibbon, who was <i>Mimi’s</i> Executive Producer, had refused to compromise on the scientific integrity of the piece: in other words, he would not fake the science.  After trying a number of things, Sam and the production crew finally succeeded by tying garbage bags to the corners of the 800-pound slab-of-stone and using the air from the divers’ tanks to float the stele to the surface.  It’s a dramatic moment in the video, and when I presented it to Bruce’s students, they were riveted. 
<p> 
The next week, Bruce came over in his quiet way to tell me about Jose, who had been so taken with the episode that he went home and recreated the entire scene in his bathtub.  Using a combination of brick, Baggies, string, and a straw as an air hose, Jose was inspired to replicate that dramatic moment.
<p>
What I learned from this set of experiences was the importance of being authentic and honest with young people. Every time I visited Central Park East, I saw those values reflected in Bruce’s classroom and his teaching.  Sam believed that young people deserved respect and his footage always reflects standards of scientific integrity.  I also learned, of course, about the power of media to inspire and stimulate students’ imaginations.  While Jose might have embodied this in the extreme, I have since worked in schools throughout the country and have learned first-hand what a powerfully evocative learning tool rich media can be. 
<p>
When I think about what I want to accomplish, the <i>Mimi</i> is my gold standard. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Sadly, we’ve become a nation that has placed way too much emphasis on testing.  I understand that there are many who see accountability as a civil rights issue, but the problem with our testing policies is that they have resulted in too many joyless learning environments.  So many of our schools, particularly those that struggle with resources, feel like they are on the brink of a nervous breakdown.  The civil rights intent has backfired, and I would argue that too many of our poorest schools have become narrow test prep factories that focus on rote skills, as opposed to deeper learning. 
<p>
We need to emulate – in our own way – the practices that have served other nations well.  These include investing in the educators who teach in our schools, building high-quality and relevant teacher education programs, and embracing a much more moderate level of testing and accountability.  We can no longer afford to only be focused on math and ELA at the elementary level – science is key, young people should learn to code, and they should be inspired to embrace learning as a life-long enterprise.  Science and technology are integral in nearly every profession, and we need young people who are not only knowledgeable about these subjects, but can use knowledge in the service of creative application.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> At the New York Hall of Science we have embraced designing, making, playing as strategies of engagement that animate how we engage audiences in STEM learning.  We have produced a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Make-Play-Generation-Innovators/dp/041553920X"><i>Design, Make, Play – Growing the Next Generation of STEM Innovators</i></a>, which features work we are doing at NYSCI and other work that is taking place around the country.
<p> 
2014 is the 50th anniversary of the New York Hall of Science.  We will be opening two major exhibitions that have been in the works for several years.  Design Lab, opening in June of 2014, is an engineering exhibit and activity space where visitors will tinker with materials, play around with science, tackle problems worth solving, and put their ideas to work.  The 7,500 square foot exhibition takes its inspiration from the places that children play, and is comprised of a series of environments that include a sandbox, a tree house, a studio, and a theater.  It has been designed to engage NYSCI’s public audiences, and to serve as an innovation lab for New York City’s teachers. 
<p>
<i>Connected Worlds</i> will open in  2014 in NYSCI’s iconic Great Hall.  The exhibit invites visitors to explore issues of sustainability within the context of imaginative, immersive worlds. Through state-of-the-art sensor technologies visitors will engage with six beautifully rendered, diverse environments that are created through projections and dynamic, real time animations. The wetlands, jungle, plains, mountain valley, reservoir and a desert all ring a 40 foot virtual waterfall.  Visitors interact with the habitats; the effects they produce model complex systems of interdependent relationships among different ecosystems.  Each habitat connects with the others through water – their shared resource – that visitors must manage to maintain healthy environments. And, each habitat is alive with fantastic creatures who respond directly and indirectly to the visitors and the changes they initiate in the world.
<p> 
At NYSCI, we are also committed to leveraging digital tools to create resources that inspire teachers and students in school settings. We are building a suite of mobile applications called <i>noticing tools</i>, that enable children to use the world as a laboratory, making meaningful science and mathematics discoveries in the context of highly engaging problems young people find worth solving.  These playful and compelling design projects are directly aligned with Common Core Math Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards.
<p> 
For example, <i>SizeWise</i> enables middle school students to use ratios and proportions while creating forced perspective photography shots where things appear wildly larger or smaller than they are in real life. Bundled with the application are a virtual objects library (e.g., images to pose with such as a giant soda can) and a set of computer-trackable objects, "stickpics," that can be printed, taped to a stick, and used as physical props.  A suite of measurement tools including calipers for keeping track of real-life and onscreen heights, a ratio tool, and a distance meter are accessible in the application as users construct and set up shots.  Once students have taken a series of pictures, they can make their own comic strips and write out the ratios and math behind their photos so that others can recreate their shots.  The strength of these tools is that students are at the center – they are the data under investigation. 
<p> 
All of these initiatives privilege students’ playful behaviors as core to the learning experience, and then leverage design-based investigations to support student inquiry. Our eye remains squarely fixed on the gold standard – creating resources that are irresistible and inspirational for deeper learning.
