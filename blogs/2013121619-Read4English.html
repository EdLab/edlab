<p>With a growing assortment of creative language learning apps on the market, there is no shortage of online activities for non-native-speaking English students seeking to strengthen their skills. <a href="http://www.brainglass.com/about/">Brainglass</a>, the source of several educational mobile apps, has added <a href="http://www.brainglass.com/read4english/">Read4English</a> to the collection, a reading and listening app for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vocab.android.bookshelf&hl=en">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/read4english/id455221430?mt=8">iOS</a>. More than just an e-reader, Read4English is a synchronized karaoke-style app that highlights and reads words out loud as students follow along. It offers interactive texts for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels with integrated dictionaries in 17 languages. New and difficult vocabulary words can be saved and accessed later for flashcard review. Because its features focus on different skill sets, this app could be used to practice pronunciation, intonation, accents, and pacing in the absence of a live native speaker.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>A quick <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YkoD0aAdtk">introductory video</a> gives new users an overview of the simple and intuitive interface, and highlights some helpful features, including the options to set vocabulary learning goals and share accomplishments via social media. Exercise formats that enable users to practice translations both from English to their native language and from their native language to English set the app apart from other supplemental reading tools on the market. And positive app store reviews highlight the popularity of the karaoke and dictionary functions. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite its advantages, there are some valid criticisms. Aside from the need for bug fixes that cause the app to run slowly or crash, some users expressed the desire for access to more content. Though the app offers one free full title to new users and has additional texts available for purchase, some of the content may not appeal to the interests of younger students. When other products are catering to the zeitgeist with <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1074">zombies</a> and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1096">superheroes</a>, JFK’s inauguration speech feels less likely to capture attention.</p>

<p>Also, a problem that arises whenever users access dictionaries for translation exercises, is that definitions may be awkward or inappropriate. Users reported that some definitions were unreliable, especially in the Korean dictionary. This is a broader problem for technology that relies on digital dictionaries, but should be a consideration for teachers recommending the app to students. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Rather than merely replacing hard copies with digital ink, it would behoove developers and teachers to leverage the unique capabilities of tablets and mobile phones to deliver more engaging methods of interacting with and comprehending text. The karaoke highlighting built into Read4English is a creative idea for e-reading, and it inspires ideas for similar tools that measure student understanding and customizable user experiences with better content.</p> 

<p>For more insights into products that are experimenting with different digital reading strategies, look to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/590">Gobstopper</a>,
<a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/716">Ponder</a>,
<a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/735">Actively Learn</a>, and <a href="http://liquidtext.net/">LiquidText</a>. There are many opportunities to innovate as edupreneurs take advantage of texts that can be pronounced, rearranged, translated, and annotated.</p>
 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Read4English is a simple and practical tool that might grow users’ reading comprehension and listening skills, but has some room for growth itself.</p>
