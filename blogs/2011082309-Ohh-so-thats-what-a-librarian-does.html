            Here's a sobering truth, my librarian friends: students don't know what you do.  

As reported by  <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/08/22/erial_study_of_student_research_habits_at_illinois_university_libraries_reveals_alarmingly_poor_information_literacy_and_skills">Steve Kolowich</a>, a recent research endeavor by academic libraries in Illinois revealed that college students are more likely to consult Google than library databases when conducting their research. What's wrong with that, you ask? Well, not only are their queries often riddled with faulty search terms, but when these unsatisfactory searches return too little or too many results, students often become so discouraged as to change their entire topic to something easier to research.  Disheartening, yes, but even more depressing is that these students don't realize that tucked away in their libraries are knowledgeable, helpful, and savvy resources: librarians! 

Students, however, are not interested in spending hours pouring over articles and chapters; they want to get from point A to point B in the shortest time possible.  How then can librarians tap into students' inner researchers without pushing them away? More importantly, how do librarians spread their reputations as top-notch resources for researchers? 

The study further points to arming students with the media literacy skills necessary to vet resources they come across on the Internet.  Students today may be more comfortable with technology than generations before them, but it does not make them more adept at handling it.  

The Digital Native, in this sense, does not exist.
