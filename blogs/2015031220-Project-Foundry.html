<p><i>"What we see with project-based learning is that when students are able to take ownership and determine how they want to learn—and what they want to learn about—it’s really empowering.  Project Foundry is designed for schools that recognize the need to shift away from an industrial seat time model to a more blended proficiency-based model that values performance-based assessment and authentic personalized learning—where projects are the main course, rather than just the dessert. The reason why schools are enthusiastic about Project Foundry is because it simplifies the planning portfolio and assessment of the cross-curricular student experiences that traditional gradebooks just don’t do well."</i> (<a href="https://vimeo.com/99779090">Project Foundry<a>)</p>

<p><b>Simplified, Not Simplistic </b> <br>
<a href="http://www.projectfoundry.org/">Project Foundry</a> is an online learning management system designed to facilitate project-based curriculum. The underlying goal is to allow projects to be as complex as needed, but still manageable—and without complicating the grading and assessment part of the process. Rather than spending too much time on grading, teachers are free to spend time helping, supporting, and teaching students. The portfolio feature also allows teachers to communicate what their students are doing to administrators, parents, and others outside of the classroom. </p> 

<p><b>Student-Centered </b> <br>
The platform is specifically designed to manage individualized, student-driven work. Teachers may find it useful to take a more managerial, involved role in the beginning while refining the learning process with their students. Ultimately, however, Project Foundry is meant to enable students to generate their own research questions; collaborate with each other; propose projects, plans, and deadlines for approval; and even create portfolios of their work for assessment and reflection. Teachers (and students) can use the built-in assessment tools to encourage critical thinking and foster project management skills, as well as to evaluate the students’ overall learning. </p>
