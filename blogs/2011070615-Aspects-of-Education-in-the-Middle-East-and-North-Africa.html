<strong>From the publisher:</strong>

The chapters in this volume do not represent the whole of the Middle  East and North Africa, as such a collection would have been too large  for one volume. Rather, the selection here is intended to present  different perspectives on a range of educational issues, relevant to a  particular focus or country, or common to a number of countries in the  area. There is no overarching theme beyond that which is common to most  of the countries in this area; such as modernity versus tradition; the  spread of education effecting sociological changes - most pronounced in  the rural and tribal areas; the changing fortunes and roles of women;  the aspiration and expectation of youth; and the state having become the  major player in providing education. These are all shared by most of  the countries represented here.
