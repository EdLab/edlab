<p><a href="https://socratic.org/">Socratic</a> is a digital tutor and homework helper app. Using the phone’s camera, students 13 years and older can take pictures of their homework questions and the app’s AI or community teachers can direct students toward information to help find the answer. The app also taps into phone contacts, so that students can ask classmates for help. The service was not designed to simply provide answers (though sometimes it does), but instead to guide students in finding the correct answer. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The app works fine for basic math problems or equations. I tested the features on the <a href="https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/assessment/practice-test-math-grade-7.pdf">Louisiana Department of Education Grade 7 Practice Book</a>. I was able to use Socratic successfully for many of the problems in the beginning of the test. The app even shows the steps that are taken to solve for the final answer. Students will be happy to discover this feature, as math teachers are often sticklers for showing work. With each scan, the app also provides informationals and other tips for students to improve comprehension on the next problem or future exams.  <p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are a few issues with this app. First, even as the app can answer short equations, it is not 100% successful; inserting symbols or objects confuses the processing. For one problem I tested, the camera misread a multiplication symbol for an x, spitting out a completely wrong answer. The AI could not tell the aesthetics of an X and an x, which are completely different in function. In another example, the app completely ignored the triangle in an angle ratio question, crucial information to the problem.</p>     

<p>Second, Socratic is not that helpful for questions that use words. I teach a course on U.S. history and I used Socratic on my own test questions. When I scanned multiple choice questions, the app often picked up on the wrong keywords and made incorrect interpretations. For one question, the app pulled up an old Quizlet somewhat related to my question and stated the answer was B, the wrong choice for my exam. The hint pages offered are not too helpful since they are basically the first few results from Googling a question. As a teacher, I can assure you that students already know how to find this information on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>A final complaint about this app regards privacy. In order to use the app, you must provide access to all of your contacts. The logic is that you can ask your classmates for help, but this should really be an optional setting.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Socratic is a really good idea with apparent uses, but the AI technology it needs is just not fully formed yet. For young students, the app could provide a way to help with difficult problems in their early math classes. Additionally, parents rusty in mathematics may want to consider this app if they are trying to help their elementary school-aged child with homework. Unfortunately, those in higher levels of math or other subjects will not find the services too functional for their needs. I’m afraid students might be tempted to use this app to simply look up their homework questions and then copy the answers, which are often incorrect. I think as the technology improves, though, Socratic will be more useful to a larger pool of students. </p>
