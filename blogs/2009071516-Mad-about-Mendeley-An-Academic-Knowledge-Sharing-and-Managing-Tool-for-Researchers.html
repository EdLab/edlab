          <p>
            Back in March, <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2514>Anthony</a> and <a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2516> I</a> blogged about Mendeley (“men-del-lay”), a free research paper sharing and managing software developed by seasoned researchers, graduate students, and open source developers from various academic institutions. When it caught our attention, it was available as beta 0.6. My initial impression was somewhere between lukewarm to curious in seeing how their long-term vision gets realized. 

Now in its beta 0.9 version, Mendeley has impressed me with further implementing their design and development goals. This time I also learned that the amazing team based in London work with the former founding engineers of Skype and <a href=http://www.last.fm/>Last.fm</a>'s former chairman.

Simply put, it r.o.c.k.s and here's why I think so. 

<b>1.</b>  Mendeley Combines <i>Mendeley Desktop</i>, a PDF and reference mgmt application, with <i>Mendeley Web</i>, an online social network for researchers.
<b>2.</b>  Automatically extracts metadata from PDF papers on your computer by dragging-n-dropping them into your Mendeley Desktop.
<b>3.</b>  On this Desktop, your digital library offers music playlist-like organization and super search any part of your archived resources as well as your personal annotations. (+ there's smart filtering and tagging)<<- my favorite. 
<b>4.</b>  You can also export citations and bibliographies to MS Word and Open Office.
<b>5.</b>  Once on your Desktop, you can back up and synchronize your digital library with your private Mendeley Web account.
<b>6.</b>  On this Web account, you can access your private article library online.
<b>7.</b>  You create a profile of your discipline, research interest, and geographic location, so as to connect with like-minded researchers and follow their research profile updates.
<b>8.</b>  You have access to readership statistics about papers, authors, and publication outlets in every academic discipline. (+ statistics about your own academic research article library)
<b>9.</b>  As you do online research, you can automatically import papers to your Mendeley library with just one click of a button. Partnerships have been made with more than a dozen of prominent academic digital archives like JSTOR, SpringerLink, EBSCO, WileyInterScience, Science Direct, and WorldCat. 

and there's more but I'll make this one the last and the most interesting one:

<b>10.</b> You can create groups to share and collaborative tag and annotate research papers with colleagues whom you know already or you have never met but share research interests.

How can one exactly collaborate and share the ever-growing database of research papers (which is directly related with the amount of papers that each user deposits into his/her Mendeley library)?

<b>My proposal to EdLab colleagues</b> is that we get onboard, create profiles, and become each other's “contacts” within Mendeley. We then can check it out for ourselves.

I don't know how they address copyright issues, but we won't know what's going on until we try. If it works as well as it aims to be, I think it'll be a grrrreat tool for us as we continue to work on our collaborative research projects…uh, are you thinking of the same thing that I'm thinking of? AERA.  Ting and Frederik are on it - come look for us on Mendeley and let's try this!
