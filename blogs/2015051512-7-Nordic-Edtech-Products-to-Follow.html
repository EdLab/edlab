          <p>
            Today George and I ventured all the way to the bottom of the island for a pitch event featuring Finnish and Swedish edtech startups. There were definitely a few products we might want to consider pitching for EdLab Review. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NordicEdTech?src=hash"target="_blank">#NordicEdtech</a>

<p><b><a href="https://www.digiexam.se/en"target="_blank">DigiExam</a></b></b>
Remember when <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/20126/"target="_blank">DigiExam did an EdLab seminar</a>? It was nice to see this platform at the event and Johan did a great job pitching in less than five minutes. He mentioned they've just raised a half million dollars and they'll soon be working with two Ivy League institutions. Way to go Johan!

<p><b><a href="https://edu.dream.do/en"target="_blank">Dreamdo Schools</a></b>
Dreamdo is a platform that assists teachers in creating semester-long student projects and makes them sharable with other schools internationally. All the materials are provided by the sponsors of the program. I like that this program offers longer term opportunities for learning compared to other platforms.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://pathstomath.com/"target="_blank">Paths to Math</a></b>
The idea behind this product was a little hard to grasp, but it basically seems like a comprehensive study plan for grades 6-10 math curricula. As the founder noted, Finland doesn't do a lot of testing, so this might not be a great fit for math programs in other countries.

<p><b><a href="https://plotagon.com/"target="_blank">Plotagon</a></b>
Very cool animated 3D video creation tool. I loved the demo and would like to see more user-generated videos and examples of this being successfully incorporated into different subject areas. Some of the judges seemed down on the app because it's not integrated into existing products, but I'm not sure how you would do that for a video creation tool. 

<p><b><a href="http://the3dclassroom.com/usa/"target="_blank">Sensavis</a></b>
This is 3D software to enhance visual learning, which seems ideal for geography, math, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering subjects. These pitches are short, but I would've liked to see a demo. 

<p><b><a href="http://www.skillpixels.com/"target="_blank">Skillpixels</a></b>
This is a smart learning game for science topics. Again, we didn't see a demo, but it's apparently based in research on adaptive learning analytics and has over 100 levels corresponding to the Common Core requirement. It's interesting that other countries are developing products with US standards in mind.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.songhi.com/"target="_blank">Songhi</a></b>
This is a colorful, digital music creation platform. The founders played a short song made by a kid in a Finnish school, and I have to say it was pretty cool. Of all the apps we saw here today, this is the one I am most likely to check out on my own time. I love that we've done more music product reviews on NLT lately and I think we should take a look at how this compares.
