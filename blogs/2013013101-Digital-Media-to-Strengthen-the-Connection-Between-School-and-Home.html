            Over the years, teachers and parents have come to understand that education is not only what happens within the classroom but many other factors outside of the classroom are key to a student's performance in school. Parent Teachers Associations (PTA) were established to serve as a connection between home and school. Moreover, in 1946 Congress established the National School Lunch Program after recognizing that children who do not eat well at home usually do not perform well in school. However, this era of <a href="http://www.edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2013/01/using-digital-media-strengthen-connection-between-school-and-home">digital media</a> has accelerated the possibilities of connecting the home and school. A large number of Americans have smart phones and other digital devices which makes it easier to connect home to school. 

Many resources are available to help make good use of digital media to strengthen the home and school relationship. Below are some examples of these resources.

<ol>
<li>Make good use of school district websites:
School district websites are a wonderful source for parents to contact teachers. These websites are available to anyone with Internet connection. The website should contain up to date content about the school and should constantly offer avenues to help parents educate their children at home.</li>
<li>Increase Social Media Outreach: 
Increasing number of districts that use social media to communicate with parents. Many schools are using Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube channels to reach out to parents.</li> 
<li>Tap into student information system:
Parents can be given access to school computers by usernames and passwords in order to track their children's performance and attendance. This gives parents an opportunity to help their kids. This is simply better than the traditional report cards which come out at end of every marking period in most school districts. Some school districts such as Pennsylvania's State College Area School District issue parents ePortfolio to track their children development. Whiles others use a text messaging system to inform parents.</li>
<li>It Works Both Ways:
Digital media can be used to give parents and the community information about the school and children performance but the same media can be used to collect information from parents and community members to teachers and researchers. This can be possible through online surveys.</li>
