<p>Whether you love the idea or hate it, virtual reality (VR) is picking up steam as an emerging technology. It has implications for learning, gaming, and film watching, to name a few, yet regardless of the genre, VR will have a significant impact on storytelling. In this vialogue, VR creators discuss how storytelling differs between traditional and VR platforms. The main difference is that in VR, you’re not telling a story as much as creating a place for people to go and experience a story for themselves. The designers in this vialogue describe VR as an "architectural theme park."</p>

<p>If you experience a traditional story, say in a movie, you remember it by the image on the screen. If you experience a VR story, however, you remember it as you would a real experience because it’s not just an image on a screen; it’s an entire world you can interact with. Although it’s not clear yet how VR will be used in the future (in education, games, films, etc.), one thing is certain: the way we experience stories might never be the same.</p>

<p>How would people learn differently from visiting a VR "architectural theme park" than they would from experiencing a traditional story? There is clearly a lot of gaming potential for this new technology, but could VR transform learning opportunities, as well? These are big questions. Help us answer them

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:17 RuthS:</b> This goes back to a classic pedagogical saying: show, don't tell. When people can be inserted in an environment, even if it's virtual, they learn from doing rather than from being told, and that can be an incredibly poignant and powerful way to learn.</p>

<p><b>@00:18 Renae_Lesser:</b> Love the image of building a theme park, creating dynamic places not just linear stories. It makes me wonder about the ecology of narrative. Is architecture/landscape a new way to think about storytelling?</p>
