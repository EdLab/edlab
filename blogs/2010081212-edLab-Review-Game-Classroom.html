<b>[About]</b> The <a href="http://www.gameclassroom.com">Game Classroom</a> is an aggregation of free educational videos and games that can be found on the web.  The editors on Game Classroom sift through the content to make sure that it's good, and then categorize it on their website so that it's easy to find and integrate in the classroom.  We are reviewing the free version, which sorts videos, worksheets, and games.  Additional content is available with a subscription.

<b>[The Good]</b> The content is very easy to find and very usable.  The videos are short (1 to 10 minutes) and the games are straightforward.

<b>[The Bad]</b> There are some gaps in the content since the resource is still being developed.  This site is supposed to provide the results from scouring the web so that you don't have to, but teachers will still have to scour the web and gameclassroom is just one stop.

<b>[The Bottom Line]</b> The Game Classroom is a great place to find new content quickly and to assure that it has been reviewed by independent educators.  It's not something to consult before every lesson because of the spare content, but if you teach math to students in grades K-6 it is a good idea to go through this site's content and be aware of what it offers.  They provide valuable material on a number of topics that can be used in the classroom or as part of a tutoring program.

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: larger">Full Review</p>

The <a href="http://www.gameclassroom.com">Game Classroom</a> takes educational content from grades K through 6 that they found on the web and aggregates it into a single site.  Navigating the site is very easy, and people looking for content will be able to save time because they know that all of the videos, worksheets, and games have been vetted by Game Classroom's editors.

The site focuses mostly on math education in grades K through 6, but they also have plenty of content for language arts.  Some of the videos are instructional and meant for the students, while other videos give tips for teachers on approaching the subjects.  Both types of videos are helpful, but it would be nice if they distinguished these into two separate categories.  While there are some free games and worksheets available, some are only available on the subscription model.

If Game Classroom can scale up their link library in the future without sacrificing usability or dependability, they have the potential to attract a wider audience to their valuable resource.
