            Related to some of the DSV plans for fall, the Georgia Library Association is offering a free webinar on "MakerCamp," a series of 3D design/printing workshops for students. I've registered for the webinar already and will share about it when it happens -- but in case anyone else is interested, the details are below:


<b>MakerCamp: Partnerships, Polylactic Acid, and Payouts</b>

<b>Register:</b> http://bit.ly/Y8OpC2

Live Webcast - 60 minutes
<b>Wednesday, September 10, 2014</b>
11am Pacific | 12pm Mountain | 1pm Central | <b>2pm Eastern</b>

<b>Description: </b>
In the summer of 2014, Gwinnett County Public Library partnered with Buffy Hamilton of Norcross High School to host their inaugural MakerCamp: a 4-day program that allowed high school-age students the opportunity to explore 3D design and 3D printing through innovative and accessible tools and resources. Join Michael Casey and Christopher Baker as they discuss MakerCamp's development and delivery, and explore the learning opportunities the program offered both students and staff.

<b>Presenters:</b> Michael Casey and Christopher Baker
