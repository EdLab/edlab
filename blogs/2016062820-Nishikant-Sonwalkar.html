<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1Z413vF">Nishikant Sonwalkar</a> is an expert in computer learning and an accomplished researcher in hypermedia authoring, mobile learning, and adaptive learning. Nishikant is also an entrepreneur who has launched several companies, including <a href= "http://bit.ly/25CXuE7">InteQ Corporation</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1TZgmBW">intellADAPT</a>. He teaches mechanical engineering at MIT where he also received his doctorate. </p>

<p><b>How have your education and professional experiences shaped your current work?</b><br>
<p>I completed my doctoral degree at MIT in Molecular Dynamics. I also co-taught a course on statistical process and molecular dynamics using 3D animations of water molecules to enhance classroom instruction. This experiment led me to become involved with education technology. I later became the founding director of <a href="http://bit.ly/1X0QJ9Y">Hypermedia Teaching Facility (HTF)</a> and Principal Education Architect at MIT in addition to my academic work in molecular dynamics of nano interfaces. As the director of HTF, I provided leadership for numerous pedagogical experiments at MIT and developed the Hypermedia Instruction and Teaching Environment (HITE). I also developed the online learning interface for the Singapore MIT Alliance that developed five new masters programs for three universities in Singapore. This experience led me to form a start-up company IntellADAPT, to develop adaptive learning platforms for online education. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way we learn?</b><br>
<p>The next generation of online education will be adaptive learning. As a pioneer in this field since 2000, I have been able to push the movement for adaptive learning mainstream in online education. Now there are conferences dedicated to adaptive and personalized learning and it has become a buzzword in the entire online education industry.</p>

<p><b>What trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The broad trends related to big-data analytics, virtual reality, internet of things (IoT), and brain-computer interfaces will impact development of next generation education technology. At intellADAPT we have received National Science Foundation (NSF) funding for the big data analytics driven adaptive learning where we have developed the adaptive 2.0 platform which supports big data analytics. We have also developed IoT interfaces for healthcare workers for training, tracking and compliance. We have also received an NSF award for the development of Brain-Computer Interface intellADAPT which is the first brain-wave Adaptive Learning platform.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Our next big project is brain wave adaptive learning, the first Brain-Computer Interface for STEM education. We have developed a platform to connect EEG headbands with an adaptive learning platform where we can measure the brain wave response of the learner for five distinct instructional designs: apprentice, incidental, inductive, deductive, and discovery. This response provides necessary data for adaptive learning and personalized education response using our dynamic adaptive learning platform.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>The work done by <a href="http://bit.ly/1X0RfVu">Tom Chi</a> with Google Glass is very interesting. <a href="http://bit.ly/1Wyj7QQ">Khan Academy</a> is an interesting foundation. For STEM education, I find the work of <a href="http://bit.ly/1TYfkJh">Hadi Partovy</a> for code.org to be interesting.</p>
