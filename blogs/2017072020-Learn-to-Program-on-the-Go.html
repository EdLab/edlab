<p>Ever find yourself twiddling your thumbs on your subway ride or staring at the wall as you eat your toast? Learning apps can be a way to build bite-sized bits of information by taking advantage of the spare moments in the day. While there are lots of language apps that do a great job of building up small moments to reach learning milestones, <a href="https://www.downloadpy.com/">Py</a> is a new one that teaches in-demand digital skills.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>With over a thousand free lessons covering a range of topics, Py has a lot to offer learners. Rather than showing a long list of topics, users are asked first if they know how to code. From there, Py displays several topic options such as web programming, data science, or programming apps. After moving through the introductory screens, the app provides a lot more opportunities for discovering course content. Each course displays the series of modules to progress through to learn a chosen topic.</p>

<p>The navigation within the app is fairly streamlined, taking users to a single course, all courses, or their profile where they can save their progress. Once a course is selected, a progress bar roughly tracks progress in a given module. As users solve questions in a module, Py provides feedback through banners and stars to show learning progress. It also describes what percentage of a given topic has been mastered so far (e.g., 12% of data science). Py also has a mentor feature built in with live chat with top software engineers to help get learners over any hurdles they may have. Daily goals, anywhere from <i>casual</i> 3 minutes to the <i>scholar</i> level of 10 minutes per day, can help keep learners accountable. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While some of the appâ€™s content is free, a lot of the modules are locked and require users to sign up for a paid premium account. Many of the locked modules are additional exercises that would be helpful for practice. Though the design within the app is modern and clean, the progress bar does not clearly indicate how far along users are in a given lesson.  Additionally, as course modules are not numbered, it is hard to know the span of a course. Despite the self-paced approach to learning with Py, It would be helpful to provide learners with a rough estimate of how long a given module might take, whether it be 10 minutes or two hours.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>In terms of a basic introduction to a wide variety of tech-based skills, Py does a great job at introducing courses and guiding learning. The user experience is intuitive, appealing, and perfect for bite-sized learning on the go. With its vast selection of courses, you can surely find something interesting to fill a few moments while learning on your phone. </p>
