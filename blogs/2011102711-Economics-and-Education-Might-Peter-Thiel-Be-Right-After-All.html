<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/10/why-the-current-revenue-model-of-higher-education-is-in-trouble.html">Marginal Revolution</a> has the lowdown on why the number of graduates will likely fall at the margin from reduced demand. Could this spell the end of runaway tuition and the higher ed bubble as Peter Thiel called it? For certain institutions yes, others no. As a rough approximation, the more selective the institution, the greater the pricing power. I doubt tuition will rise at a slower rate for elites. On the other hand, I think community colleges, publicly funded liberal arts colleges, and even major state universities are only going to be squeezed further. What I'm most interested to see is if the decline in return on schooling forces out online higher ed. On one level, they are the most vulnerable given that they're at the bottom of the food chain. Yet because they operate in a for-profit model that minimizes cost, they probably will be able to survive with fewer ads. 

I'm not sure how to view this most recent development. On the one hand, it is good to see that most colleges can't get away with extortion. Nevertheless, I see all of this as a failure of higher institutions to impart the necessary skills and knowledge in their students. There is no reason four years of  learning at a higher learning institution should fail to result in high wage returns and genuinely high marginal and social product. This might be a bit of moralizing in part, but I think we will look back on the past 30 years of higher education as an age of wasteful decadence. There are so many opportunities to raise the stock of human capital in this country and yet educational and economic outcomes for the median American have largely stagnated for the past 30 years.
