          <p>
            Happy New Year to all patrons and friends of the Gottesman Libraries! Hopefully, at least some of you have made the resolution to read more this year. Of course, the wide world of the Internet is full of quality reading material: breaking news, long-form journalism, blogs, personal websites, and more.

In fact, it's easy to feel bombarded by all the information that the internet has to offer. For longer than a year now, I've been using the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> service to manage links to items I want to read in the future. Instapaper provides you with a free account online for storing links and a button used to place the links into your account. You just install the button into your internet browser (on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or Kindle) and click it whenever you see something you'd like to read later. The links will all be waiting for you the next time you log into <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>.

<a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> has helped me to remember to read very many interesting and valuable stories that I otherwise would have forgotten about. It also acts as a kind of filter: sometimes, by the time you revisit your links, you find that you aren't really that interested in an item, and you don't waste time reading it anyway. Finally, it acts as a kind of bookmark repository: as you archive links you've read, it saves a record of them. You can learn more by reading the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/faq">Instapaper FAQs</a>.

I hope that you find <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> as useful as I have, and that it helps you to resolve to read more in 2011!
