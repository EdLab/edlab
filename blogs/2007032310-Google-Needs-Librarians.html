            I wondered how long it would be before Google started recruiting librarians:

Subject: 	[Google Librarian Central] Librarian Wanted: Part II
Date: 	Thu, 22 Mar 2007 11:26:51 -0700 (PDT)
From: 	Librarian Central <librariancentral@gmail.com>

As the Google Book Search <http://books.google.com> project grows and more libraries <http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/03/bavarian-state-library-becomes-largest.html>
sign on to participate, the need for good, comprehensive collection analysis becomes ever more pressing. We're looking for a stellar collections person who will thrive in the controlled chaos that is Google, someone who will not only dive deeply into the collections we've scanned to date, but help us as we develop new library relationships with the goal of digitizing the world's books.

If you know cataloging and collections inside and out, and if the sheer hugeness of this project makes you as giddy as it does me, click to view the job posting <http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/answer.py?answer=61406> and send us your resume via the "Add to job cart" link at the bottom of the page.

*Library Collections Specialist, Book Search - Mountain View*

The Library Collections Specialist (Monographs & Serials) will assist the team in understanding Google?s current collection of digitized materials and the collections of Google?s current and prospective library partners in order to develop a better, more comprehensive digital library. Candidates must have demonstrated abilities and background experience in conducting quantitative and qualitative analyses of library collections.

Responsibilities:

* Quantitatively and qualitatively understand the strengths and weaknesses of the Google digital collection of monographs and serials.
* Use Google's internal data and tools and external databases to analyze library partner collections and create actionable assessments.
* Help guide collection development needs via use of subject, format and language verticals.
* Identify potential partners to meet collection development needs.
* Assist operations team in prioritizing allocation of digitization resources.
* Participate in discussion of collection analysis with library partners.


Requirements:

* BS degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or equivalent technical.
* MLS or equivalent library science experience required.
* 2+ years of experience strongly preferred.
* Software engineering skills including competence with SQL and database design, scripting languages, and the Unix environment.
* Familiarity with library technologies, standards and software including bibliographic standards including MARC, standard library classification systems (LC, Dewey, etc) and current OPAC and ILS systems.
* Familiarity with databases and cataloging software and analysis tools (e.g. OCLC, OPAC software such as Aleph, Sirsi, etc.).
* Experience in traditional library collection development a plus.
* Excellent quantitative skills and written and verbal communication skills, including ability to express and explain complex quantitative data.
* Ability to perform in a fast-paced, constantly evolving team environment.
* Active participation in professional librarian community a plus.
