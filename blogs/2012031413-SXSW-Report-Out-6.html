          <p>
            A second session on agile development for mobile highlighted the need to develop techniques to keep the process agile.  These included low-effort prototyping and a commitment to get something out as opposed to getting something perfect.  The consensus seemed to be that the designers and developers could waste a lot of time getting something to where they thought it was great, but that users are the ultimate test and ultimate judges --- so -- get something in front of users and let them use it.  Then collect feedback and iterate.  Stop arguing amongst the team on small issues that might end up being meaningless to users.  The one area that was particularly challenging for agile was game development.  The lead developer on Farmville explained that it was difficult to get anything but the complete game in front of users in order to get useful feedback.  Even in this case, however, it doesn't make sense to sweat the small things like the colors of buttons, etc.  Everyone on the panel acknowledged the importance of testing, but just about everyone had been in situations where the testing was not thorough enough.  The best situation to strive for would seem to be a good test script that can be run automatically each time a new release is pushed.  Even then, there is still need for human testing to make sure the meaning of things is as intended.  Almost no one had experience with A/B testing, but most agreed that it would be a great option for the system to select which of two paths (A or B) a user went down and then evaluate the alternatives.  Everyone agreed that one of the hardest things was to get the large numbers of users that make testing really useful.  And everyone had horror stories from big name products and firms.
