            The KIPP Empower Academy was recently praised on <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/06/22/137318998/schools-blend-computers-with-classroom-learning">All Things Considered</a> for their students' great improvements. While the switch from the traditional classroom to blended learning was because of budget cuts (the principal had to cut out an entire classroom), the ongoing praise of blended learning makes me worried that the transitions will no longer be because of fiscal necessity, but because it is seen as the new pinnacle for instruction. The worry isn't because I am a traditionalist when it comes to education, far from it actually, but rather because these students were in kindergarten. 

Teaching such young students in a blended learning environment raises two issues for me. The first issue is that students that young are not designed to be sitting at computers, let alone for half of the time they are in class. “The biggest challenge for us is teaching them actually how to sit at a computer”, teacher, M.J. Mathis, said. KIPP goes as far as drilling the students on how to move in the classroom and use a computer. The second issue is that young students who are exposed to technology with drill and practice type activities (the overwhelming majority of offerings in educational technology) have shown decreases in children's creativity and motivation. 

Yes, increases in reading levels are obviously necessary, but there are other ways to tighten budgets without sacrificing the characteristics necessary for meaningful employment and economic growth in the future, or the things that make childhood great. If anything, this is a call for entrepreneurs to develop learning programs that go beyond drill and practice and help children to develop their creativity and nurture their sense of wonder.
