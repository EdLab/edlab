          <p>
            During last week's seminar, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3603">Dr. Gary Natriello</a> presented work on adaptive learning opportunities. He presented a model of processes and interactions that can lead to adaptive learning opportunities and within the model, seven major areas that provide perspectives for these adaptive learning opportunities emerged. 
<br> The work is part of an effort to explore the landscape of the kinds of applications that provide adaptive experiences both within the education sector for formal learning as well as tools not necessarily focused on learning but possibly relevant in future collaborations or developments in this field. The talk featured an overview of the proposed seven buckets that encompass areas where adaptive opportunities exist as well as a small group breakout activity to discuss each of these areas. Specifically, the conversations in the groups were to discuss any experiences within the group pertaining to their topic, any EdLab projects that would fit in their bucket, as well as any missing links they could identify around their topic or additions they would make. Below, is a summary highlighting points in each groups focused discussion. Due to the length of some of the notes please click on the title for a more detailed account of information.

<b>The Natural Task Perspective</b></a>
<div id="example" style="display:none"><i>
Experiences
We had a difficult time distinguishing between experiential learning and natural learning. Part of the confusion stemmed from the the definition of natural learning, where it was emphasized that learning is not the primary purpose of engaging in the task. For this reason, at the time we were unable to come up with an adequate example of times in which we experienced natural learning.  

Edlab Connections
- Perhaps the EdLab internships.   
- Survey Sidekick because the primary goal for the user of this tool is to create a survey. The secondary product is learning the components of good survey creation.</i>  

</div>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example1');">
<b>The Constructed Learning Task Perspective</b></a>
<div id="example1" style="display:none"><i>
Experiences:
Most of us had the same reaction that our experience with these kinds of tasks were attempted by teachers in school through teaching adaptively. another example of it being used in a company such as scholastic was brought up, adapting content for different reading levels of students to allow for group instruction.

Discussed things around
What is a task? watching a video vs. constructed teacher incentives (spectrum of activities that could fall under tasks that represent these kinds of learning experiences)and subsequently within that, the design or structure behind the task also varies greatly dependent on the learners ie self-directed vs. direct instruction a kind of implicit/explicit motivation system was also discussed.
During this discussion the question where does 'adaptive' come in? arose and what are the components of a constructed learning task that allow it to be defined as adaptive? Which we also decided could be envisioned on a continuum.


Edlab Connection:
We discussed many of the projects that weren't necessarily designed or defined as 'adaptive' but could be framed that way depending on additional resources or re purposing it for this reason. We also felt that some fit better into this category than others, and again we were left with a kind of spectrum like design for EdLab projects with features that could be adaptive if built around the tool toward ones that are already using some of these principle inherently in the design.
Examples:
After-Ed video channel (Mediashow etc.)
Audio Tour
Teaching the Levees Curriculum
Critter
Teaching & Learning Network
Survey Sidekick
Fluensee
Math Maze

What's missing or is there something further.
Possibilities for the future include not top down models of adapting based on expert knowledge but trying to flip that model and allow learners to create micro adaptive tools.</i>
</div>


<a onclick="toggleVis('example3');">
<b>The Learning Research Perspective</b></a>
<div id="example3" style="display:none"><i>
Experiences  
   - active learning model
   - grounded cognition

EdLab Examples 
   - TC Assets, TC route finder, and so on would be the ones that use adaptive theory.

What seems to be missing
   - we talked about it as something that can be easily missed or not capitalized on in designing adaptive tools. Adaptive tools should be based on robust empirical studies but most of time developers just make a tool and put all the possible interpretations to explain effectiveness of that tool.So we see some missed opportunities in our category to see the tools as research tools in addition to learning tools.</i></div>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example2');">
<b>The Content Model Perspective</b></a>
<div id="example2" style="display:none"><i>
Project ideas
1)Teachers College Record article recommendation
2)Course recommendation system
3)Self-directed video learning platform/Critter

We think current TCR Related Articles section, though not working perfectly, is one example of adaptive content model because users would receive resources adapted to their interests. In a similar vein, based on a student's academic interest, background, and history of course work, a course recommendation system will suggest courses that meet the student's need. Finally, we think of designing a self-directed video learning platform/critter, where learners can customize a video streaming and learning environment based on their interests and select most relevant videos on their pages. While all these ideas are adaptive based on learner's interest, we also wonder (and regrettably we ran out of time) how could we design a system based on learner's ability.</i></div>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example4');">
 <b>The Teaching Perspective</b></a>
<div id="example4" style="display:none"> <i>
Reflections on topic / Experiences:
This category includes situations that allows teacher to interfere or to alter the way they teach based on the students interests/learning preference. Also during teaching they must be reactive and be able to improvise their teaching or lesson based one the reactions of students and the feedback they are providing. There is an overlap between the teaching perspective/intelligent tutoring and "DYAD"

EdLab connection:
Key to make things easier for a teacher.
We discussed some in relation to work, or presentations at the EdLab as well as beyond toward other tools we know of. 
- PA Cyber Charter School platform which gives teachers the ability to quickly gauge where students are in their understanding by using the M/C or ping feature that easily pools the class based on what the teacher asked. It gave the teacher a feedback tool while progressing with the lesson that was going on.
- Lesson Writer, a tool that has the goal of making lesson writing easier. (Arianna blogged about it, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3607">see it here</a> to learn more)
- The Media Show also takes into account feedback from the viewers and can put out follow up versions and episodes in response to the reactions.
- Other thoughts/ tools included: The Teachers Network (lesson plans for use by other teachers);Turn It In application (text analysis for plagiarism); parent-teacher conference tool developed by the EdLab (a scheduling tool but the actual conference is the adaptive part of the teaching perspective); Critter (based on questions posted, as a classroom tool this helps teachers to develop and revise their instructional skills based on the teacher's analysis of student comments); Firefox Check Republic add-on; "clippy" the help avatar for Microsoft Word, which identifies certain procedures you are attempting to do and offers help formatting them, Also just the troubleshooting procedure in general, click on help, type in problem, chose solution or get linked to solution. </i>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example5');">
 <b>The Assessment Perspective </b></a>
<div id="example5" style="display:none"><i>
Reflection on Topic / Experience:
Adaptive assessment pertaining to learning works better when applied to formative assessment:
e.g. in cases like language oral exams, assessment strategies can be continually revised based on the learner's performance. That can work to the advantage of the learner.
Another example we could think of was job interviews where questions tend to be based on the interviewee's answers to prior questions. Such Interview formats can also sometimes lead to serendipitous learning and outcomes e.g. "judging from your performance, we will offer you job A instead of job B you are interviewing for." 

-  Summative adaptive assessments such as the GRE only works to categorize learner's and not to improve learning during the assessment process. Indeed, such assessment formats even work to discourage or prevent any form of learning during the assessment. However, in situations where the test taker upon completing the test goes to learn and then take the test again, then the test can be seen as contributing to the "new" learning. It was however suggested that such "new" learning might only involve test taking strategies and content to a lesser extent.

EdLab Connection
For an adaptive assessment tool we talked of MathMaze - the IPhone app that adjusts the level of difficulty of ensuing math questions based on a player's performance. Indeed, it occurred to us that most strategy games can be considered as adaptive assessment tools.</i></div>

<a onclick="toggleVis('example6');">
<b>The Social Network Perspective</b></a>
<div id="example6" style="display:none"><i> 
What is the definition of social networking?
Should both content network and personal network be included into this perspective? Or Can these two networks be blended?

EdLab Connection / Project ideas
Social publishing network
TCR
TC Portal
NetPosse (a more advanced version of Mendeley)

The social network learning task can include adaptive natural learning, adaptive content learning, non-adaptive natural learning, or non-adaptive content learning, considering both active searchers and non-active searchers. Recommendations made by the system should not only match users' background information but also match the user's search history. There are two different learning platforms regarding social networking learning tools: the natural learning platform such as Amazon and the constructivist learning platform such as NetPosse. Furthermore, network actually emerges in two major ways: bottom-up recommendations made by users, and top-down recommendations controlled by the organization/company.</i></div>

<br>
 
A general set of answers to the questions posed across the groups included that (1) people have experienced adaptation in some form or another, mostly in context of learning. (2) Connections of EdLab projects/products and materials are related to or can be placed in at least one if not a few of the presented adaptive opportunity buckets. (3) Areas exposing missing links or ideas for the future included capitalizing on learning research possibilities and gaining richer understandings on the roles during development of these tools and relationships between those creating such applications. 

Moving forward with this work, empirically supported concrete examples need to be collected in each bucket and analyzed to find areas in which future collaborations among developers of these tools can be harnessed. Everyone at the lab is encouraged, if they come across any specific product that exemplifies one of the categories, to please share it!
