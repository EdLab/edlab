There has never been a more exciting time for education than right now. In fact, 2012 may go down as one of the most disruptive in history, what with the booming popularity of MOOCs and the increasingly prominent use of ICTs. 
<p>
Perhaps most thrilling of all is imagining the next iteration of learning. This vialogue features renowned educational innovators as they eulogize the factory-model education system and welcome a new era of learning. Seth Godin, for example, points out the issue of access: There was a time when school was the gatekeeper of information, but the internet has proven to be the great equalizer in knowledge acquisition. Now everyone with an internet connection has access to the same information (presumably). 
<p>
Stephen Heppell, the man once billed as Europeâ€™s leading online education expert, presents the simplest and yet most challenging way to revolutionize education. He notes that more children will be graduating from secondary school within the next 30 years than ever in history. "If I was going to make one change, I would make their schooling just a little bit better... and that will change history faster than anything else."
<p>

<b>@1:51 beccachov:</b> The death of education? Learning is just beginning, how exciting!!!!
<p>
<b>@4:23 BridgetJane1:</b> Yeah, I agree.... but I'd argue that motivation also plays a huge role in learning, especially self-directed learning.
