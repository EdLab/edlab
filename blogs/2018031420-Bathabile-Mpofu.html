Bathabile Mpofu is a scientist, innovator, entrepreneur, and co-founder of <a href="https://www.nkazisciences.co.za">Nkazimulo Applied Sciences</a> in Durban, South Africa. Her company manufactures ChemStart, a science kit that she uses to inspire high school learners with her unique <i>wow</i> factor demos. She has been self-employed and worked as a research scientist, where she helped other entrepreneurs create innovative products. She is the winner of the Total Startupper of the Year 2016 Challenge, and she recently completed her MBA studies at the University of Cape Town.</p>

<p><b>ChemStart science kits were inspired by your own experiences. What were these? </b><br>
<p>Growing up I dreamed of studying medicine and becoming a doctor, but high school science education didn’t prepare me for that when I got to university. Imagine being 16 years old and coming to the knowledge that your dreams and the future you planned are never going to happen, and it wasn’t your fault. You know you are capable, but you are disempowered by lack of resources. This was wrong then, and it is wrong now. Instead of medicine I studied chemistry, and when I worked at my university as a technician, I saw many other learners battling in the lab and could completely relate. I knew I could do something to help the situation.</p>
<p><b>How has your educational and professional trajectory shaped the work you do with children in schools?</b><br>
<p>My education, experience at university, and work with an organization that gave funding (grants) to entrepreneurs with technology innovations all clarified the purpose of life for me. First, I worked with interns who couldn’t translate the science knowledge they learned at university into real life application. Second, the entrepreneurs that accessed the funding were privileged and went to schools that provided the resources they needed to learn. By virtue of their school background, most South Africans were excluded from accessing these opportunities. Information didn’t mean anything; it wasn’t knowledge and they couldn’t use it to their advantage. So now I live my life helping young people become scientists, not letting their backgrounds hinder them.</p>
<p><b>You aim to show that science is cool, not scary, and you present your experiments with "a dash of humor." How do you see your work with children changing the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Currently fewer and fewer learners are taking up science subjects, partly because of a lack of resources and partly because their parents never had the exposure themselves to these subjects, so everyone is fearful of science and there are few role models they can relate to. I am hoping to change the landscape so that more learners take up science subjects, pursue science careers, and eventually innovate and make our lives in the world better through science.</p>
<p><b>What current trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>All young people love gadgets and have smartphones. If education is incorporated into these gadgets and phones, I think it would be great. For example, imagine having a math or chemistry question, rather than a password, unlock a phone; the right answer unlocks the phone, and the wrong answer results in a lesson that will lead the student to the right answer, and these questions would change all the time and pop-up every 30 minutes. As it is, young people spend too much time on social media, where very little benefit or learning can be derived.</p>
<p><b>What are you currently working on? Is there a big project in the pipeline?</b><br>
<p>Yes, we are working on making videos of the experiments and fitting the videos into an SD (secure digital) card that can be slotted into a cell phone to make it easy for young people to watch and conduct experiments without requiring data to access the internet. We are also looking for sponsors to buy Chemstart kits for impoverished communities. At the end of October we will be handing over Chemstart science kits to five schools.The kits were purchased by SC Johnson and Sons Pty Ltd, in honour of Nelson Mandela, as the Nelson Mandela Foundation is running a campaign this year titled #ActionAgainstPoverty.</p>
<p><b>Who are your heroes? Who inspires Bathabile Mpofu?</b><br>
<p>Of the famous ones, it’s Oprah. When Oprah was told to learn how to do laundry because she’d grow up to become a maid, she decided she wasn’t going to be a maid. She decided for herself that she wanted to be great, and she went on to achieve that! At a young age she made a decision not to let her background define her future. She works hard and is dedicated to excellence, and I see myself in her; she is my hero. My school education didn’t let me become a medical doctor, but I will help others become doctors and fulfill their dreams. My heros back home are my parents. I wouldn’t be who I am now if it wasn’t for them. They sacrificed a lot and allowed me to try science at home. They told me I could achieve anything I set myself to achieve, and that is true!</p>
