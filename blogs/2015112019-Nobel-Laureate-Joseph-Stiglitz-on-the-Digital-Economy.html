            <b>Evaluating the Importance of the <i>Digital Economy</i>   </b>
<i>How important is digital technology to the new economy?   </i>

This is the second entry from a panel discussion on the significance of the <i>Digital Economy</i> for the U.S. and global growth, its transformative impact on traditional industries, its implications for developing countries, and its possible effect on cross border trade. The first panelist was <a href=" http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/12486">Martin Wolf, CBE, of the Financial Times</a>. The speaker discussed below is Columbia University Professor, and Nobel Laureate, Joseph E. Stiglitz.

<b>Digital Transformations</b>
-You cannot think of a separate, discrete subject of “Economics of Information.” Information is intertwined with the entire economy.
-New technologies have transformed the nature of competition, and monitoring of that competition, more than they have transformed the economy or affected the foundations of economics.
-The new <i>Digital Economy</i> is inherently an abstract concept. If you go back to classical economics (e.g., Adam Smith, David Ricardo, etc.) many of these foundational principles still exist, such as the law of diminishing returns, which is fundamental to the popular conception of modern economics.
-In terms of ideas like public goods and appropriation, they were not a part of that older world (e.g., one that traded in agricultural products). However, certain tenets of classical economics are still ingrained in people’s minds (e.g., Adam Smith’s notion of the invisible hand).

<b>Two Central Concepts of the Modern Economy</b> 
-The following are two central characteristics of the modern economy:

<b>(1) Appropriating From Information</b> 
-It is fundamentally difficult to appropriate from a shared good. There are competing tensions. Some believe we need to exclude people from having access to the shared good, others believe we shouldn’t. This idea of “not believing we have to share” reveals itself as a public versus a private tension. Does it make any sense to restrict something with zero marginal cost of usage?

<b>(2) Competition </b>
-Although there is a fixed cost to production (especially regarding digitally-produced phenomena), the marginal cost is relatively small. This state is classically defined as a<i>natural monopoly</i>. 
-There can be some inherent efficiencies within a single platform, for example, think of communicating with a single, common language.
-There are also efficiencies of domination. However, competition is the basis of a modern economy.
-In terms of digital platforms, there will be (limited) competition for the platform. This is called the “contestability doctrine.” However, you will not get full, effective competition for this platform. This limited competition for the platform has profound effects for the economy.

<b>The Public Sector’s Role</b>
-Does the public sector play an important role regarding digital technologies and the Digital Economy?
-Digital technologies and the Digital Economy pose an economic problem. There is a 2-sided effect with respect to the government regarding the collection of taxes: (a) tax avoidance, and (b) monitoring.
-Minimizing tax avoidance and improving the monitoring of businesses both strengthen the functioning of markets. Due to the problems of the Digital Economy, how will all of these competing interests balance out?

<b>Highlight #1: Competition Contrast</b>
-There is a technology paradox with respect to competition.
-Technology enhances the transmission of information. In at least an abstract sense, this improved transmission could have theoretically led to more competition.
-However, in contrast, technology can also allow large fixed cost to be reduced. As a result, this has the potential to lessen competition and increase domination.

<b>Highlight #2: Technology and Capital Markets   </b>
-In terms of capital markets, technology can lead to greater efficiency of information transfer.
-However, there can also be lower efficiency due to inefficient exploitation (e.g., from the practice of high frequency traders). These traders are mostly interpreting what others are doing and stealing the value of the information.
-More specifically, one of these institutional traders is involved in “Front-Running”—it uses information from an order flow to make money.
-This has always been illegal, but this institutional trader is engaged in this practice in a way to circumvent laws to make their actions legal. More specifically, if this trader received an order, ran to the market, and sold to some guy to make a profit, the trader would go to prison. Instead, if it was not an explicit front-run, and the behavior was more abstract, the dealer would not go to prison and potentially make a great deal of money.
-In terms of technology, these traders took a feed and received information regarding what others were trading. They would receive this information 20 milliseconds before others. Subsequently, they would buy and sell based on this early information feed to make huge amounts of money. This does not result in any good, either socially or economically. This is what high-frequency traders do—they get information from the order flow.
-Professor Sandy Grossman forwarded an important theorem regarding information. Perfectly efficient markets would provide no incentive to seek new information—no profit would be accrued by this type of activity. However, if there is no profit available, no business would attempt to gather this information. As a result, no one could possibly be fully, perfectly informed. This suggests that the idea of perfect information, or anything even close to it, is a pure fiction as well as a contradiction of the efficient market theory. This results in a paradox.

<b>Neo-Arbitrage</b>
-A U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commision (CFTC) commissioner spoke to a high-frequency trader and asked if, in contrast to his current behavior, could he keep his order open for at least a second. The response? “Do you want to go back to the middle- ages???”
-This would not be the middle-ages for greater society. This high-frequency trading discourages real information from being produced. A lot of what is currently going on is business/rent stealing, a form of arbitrage. In sum, arbitrage’s impact is negative.

<b>Tax and Regulatory Avoidance</b>
-The system has devolved to such an extent that there are increasingly sophisticated ways of taking advantage of tax regimes. For instance, in the UK, if you are more efficient in tax avoidance, this results in higher profitability. It has become so bad, that for some companies, some/most of their profits come from regulatory evasion and tax avoidance (e.g., Uber)
-Uber has responded to this, saying “No, we’re new. We’re creating jobs.” Unfortunately, there is no significant evidence that they are creating jobs. Due to their presence, there are probably more total taxi trips. As well, fundamental changes of bargaining structure in society have developed. Similar to the impact of globalization, when you bring large numbers of people into the economy, there are more effective workers (at least on the supply side). If this results in a single monopolist, this changes (and most likely lowers) the bargaining power of workers. Essentially, although there are more of them involved in the economy, these workers have no rights, no collective organization. And the ultimate result? Increase in labor supply and an effective decrease in their bargaining power. The net effect? We experience largely a distributional change. Going back to the Uber example, we have slightly greater rider and consumer convenience, more drivers are brought into the labor market, the company appears to engage in a form of arbitrage, the company attempts to engage in tax avoidance, there is a decrease in labor bargaining. As a result, consumers are better off, there is more labor, overall productivity is probably better off, and Uber is definitely better off. In sum, digital technology leads to complex distributional changes.

<b>Productivity Lag</b>
-Despite the influx of digital technology into the economy, why is this not showing up in increasing productivity?
-This impact is not clear in the innovation economy. One improvement is that digital technology has created better advertising for the economy. For example, Google has become a better “advertising agency” (e.g., it sells advertisements through its search engine, hence it de facto operates as an advertising agency) due to the influence of digital technology.
-And although Google may have become a better, more successful advertising agency, how do you compare that value with the value of electricity? With the value of the automobile? The airplane?
-As a result, technology and innovation has, therefore, not led to a fundamental transformation of the economy unlike, say, electricity, automobiles, and airplanes.

<b>The Value of the Search Engine/The Production of “Public” Goods</b>
-1. The value of the internet search engine has been significant (e.g., as an economic good). For example, the search engine has been effective in relation to advertising as per Google discussed earlier. Economists have underestimated the value of Facebook. People enjoy communicating with others in ways that they could not have engaged in before its founding.
2. Can public goods be provided jointly? (e.g., news and search). Or will they be replaced? 
-There is already advertising-supported internet search, as well as advertising-supported news.
-Is there another way of providing quasi-public goods (e.g., such as searches and news) aside from the ones listed above?
-Due to these factors, we need to re-examine how we provide things like internet searches, news, etc.

<b>Information Complexity</b>
-There are two-sided changes:
-(a) With greater information, banks have increased the complexity of their operation, but they don’t necessarily have, or provide, more information. As a result, they circumvent ways that they can be monitored. Only report loan books remain. They cannot be processed. 
-In terms of the financial sector, how do they make stuff so complex, regulators can’t figure what they are doing (e.g., high-frequency trading)? For example, there are billions of trades that occur over the course of milliseconds. As a result, this produces an echo system to circumvent monitoring/regulation. This finally results in a marked contrast between destroying and creating wealth. As a result, this has resulted in an increasing dysfunctional financial sector.

<b>Privacy </b>
-(b) Privacy has become an increasing concern. This is especially important in terms of government’s ability to collect and use information that we do not want them to use.

<b>The Impact of Digital Technology on the Development Sector</b>
-In term of development, there are some real benefits due to the wide availability of low cost digital technology.
-However, the World Development Report, concerning the Digital Economy, had insights that were much more mixed.
-These results from the World Development Report reflected the discussion of this panel. You cannot be overly optimistic or pessimistic.

<b>Equilibrium</b>
-You have to look at particular stories, especially regarding partial equilibrium. It is beneficial to have a general equilibrium effect. In a global economic system, there is such a thing as large differences in comparative advantage. It is the basis of trade in goods.
-In terms of the service sector, tradable goods are not very important. There are less comparative advantages to developing countries.
-In terms of the manufacturing sector, concerning apparel, with advanced technology, you can make a shirt that is designed to the specifications of a particular individual.
-We have moved to a highly capital-intensive technology that is also highly mobile. As a result, comparative advantage has almost disappeared. From this change, industrial sectors like apparel production could move back to the U.S.

<b>Conclusions </b>
-These fundamental changes discussed could have positive impacts if we manage them correctly. 
-If we manage regulation correctly, as well as manage microeconomic and macroeconomic policy, there can be positives (e.g., extra leisure) or negatives (e.g., monopoly, unemployment).
