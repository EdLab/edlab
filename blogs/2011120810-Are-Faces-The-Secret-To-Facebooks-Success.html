            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/floridamemory/3328074451/" title="Smiley face written in the sky during the inauguration of Governor Bob Martinez by State Library and Archives of Florida, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3366/3328074451_29cdf54924_m.jpg" width="240" height="162" alt="Smiley face written in the sky during the inauguration of Governor Bob Martinez"></a>

It may seem obvious, ridiculously simple actually, but human faces may be the reason why Facebook still dominates the social media stratosphere.  New research commissioned by the site and conducted by <a href="http://www.neurofocus.com/">NeuroFocus</a> in Berkeley, CA discovered (or reaffirmed for anyone who has studied human development) that the prominent focus on people's faces leads to a higher level of emotional engagement. 

<a href="http://mashable.com/2011/12/07/facebook-faces-emotion/">This Mashable article</a> lays-out the study's basic attributes and what follows are Dr. A.K. Pradeep, the founder & CEO of NeuroFocus' thoughts on increased user engagement: 

<i>“As you can see, one of the dominant features of Facebook is the human face,” he says. “The face is a window to the emotions.” Pradeep says that since childhood we are trained to read people's faces to discern emotion, and that such information is key to survival: Thus the stimulation we experience when scanning our newsfeeds.</i>

<b>How might this study's results be applied to EdLab projects and platforms?</b>
I think a main take-away here would be to enlarge and re-focus our design of <a href="">Ednode</a> to better emphasize and highlight user profile pictures.  Currently, profile pictures are displayed in search results as small thumbnails, perhaps we want to re-think this design?  We could create a "flip-book"-style navigation through user profile pictures?  As we develop new and enhance existent tools and platforms how can we increase and further highlight the "human factor"... even something as seeming simple as increasing the size of a profile picture could have a huge impact on user experience and ultimately increase engagement.
