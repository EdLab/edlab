<p>Wiki products <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/2848/the-discrepancies-behind-citing-wikipedia-sources">seem</a> to be <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1686/wikipedia-and-the-library">omnipresent</a> in the world of academia and education. However, because there are so many ways in which they can be used, for better or for worse, researchers across the world are diving into studies to uncover best practices for taking advantage of online resources like Wikipedia and Wikibooks in the classroom.</p>
 
<p>In this study, a researcher from Hong Kong employed Wikibooks in a 96 person undergraduate linguistics course, where the students were tasked with learning the English language and methods to teach English as a second language (ESL). Students used Wikibooks to write an academic book online, and then edited and commented on their peers’ books through the Wiki platform. Using pre-study surveys and follow-up interviews, the researcher discovered that most of the students found the course to be student-centered and were able to build cooperative learning relationships with peers. However, some of the students cited a few challenges with the course, such as new concepts that were unfamiliar and unclear, which prevented them from effectively putting together their Wikibooks project. Many students confessed that they did not read their peers’ chapters as diligently later in the semester when their workload increased.</p>
 
<p>Overall, the students from this study reflected in their surveys and interviews that they enjoyed the opportunity to work collaboratively with peers, whether it was through the peer learning aspect—where they read each other’s chapters—or the peer teaching and assessment part, where they presented their work and graded each other’s projects. The use of Wikibooks as a platform for facilitating this type of peer-to-peer academic work may prompt other classes—post-secondary or otherwise—to consider integrating more online platforms in their curricula. By using open-source libraries and peer editing features, teachers can encourage a truly collaborative learning environment in their classrooms.</p>
