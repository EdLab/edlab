What would it look like to prioritize geography, culture, and yes, food in school curriculums? Students <i>can</i> learn about culture, architecture, history, and geology through food with state-of-the-art resources. From cooking to environmental education, students engage in this and more at <a href= "http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/">Sydney Living Museums. </a><p>

Founded in the 1980s, Living Museums is an innovative museum hybrid deeply invested in history, education, and technology. The museum website states, "Sydney Living Museums cares for a group of 12 of the most important historic houses, gardens and museums in NSW on behalf of the people of NSW." The museum upholds four core tenets as part of its historical and educational work. It believes in being: authentically resourceful, personally fascinating, sociable hosts, and reviving and revitalizing. The museum seeks to increase engagement in the long term through careful scholarship and interactive experiences in historical spaces. The museum actively teaches the work of conservation in an effort to build interest and knowledge about important spaces. <p>

The museum has developed innovative "primary programs" that allow students to experience the life of children and adults in bygone eras. These programs are broken down into stages, subjects, and locations. The museum relies heavily on creative play, technology, experience, and investigation. While many of the learning experiences are site based, there are some that are virtual. These "virtual excursions" allow participants to quite literally walk in the shoes of past figures. <p>

Do you think making food and hands-on experience is a good way to learn about history? Share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18472">in the ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@1:02 Carla:</b> I wonder if they make connections to modern ways of these practices as well. For example, for the most part I bet pickling is the same as it was, but there may be advancements (like certain powders or containers) that allow you to cut the time it normally took in half.<p>

<b>@01:21 Anthony123:</b> "I like the idea that you learn about history by what was produced during each era."<p>

<b>@01:26 Carla:</b> "It's great that kids get to take home what they've made!"<p>
