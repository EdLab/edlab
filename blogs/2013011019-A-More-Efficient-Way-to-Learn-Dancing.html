<p><b>Title:</b> Automatic Dance Lesson Generation (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Yang Yang, Howard Leung, LiHua Yue, & LiQun Deng
</p>

<b>Study Design:</b> Mimicry is an important part of learning, especially in movement-based subjects like dance. The traditional method of learning a physical skill is to watch and attempt to imitate the moves of an instructor. The authors of this study attempted to analyze the learning path of physical skill acquisition by observing the patterns created by dance learners and trying to teach those patterns to other novice dancers as an alternative method of instruction. 
</p>

<p>In <i><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=06095501">Automatic Dance Lesson Generation</a></i> the authors attempted to recognize a learning path for dance acquisition. They used 35 <a href="http://physbam.stanford.edu/cs448x/old/Optical_Motion_Capture_Guide.html">optical markers</a> on different body parts to capture 3D motion pictures and analyzed the repetitive and non-repetitive patterns used by novice dancers as they learned. They used this data to create a learning system based on pattern instruction and tested this learning system in contrast to traditional dance learning on 40 students who had never had formal dance instruction. The students learned two different styles of dance, and the time it took them to reach mastery was recorded by the authors. The students were also judged for technical proficiency and asked to take a questionnaire at the end of the learning period. 
</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The researchers found that students learned faster on average with the pattern-based learning system than the traditional dance instruction. Students also felt better about the pattern-based instruction, with 75% reporting that it was effective and 65% confirming that the study made effective use of these new technologies.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> There is nothing wrong with traditional dance instruction, but studies like this one may shed light on new technology-based learning strategies that would help us learn faster and better than traditional instruction. The promising results of this structured pattern analysis and application may also have implications for non-physical learning. It is more difficult to observe mental pattern-making, but the results of this study suggest that there is much to learn about instruction from observing novice learning.
