<i>We don’t claim to have all the answers. We don’t think that the Raspberry Pi is a fix to all of the world’s computing issues; we do believe that we can be a catalyst. We want to see cheap, accessible, programmable computers everywhere; we actively encourage other companies to clone what we’re doing. We want to break the paradigm where without spending hundreds of pounds on a PC, families can’t use the internet. We want owning a truly personal computer to be normal for children</i> (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>).

<b>Ripe for the Picking</b><br>
Mobile, scalable & cheap, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> sounds like a confection, but it is actually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">single-board</a>, Linux-based computer.  The simple, mini computer can be hooked up to any display and keyboard, and combines just enough "DIY-U" challenge to engage students.  Perhaps most appealing and practical is the price tag; at $25 for model "A" or $35 for Model "B" the computer is closer in price to a gourmet pie, rather than a powerful computer.  Created by UK-based charitable group, Raspberry Pi Foundation and their partner, <a href="http://blog.broadcom.com/?s=Raspberry+Pi">Broadcom</a>, the computer in a box is well on its way to meeting its goal of encouraging interest in programing and engineering education.  One of the partners in the initiative, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge</a> even describes the project on their site as, "putting the fun back into computing."   Through "Raspberry Jams" (in-person programing meetups) and resources like <a href="http://www.themagpi.com/">The MagPi magazine</a>, created to support Pi enthusiasts, the small computer in a box is ripe for learners of all ages to pick.   
<p>
<b>Simple as Pi</b><br>
The Raspberry Pi Foundation, which was founded in 2009, started to sell Raspberry Pi computers in February of 2012, and since the first model shipped, the pint-sized computer has been heralded as being "so-simple-it’s-revolutionary."  From <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/10/04/broadcom-teaches-kids-to-program-using-raspberry-pi/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+mashable%2Ftech+%28Mashable+%C2%BB+Tech%29">a recent Mashable.com article</a> highlighting the fact that learners can gain programing skills in under an hour, to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.raeng.org.uk%2Fnews%2Fpublications%2Flist%2Freports%2Fget_coding.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFUGuvfsqXFgui1VdVU17yiLTRLkw">The Royal Academy of Engineering’s recent inclusion of Raspberry Pi in their white paper, "Resources to support the learning of computing: a guide for schools"</a> the computer has been acclaimed for its potential to be a low-cost and low barrier-of-entry programming and engineering tool for classrooms.  In an article from the August 2012 issue, The MagPi magazine describes how the computer helps to increase independent learning and reduce reliance on an instructor, "One of the great things is that pretty quickly pupils can get to the ‘take off’ point, whereby they’re not dependent upon being fed more information by a teacher, but can explore ideas themselves...."  With extensive help sections, downloads and <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=26">forums</a> Raspberry Pi has the potential to be both accessible to casual learners and a time and cost-saving essential in more formalized educational settings.  Delicious Pi indeed.
