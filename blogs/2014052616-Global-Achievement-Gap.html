            This time year offers a lot of optimism for many students across the country as they receive their college diplomas. However, a college degree does not necessarily guarantee success. In the current global economy, competition for jobs remains high and students must work extra hard to stand out. Often times students ask, “Will this degree land me a job after college?” but a better question to ask is “What skills do I need to have to land a good job after college?”
American students are falling behind our international peers in several academic categories, especially the STEM subjects. Despite being more creative than foreign students, American students are becoming less curious and less innovative. There are many steps that could be taken to <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/defining-ideas/article/169896" target = "blank">improve skills and abilities of American students.</a>

One possible way is through group work and presenting ideas to a large group of people as it shows mastery and confidence of that subject. Students must be presented with more real life situations and find possible solutions to those situations. Standardized exams, the barometer use to assess students (and increasingly educators), are not an effective way of testing. In some countries, students are interviewed as part of their assessment.  Asking good questions shows curiosity, which is vital during a job interview. These skills and many more are what students must improve to increase their chances of success in the job market.
