            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58572505@N04/6420310879/" title="Dimension U logo by CuriousBrooklyn, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6046/6420310879_cf0389fa7e_m.jpg" width="148" height="49" alt="Dimension U logo"></a>

<a href="http://www.dimensionu.com/DimU/default.aspx?">Dimension U</a>, states on their site that the basic premise of their platform for educational gaming is to help K-12 students to, "hone their math and literacy skills, connect with friends, and compete and collaborate while learning."  In addition to providing math, science and literacy-based games and hosting gaming events the site provides a forum for study groups and around content covered in the games.  

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the site is now the home to one of the first, "Play, Learn, Earn" reward systems, that allows parents to add real "pledge" money to their kid's accounts thereby allowing upon completion of a certain number of educational goals and games, the kids to cashed-in parent's pledges for prizes listed on the site.  This is one of the first educational gaming platforms to incentivize play through monetary reward.  

<b>Pros:</b>
The game I demo'd from the site, <a href="https://preview.dimensionu.com/students/home/default.aspx?">"GadgetWorks,"</a> seemed easy to understand and was clearly linked to early algebra skills.  The game design & dynamics were fun and graphically appealing, with clear, easy to follow instructions and fast-paced pacing.  The reward system "Play, Learn, Earn" seems straightforward, and easy to initiate with your parents through an email you can send to them through the system.  A nice caveat is that you can play without this extra "reward" system in place and will have the same game experience, thereby not penalizing a less financially secure child.  The Dimension U leader-board and virtual tokens awarded for high scores are another way to incentivize performance without actual currency. 

<b>Cons:</b>
I was confused by the branding of the different sections, Dimension M for Math, Dimension L for Reading etc. These special section designators are not easy to find or distinguish between.  The site explains these designations as follows: 

<i>You can click on the orbiting green M above to transport yourself to DimensionM, where you'll find multiplayer educational games for Math, click on the purple L for the land of Literacy, or click on the blue S to transport yourself to DimensionS where you can work on your Science skills.</i>

I would steer-clear of too many nested categories and instead, rely on clearer hierarchies within ONE site.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The lab is committed to investigating new ways to both present scholarly academic material, as well as fresh, exciting ways to reinvigorate the experience of learning.  Online educational gaming is a great way to investigate and explore the latter, while collecting and studying information on how learners learn and gaining insight into the best ways to present information to optimize learning and retention.  There is a great belief that is alive and well at the EdLab that, "'Play' can accomplish the same things as 'work.'"  

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
As we continue to think about developing games and content in general for the education sector, it is important to remember that too many nested hierarchies can be confusing for users to navigate.  Additionally, there are many different kinds of incentives that can be built-into a virtual learning environment, platform, site or game.  These incentives can be financially based, as in read the following articles & comment for the chance to win a prize, or intrinsic motivators that allow a student or reader to learn something new or play a game for the shear job of the experience.
