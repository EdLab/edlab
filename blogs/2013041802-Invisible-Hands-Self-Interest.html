            Economics is often defined as the study of how individuals make choices and how those choices interact. The world of economics has seen many great thinkers like Adam Smith enlighten us about how the economy works. In my economics class, we've discussed how Adams Smith's ideas played a key role in the infrastructure of economics as it is known today. In his seminal book, the Wealth of Nations, Smith emphasized the importance of economic freedom: he believed that self-interest will bring about a better functional and productive market economy. The idea of self-interest will open the door for a free market economy or free enterprise, <i>laissez faire.</i>

Smith introduced the concept of an <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/sleight-of-the-invisible-hand/">invisible hand</a> in his writing; the invisible hand been the natural force that self regulates the market economy. The concept explains that an individual decision in a market economy to benefit them will actually make the economy better off as a whole. The force that leads to making the entire economy better off is the invisible hand. An example of invisible hand is an individual making a decision to buy coffee and a bagel to make them better off, that person decision will make the economic society as a whole better off. The decision of buying the coffee and the bagel will make the seller better because of profit and also make the production market that distributes the goods better. This pattern will benefit everyone in the circular flow because it will make the firms and the market who produce resources better off.  The principle actually explains how interaction through trade benefits everyone.
