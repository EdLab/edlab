<p><i>"PowerToFly makes it easier for companies to find great female talent, while attracting more women to the tech workforce. I feel very lucky to be able to serve this community of women."</i> (<a href="https://www.powertofly.com/talents/70">Milena Berry</a>, Power to Fly) </p>
 
<p><b>Tech Jobs for Women Worldwide</b></p>

<p>Katharine Zaleski and Milena Berry started <a href="https://connect.powertofly.com/">PowerToFly</a> with similar goals in mind: they wanted to create a place for women in technology fields to showcase their talents and attain recognition for their work—all while working remotely in the generally male-dominated tech world. Both Zaleski and Berry are mothers, and they understand and appreciate the draw of working from home. Through PowerToFly, they work with women (with and without children alike) from all over the world. They’ve started to expand in places like Saudi Arabia, Palestine, and Haiti—places where women often <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/01/09/power-to-fly-women-tech/">pursue IT degrees but are rarely able to leave home</a> to find work. One of Zaleski’s founding goals is to ensure that more women are able to work for pay, which in turn enables them to support other women by paying for childcare, local goods, and other services. </p>

<p><b>Benefits of PowerToFly</b></p>
 
<p>A thorough orientation is in place for women before they can apply for jobs on PowerToFly, which sets people up for greater success. Users create a profile and either fill out a questionnaire or submit a video interview. Once set up on the site, users can connect with each other and read articles posted to the site—how to find the ideal work/life balance, for example, as well as many other relatable topics. The co-founders make sure that working remotely is successful for both the employee and the employer. Zaleski and Berry offer webinars on working remotely to employers who list jobs on their site, as well as potential employees, to ensure that everyone is getting the most out of the experience. To ease the transition, PowerToFly assigns talent managers for each new employee and their respective employer, and daily reports help talent managers keep everyone on track. All of these features and more make this a wonderful platform for women to interact and let their talents shine. With other sites, like Linkedin, it’s easy to get lost in a sea of entrepreneurs—but with PowerToFly, you get an easy-to-navigate, personalized experience in continuing education and professional development. </p>
