<b>The Details and Back-story</b>
<a href="http://www.skillshare.com/about/manifesto">Skillshare</a> was started in early April 2011 with the mission of helping to democratize teaching and learning by allowing anyone to learn from a peer workshop anywhere.  Co-founder Mike Karnjanaprakorn, goes further in <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/skillshare-raises-3-1-million-to-turn-everyone-into-teachers/">this New York Time's article</a> from August 2011, describing one of the group's goals as being to, "broaden access to classroom learning and education, much as Airbnb expanded the accommodations market for adventurous travelers."  

Anyone can sign on to become an instructor and use the site to promote their workshop or class in one of the following categories; creative arts, culinary arts, entrepreneurship, lifestyle and technology.  Participants then rate their experience with this instructor and their offering.  Instructors are able to charge money for their courses and Skillshare takes a 15% cut of these course fees.     

Karnjanaprakorn was chosen as a TED Fellow for 2012.  Learn more about this TED initiative <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2011/10/25/meet-the-ted2012-fellows/">here</a>. 

<b>Unique Point of Difference</b>
Skillshare seems to want to encourage a wide breadth of courses, from scone-making to programming, while at the same time maintaining a niche focus.  Another distinction is that the courses are all P2P-based workshops with an emphasis on in-person interaction and not online learning as many ed startups are now focused.  A final unique point-of-difference is that users can follow favorite instructors and classes, allowing for easy updates on new courses.

<b>EdLab Takeaway</b>
As we develop new projects and products for the mSchool it is important to both offer a variety of courses and to define who our core audience could be and then develop courses around their needs.  For example, a class on alpaca knitting may be interesting to the young, urban professional Skillshare focuses on, but not necessarily, a suburban middle-school teacher who wants to gain new professional development credentials.
