            **KEEP PRIVATE**

Ugh...School Library Journal, a monthly publication for librarians, particularly those that work with younger students and children, recently published a <a href="http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/home/891612-312/something_to_shout_about_new.html.csp">'study'</a> on the value of librarians. To be honest this study is outright offensive and a disservice to those of us who do value the importance of high-quality librarians. I suggest everyone interested in statistics to take a brief look to have some idea of what bad statistics looks like. An undergraduate who has taken a basic statistical inference or econometrics course could easily come up with something better than this.

When you're trying to figure out whether librarians are important to reading achievement, your job is NOT to analyze how closely reading achievement correlates with the presence of librarians on its own. If the direct correlation between reading achievement and the presence of librarians is .56, does that mean 56% of reading achievement can be explained by the work of librarians? NO! If an undergraduate who had just finished taking econometrics were running this study, he would first gather all of the relevant, but still independent, variables that have been shown to matter for reading achievement. Then he would run a regression on all of those variables plus a binary variable for the presence of librarians. Using robust standard errors, he could see whether the coefficient on said binary variable was significantly (2 robust standard errors) greater or less than zero. If there were enough data points, he could also include interaction variables between the presence of librarians in poor income areas or large high schools in the regression. Then he can run an F-test to see whether all of the variables related to the presence of librarians is at least jointly significant to the regression.

But the study fails to meet even this minimum standard. Instead, they run a basic correlation between reading achievement and the presence of librarians. As one often hears, correlation does not imply causation. They claim to correct for endogenous variables by also running a regression of reading achievement on librarian cuts as a percentage of total staff cut. This is an incredibly crude and flawed method for controlling for endogenous variables but we'll leave that for later. They do claim that they are going to run a follow-up study that includes more control variables; let's hope they can do better.

<b>The real crime here</b> is their emphasis on the wrong set of numbers. They are far too concerned with stating how pretty their correlation is (aka the R-squared value), rather than focusing on the significance of the coefficient associated with the presence of librarians. We first need to figure out whether librarians are statistically significant to academic achievement. If so, then we test to see how significant. These researchers have not taken the first step to truly determining whether librarians are significant among the whole suite of inputs required for improved reading achievement.

As a minor point, they probably ought to dig deeper than the state level (50n data points). Am I surprised that states that hired librarians tended to have better achievement scores than those that fired librarians? No, because being able to afford librarians also means you are probably a richer school. Moreover, each state has policies that could potentially distort what this study aims to capture. As far as 'librarians cut as a percentage of total staff', there are typically only one or two librarians/media specialists at a given school. Thus, this method of "controlling" for a school's financial state is just a proxy for school size in all likelihood. 

Keep in mind that this is the skeptic in me speaking. I still think that, given the anecdotal evidence I've come across as well as my own intuition, <i>librarians matter</i>. The School Library Journal is doing a disservice to its cause and constituency by publishing such shallow analysis.
