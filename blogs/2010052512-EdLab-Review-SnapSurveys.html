            Edlab review: Snapsurveys

<img src=http://www.snapsurveys.com/images/snap-logo-wo.gif>
<b>A single software solution supporting all survey modes, in any language for all market sectors.</b>

http://www.snapsurveys.com/us/ <br>

Snapsurveys is a survey software that covers both online and paper survey solution. Snapsurveys provides various types of survey mode and it includes online, paper, PDA, mobile, kiosk, and phone. It also provides simultaneous multilingual services. 

In the survey mode, pictures or diagrams can be used. Throughout a web hosting, it can also collect a huge sample data and help analyze the results in real time. Researchers design questionnaires and can upload it on a snap webhost. It also helps make paper surveys and provide scanning function. Scanning can recognize not only checkboxes, but also various free format number and printed hand writing text.  

<b>Price:</b>
- Online + paper: $1,995 (single PC installation), $2,495 (Corporate Network Installation)  
- Snap WebHost: $2,995 (software purchase), Annual subscription (Price based on total responses) 
- Education institutions and not for profit organizations can benefit from a discount on all survey software (price is not specified for this case). 


<b>How it works:</b>
Once you install the software and open it, you see a survey overview which has templates that can be used in various survey goals and modes. After choosing a template from the dropdown menu, you can edit survey contents. In the dropdown menu, you can choose table style, questionnaire design, language, etc. Once you finish filling out contents, you can export it into various file types, such as rtf, html, or txt.<br>

<b>Prop points:</b>
Snap Survey Software is a powerful, intuitive survey system for questionnaire design, publishing, data collection and analysis supporting all survey modes (Web, E-mail, Paper, Scanning, Kiosk, Phone, PDA, Tablet PC) in any language (e.g. European, Asian, Far Eastern, etc). Snap provides software solutions for all market sectors, including: Education, Healthcare, Government, Non-profit, Market Research and Corporate sectors. Snap's extensive library of questions and styles helps you set-up surveys quickly and includes the ability to generate your own in-house style templates and question libraries for custom solutions with unique formatting and content. Advanced data management capabilities provide Excel, MS Access or SQL database connectivity allowing Snap to integrate directly with your CRM, LMS, HR or other administrative systems. Snap has robust analysis capability to manage your results as tables (cross-tabs, frequencies, grids), charts (2D & 3D) and reports including both descriptive & multivariate statistics. Export your survey results in a variety of formats including SPSS, MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, etc), PDF, HTML, SQL, and Triple-S XML.

<b>Drop points:</b>
There are some drawbacks to the Snapsurveys software. First, system requirements are mainly limited to Windows operating system: Windows 95, 98, ME, NT 4, 2000, XP, Vista or later. Also, JavaScript-enabled browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, are required to make it function properly. <br>

In terms of sharing, even though there is a helpdesk and user training sessions, there is no user discussion forum or board to share usability issues or ideas among Snapsurvey users. Also, it seems that survey language translation function is based on Windows language support, since Chinese character was chosen, all letters became broken. Therefore, it would be hard to say that it is fully web-based. <br>

Finally, Snapsurveys is a “software”, so users still need time to maximize its usability.<br> 

<b>Final score: </b>
Snapsurveys aims to provide users with survey environment available in a range of formats. It supports online, paper, PDA, and kiosk survey. Snapsurveys makes it possible to export to web, import from other formats, and scan from paper survey.  Therefore, Snapsurvey Software gives users the flexibility to find what works best for the survey they need. 

Current users of Snapsurvey especially in education include: New York University, University of Michigan, Harvard University, Case Western Reserve University, Dartmouth College, UCLA, Northwestern University, University of Notre Dame, Johns Hopkins, Villanova University, Duke University, and etc.</br>
