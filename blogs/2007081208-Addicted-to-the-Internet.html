            The Internet is a fascinating piece of technology available to tens of millions of people. We can chat with friends, play games, read newspapers, and even shop through the internet. The World Wide Web can be beneficial to all, but is too much internet a bad thing? China's government thinks that some of its citizens are actually addicted to what the internet has to offer. The government has even created a clinic to help “fight” these internet addictions. China is trying to counter this because people are quitting school, becoming violent, and discussing sex. Online pornography has “perverted China's young minds, said the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18089487/">Chinese Government</a>. They also said that some cases of rape were induced by porn. Many internet police are trying to reduce the amount of people looking at erotic videos and images. 

Parents in China are gravely concerned about their children not succeeding in life, so they bring the kids to the first internet clinic funded by the government. Some of the “addicts” are actually over 20 years old. Some voluntarily admit themselves into the clinic because they believe that the problem is destroying their lives. Nurses at the clinic say that some effects of internet addiction are lack of sleep, not eating, failing in school, not interacting with people face-to-face, and even death. One clinic in Daxing, Beijing charges $1,300 per month for their services, which is run by Dr. Tao Ran. In this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/21/AR2007022102094_2.html">clinic</a>, patients live in artificial environments. Some of them will receive medication and even shock therapy. However, there are some fun and harmless activities also. The patients go through therapy, acupuncture, and sports, stated in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-07-01-china-web-addiction_x.htm">USAToday's</a> article. 

South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam are taking steps to curb internet addiction. They are temporarily closing down some internet cafes that teens often hang out in. The Chinese Government also censors some websites and blocks access at certain times. The doctors and nurses blame internet addiction on the inability to communicate to others in person and they go on the internet to get away from that problem, while the teens say that they go online to get away from the pressure to excel in school that their parents put on them. The patients that have undergone the treatments have said that they feel much better. They want to stop going on the internet and focus more on school. The clinic does not cure them; the teens themselves must resist the internet and concentrate on their studies, family, and friends. The kids are said to now have exercise, meals, and sleep on a regular basis because of the treatments. 

The United States may also have this problem, even though the effects are rare. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/internet/12/24/internet.addiction/index.html">Medical research</a> shows that some people need to use the internet. Some people noted that their relationships and jobs have been affected due to excessive internet use. Internet addiction may not be a major problem at all, but still one that should be examined carefully.
