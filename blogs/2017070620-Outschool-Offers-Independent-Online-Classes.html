<p><i>"Outschool connects motivated learners, parents, and teachers together to create great learning experiences."</i> (<a href="https://outschool.com/about">About Outschool</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Independent Online Classes</b></p>

<p><a href="https://outschool.com">Outschool</a> is a new online learning platform that creates a space for independent teachers to host small classes via video chat and messages. The platform offers classes for Kâ€“12 students who want to explore various subjects outside regular school hours. Although the platform was originally geared toward homeschoolers, it has since switched its focus to all students eager to learn. Outschool classes occur over video chat, where students communicate with their teacher and their peers.</p>

<p>The classes offered range from reinforcing the basics to exploring the zany. Some of the more interesting titles include Minecraft Shakespeare, The Science of Harry Potter, and Act as a Juror for a Civil Case. Teachers decide class length, size, and age group. Most classes are capped at 10 students, and while some extend over the course of an entire semester, others are one-time affairs. This means that Outschool classes can complement courses taken during the school year or give students more learning opportunities throughout the summer.</p>

<p><b>Outschool Instructors</b></p>
 
<p>Outschool instructors include trained teachers, artists, everyday professionals, and even parents. There are hundreds of independent teachers on Outschool collectively offering over 1,000 classes. Instructors can choose to teach on any topic they want, and they receive almost all of the tuition fees that each learner pays. Because of this, Outschool has become a popular choice for many trained teachers to earn extra income while gaining experience in online education.</p>
