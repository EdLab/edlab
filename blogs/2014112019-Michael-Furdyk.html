<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I started my career in technology quite young after receiving a Commodore 64 for Christmas in 1985 at the age of 2, so I grew up "bathed in bits" as Don Tapscott says. I wasn't the most engaged by my educational experience, but there were a few special teachers who helped me accelerate my passion for tinkering and innovation. I realized that there was huge untapped opportunity for technology to support (not replace) educators in delivering meaningful, real-world learning opportunities for students. After pursuing my passion for technology in a for-profit setting (and selling my second startup to a US company before the bubble burst in 2000), I decided to create a charity to address this opportunity. Initially our work was focused on supporting informal student learning, but in response to overwhelming educator feedback at conference presentations, we launched a program to offer professional development and global collaborative projects. I recently completed a Masters of Design in Inclusive Design at OCAD University, where I was able to build on my ideas for inclusion in education and launch the new <a href="http://www.futurefriendlyschools.org/">Future Friendly Schools</a> program I discuss in one of my other responses.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> Rather than think we ourselves need to be responsible for the change, we've identified many great examples of educators with impressive projects that are already making a significant impact. One goal we have is to showcase the great examples already out there of effective global collaboration taking place. To this end, we launched "Take Your Classroom Global", a partnership with ISTE and Microsoft many years back, and published a "best practices" publication to recognize leaders and help to inspire others. Recently, we've launched a new Projects section to support educators in sharing their ideas and finding collaborators.
<p>
While it's certainly impressive to see the explosion of venture-backed educational technology startups over the last few years, so many are focused on providing solutions to remove the "pain points" of a traditional classroom and pedagogical approach - which have contributed to the lack of engagement school systems in North America are seeing (for example, the 2011 MyVoice study found that 46% of U.S. high school students say they find school boring). By encouraging values such as student voice and global citizenship (see our new Future Friendly Schools program in your follow up question), and providing free programs for student-directed project-based learning, we hope to empower educators to facilitate more engaging learning opportunities for their students.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> On the technology side, mobile and wearable technology is an exciting emerging trend. With battery life improving and processing power increasing, we're all holding a computer in our hand many thousands of times more powerful than my 1984 Commodore 64. It's exciting to imagine how new wearable devices from Google, Sony, and Apple will support on-demand consumption of learning.
<p>
The mainstreaming of the maker movement, documented in the recent book "<a href="http://www.inventtolearn.com/"><i>Invent to Learn</i></a>, combined with the rise of crowdsourcing is also exciting to watch. We need to make sure the next generation of learners have the creative outlets that will enable them to think outside the box and create the next Fortune 100 company or powerful invention. And combined with crowdsourcing, that young inventor doesn't have to worry about being rejected from a venture capitalist who thinks her idea is too unlikely to work or lacks a market. They can leverage the power of their social networks to raise the funds they need to propel their ideas forward.
<p>
Finally, the rise of social innovation & entrepreneurship is our only hope to address the increasingly complex nature of social issues. We need every student to feel inspired and equipped to solve problems - local or global, small or large - and by embedding these issues and entrepreneurship skills & thinking into classroom projects, we get the bonus side benefit of making learning much more engaging. We've been lucky to have the support of the Pearson Foundation to launch our <a href="http://sprout.tigweb.org/">Sprout Ideas initiative</a>, which offers a free, self-guided "Sprout Self" e-course along with facilitated course cycles often culminating in mentorship and funding for graduates at the high school or university level. In partnership with <a href="http://www.prometheanplanet.com/en-us/professional-development/best-practice/education-fast-forward/">Education Fast Forward</a>, we've just announced the EFF Sprout Innovation Fund and we're looking for youth (30 and under) to help take their big ideas for education to the next level (learn more <a href="http://www.effdebate.org/action/">here</a>â€”It's an opportunity I wish I had when I was getting started!
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Our current focus is <a href="http://www.futurefriendlyschools.org/">Future Friendly Schools</a>, a certification and network of schools dedicated to global citizenship, environmental stewardship, and student voice. Knowing we weren't the only organization working in these areas, in 2013 we crowd-sourced our indicators and had more than 4,500 non-profits, educators, students, and parents give their input. 11 of the program's 15 principles came directly from the more than 100 new ideas submitted. After working with a few pilot schools to refine the process, we're now looking for a few schools engaged in these areas to join our founding cohort, so I encourage your readers to reach out if they're interested!
<p>
Another big project is making our entire site mobile-responsive (on track to be completed by year-end) and increasing our presence on the mobile learning front. We currently have three mobile learning programs: <a href="http://www.commit2act.org">Commit2Act</a>, a mobile environmental action tracking tool, <a href="http://www.explore150.ca">Explore150</a>, a local discovery and historical learning platform specific to Canada, and <a href="http://www.cultureconnect.us">Culture Connect</a>, an intercultural learning and exchange program. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Here are several of my mentors, all active in the movement to improve education systems around the world, and support educators in creating rich, deep, engaging learning experiences:

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bruceadixon">Bruce Dixon</a>, President AALF</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/garystager">Gary Stager</a>, Author, <i>Invent to Learn</i></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gbutler_at_ci">Greg Butler</a>, Partner, Collaborative Impact / New Pedagogies for Deep Learning</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/julielindsay">Julie Lindsay</a>, Flat Connections
