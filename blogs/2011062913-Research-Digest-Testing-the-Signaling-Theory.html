<a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/millimet/classes/eco7321/papers/lang%20kropp.pdf">Lang, Kevin., Kropp, David. (1986). Human Capital Versus Sorting: The Effects of Compulsory Attendance Laws.  The Quarterly Journal of Economics 101(3), 609-624.</a>

The last paper I discussed was so directly relevant to the work at Edlab that I thought for the next one I could really go out into left field.  This is a paper that surfaced during an ongoing debate over the purpose of education in America that Skanda and I have been following for the past few days.  It attempts to find evidence of whether education is primarily about human-capital formation (actually learning productive skills) or signaling (demonstrating your inherent skills and abilities to employers through degrees attained).
<!--break-->
Description:

To test this question, the authors have found a “natural experiment” in the various Compulsary Attendance Laws (CALs) that have been passed over the years in different states.  Under the human capital formation theory, they claim, requiring students to attend school for more years should have any impact on those not directly affected by the law.  Under the signaling model, however, we should see a ripple effect following from the implementation of the law.  Once a lot more people are attaining a certain level of education due to a CAL, the signal sent by that amount of education is concurrently diluted, so that now everybody seeks even more education so as to send the appropriate signal about their qualifications.  Of course there are various caveats to both these claims (there could be second order effects even under the human capital model, the “ripples” predicted under the signaling theory may be less evident in certain circumstances, etc.). 

So the test is whether or not implementing CALs increases the enrollment of age groups not directly affected by them.  Data on CALs is apparently not easy to find, so the most recent data they use are from 1965 (with other sets stretching back to 1908).  As well, these CALs are limited solely, as one would expect, to high school education.  Despite its various drawbacks, which may attenuate the relevance of the study, the conclusions the authors draw from the data are fairly interesting.

It looks like there is a significant correlation between the implementation of a CAL and increased enrollment rates in age groups not directly affected.  There are other possible explanations (one that immediately springs to mind, which they discuss, is the possibility that making people go to school longer teaches them that they would benefit from going to school even long than the new requirement), but none are so plausible as to lead me to immediately discount their conclusion (not that I would anyway, given my biases).  

EdLab Relevance:

I suppose a long-term effect of work of this kind would be greater support for the kinds of changes that Edlab has been pushing and spearheading.  The more people believe that our current education system isn't really about educating, the more enthusiastic they will be about dismantling it to take advantage of the productivity gains made possible by new technologies.
