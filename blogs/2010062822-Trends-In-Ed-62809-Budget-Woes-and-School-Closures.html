            Education officials in are <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lacoe-schools-20100628,0,6422522.story">on the verge of closing alternative high schools in the Los Angeles area</a> as part of the county's budget woes. Alternative high schools in Los Angeles County cater predominantly to students who went the traditional route but were either expelled, arrested (and currently on probation), pregnant or new mothers, among others who for some reason or another cannot return to traditional schools. The closure is a direct result of California's economic troubles as a 20% budget decrease for the past fiscal year left alternative schools scrambling to stay open.  According to county officials, another reason for why they are closing alternative schools is the lack of enrollment, especially from referrals from school districts that are also facing the brunt of the state's economic problems.

However, not all hope is lost. One of the many proposals up for recommendations include a last ditch effort by school officials and county leaders to keep the schools open for at least the next 30 days in order to urge local school districts to find a way to keep the schools open and share costs.  The greater concern among opponents of the closure concern the future of the students, most of whom have made great strides through alternative programs and hence there is a great risk of them becoming lost in the system.
