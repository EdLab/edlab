University of Queensland's Advanced Engineering Building (AEB) incorporates new learning strategies and fancy high tech equipment. But for 130 million dollars, was it money well spent?  Professor David St. John of the School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering thinks so. He appreciates being able to practice such pedagogies as "design, build, and test" within the newly built active learning labs, design studios, and modeling/simulation labs. <p>

Perhaps the crown jewel of the renovation is the 500-seat, all-wooden GHD Auditorium, featured in the video above (<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11613#time=30&comment_id=74645">@00:30</a>).  This theater, as well as the entire building, is energy-efficient, utilizing solar shading, an open ventilation system, and operable blinds on the exterior of the structure that block direct sunlight from entering, thus reducing the amount of air conditioning needed to cool the building. It has received one of the highest ratings of sustainability allotted to Australian buildings (a Green Star rating of 5 out of 6). <p>

While it is still too early to tell the effect the new facility will have on its students (construction of the projection wrapped only months ago), the renovation has been positive for UQ’s reputation. As excitement over the new building carries across campuses and news outlets, UQ’s standing as a world leader in engineering education grows ever more solid. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:19 Rita:</b> The building was conceptualized to address the growing # of students and also to implement new teaching and learning spaces.<p>

<b>@00:31 MartinPaper:</b> A state of the art lecture hall? You would think that more money would have gone into more modern learning environments. I'm disappointed to see the legacy of the lecture hall continue with this renovation. They could have at least made a flexible theater space!
