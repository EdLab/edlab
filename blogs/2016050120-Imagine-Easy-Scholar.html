<p><a href="https://www.iescholar.com">Imagine Easy Scholar</a>, a project from Imagine Easy Solutions, is a browser-based tool that enables teachers and students to collaborate on research and writing. The program easily integrates with EasyBib, the generator that helps students collect and cite research articles. Students can highlight information directly in a website and copy it onto digital notecards for their research. Imagine Easy Scholar also incorporates the teacher into assignment development. Teachers can monitor student progress on assignments through visualized analytics.  </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The system allows teachers to access and annotate notes on student work. Google Doc tools are integrated into a system dedicated specifically for teachers and students. With a clear, simple interface, the platform is user-friendly. The tool that really sets this program apart from Google Docs is the analytics feature. Teachers can intervene early if they see that a student is behind by using the program’s graphs and comprehensive summaries. The graphs allow teachers to see the diversity and range of media, content, and sources students are using in their assignments. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>It is important for students to learn formatting along with their work projects. EasyBib cuts out the tedious process of copying bibliographic information into word documents, and Imagine Easy Scholar makes a uniform design for assignments. The platform is designed to save teachers time by streamlining their student work in one place, but there may be paper writing opportunities that students miss because of the program’s simplified approach.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Imagine Easy Solutions removes the painful aspects of research and paper writing for students. The additional insights that teachers are given with the program are valuable, as they can be alerted to take preventative measures for students falling behind. In a world where sharing information happens constantly in various social forums, the importance of citing sources and attributing credit increasingly seems to be a lost cause but Imagine Easy Scholar may help.</p>
