            Is it possible to view Katrina as a simple “failure of infrastructure,” no more, no less?

In the aftermath of the recent bridge collapse in Minneapolis, the mainstream media seem to be drawing a straight line from Katrina, through the July steam pipe explosion in midtown Manhattan, to the I-35 disaster. 

Take this, for example, from the August 4 <i>Wall Street Journal</i>:

<i>A dramatic rush-hour collapse of the eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis into the Mississippi River left at least five confirmed dead and more missing.

The disaster raised anew questions about the safety of the country's aging infrastructure.

Last month, a steam-pipe explosion in Manhattan killed one person, while in April an Oakland highway overpass collapsed after a tanker truck carrying gasoline crashed into a highway support, melting the steel roadway support.  Those accidents follow the 2005 failure of levees during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans….</i>

The following day, <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/opinion/05sun1.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fEditorials>The New York Times</a> editorialized:

<i>The nation's physical foundations seem to be crumbling beneath us.  Last week, a 40-year-old interstate highway bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, plunging rush-hour traffic into the Mississippi River 60 feet below.  Two weeks earlier, an 83-year-old steam pipe under the streets of Manhattan exploded in a volcano-like blast, showering asbestos-laden debris.  And two years before that, substandard levees gave way in New Orleans, opening the way for the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina….</i>

In the black-and-white mindset of the press, it seems, these incidents are all of a piece, symptoms of a nation that simply does not adequately invest in “infrastructure.”  

But such (over?)simplification seems to obscure a host of larger issues.  It would be nice to place the blame for all three incidents squarely on the shoulders of the engineers and inspectors, but they hardly function in a vacuum.  

The Minneapolis and New York incidents took place in downtown areas traversed by people of all walks of life.  Their damage, while alarming to city residents and tragic for the victims and their families, was contained within small areas.  And they certainly did not discriminate:  among <a href=http://www.startribune.com/10136/gallery/1344266.html>the victims</a> were a pregnant 23-year-old refugee from Somalia and her two-year-old daughter, a construction worker, a security consultant, a truck driver, an exercise therapist and a Native American mother of two.  

The failure of the levees in New Orleans, on the other hand, discriminated heavily against the poor and the African-American population of the city.  (See Brown University professor John R. Logan's report,<a href=http://www.s4.brown.edu/Katrina/report.pdf> “The Impact of Katrina: Race and Class in Storm-Damaged Neighborhoods”</a> for documentation.  And for a lesson plan that asks students to consider whether or not the storm's impact on the poor was merely coincidental, or the direct result of specific policy choices, see the <a href=http://www.teachingthelevees.org/curriculum.php>Katrina and Environmental Justice</a> lesson on the <a href=http://teachingthelevees.org>Teaching the Levees</a> website.)  

While residents of Minneapolis were stunned by the I-35 bridge collapse, for the most part their lives went on unaffected.  By coincidence, I was in Minneapolis two days after the incident, which did not keep the crowds away from the cafes on Nicollet Mall Friday night or away from a free outdoor concert downtown. The Minnesota Twins did skip a game Thursday, but continued to play through the weekend at the Metrodome, within eyeshot of the downed bridge. Had we not seen the extensive coverage of the incident on television from our downtown hotel room, we probably would not have even known that it had happened.  In New York, my husband could see the plume of steam from his office window after the pipe explosion in July, but our lives were hardly affected.

By contrast, there is no one in New Orleans unaffected by the failure of the levees.  

So, here is the question:  does classifying Katrina as a “failure of infrastructure” make it too easy for everyone to ignore all the larger issues raised by the failure of the levees? Is everything that has happened in New Orleans since August, 2005, the simple result of subpar engineering? Is it fair to put the near-destruction of a major city in the same docket as a roadway collapse or a pipe explosion?

Or, on the other hand, is the lesson of Katrina so simple that we are straining to read too much into a problem that would have been completely avoided by more competent engineers?

Let us know what you think.
