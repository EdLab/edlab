            As reported by <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://thejournal.com/Articles/2009/06/24/5-States-Developing-Green-Curriculum.aspx">Technical Education</a>, five states -- Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, and Oregon-- have committed to developing green career and technical education initiatives. In collaboration with the United States Department of Education, the states will create secondary and post-secondary programs that will lead to certificates and associate and bachelor degrees.
<blockquote>
"Green means healthier learning environments for students and adults, plus lower energy costs and a stronger economy," said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, also in a statement released this week. "Green programs of study support the administration's goal of expanding a green workforce by preparing students for high-skill, high-wage jobs in a clean energy economy.</blockquote>Among the five, Oregon has been pioneering in its industrial construction and development in this field. It has developed <a href="http://www.blogger.com/This%20is%20a%20104kW%20system%20comprised%20of%20594%20panels.%20Its%20annual%20production%20is%20estimated%20to%20be%20128%20megawatt-hours%20%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%93%20enough%20to%20power%20about%2010%20typical%20homes%20for%20a%20year.%20However,%20The%20Oregon%20Dept%20of%20Transportation%20%28ODOT%29%20is%20using%20it%20to%20power%20the%20lights%20at%20the%20I-5%20&amp;%20I-205%20exchange.">a pilot solar-powered high way</a>, the first of its kind in the nation, installed with a 104kW system comprised of 594 panels.
<blockquote>Its annual production is about 128 megawatt-hours â€” enough to power about 10 typical homes for a year. However, The Oregon Dept of Transportation (ODOT) is using it to power the lights at the I-5 &amp; I-205 exchange.</blockquote><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/3078005880_7eeb96b270.jpg?v=0"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 500px; height: 335px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/3078005880_7eeb96b270.jpg?v=0" alt="" border="0" /></a>
Meanwhile, earlier this month, Austin announced its pilot program called <a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2009/08/17/austin-texas-gets-an-electric-sunflower-garden/"><em>Sunflowers, An Electric Garden</em></a>.
<blockquote>Designed by public art team <a href="http://www.harriesheder.com/index.html">Harries/Heder</a>, the installation consists of 15 flower-like solar photovoltaic panels located on a pedestrian and bike path between the village of Mueller and Austin's highway I-35. </blockquote><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.inhabitat.com/wp-content/uploads/sunflowers4.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 537px; height: 357px;" src="http://www.inhabitat.com/wp-content/uploads/sunflowers4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Global warming and the perishing non-renewable energy resources have become the most crucial issues faced by human beings. While, secondary and post-secondary schools have started to pay attention to bring "green" to their program design, mainly focusing on cultivating future "green" engineers/technologists, however, "green" ideas are missed in most of the K-12 curricula. Additional content orientations in arts and aesthetics are mentioned a lot in the educational field, but the idea of applying "green" in daily life are not integrated into K-12 curricula as well as most teacher education programs.
