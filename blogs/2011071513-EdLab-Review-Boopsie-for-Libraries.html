<a href="http://www.boopsie.com/libraries.html">Boopsie for Libraries</a> is a series of mobile applications to aid in the discovery and access of library materials. It basically performs all of the major job responsibilities I held as a public library page, albeit with far less charm and panache. Famous for supporting the <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/891176-264/ala_annual_2011_boopsie_app.html.csp">ALA conference app</a> this year, Boopsie's cadre of services allow for discovery of catalog and non-catalog content: social media connections, mobile reference, library locations and hours. 

<b>Pros</b>
Boopsie is able to scan book UPC codes and place a hold for the book at your library. This will be especially useful for those of us who love bookstore displays, but refuse to pay for them. The scanner even links to the library's <a href="http://www.overdrive.com/">Overdrive</a> subscription to enable immediate phone reading. It seems infinitely flexible, with its any phone/any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_library_system">ILS</a> promise. The coolest feature by far is BookCheck system, which allows for in-stacks self-checkout! Self-checkout machines have never been cool, automated check-in machines are kind of cool, but every machine for checkout is ancient, bulky, and cranky by definition. This feature alone is a light in the tunnel.

<b>Cons</b>
The system has a static reading list feature that seems a bit outdated, since it features real-time ILS integration, it should update the lists based on availability. The subject index feature also seems a little problematic. It's meant as a discovery tool to augment the keyword search and it's nice that it is included; I just think it's a bit superfluous in such a keyword oriented medium. There's one major oversight in page duties that I can see. The app has a GPS function but it should also be able to point a user towards the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/libetiquette.224324494">library restrooms</a>.
 
<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
Not that we'd ever use a subscription app for our mobile library access, but there are a lot of good ideas in this system. I was surprised and flattered that the creators of Boopsie clearly thought deeply about how libraries provide service and presented solutions for common problems while providing new amenities allowed by the platform. If we were to start thinking about mobile access and we probably should, we might want to take a page out of Boopsie's book or rather scan it's code and check it out here. 

<b>Our Takeaway</b>
Boopsie could actually work for a lot of libraries. It's a thoughtful, useful system that carefully considers modern library needs and the service potential of mobility.
