<p>One problem with augmented reality (AR) is that what is displayed on the screen cannot be touched in real life. The <a href="
https://mergevr.com/cube">Merge Cube</a> is an attempt to make AR tangible. This item is basically just a foam cube, but when paired with <a href="
https://www.miniverse.io/cube">specially-made apps</a>, it comes to life. While looking at the cube through a screen, users can defuse a bomb, palm a skull, or experience a multitude of other augmented items.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The cost of the cube is fairly cheap, less than $10, and many of the apps made for the platform are free, while others costs a few dollars. For this review, the publishing team at EdLab and I only tested the free apps. While some of the paid apps promised more capabilities (<a href="
https://youtu.be/EvedPF7S3BU">one in particular</a> looked stunning), the free ones still showed off the cubeâ€™s impressive capabilities. </p> There are apps that allow you to hold the entire <a href="
https://www.miniverse.io/experience?e=galactic-explorer-for-merge-cube">Solar System</a> in your hands or explore inside a <a href="
https://www.miniverse.io/experience?e=mr-body-for-merge-cube">tiny human body</a>

<p>There is little to no learning curve to using the Merge Cube, too. Just download the apps, hold the cube in front of the camera, and watch the magic work.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The apps that we tested on the Merge Cube provided quick boosts of excitement, but they did not hold our attention for very long. There is a gimmicky aspect to its functions. Using these tools in an educational setting might not offer much long-term value.</p>  

<p>Another issue with AR technology used in the Merge Cube is that it still relies on screen interaction. For instance, in the <a href="
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uvbPY46n9E">Rubik's Cube</a> game, the Merge Cube becomes a Rubik's Cube to great effect. However, instead of being able to rotate the cube segments by hand, we had to press buttons on the screen. Using the screen somewhat defeated the purpose of actually holding the item.</p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The team agreed that the Merge Cube was a lot of fun (we especially liked the <a href="
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwitktf-bqY">campfire</a> app). Educators should be able to elicit this same kind of excitement in students, but the buzz might wear off quickly. Teachers and parents will have to decide if the initial boosts of fun are worth the costs. </p>

<p>The Merge Cube represents just the beginning of AR technology. Once developers improve upon the functionalities, such as digital manipulation without touching the screen, the usefulness for learning could be limitless. Until then, these will mostly be used as bits of supplemental fun for lessons. </p>
