          <p>
            <p>I enjoyed the publishing seminar today by Brian and Rob, as it was a great refresher on how many players in the academic publishing world are placing their chips on open access systems, processes, and content.</p><p><br /></p><p>Unfortunately the seminar participants at my table, the discussion opportunity lured me onto my soapbox. Sorry! Open access touches on so many big societal issues, so it really gets me wound up.</p><p><br /></p><p>I just wanted to share links to some of the scholars and resources I mentioned at our table. Here they are:</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/" target="_blank">The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy</a> by Mariana Mazzucato. Blurb:</p><blockquote>In this scathing indictment of our current global financial system, The Value of Everything rigorously scrutinizes the way in which economic value has been determined and reveals how the difference between value creation and value extraction has become increasingly blurry. Mariana Mazzucato argues that this blurriness allowed certain actors in the economy to portray themselves as value creators, while in reality they were just moving existing value around or, even worse, destroying it.</blockquote><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://www.anand.ly/winners-take-all" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(183, 0, 22);">Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World</a> by Anand Giridharadas. Blurb:</p><blockquote>An insider’s groundbreaking investigation of how the global elite’s efforts to “change the world” preserve the status quo and obscure their role in causing the problems they later seek to solve.</blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Both of these books elucidate interesting financial, political, and social aspects of our world. For me, the high-level takeaway from the larger economic picture (i.e., rapidly growing inequality), is that we have to prioritize developing policies, systems, and attitudes toward the end of constraining and enhancing American capitalism. And more specifically, we should focus on curtailing the financialization of capital that's been unleashed by four decades of deregulation (in the U.S at least.).</p><p><br /></p><p>Zooming in a bit to the issue at hand, focusing on open access seems akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic—and worthy of the cliche. But it's also possibly wrong-headed in light of the two authors cited here. Giridharadas' critique is well-suited for this: pushing around the cost of vetting and sharing research allows both monopolistic private companies (Elsevier) and the financial elite (foundations) to retain control of processes and products that could be more democratically shared public resources. Perhaps counterintuitively, tackling this issue could get better traction by incentivizing competition in the publishing "market." Or in our case, participating in it.</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm back on my soapbox. Oh well. I just wanted to share these two great voices that I feel speak to very important political and social issues that we face. Mazzucato's book in particular provides a great overview of economic thought, and how we need better thinking around new policies that incentivize some economic actions and activities while deprioritizing others.</p><p><br /></p><p>What to talk shop? Meet me at the coffee machine. :)</p>
