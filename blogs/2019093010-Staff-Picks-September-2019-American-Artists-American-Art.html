Included are profiles of Georgia O’Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, and Grandma Moses (painters), Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Faith Ringgold (multimedia artists), Patience Wright and Alexander Calder (sculptors), and Norman Rockwell and Wanda Gag (illustrators). There are stories about iconic works of American art such as the statue of Abraham Lincoln by Vinnie Ream in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, and the Mount Rushmore National Memorial by Gutzon Borglum. The collection recognizes female and minority artists heretofore not accorded commensurate attention, such as the visionary self-taught folk artist, Minnie Evans, and Bill Traylor, who drew in his 80s from the streets of Montgomery, and </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">is now recognized as one of the most important self-taught American folk artists of the twentieth century</span><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)">. There are stories that bring well-deserved recognition to artists who triumphed over adversity, such as George Mendoza, a blind painter, and Winfred Rembert, one of only a few victims of a lynching ever known to have survived. There’s even a story about the three glittering towers built over thirty years by Simon Rodia, an indomitable resident of the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)">Raised all across the United States, and all of immigrant heritage, most of these artists felt an undeniable urge to express their artistic identities from an early age. Many were encouraged by their families. Whether academy educated or self-taught, most overcame financial hardship. Many were drawn to New York City, either for a time or for life. A few died prematurely. Those who became accomplished artists later in life were surprised by their success.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)">Reading aloud story books and biographies of artists and art to children offers special delights. We are often introduced to the artist as a young child, and invited to see the world through their eyes. We come to understand the environment in which iconic works of American art were created. We identify with the bravery, originality, and persistence the artists demonstrated in pursuing their vision. Their words capture our imagination. The book’s illustrations, while original, are sometimes inspired by the styles of the artists themselves. Some of the books are enhanced by historical photos and art reproductions. Most include an afterword about the artist and their life, some with a timeline.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34)">Consider sharing with your students a personal story of how art education impacted your life, as you enter the picture books and biographies of these American artists and their art. For me, it was spending Saturday afternoons as a child in Manhattan art galleries with my artist father. Later, when I discovered a passion for collage, linoleum cut, and silkscreen in high school, I made my own creations. It all felt within reach, thanks to that childhood introduction to art.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">BOOKS ON EXHIBIT:</strong></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=Action+Jackson&amp;submit=Submit" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204)">Action Jackson</a><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> by Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan; illustrated by Robert Andrew Parker.</span><em style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> A picture book about the creation of painting "Number 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist)" by the groundbreaking twentieth century Abstract Expressionist, Jackson Pollock (1912-1956).
