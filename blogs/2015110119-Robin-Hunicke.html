Robin Hunicke is the co-founder and CEO of the independent San Francisco game studio <a href="http://bit.ly/1HMU1kD">Funomena</a>, where she is working on two titles: <a href="http://bit.ly/1HMUeUK">Luna</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1gC9xtP">Wattam</a>. She is an outspoken evangelist for diversity of thought and participation in game design and game culture. With over 10 years of experience on games like The Sims and Journey, Hunicke also has a background in computer science, and teaches Game Design at UC Santa Cruz.</p> 

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I started my academic career as an artist and aspiring poet and filmmaker, and then found computers and fell in love! I began studying CS and then went on to do graduate work in AI and Robotics, which led me to Games. The work I did as a graduate student was about making computers capable of telling compelling, emotionally involving stories. What I have realized now that I'm ten plus years into a career as a game designer is that games are in fact the best way for machines to tell stories, because they are conversational and interactive. My studies helped me understand that games are about systems, and systems can be designed to respond to user input in interesting ways. If I didn't have a background in CS and AI, I might not have as hopeful or broad of a vision for what games can communicate.</p> 

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
At Funomena, we have been working on a non-profit game called <a href="http://bit.ly/1M5UwfK">Terra</a> with Cynthia Carter-Ching and her research team at UC Davis. This game focuses on having kids learn about activity and fitness by playing a game. Specifically, it uses data from a FitBit to drive the gameâ€”teaching them about exploration, health and development of a landscape on a foreign planet... which reinforces ideas about exploration, health and development in the kids themselves. I believe that games for education can communicate implicitly about concepts, without being so overt as to make them feel "like work". It's my hope that as Terra evolves, we are able to create a game that feels interesting and challenging, while positively shaping the way kids think about their bodies, activity levels, and engagement with the world.</p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
As time passes, more and more people will have access to information and tools that allow them to connect activity in the real world to the virtual or collective world. This is important because it means we have more power for collective action, collective learning, and collective change. Resources like power, water, and clean air will also continue to be an issue. Working collectively to notice our mistakes and their impact on the planet, to change our behavior to enrich it... and thus positively impact humanity is possible now like never before. It's a fantastic time to be building software (and hardware) that connects us as a species.</p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
At Funomena we are working on two games. Our first title is the puzzling fable called Luna. It follows the story of a bird, an owl, and the moon. Set in a tactile, miniature world that you unlock by solving a variety of puzzles, this game was initially inspired by some time I spent folding origami. It deals with themes of personal transformation and has an art style very heavily influenced by artists like Disney's Mary Blair, as well as sculptors like Lee Bontecou, and animators like Yuri Norstein.</p>

</p>Our second title is the silly, exploratory game called Wattam. The idea for the game came from when it's creative director, Keita Takahashi, was playing blocks with his two-year-old son. He wondered what it would be like if all the toys suddenly sprang to life. The game involves stacking, chaining and exploding characters, all meant to bring joy and happiness to the people of Wattam. Writ-large, the story is about bringing people together, building community, making friends and overcoming our differences.</p>

<p>As you can tell, our games are not typical, but they share common values that we believe are important. Both are designed to be played with others, in the same room, explored and discussed by people regardless of age or their prior experience with games.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I would recommend <a href="http://bit.ly/1K7yOFS">John Maeda</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1O6ASid">Paola Antonelli</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/1JhZjFT">Cory Doctorow</a>.</p>
