            I first arrived in Beijing for a flight transfer before returning to Shanghai. Once the plane landed in Beijing, all the passengers were required to stay in the plane, then about ten policemen wearing mask and special glasses entered the plane and came to test everyone's temperatures. I was told that if there was one person suspected of being a swine-flu carrier, all passengers would be quarantined for at least seven days in a hotel near the Beijing Airport. For further investigation purpose, we all submitted our home contact information...

Fortunately enough, everyone on my flight got back home safely, and the next-day, there were news reported that under the same airline company (Air China), there were two cases found from the flight which arrived one day before mine. The atmosphere of the fear brought by swine flu is much more serious than that in New York. I was reminded to stay at home for several days to make sure I am not "dangerous"...

Because of a large number of Buddhist believers in China, the local Buddhist temples, especially the hall of the Buddha of Medicine, is full of people (see the picture below) with great piety praying for health and prevention of disease.

The above picture was taken in <a href="ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingyin_Temple">Linyin Temple</a>, a Buddhist monastery founded in Hangzhou in 328 AD by an Indian monk. I was first taken there (and was lost for a few hours!) by my parents when I was four years old.
