<p>At some point every teacher becomes disgruntled with the textbooks and curriculum they are expected to use, but they often lack the time and energy to create their own resources. Teachers who take the time to build successful lesson plans may not have access to a platform to share or sell them. <a href="http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">Teachers Pay Teachers</a> bridges this gap with an online marketplace where teachers can buy, sell, and share their resources.</p> 

<p>This site (and mobile app for iOS and Android) offers over 530,000 resources, some of which are available for free, for pre-k through higher ed levels in language arts, math, science, arts, and common core subjects. To date it has paid out over $27 million to teachers, with 2,400 teachers having made at least $1,000.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>By incentivizing teachers to share their resources through the option of monetization, creating quality content becomes worth their time as they are able to supplement their income. Creating resources for other teachers encourages the creators to refine their skills, focus on learning objectives and outcomes, and enhance their own teaching. The site not only delivers teacher-tested lessons, but removes pricey corporate textbook publishers from the equation. Teachers who are passionate about providing quality learning materials have the ability to reach more classrooms and expand their impact.</p>

<p>The site’s design allows visitors to browse by featured resources, grade level, subject, prices, and sellers. Lessons are divided into price categories: free, under $5, $5-10, and $10 and up, with authors choosing the tier under which their materials should be sold. Importantly, the terms of service clearly define copyright policy, privacy issues, and stress the importance of submitting appropriate material.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>On any site where users buy and sell from each other, there is always the possibility that transactional discrepancies and disputes will arise. The terms of service indicate that site administrators will not become involved in resolving disputes. Also, because content is user-created, the quality of lessons could vary; responsible teachers should review content and check for accuracy before incorporating lessons into their plans.</p> 

<p>While anyone can sell their lessons on the site, only premium members enjoy higher royalties and waived transaction fees, and receive product placement on the homepage. The annual fee for premium membership is $59.95, which may not fit into some teachers’ budgets.</p>


<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>This site empowers teachers and incentivizes lesson planning outside their usual routines and curriculum. When schools seek to give their teachers more autonomy, this site is an excellent resource for implementing creative and dynamic lessons. When teachers transition to the common core standards, it’s a place to see how other educators are adapting.</p> 

<p>There are similar sites (<a href="http://busyteacher.org/"target="_blank">Busy Teacher</a>, <a href="http://www.theteacherscorner.net/">The Teacher’s Corner</a>, <a href="http://www.prometheanplanet.com/en/">Promethean Planet</a>) that also contribute to the growing online economy of teacher-created lesson plans. Well-designed and structured communities of shared educational resources only provide teachers with more opportunities and strengthen their ability to reach students. </p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Teachers Pay Teachers belongs in any teacher’s bookmarks bar.</p>
