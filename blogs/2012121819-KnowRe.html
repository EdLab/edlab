<a href="http://www.knowre.com/">KnowRe</a> is a unique adaptive math learning technology that hinges on a micro analysis of student learning achievement. The system is currently in private alpha, but promises to be a stylish riff on current systems with an aim at the modern, data-centric classroom. Their endearing, if sparse, blog details the South Korean cum New York City-based company’s development into what could be the next big thing in math education.
</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The micro analysis of KnowRe’s philosophy works by separating information into knowledge units, described as the "smallest form of mathematical knowledge," and organizing these units into knowledge chains. A knowledge chain is made up of interpretive, formulaic, and computation knowledge units around the same concept. Students are independently evaluated for mastery of each unit and chain so instructors can clearly identify tricky concepts and the particular problem-solving steps that derail learning. The site also strives to create a context for learning through social media and real-world application. Combining meaning-infused math content with a mastery-focused and self-paced learning strategy may be a winning combination for reluctant math learners. The interface looks intriguing, heavily gamified, and designed with digital native learners in mind. From the look of the site, KnowRe’s young and hip team seem to be well-versed in contemporary mobile gaming trends. 
</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Still in private alpha, KnowRe’s actual functionality is a big unknown for educators and institutions considering the system. The site at times seems almost needlessly complex, with shifty animated bullet points, scads of cute illustrations, and a layout so intricate that it takes one a while to realize the product isn’t yet available. KnowRe is meant to be used in a classroom, unlike adaptive tutoring tools such as <a href="http://www.virtualnerd.com/">Virtual Nerd</a>, so recruiting teachers and wooing schools will be paramount to the system’s success. 
</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>KnowRe rests on two rapidly developing pillars of modern education: adaptive technologies and data analysis. The combination of self-paced and evolving student modules and the increasing reliance on the data from these digital systems will likely shift teacher-student interactions dramatically. KnowRe’s micro knowledge units are endlessly mapped onto helpful matrices so interested teachers will know exactly which areas are troubling their students and can wisely allocate their limited class time to the haziest concepts. 
</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>KnowRe will apply online learning trends to the math classroom.</p>
