          <p>
            <p>**This post has been updated! Scroll for the Edit. </p><p><strike><br /></strike></p><p><strike>Tomorrow</strike> Today begins a new EdLab era, one filled with straight lines and whitespace. So take a good, long look at the site you’ve claimed as your own for the last 10 years because when the clock strikes 0900 on 3/7/17, it’ll be gone <i>for-ev-er</i>.

One huge change we made is to synchronize your EdLab Account to the EdLab site. Now one username and password rules them all! So if you’ve ever logged into Vialogues, NLT, Rhizr, or, perhaps most notably, RSVP’d on the LT site, that’s the login info you’ll now use on the EdLab site. That also means that we’ve made it easier for <i>anyone</i> with an EdLab Account to write a comment on one of our posts (just comments, non-staff will not be able to write posts). So think about that the next time your fingers are itching to write something. Your audience awaits!</p><p><br /></p><p>❗️Quick request interlude here: We want <i>everyone</i> on staff to login in and observe the comments section below a post. In the editor toolbar, make sure you see a Vialogues icon.<b> If you do not see this icon, please leave a comment on this post saying so.</b> If you don’t see it, we’ll need to fiddle with your permission settings.

We took into account all of the praise (?) and complaints of the [now old] EdLab site uttered throughout the years to come up with this streamlined, content-centered design. We encourage you to comb through every page, click every link, and get comfortable in your new home. If you see something that doesn’t quite make sense, could be better, or seems wonky, let us know in the comments below!</p><p><br /></p><p>❗️Another request interlude: Search something! Anything! Now search something very specific. Can you actually find it? Compare that to the old EdLab search. Would you say it’s improved? (Note: You can only search public assets; results for private articles, comments, or discussions will not be returned.)</p><p><br /></p><p>Finally, we (mostly Sabs and Lingxiao) went through great pains to simultaneously make the site responsive, so whip out that fancy mobile device of yours and do some poking around. If you spot anything you think is out of the ordinary, report it below.</p><p><br /></p><p>We hope you like what you see and feel it represents you and the work you do here. If you do dig it and feel compelled to start doling out kudos and hugs, I have a few people you can start with; namely, Ryan, Sabs, Lingxiao, Zhou, Ziyin, and Iyob. And for their constant guidance, direction, and counsel, fist bumps to Hui Soo and Gary.</p><p><br /></p><p>Here’s to keeping laser-focused on the future while learning from our past. Onward, upward, forward!</p><p><br /></p><p><b>**EDIT:</b> It has come to my attention that some of you are unable to login using what you thought was your EdLab Account. This means that you can't even reply to this post! So, if this includes you, send me an email at jo.agnitti@gmail.com and let me know that you're having trouble. We're going to make a batch correction (instead of one-by-one) <b>so sign in ASAP, find out if you are among those affected, and we'll merge all outstanding identities by Thursday. </b>You'll know you're affected if 1) You are unable to sign in OR 2) You can sign in but you do not see the option to &quot;Write new post&quot; in the dropdown menu under your name. </p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://cdn.tc-library.org/EdLab-blog/20170307203241-screen_shot_2017_03_07_at_3_30_55_pm_png_9fcbc448604610ba44726a6a66f83be5.png" style /><br /></p>
