            The soon to be vacated seat by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice David Souter will give President Obama a chance to make one of his most enduring decisions as president. It is very rare for presidents to fill a vacancy on the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/1487">Supreme Court</a> so early in their administration. During his campaign, Obama stated that “"we need somebody who's got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom…the empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old. And that's the criterion by which I'm going to be selecting my judges."

David Souter was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush to replace the retiring William Brennan. To the disappointments of many in the conservative camp, he turned out to be one of the most liberal judges on the court. He often voted with the liberal bloc on the court (along with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens) on hot button issues such as abortion, affirmative action, and capital punishment. Souter, a lifelong bachelor who doesn't own a cellphone or computer, nearly quit the Court following its controversial decision in <I>Bush v. Gore (2002)</I> (he voted to continue the recount), which ended the Florida recount and declared George W. Bush winner of the presidential election. Souter's dissatisfaction with Washington and a yearning to go back to his New Hampshire home are seen as the primary reasons for his decision to quit the court after just 18 years. It is rumored that Souter waited until after President Obama was elected to seriously consider retiring since a Democratic president will almost certainly select a liberal judge and thus maintain the ideological makeup of the Court. Souter will step down when the Court's term ends in early summer. He will still be able to cast his vote on all the remaining cases, including a highly controversial case <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2380">concerning students' and searches on school grounds.</a> 



The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124139508689381755.html">list of candidates</a> to replace Souter are sure to include some of the most prominent circuit judges in the nation since all the current members of the Supreme Court were circuit judges before they were selected to the Court. However, there is also an ongoing debate in legal circles to select someone with a diverse career background that doesn't necessarily follow the conventional path of the federal courts. The current makeup of the court will also play a vital role in who the president nominates to replace Souter. Currently, there is only one woman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and one African American, Clarence Thomas, on the Court. There has never been a Hispanic or Asian judge on the Court. Sonia Sotomayor, a judge for the 2nd federal circuit right here in New York City and a Bronx native, is one of the leading candidates for Souter's seat. Sotomayor will become the first Hispanic and third woman to sit on the Court if she is selected. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, an African American and a personal friend of the president, is also among the candidates though conventional wisdom suggests the president will almost certainly select a woman. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano, Circuit judges Kim Wardlaw and Diane Wood and Stanford law professor Kathleen Sullivan are also deemed as serious candidates for the Souter's seat. 

President Obama will have few problems in the Senate during confirmation hearings for his nominee. Alern Specter's defection to the Democratic Party last week coupled with a Minnesota's judge almost certain decision in favor of Democrat Al Franken in that state's still undecided Senate election will give the Democrats the 60 member super majority needed to override any Republican filibuster. Who should the President select and why?
