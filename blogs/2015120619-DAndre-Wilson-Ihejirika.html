D’Andre Wilson-Ihejirika is the founder of <a href="http://bit.ly/1ZbVzka">BrainSTEM Alliance</a>, a consulting company that focuses on enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) educational programming for non-profit organizations and educational institutions. Wilson-Ihejirika was born and raised in Nassau, Bahamas and moved to Canada to complete her degree in Chemical Engineering at McGill University. She completed her masters in Financial Engineering at the Centre for Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship at the University of Toronto, before working with Suncor Energy in the Athabasca Oil Sands. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I completed my bachelors in Chemical Engineering and my master’s in Financial Engineering. I then went on to work in Process Engineering and Project Development. This experience has completely shaped the work I do with BrainSTEM Alliance. A big part of the work at BrainSTEM Alliance is utilizing the knowledge and experience of engineers to teach youth about engineering. I constantly use examples and learnings from my work as an engineer in the programming I develop for the organizations I work with. </p> 

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
I am hoping that my work will allow STEM education to be more accessible to youth. By working directly with non-profits, community organizations, and educational institutions that already have direct access to a wide and diverse range of students, the impact of STEM education can be brought to every child. The idea of BrainSTEM Alliance was not to create another non-profit that offers STEM programs, but to help the organizations currently in existence make the most of the STEM opportunities around them—to help organizations collaborate to create the largest positive impact on youth and allow for maximum exposure to opportunities. </p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
I believe project- and problem-based learning will be how we learn in the future. With many successful innovators and entrepreneurs ditching the traditional learning system for more informal learning and learning through experience, institutions will have to follow suit and change the way lessons are taught in the classroom. Project- and problem-based learning are already being adopted by more forward thinking countries. Finland is one such pioneer and has already begun to restructure their national curriculum around this style of learning. </p> 

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
Right now I am based in Northern Alberta in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, so most of my projects are based in this region. One of the main collaborations I have worked on is the Girls Inc. of Northern Alberta—Operation SMART program. Through this program I have facilitated collaborations between Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest integrated energy company, as well as the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta, to recruit and prepare their engineers to be volunteers and mentors for the program. As part of this project, I am also collecting data to track the trends of girls’ perceptions of engineering as well as the impact on the female volunteers and their career advancement and retention in engineering. </p>

<p>A project that I am working on outside of Canada is Bahamas Engineering & Technology Advancement (BETA). I am originally from the Bahamas and I have always wanted to contribute to engineering education in my home country. BETA is comprised of a team of Bahamian engineers and technologists that are working to expose more Bahamian youth to the engineering disciplines. BETA is working closely with the Bahamian Ministry of Education, Science and Technology as well as partnering with the College of the Bahamas to carry out this mission. </p>

<p>As for my next big project, I have a few ideas that I want to pursue. One idea at the top of my list is for BrainSTEM Alliance to create an interactive database of engineering volunteers throughout Canada. This will allow organizations across the country to access professionals that can augment their STEM curriculum and act as mentors for youth. I am also thinking of doing some work on chemical engineering education down the line. Many of the other engineering disciplines have toys or apps that help to introduce kids to the concepts, but there is a lack of these resources focused on chemical engineering. I hope to change that with a few ideas I have for chemical engineering toys and apps. </p>
