          <p>
            Given the structure of our collegiate and athletic institutions currently, it is difficult to see massive change occurring any time soon. However there are some positive trends that will hopefully break the backs of the NCAA in the next twenty years:

1.) The Brandon Jennings effect. Brandon Jennings, now a star player for the Milwaukee Bucks, managed to outfox David Stern, who instituted a rule that players are only eligible for the NBA Draft if they are 19 or have completed their freshman year. Brandon Jennings decided to head to Europe for a year. In the process, he gained valuable experience and was paid for his efforts fairly. It seems obvious that as European leagues come into more money, they will be able to recruit better coaches and actively seek out high school basketball players that know college is not the place for them. Simply put, competition from European basketball leagues can help overcome this barrier.

2.) Corruption. The Fiesta Bowl news recently regarding the use of funds for personal expenses has only brought more negative publicity to the bowl system that serves as the cement to the college football establishment. As more corruption reveals itself, people will begin to question the incentives at play here.

3.) Rich guys. Someone is going to realize that setting up a rival league that competes with college football and basketball can easily become very attractive for athletes coming out of high school. While the risk to such a venture would certainly be incredibly high, the payoff would as well. For instance, even the USFL, which ultimately failed, had significant impact on how the NFL operated.
