            In a case that may have huge ramifications for school boards across the country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) recently filed <a href="http://www.danapointtimes.com/view/full_story/9481387/article-Free-Education--Dana-Hills-Fees-Cited-in-Statewide-Lawsuit?instance=eye_on_dp">a civil suit against several school districts in California</a>. Also named in the suit are the State of California and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The suit claims that public school students in over 40 districts in California were forced to pay for textbooks, workbooks and required readings for their courses. In addition, the suit also claims students were forced to pay for their AP exams, which are considered course requirements.  

According to ACLU Chief Counsel for Southern California Mark Rosenbaum, 

<blockquote>the idea of educating every child at public expense ranks with political democracy as one of the United States' great original social contribution. Each of these ideas rests on a hallowed belief that every child is capable of reaching his or her fullest potential only when we encourage and honor accomplishment based on merit and hard work and disavow class distinctions.
</blockquote>

The suit is not the first of its kind in terms of civil or political groups wanting to level the education playing field. In the fiscal equity case Levittown v.  Nyquist, a New York State appeals court held that every public school student in the state had a right to a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2526">“basic sound education.”</a> In New Jersey, there is still no clear-cut ruling in the never-ending <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3520">Abbott cases</a>, a suit first brought before that state's Supreme Court in 1981. The suit claims the state has failed in its constitutional duty to provide a "thorough and efficient" education for students in poor urban school districts.
