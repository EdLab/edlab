<p><a href="https://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/do_science_now/science_apps_and_activities/i_got_this">I Got This</a> is an interactive first-person character story designed to teach pre-teens about one of the fastest growing diseases in the U.S. and around the world: type 2 diabetes. Created in collaboration with the UCSF Benihoff Children’s Hospital Oakland, I Got This explores the causes and symptoms of the life-changing disease as well as prevention and treatment.</p>

<p>The story follows a day in the life of Emily, an adolescent girl who is unaware that she is suffering from type 2 diabetes. In the early stages of Emily’s story, she experiences common symptoms: extreme sluggishness, hunger pangs, excessive thirst, and nervous jitters. After interventions from friends, family, and school administrators, Emily is formally diagnosed by her family pediatrician. Users learn alongside Emily as she begins to understand how insulin, blood glucose, and eating habits are all connected to the management of diabetes. As the story comes to a close, users witness improvements in Emily’s confidence, ability, and motivation to undertake the self-care necessary to successfully treat diabetes.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The interactive story format allows users to learn about the disease’s causes and symptoms without overwhelming them with information, and following along with a first-person character creates a sense of empathy for others living with type 2 diabetes. Witnessing how social life and self-esteem are negatively impacted helps users to connect with Emily's character and the trials she faces. I Got This also highlights the importance of family awareness, illustrating how family medical history is an indicator of risk for developing the disease.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> The downside of I Got This is its lack of interactive knowledge checks. The ways in which users are directed to advance the story offer little in the way of impactful interaction with the content. Without the inclusion of multiple-choice questions or branching scenarios, I Got This presents limited opportunities for real-time application of learning. Creating pockets for sticky learning to occur throughout the story would increase retention among users.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>There is a market need for educational resources that help to tackle the dangers and symptoms of this illness. I Got This succeeds in creating an experience that engages its users while serving as an informative tool that makes the complexities of type 2 diabetes a little easier for adolescents to understand.</p>
