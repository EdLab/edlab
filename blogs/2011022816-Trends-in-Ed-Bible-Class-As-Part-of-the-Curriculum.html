            Kentucky's state legislature is currently reviewing a bill that will make it legal for students in its public schools <a href="http://www.wlky.com/r/26818810/detail.html">to take Bible classes as part of their education.</a> Republican State Senator Joe Bowen, who proposed the bill, argues, “no doubt about it, the most important book ever written and obviously, it's [Bible] had so much influence on our society and all of western civilization.” Bowen also notes there is nothing currently preventing Kentucky schools from offering Bible classes as part of its curriculum. As expected, the bill has already received its share of criticism from opposition groups, who question the academic purpose of Bible classes.

Should the bill pass in both chambers of the Kentucky Legislature, the state can expect lawsuits that will call into question the constitutionality of the bill since the first amendment prohibits the establishment clause. As it currently stands, there are precedents by the federal courts that outlaw the teaching of text from a purely religious perspective in public schools. The current law regarding prayer and bible reading in school was decided in School District of Abington Township v. Schempp (1963), in which the Supreme Court held that reading the Bible for sectarian purposes and reciting the Lord's Prayer in public schools during normal school hours was unconstitutional. The Court however held that the Bible could be read as literature in an appropriate classes and history of religion or comparative religion could also be taught. 

Kentucky's bill on the heels of the controversy which surrounded <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/education/13texas.html">Texas' much publicized and maligned decision</a> to change the creation story in its public school textbooks, among other changes.
