          <p>
            Upon the hype about Twitter and some takeaways from the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8439">Strata - DataGotham conference</a>, I'm summarizing and sharing my thoughts about this paper I found from <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai12.php">AAAI (Twenty-Sixth Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</a>, titled: <a href="http://affectlab.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dixon_aaai_submission_foodmood.pdf"><b>FoodMood: Measuring global Food Sentiment one Tweet at a Time </b> </a>. 

In the paper, the authors from a Dutch research lab - <a href="http://affectlab.org/">Affect Lab</a>, a non-profit organization aimed at harvesting social media data to better understand people's emotional well-being and behavior shared their findings by using tweets about food coupled with sentiments. The basic argument was people (we) generally don't have the connection between our emotions and the choices we make. In this particular case (food), they wanted to find out the global food consumption patterns and the impact on daily emotions. i.e. can these obesity-contributing foods be categorized and quantified? They developed an interactive visualization to help navigate and make connections of food and emotions for their own reflection and self-awareness. Check out <a href="http://foodmood.in/">FoodMood</a> here.

They trained a million tweets in the food domain with the algorithm developed by Stanford University, which is capable of reaching about 80% accuracy. (The algorithm is a mixture of Naive Bayes, maximum entropy and SVM, please refer to <a href="http://cs.wmich.edu/~tllake/fileshare/TwitterDistantSupervision09.pdf">this paper</a> if you are interested in it. The paper was cited 116 times in 2.5 years). The results included high sentiment for foods contributing to obesity, high sentiment toward meat, gaps between rich and poor (GDP). 

The top global happiest food list: <b>pancakes, eggs and pizza</b>.

Well, it seems well-perceived that…Twitter provides rich data sources to gather people's emotions. And people generally believe that these insights could help explain our behavior. Do Twitter users capture an <i>ok</i> (legitimate) sample of what we want to find out? Or just some random <i>fun</i> facts? In DataGotham, 7/10 presentations talked about Twitter and visualizations. There's even a big statement about "this is <i>real</i> user behavior", A/B testing is kinda manipulative setups?! 

In one of my recent pitches in Research Digest about Twitter's use in education (hope it gets through, so people can read about it in NLT, yay!), only 8% of kids (12-17 years old) and 19% of adults use Twitter. Assuming these numbers are correct, they aren't so high! Why do we get obsessed by using whatever social medium we are using??!!…but looks like, creating the <i>Coolness</i> and the <i>hype</i> is definitely the trend.

There are some other Twitter + emotions studies, such as <a href="http://foodmood.in/">wefeelfine.org</a>,  <a href="http://moodjam.com/">moodjam</a> and more.
