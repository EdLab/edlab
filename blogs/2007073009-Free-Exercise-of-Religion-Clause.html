            The first amendment to the U. S. Constitution is the source of many of the questions that the U. S. Supreme Court decides every year.  The first amendment states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people to peacefully assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” The many clauses of the first amendment, where a majority of our civil liberties can be found, are interpreted differently by the Court. I will look at the free exercise of religion clause and how the Court has examined and ruled on this fundamental right. <p>

In most first amendment cases, the Court usually relies on precedents to formulate a new standard or reaffirm that standard with new provisions to decide the clause in question. One of the first questions in regards to the first amendment the Supreme Court had to decide concentrated on the meaning of religion. In Davis v. Beason (1890), the Court unveiled the meaning of religion in constitutional law and in the process established the theistic standard. The majority decided that “religion” as a term refers to a belief in God that comports with conventional standard of the law, order and morality. Davis relates religion to a belief in God, a belief that some religions do not hold or about which some “religious” individuals are skeptical. The theistic standard was struck down in a series of cases that eventually yielded the sincerity standard. In United States v. Ballard (1944), the justices held that the proper test of a constitutionally protected religious belief is not the truth of its doctrine but the sincerity with which it is held.  In United States v. Seeger (1965), the Court concluded that one did not need to believe in God but rather have a “belief that is sincere and meaningful.” Welsh v. United States (1970) held that even if one's beliefs are not based on traditional religious grounds, one could obtain a religious exemption if morals and ethical behavior are sincerely held-as sincerely held as traditionally defined religious beliefs. The aforementioned cases resulted in the sincerity standard-that a belief will be viewed as religious-and constitutionally protected-if it is a moral and/or ethical belief that is as sincerely held as traditionally-defined religious belief. The truth, validity or logic of the belief is irrelevant and the belief need not to be based on a belief in God.<p>

In Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), the Court adopted the valid secular test-that a law or policy that has the effect of conflicting with a religious practice is constitutional if the law or policy serves a legitimate non-religious governmental purpose and is not directed at any particular religion-that is, if it is a neutral secular law of general applicability. The law or policy must have a valid and secular reason or purpose and be generally applicable to both religious and non-religious activity. In the majority opinion, the Court held that states could regulate the collection of funds, even if for religious purposes, because it had a valid interest in protecting its citizens from false solicitation. Cantwell offered a major policy of the valid secular test: neutrality. If the government has a valid secular reason for its policy, then in the eyes of the justices, religions should not be exempt from its coverage because they are religions; doing so would give religion an elevated position in society. The prevention of fraud, the reasonable regulation of the time and manner of solicitation, and the preservation of “public safety, peace, comfort, or convenience” are some of the reasons that may be encompassed in the application of the valid secular test. <p>

One of the most notorious cases in Supreme Court history, Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940), arose under the free exercise of religion clause. The case occurred when Walter Gobitis', a Jehovah Witness, two young children were expelled from school for refusing to salute the flag in a Pennsylvania public school with a mandatory flag salute. At the period in which the case arose, the flag was saluted with a straight, extended arm, resembling the Nazi-Fascist salute. Since Jehovah Witnesses were heavily prosecuted under Hitler, they objected to the flag salute. Following World War I, flag salute became mandatory in most states as a sign of patriotism. Gobitis brought suit against the school board, arguing the expulsion of his children violated their free exercise of religious rights. Writing the opinion for the Court, Justice Felix Frankfurter stated the “flag is the symbol of our national unity, transcending all internal differences.” Frankfurter essentially claims that the state has a legitimate secular reason for requiring flag salutes: to foster patriotism. Frankfurter believed the Court should not interfere with local policies because that “would in effect make [the Court] the school board for the country.” The effect of the case was disastrous for Jehovah Witnesses. They were stoned, kidnapped, beaten and even castrated by angry mobs that saw them as unpatriotic, especially since the nation was involved in World War II. The standards set forth in Gobitis were overruled three years later in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, in which the Court ruled that the individual has at least a qualified right to be free of government coercion to express views he or she disavows. <p>

I have been reading and studying constitutional law for two years now and one of the most common standards the justices use in most Bill of Rights cases is the compelling interest test-a law or policy that has the effect of burdening the free exercise of religion is unconstitutional, unless the law or policy: furthers or protects a compelling state interest, and furthers or protects that interest in a narrowly tailored manner. The standard for the compelling interest test was set forth in Sherbet v. Verner (1963). Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion, stated “any incidental burden on the free exercise of appellant's religion may be justified by a compelling state interest in the regulation of a subject within the state's constitutional power to regulate.” Under this ruling, the government enacts a law that burdens the free exercise of religion, it must show that it is protecting an important, compelling government interest and in the least restrictive manner. The Court was striking down a law that was neutral in application on the ground that it burdened the free exercise of religion with a less than compelling interest. Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), where the question in hand concerned the Amish practice of stopping education after eighth grade, furthered the compelling interest test. The Court decided in Yoder that “however strong the state's interest in universal compulsory education, it is by no means absolute to the exclusion or subordination of all other interests,” which meant that the state's interest was not sufficiently compelling to outweigh the free exercise claim of the Amish people.
