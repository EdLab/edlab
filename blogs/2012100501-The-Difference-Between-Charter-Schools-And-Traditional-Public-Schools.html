            Charter schools have and continue to play an increasingly central role in the education of many of our nation's students, especially in the inner cities. Since the charter school experiment has gained momentum, the time has come to evaluate charter schools and whether it does indeed offer a better substitute than public schools. A recent study looked at the achievement tests of students at different charter schools across several states and examined the results several ways: a nationwide analysis of charter school impact, a state-by-state analysis of charter school results, and an examination of the performance of charter schools against their local alternatives. A virtual twin was created for charter school students based on their demographics, such as English, special education or subsidized lunch programs. On the first chart you see here on this <a href="http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/MULTIPLE_CHOICE_CREDO.pdf">PDF</a> you see how much of a difference there is between charter schools and traditional public schools (TPS). 

In 2009, over 1.4 million children were enrolled in more than 4,700 charter schools, while some 365,000 names lingered on charter schools' waiting list. On the other end, there are many more students in TPS that need all sorts of educational help. Poor and English language learner students on average do notably worse than their counterparts who remain in the traditional public school system. I feel these are the students that should be paid attention to more on a regular basis.

I have looked at the charts in the study and found it very interesting how the difference between charter schools and traditional public schools is so huge and wide. Here's the <a href="http://credo.stanford.edu/reports/MULTIPLE_CHOICE_CREDO.pdf">the link</a> to the full study and please share your thoughts and ideas on the impact of charter schools and whether it truly offers a better option than public school.
