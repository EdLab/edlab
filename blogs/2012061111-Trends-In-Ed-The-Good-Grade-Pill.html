This is a scene from the sci fi thriller, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219289/">"Limitless"</a> (start at 0:58), but it could also describe a ninth grader's experience in the school parking lot before a big AP exam.

In a recent New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/education/seeking-academic-edge-teenagers-abuse-stimulants.html?ref=education&pagewanted=all">article</a>, middle school and high school students reveal just how far they are willing to go in order to get accepted into their ideal Ivy league schools. They know they can't buy more time, though they desperately want to squeeze in an extra hour of studying in between lacrosse and violin practice. Thus, they find a way to acquire a mental edge instead... through pills, such as Aderall and Vyvanse, intended for children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhd">ADHD</a>). Some students claim they received better grades, but there are multiple negative side effects of prescription stimulants that should deter any extreme ambitions to do well on an exam: depression, mood swings, heart irregularities, and acute exhaustion, to name a few. Substance abuse of this nature also puts young people at risk of later addictions to painkillers and even heroin.

So, the alarming story is painted; the pressure is obviously on, and it is real. This example of substance abuse, like any other example, is a cry for help. Imagine young minds competing in a burgeoning information age (the age of Wikipedia and Google Search), while school systems are still evaluating them in terms of multiple choice questions answered correctly. No wonder it's hard for students to keep up! But if the whole system of identifying top students is unlikely to budge, at the very least, the rise of the "good-grade pill" in education should hopefully direct us into some untapped areas for education technologies that will help students manage their time, resources, overall learning, and perhaps even their overall well-being.
