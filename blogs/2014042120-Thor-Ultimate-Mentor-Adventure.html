<i>MARVEL’S THOR: THE DARK WORLD - ULTIMATE MENTOR ADVENTURE aims to empower girls ages 14 and up in grades 9-12 to embark on a journey that will allow them to explore their potential in the world of <b>STEM:</b> Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Through the collaborative efforts of MARVEL, the National Academy of Sciences, and Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., girls will have a chance to go out into the real world and ask successful women in STEM fields about what they do, how they got where they are… and how others can follow in their footsteps.</i> (From <a href="http://dep.disney.go.com/ultimatementoradventure/learnMore.html">Marvel’s Thor site</a>)

<p><b>Jane Foster, Fosters STEM Learning</b><br>
STEM engagement for young women took a super-hero turn with the <a href="http://marvel.com/">Marvel</a> produced <a href="http://dep.disney.go.com/ultimatementoradventure/learnMore.html">Thor: The Dark World - Ultimate Mentor Adventure</a>.  Focused on young women in grades 9-12, this video contest allowed girls to both celebrate their love of STEM, and through a unique partnership with the <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/">National Academy of Sciences</a> and <a href="http://www.ul.com/usa/eng/pages/">Underwriters Laboratories</a>, find talented mentors working in STEM fields through a <a href="http://dep.disney.go.com/ultimatementoradventure/mentorMap.html">digital mentor map</a>.  This map allowed participants to conduct a state-by-state search of active STEM mentors (with email addresses), who have agreed to be interviewed by these young women regarding their STEM experience and career trajectories.  A list of possible <a href="http://dep.disney.go.com/ultimatementoradventure/pdf/STEM_Careers.pdf">STEM careers</a> and <a href="http://dep.disney.go.com/ultimatementoradventure/pdf/Tips_For_Contacting_Mentors.pdf">interview tips</a> are provided as well.  Girls were then encouraged to create a five-minute (unedited) video describing their "love of science, their experience interviewing their mentor, and what steps they might take to embark on a STEM career."  The <a href=" http://dep.disney.go.com/ultimatementoradventure/videos.php">grand prize winning finalists</a> were flown to LA to attend opening night of this next installment of the Thor movie franchise <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981115/">Thor: The Dark World</a></i>. </p>


<b>Passing the Bechdel Test</b><br>
Beyond helping to solve the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Massive-Excitement-About/135302/">"access" issue that plagues young women’s dwindling representation in the STEM fields</a>, Marvel’s contest and mentorship initiative addred another potential issue, entertainment.  Namely, the fact that most female scientists depicted (if they are depicted at all) in movies are either <b>a)</b> provided as <a href="http://scx.sagepub.com/content/27/1/27.full.pdf">"token female scientists"</a> (as an aside, this is even the case in <a href="http://pus.sagepub.com/content/9/4/347.refs">science journals)</a> <b>b)</b> given lines that are not grounded in "hard" science.  This lack of adequate representation and real-world science skills is refreshingly defeated in the first installment of the Thor franchise, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/">Thor</a>, as the film not only provides a <a href="http://www.comicvine.com/profile/sora_thekey/blog/jane-foster-is-an-astrophysicist-in-thor-movie/62206/">capable female lead astrophysicist, Jane Foster</a>, but also a female lead scientist who passes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test">Bechdel Test</a>. While seemingly insignificant, it is these small steps to represent women in STEM both in the entertainment industry and through a digital network of available mentors that might help to not only influence minds, but also hearts. After all, like a comic book, cool science equipment has been for too long, something young girls borrowed from a big brother.
