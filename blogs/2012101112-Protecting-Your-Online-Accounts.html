            Many of us have various social networking accounts (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.,) and it has grown to form a big part of our lives. Wired's Mat Honan found out the downside of having different social networking accounts when his Twitter, Google and Amazon accounts were compromised and his Apple products (iPad, iPhone and Macbook) were entirely wiped out by unknown persons. The unknown persons apparently liked Mat's Twitter handle and that motivated them to take over his other accounts. 

Though it is hard to pinpoint precisely what Matt did to allow his accounts to be hacked, he most likely used the same password for his Apple and Amazon accounts or shared his login credentials with the wrong person. This <a href="http://www.tested.com/how-to/142106-how-to-protect-yourself-from-amazons-and-apples-gaping-security-holes/">article</a> sheds light on Mat's situation and offers tips on how we can best protect ourselves from such attacks. Though Mat can be partially blamed for his problem, the hackers took advantage of a small but particularly devastating security problem at major companies such as Apple and Amazon:

<blockquote>The malicious party first obtained the name on the account, a likely email address, and Mat's billing address. This information is readily available for most people--for Mat it was all in the WHOIS database, attached to his personal domain registration. Armed with this info, the attackers called Amazon and were allowed to add a new credit card to his account. After the first call, they called Amazon again and said they'd lost access to the account. To change the email address on the account, Amazon just requires your name, billing address, and a credit card number attached to the account. Using the card they just added, the attackers gained access to Mat's Amazon account.</blockquote>

In short, the author has these pointers for everyone to keep safe from the kind of attack Mat experienced:

<ul>
<li>Back up your computers</li>
<li>Use unique passwords for your accounts</li>
<li>Don't use Apple's email</li>
<li>Turn On Two-Factor Authentication for Your Primary Mail Account</li>
<li>Funnel All Your Accounts Through the Two-Factor Authenticated Account</li> 
<li>Disable Find My Mac</li>
<li>Create Secret, Separate Email Addresses For Your Apple and Amazon Accounts</li> 
<li>Don't Use the Same Credit Card for Apple and Amazon</li> 
</ul>

What do you think are some other ways to protect our online accounts?
