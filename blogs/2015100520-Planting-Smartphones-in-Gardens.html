<p>Though the use of personal mobile devices still courts some controversy among educators, smartphones definitely bring some distinct advantages, especially for learning outside of the classroom. Today's mobile phones are essentially all-in-one measuring, navigating, recording, and documenting machines—and highly portable at that. Of course, they also present unique challenges. It can be difficult to create experiential learning activities that take advantage of mobile technology while avoiding its inherent distracting qualities. It's equally challenging to ensure that mobile devices are used as instruments for exploration rather than as replacements for actual experiences. So how can teachers deploy mobile phones in experiential learning contexts in a way that enhances—not supplants—how students engage with their surroundings?</p>
 
<p>Researchers in Israel focused on this problem by introducing smartphones into an educational setting in botanical gardens, where students were asked to develop smartphone-enhanced experiential activities. The students used a program called the "Wandering" platform, which gives the users assignments and information based on their location or on a QR code that they can scan.</p>
 
<p>The researchers evaluated the efficacy of the introduction of smartphones into the garden based on the extent of smartphone use in the workshop, the quality of the students’ activity design, the students’ perception of the workshop, and the students’ willingness to employ the technology in the future. They found that the students thought that the workshop was successful in developing the users’ thinking skills, but not due to the use of the smartphones. In fact, due to issues with cell phone signal, battery life, and operation, the students gave low ratings to the contribution of smartphones to learning in the garden. Furthermore, because the phones were only used to access instructions for the activity and not used to measure observations, access helpful information, or orient users in the garden, the students perceived them to be largely unnecessary in the workshop.</p>
 
<p>The researchers acknowledged that because most of the participants taught preschool, they may have felt that the use of smartphones was not particularly age-appropriate. Many were unconvinced of the need to use smartphones in the botanical gardens for learning purposes, though some noted that smartphones were advantageous in their ability to take photos. Though the findings from this study were not overwhelmingly favorable toward cell phone use for educational purposes in botanical gardens, the study only tested one smartphone feature. Future pilot programs may consider integrating smartphones by utilizing technologies more relevant to learning about and navigating the gardens.</p>
