<p>The digital era has changed academic publishing in many ways. Despite the fact that the format and language of academic articles has remained pretty consistent so far, there have been many changes in the actual business and review processes of scholarly publications. A recent study found four specific aspects of academic publications that have evolved in the digital age: 1) new business models for scientific journals, 2) open-access articles and article metrics, 3) open and experimental peer review processes, and 4) changes in research workflow.</p>
 
<p>Regarding the first aspect, obviously more people are reading articles online than in print journals, but the academic publishing field has not been democratized because of it. In fact, the biggest commercial publishers have only produced more journals, often bundling them together in various packages. Their prices have also increased overall, making it difficult for smaller libraries to keep up. In fact, the authors of this article claim that libraries are now fighting against the digital platforms, such as JSTOR, that they once pioneered.</p>
 
<p>The increasing demand for open-access articles has also changed academic publishing. Even top publications have long-term goals of becoming open-access. But new journals that are open-access are often of lower quality than traditional publications, making them less popular choices for academics. Despite this, article metrics, such as number of views and Google Scholar citations, help scholars weed out good articles from journals with subpar reputations. This gives scholars a better chance of finding quality articles in journals that aren’t highly ranked.</p>
 
<p>The peer review process is also changing due to digital demands. Normally, there’s a substantial time gap between an article’s submission and publication, largely due to how long the blind peer review process takes. With digital publications, that process is increasingly being simplified through different platforms, although some journals are opting for open peer reviews after publication, rather than before. Scholars mostly view this strategy as harmful to article quality.</p>
 
<p>Regarding academic workflow, the digital era has changed how scholars consume research. Digital journals provide scholars with much more efficient research tools, and researchers are reading more academic articles now than ever. But because there is lower quality published content, they tend to rely only on traditional, highly-ranked journals rather than other publications.</p>
 
<p>The landscape of academic publishing is definitely changing, and while this study details the most significant ways the process has already shifted, many scholars foresee even greater changes in the years ahead as digital opportunities continue to expand at ever-increasing rates.</p>
