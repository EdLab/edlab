<em>Changing Minds: in Detail </em>works from a deep understanding of how people think and decide. The book details the full <em>SIFT-3M<span style="font-family: Verdana">™</span></em> model of how the mind works, covering many motivators as well as how we process information and formulate our decisions. At every stage, specific methods are described to utilize understanding in changing minds. With an understanding of how individuals think, the interaction of people in relationships and groups is then described. After a strong foundation, the heart of the book is covered in the <em>Core Pattern for Changing Minds<span style="font-family: Verdana">™</span></em>. After years of study, a new pattern of persuasion has been discovered that underlies all other methods persuasion, from negotiation to sales to business change management. Overall, the book offers both real detail and a very readable format, with many diagrams and tables. Each page is written as an individual bite-sized chunk, making it a very browsable book, yet the whole knits together in a highly cohesive and structured approach to changing minds.

<strong>About the Author:</strong>

From website: "I have a 'head in the clouds, feet on the ground' philosophy, as I like to understand deep theory and also to reconcile this with the messy realities of daily life. I kept grounded in several ways, for example by working closely with HR managers, where the sometimes-alarming events of people's lives had to be handled with reliable care. I also ran the HP support ISO9000 system, where I moved auditing from being a 'show me your procedures' approach to a dialogue around 'what can we do that is really useful?'

After HP, I worked in Agilent Technologies, first leading an international Innovation Team and then managing acquisitions and divestitures for the global Workplace Services organisation. I hadn't worked in this area before, which gave me another excellent challenge. In short, I made it work through clarifying processes and intensive communication. When acquisitions slowed, I worked in some big change programs. It was similar stuff: global teams, innovation, people, costs, benefits and so on....

Quality has been a theme and I have worked in and out and around the topic. It is a strange word and is much misunderstood. My view is that it is about sustained success. In my first job in this domain I discovered that quality is, in fact, easy. It's the people and change bit that's difficult. This 'people thing' offered an even bigger (but still overlapping) challenge than understanding business. And this is where my main learning has been for the past 25 years. I have dug into subjects such as communication, negotiation, selling, leadership, change, creativity and the further reaches of psychology."
