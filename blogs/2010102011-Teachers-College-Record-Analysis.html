            Our findings from an analysis of Teachers College Record's (TCR) 110 years of historical data are in this article. These findings are crude and our research questions are still evolving but these results give us some useful insights on TCR.

<b>Article Count</b>

TCR started in 1900 with 39 articles. Since then, 14,213 articles have been published in TCR. The record number of articles published in a single year was in 1929, where 461 articles were published.

It is worth noting that 98% of the articles published in 1929 were feature articles while the others were Educational YearBook. 

<b> Category of the articles </b>
Out of the different categories of articles published, feature articles have been published the most since 1900 with book reviews coming in second. Editorials have been published an average of 1.35 times per year.

<b> Authors </b>
7,973 authors have contributed to TCR in the last 110 years. 77% of these authors have only contributed one article to TCR with the others contributing more than one article. We also know that  "Departmental Notes" have given the most number of contributions to TCR, followed by Teachers College in the News.

<b> Abstract in the articles </b>
49% of the articles in TCR do not have an abstract associated with them. 3% of feature articles are without an abstract. We are working to see if we can relate this to any particular years/time. 

<b>The top 10 words in the abstract </b> since 1900 have been (in the decreasing order of their ranking):

education, school, teachers, book, students, research, college, social, public, american 

<b>The top 10 words in the title </b> since 1900 have been (in the decreasing order of their ranking):

education, school, college, teachers, american, learning, departmental, social, study, public.

<b>Sample traffic Analysis:</b> 

I analyzed TCR's traffic from Sept 10-Oct 10, 2010 to see what the data looked like. I found the data to be intriguing, and I was able to draw some interesting/useful analysis.
 
Around 57% of the traffic coming to TCR is from general purpose search engines such as Google. 21% of the traffic is coming from the TCR's website. 21% of the traffic is coming from the referring sites.

I looked at the top 100 queries in the Google search engine, which made people visit TCR.

Out of these <b>100 queries: </b>

14 queries were navigational queries with the intent to reach the homepage of TCR. E.g. "teachers college record", "tcrecord" etc
17 queries were on people. E.g. "marcelle haddix"
14 queries were on people along with some topic. E.g. "dewey reflection"
43 queries were on topics- broad, narrow. E.g. "Education and income"
19 other queries that I could not fit into any category. They were either very general or didn't look relevant to TCR. E.g. "financial statement sample" 

<b>Most commonly appearing words in the queries:</b>

Education - appeared in 10 queries
School - appeared in 6 queries
Teaching - appeared in 2 queries

<b>The top queries were found to be: </b>

Assertive discipline : appeared 5 times
parents involvement in schools : appeared 4 times
tcr submission guidelines : appeared 3 times
stanford binet: appeared 2 times
decision making process : appeared 2 times
john dewey reflection : appeared 2 times

After these initial findings on the traffic, we are probably going to expand the data sample and look at the traffic since 1900.
