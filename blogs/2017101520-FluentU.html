<p><a href="http://www.fluentu.com/">FluentU</a> is a language learning service available for phones, tablets, and computers that specializes in learning through videos, such as movie trailers, music videos, or news broadcasts. The Hong Kong-based company initially started as a Chinese learning service, but it has now expanded to Spanish, French, English, German, Italian, Korean, and Russian. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The service features a wide selection of videos and audio, each interfaced with various subtitle, playback, and vocabulary options. There are no rigid lessons beyond choosing a fluency level (beginner to advanced) and you can move to whichever video subject area that you are most interested in learning. I gravitated toward the basketball themed videos. All of the audio is crisp, clear, and natural, an especially important feature for language learning. While watching videos, individual words can be clicked, which stops the video and flashes the definition, and every sentence is segmented to simplify review playback. </p> 

<p> The video library selection choices are quite impressive. While I found the trailers and music videos a bit above my Mandarin level, instead, I actually liked watching FluentU’s premade real world scenario videos. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could follow along with most of the Chinese dialogue because the actors spoke slowly and deliberately, specifically for the learning audience. These videos can all be viewed directly on YouTube for free; but, when watched through FluentU’s interface, the subtitle features are added, your progress is synced, and vocabulary is tracked.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>For $15 per month, you only get the basic package. This only includes watching movies, listening to audio, and tracking vocabulary, but other features are locked. To take quizzes, use and create flashcards, or download video transcripts, you must be a FluentU Plus member, which is $30 per month. The basic plan feels like only half an app and the premium membership is just a bit too expensive. I really think that the quiz, gaming, and flashcard functions are needed to keep the sessions from becoming too monotonous.

<p>In terms of function, I did have some minor playback issues, with some lagging videos. Mostly, though, this was a small and rare problem for me. Currently, the company hosts their videos through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNaFNcATtqmg6T_Ue4bTb0w">YouTube</a>, meaning they are at the whim of Google upgrades that might cause glitches with the interface. They could consider moving towards their own hosted videos as the service continues to grow.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Relative to Mandarin courses offered at colleges or specialized language schools, FluentU is a fairly cheap option. It has fun and innovative features that will help with language acquisition. I was impressed that their videos provided real world situations that I could mostly understand, picking up new vocabulary along the way. Unfortunately, the basic membership only provides partial services without the crucial study tools. In the online language learning space, FluentU’s full $30 a month service is quite expensive, especially given the many free alternatives available.</p>

<p>Subscribing to FluentU is comparable to a getting a gym membership. You might be able to workout for free just by running around the block or doing pushups at home, but if you buy a fancy gym membership, you might be more motivated to <i>actually</i> workout because you paid for it. It’s likewise up to users to decide if they need that extra push when it comes to language learning.</p>
