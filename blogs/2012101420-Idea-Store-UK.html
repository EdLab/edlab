<i>Idea Stores are more than just a library or a place of learning. As well as the traditional library service, they offer a wide range of adult education classes, along with career support, training, meeting areas, cafes and arts and leisure pursuits.</i> (<a href="http://www.ideastore.co.uk/">Idea Store </a>) 
<p>
 
<b>Flipping the Library</b><p>
 
What if your library card got you much more than a fresh stack of books, and instead, gave you entry into a wide range of online and in-person classes, workshops and learning experiences? Enter the <a href="http://www.ideastore.co.uk/">Idea Store</a>. Started in 1999 and located throughout the UK, this revolutionary library concept was developed to resemble more a "cool bookstore" or retail experience that emphasizes customer service, personalization, and relevance to the local population’s daily lives and less a traditional library. Through sophisticated design and technology, the Idea Store blends the edges of library, community center and continuing education space together into something that Julie V. Lovine, the executive editor of The Architect’s Newspaper, describes
as being less, "…curiosity-crushing banality of yesterday's libraries" and instead, more "…tech- savvy, transparent, and welcoming." In addition to traditional books and online resources like <a href="http://www.overdrive.com/">Overdrive</a> and a "24-hour library" of digital resources and e-books, Idea Stores offer continuing- education courses, cafes, in-store legal advice, film festivals, language courses, dance classes, rooms for "hire" and even employment assistance. Another hallmark of the Idea Store concept is its beautifully designed, modern spaces that maximize both flexible usage and emphasize natural light (imagine if Steve Jobs had been in the library design business).  Not only offering unique resources in a high-design setting, this new multi-use model manages to leap beyond the traditional library as a center for independent learning, and instead has created a new library model that provides the resources for patrons to do the work they need to at their own pace and on their own, while also reserving a significant amount of time and space in the library for collaborative learning opportunities.  It is this last point that most closely aligns the "Idea Store" model with that of the now popular <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7052">"flipped classroom"</a> which provides students with asynchronous technologies and resources to free up classroom time for more meaningful learner and educator interaction.
 <p>
<b>Libraries as Learning Spaces</b><p>
 
Libraries have traditionally been points of discovery for citizens dating back to the library of Alexandria. However, what sets initiatives like the Idea Store apart is the concept of "joint-use" spaces that has circulated in library science circles for a number of years. This "combined-use" movement is more than an attempt to move away from being merely a repository for books, and instead symbolizes an increased need for libraries to embrace technology in order to meet people where and how they are already interacting with it. The movement also aims to fulfill "real world" needs and to be as relevant to people’s lives as possible. In terms of design, the emphasis is on flexible spaces, and the library of the future might have elements more commonly found in a welcoming high-end clothing store and less, the staid, inflexible "book boxes" of the past. For example, initiatives like the Lafayette Library and Learning Center in the East Bay area of California and Arizona’s Prescott Valley Public Library are putting this new breed of multi-use space into practice and in the case of Prescott Valley, even going so far as to provide local universities with classroom space.
 <p>
Beyond a physical blending of learning spaces within libraries, there are parallel movements alive and well in today’s schools.   Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, flipped-classrooms, project-based learning, customizable and more "connected" classrooms, and virtual learning spaces are all similarly attempting to meet learners in and through their natural spaces and the technologies used in the "real world" outside school walls. Regardless of your educational philosophy, "mixed-use" libraries are able to provide resources that are often overtaxed or unavailable via traditional schools.  For example, in an interview with an early Library Store patron, a mother of a 3-year-old describes her son’s delayed speech and how it was not in school, but through Idea Store enrichment programs that she saw progress in his development. Perhaps, in the not too distant future libraries will become more store-like and schools will be more library-like with open, remixable resources and courses that students can check-out at their own pace. Regardless, the lines are blurring between library and more traditional learning environments and what results are hybrids that are often better and more impactful than either one could have been on their own.
