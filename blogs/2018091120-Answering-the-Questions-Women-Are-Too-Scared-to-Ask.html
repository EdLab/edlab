<p><a href="https://www.b-wom.com/en/#">B-wom</a> is a Barcelona-based women's health and well-being coaching app that aims to inform, empower, and improve the lives of its users. B-wom specializes in helping women learn about and combat health concerns that many are too embarrassed to ask about, from constipation to orgasming to childbirth recovery. Beyond increasing women's knowledge of their own bodies, B-wom provides personalized care plans, exercises, and health reports.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>B-wom focuses on addressing the most intimate types of concerns women may have, making the app a great resource for those who feel too afraid or ashamed to go searching for answers. Breaking stigmas and silences by providing information on these taboo topics is a respectable mission, and one that gives confidence and power to its users. Women can seek advice and become informed on topics like pregnancy, constipation, urine leaks, and sexual discomfort.</p>

<p>After taking an assessment about your health and habits, your digital coach on B-wom suggests goals for you and provides information, tips, and exercises to help you understand and reach those goals. For example, for the goal of prolapse prevention, the user is told what prolapse is, why it occurs, why it is so common in women, and what dangers it poses. Then, she is armed with exercises to prevent prolapse from happening. This straightforward, streamlined method of informing and preventing seems very effective.</p>

<p>Another way B-wom lets users feel like they have control over their own health is through the note taking feature, which allows you to track your progress and keep tabs on your habits and symptoms.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The greatest downside to B-wom is cost; while the app is marketed on the app store as free, there is very little you can do without paying for a monthly subscription (5,99 €, about $7.06) or an annual subscription (24,99 €, about $29.45). While every woman could benefit from a digital coach, not every woman will be able to afford one.</p>

<p>The B-wom website features a blog that contains a wealth of knowledge, but its existence is not advertised on the app. A direct link from the app to the blog could provide substantially more opportunities for learning about and understanding women’s health.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The femtech company behind B-wom has created a wonderful, radical resource that expands the discussion of women’s health in very important ways. I hope it will become more accessible in the future.</p>
