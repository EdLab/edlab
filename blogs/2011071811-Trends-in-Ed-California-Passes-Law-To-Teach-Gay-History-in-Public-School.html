            California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="
http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2011/07/15/should-children-learn-gay-history-in-public-schools">recently signed into law a bill</a> that requires all public schools in that state to teach about the contributions of gays, lesbians and transgenders to society. It is the first such law of its kind across the country.  As expected, the vote for the bill was split largely along party lines, Brown being a Democrat. The bill was originally proposed in 2006 under then Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger but was swiftly vetoed.  

Many observers note the recent spate of gay teenage suicide as a result of bullying might have rallied public support for the bill, which will teach about figures such as Harvey Milk, the first openly gay public official elected in California.  As expected, the bill has been met with skepticism from segments of the public as they feel it is not the duty of the state's public schools to teach about the contributions of gays and lesbians. Public interest groups have also been up in arms about the law, as they have argued that the bill infringes on the rights of local school districts to determine requirements to be included in their curriculum.
