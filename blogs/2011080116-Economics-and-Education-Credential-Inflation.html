          <p>
            When Fred and I were having our discussion on the merits to higher education as a means for improving economic outcomes, I wish I had come across this term. "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24masters-t.html?_r=1&ref=education">Credential inflation</a>" is precisely the way to diagnose the central problem of discovering higher educations's true value (Hui Soo linked to this in one of his comments). More and more credentials are needed for desirable jobs, and yet are these credentials making our workers more productive? If not, we are simply requiring more and more degrees to the same work, which if anything, will increase income inequality and reduce economic outcomes for many. The NYT article does a great job of identifying the rise in demand for master's degrees over bachelors degrees.

What upsets me in all of this is that the cost of higher education is increasing rapidly while the value received from it is more so as an intermediary to graduate education than as a useful good in and of itself. We are creating a never-ending cycle of signaling with inadequate academic and intellectual gain occurring in the process given the amount of money that pours into these educational institutions. This will only increase social stratification since it separates those who can afford all of the necessary degrees from those who can't. If more credentials are being required by employers for roughly the same output, it will only result in lower welfare and higher inequality.
