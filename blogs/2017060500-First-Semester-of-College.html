          <p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I recently completed my first semester as a college student.  As far back as I can remember, enrolling in college and all its perceived rigors were all I heard from my parents and teachers. Overall, this past semester was a good experience.  I was enrolled in four classes: English, Math, Speech, and a series of workshops collectively known as Freshman Year Experiences (FYE). All the classes were fairly challenging although my English class was perhaps the most challenging. I want to improve my writing and command of English so even though it was challenging, I learned a lot and plan to continue to learn a lot.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the biggest transitions for me was maintaining a schedule and keep track of all your assignments. In high school, my teachers constantly reminded the class about upcoming assignments and exams. In college, I don’t remember a professor reminding us of due dates. It took a period of adjusting.  My professors created an environment in which I was able to engage in discussion and collaboration with my classmates. I have yet to decide on an area of study but slowly leaning towards something in the arts. Stay tuned. </span></p><p>
