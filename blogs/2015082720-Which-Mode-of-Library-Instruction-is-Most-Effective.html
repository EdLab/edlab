<p>Just about all college underclassmen in recent years have experienced university librarians leading class sessions on how to access library resources, particularly online databases. For some sessions, maybe the librarian didn’t physically come to the classroom, but instead prepared a slideshow of screenshots showing how to navigate the library website for students to watch on their own time. Which of these two methods would you wager is the most successful in teaching students about scholarly research? Researchers from various universities sought to answer this question, and gave students at Midwestern University both scenarios in order to determine if face-to-face or online modes are more effective for library instruction. </p>

<p>For this study, MWU undergraduates participated in a one-hour-long instructional session on using library resources to find empirical sources. To test which method was most effective, one half of the class sat through an hour of a librarian’s lesson in person, while the other half participated in a virtual lesson. Both groups were given the same lesson: how to identify peer-reviewed, scholarly research. Although similar studies have been conducted to determine which teaching method is superior, the researchers in this study differentiated themselves by measuring the results in a more reliable way. Rather than relying on an assessment of subject attitudes—i.e., asking students if they <i>feel</i> like they learned more after the instruction sessions—the leaders of this study used behavioral evidence to determine students’ ability to locate and surmise if sources were empirical, which more accurately evaluates the practical application of the lesson. </p>

<p>Research assistants who were unaware of the methods of library instruction given to each student were able to objectively determine if the students found sources that were actually empirical. The experiment showed that about 10% more students who had the online library instruction found empirical sources using the library resources. Although this may immediately point to online library instruction as the more effective method, there are many factors that could have affected this outcome. Would the results change if the face-to-face session was led by a particularly energetic person? Does the fact that the library resources are all online have anything to do with the advantage for students who received instruction in the same mode? </p>

<p>There is more research to be done and no shortage of variables to consider; however, this study produced behavior-centered results showing that online library instruction can be more successful than face-to-face instruction. How librarians can best approach teaching students to find reliable sources cannot be answered with certainty as of yet, but future studies that more firmly control all of the possible variables may bring us an answer. It would be particularly helpful to see if the library task students were given after the instruction did not match the mode of the instruction itself.</p>
