<p>On a global scale, our linguistic, cultural, and ethnic differences can push us away from one another. However, our shared presence on this planet perpetually tethers us together. Geography separates us by dispersing us across the globe while paradoxically connecting us through the same soil. Economic power can raise buildings, but natural disasters can also raze them. </p>
 
<p>Droughts are a recurring global catastrophe—their frequency appears to be increasing while their footprint expands. Local citizens inhabiting drought-stricken terrain struggle to survive regardless of their place on economic strata. In an attempt to address this pressing issue, Brazilian artist Thiago Mundano used cacti and other found objects during his residency in California to create situated art, highlighting the problems that result when economic interests trump the personal. A son of the developing world spreads his message to the developed world, and all should listen to his prophetic voice. </p>
 
<p>Although Mundano’s Brazilian home is literally a hemisphere apart from the U.S., his art transcends these global divisions. Both Brazil and California have equally problematic relationships to drought. It is a curse they both share despite their obvious differences. In at least one cruel way, they inhabit separate lands but suffer from equal degrees of trauma. </p>
 
<p>Are there innovative ways to cope with drought and other environmental problems? How can you empower yourself and your community when you are faced with a seemingly intractable problem? Tell us about a time when you took agency during a difficult time in the ongoing discussion <a href=" https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25123/
">on Vialogues</a>. <p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:26 Nantwi:</b> I have a strong conviction that water will become the "it" issue in climate change in the coming years. Lack of access to water is increasingly becoming a global issue that affects millions of people across the globe.</p>
 
<p><b>@00:32 Nantwi:</b> The economic interests of multi-national corporations has and continues to lead to many environmental issues such as deforestation, loss of habitat, etc., Is there a way to balance economic interest with climate protection?</p>
