<p><b>Title:</b> Feedback and Revising in an Intelligent Tutoring System for Writing Strategies (2013)<br></p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rod Roscoe Erica L. Snow Danielle S. McNamara</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39112-5_27.pdf">The 16th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
Does automated feedback inspire students to revise their writing?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
<a href="http://lsi.asu.edu/project/w-pal-intelligent-tutoring-system-provides-interactive-writing-strategy-training">W-Pal</a> is an intelligent tutoring system for writing that guides students through instruction and game-based practice with automated feedback. The literature shows that without guided instruction, the revisions that students make to their writing often end at superficial edits to grammar and spelling. To become better writers, students must learn to edit for organization, meaning, and structure. The authors found that, when presented with feedback in a controlled environment, most students did not make any revisions and those who did only occasionally made substantive revisions. <a href="http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39112-5_27.pdf">Feedback and Revising in an Intelligent Tutoring System for Writing Strategies</a> sought to investigate student response to automated feedback in two different settings: a traditional writing classroom with an emphasis on intensive practice and an alternative classroom focused on writing instruction with less hands-on practice.</p>

<p>In the W-Pal system, student essays are graded on a 6-point scale from poor to great. The system then presents students with more intensive feedback including writing goals and strategies. The system generates feedback through assessing essays for important features like length, topic relevance, and structure. The authors considered 770 student essays in W-Pal to investigate whether revisions occurred after students received feedback in the system, how these revisions differed between the two types of classrooms studied, and whether student motivation and perception of the W-Pal system influenced revision strategy. Results were coded based on level of revision and surveys were conducted at the beginning of each session.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results showed that when students were given feedback in W-Pal, over 97% of essays were revised in some way. A much smaller percentage of essays showed substantive revisions. Students did not pass up opportunities to revise, but nearly half ignored W-Pal’s suggestions for large-scale changes to length, topic relevance, and structure. This editing strategy led to a slight but significant increase in student essay grades. Interestingly, students in the practice-based traditional classroom were more likely to correctly implement W-Pal’s suggestions without marked increases in writing or revising time. The authors found that students’ perceptions did not seem to affect their response to editing suggestions.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Automatic essay grading has long been an inflammatory issue in writing instruction and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/science/new-test-for-computers-grading-essays-at-college-level.html?pagewanted=all">MOOC courses</a> have reinvigorated the argument. The relationship between computers and writing is still an ill-defined domain and this study uniquely captures student reactions to this uneasy collaboration. Increasing revisions, particularly when the revisions are substantive, seems to improve writing. This study suggests that practice-based instruction can be a useful approach to help students feel more capable in their ability to revise. This is a complex problem that researchers are far from understanding completely, but studies working to model intelligent support and user behaviors have the potential to enhance learning in an increasingly digital writing classroom.</p>
