<b>Description:</b> <a href ="learnzillion.com"> LearnZillion</a> is a website that gives teachers access to a library of math video lessons and allows them to assign these video lessons to their students. Founded by <a href ="http://learnzillion.com/about">Eric Westendorf and Alix Guerrier</a> and started at E.L. Public Charter School in Washington D.C., LearnZillion was created to address the fact that most teachers do not have enough time to teach every individual student the lesson that would be most effective for them.   

After teachers and students register for LearnZillion, teachers have several new and interesting options when assigning video lectures to their students. They can create a playlist of video lessons for either all or some of their students. This gives teachers the option of personalizing a playlist of video lessons to match a student's needs. When a student is assigned a video, they would watch a 4-5 minute lesson, then watch a brief practice lesson, and finally take a short multiple choice quiz. Teachers can track a student's progress and mastery of a specific subject, and if a teacher feels that a student is not completely mastering a subject, then a teacher can assign a personalized playlist that only the individual student would have access to that would help students master a subject.

<b>Pros:</b> LearnZillion has many great features that allows teachers to organize their students by class, tutoring group, or any other set. How teachers can view a students progress is done very well: it's very simple but it gives teachers a good idea of who is doing well and who is struggling with just a quick glance. Simply put time is very valuable for teachers and any feature that saves time is a huge plus and LearnZillion should keep this in mind when adding new features to their site.

<b>Cons:</b> While LearnZillion has a huge library of videos, about 800 I believe, they all fall under the mathematics umbrella. It would be great if they can include other subjects like science or history in their library. If LearnZillion wants to stick to just math video lessons, then they should express the fact that they have a huge library of math videos to their potential users, and keep the math video library growing. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> LearnZillion can be compared to the <a href ="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy site</a>, but while Khan Academy is more geared towards users from any educational background, LearnZillion is without a doubt targeting teachers, students, and parents as potential users. LearnZillion also has great credentials since their video lessons highlights a Common Core standard. It is interesting to see more sites that can be used as resources for the <a href ="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6525">Flipped Classroom model</a>. LearnZillion would fit into the Flipped Classroom model quite well and I wonder if they know about the Flipped Classroom movement when creating the site, or was it all coincidental.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> What I was thinking about throughout the creation of this article was the similarities and differences between LearnZillion and <a href ="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/">EdLab's</a> incredible <a href ="https://vialogues.com/">Vialogues</a>. The major difference between the two is that Vialogues has time-stamp based commenting around the video, which from my own research of video platforms, is a feature that is unique and exclusive to Vialogues. I thought it would be interesting to see how Vialogues can take one of their video lessons and try to use our time-stamp based commenting to keep a student engaged, and determine mastery, so here are two Vialogues, one fraction lesson, and one fraction practice video from LearnZillion:
