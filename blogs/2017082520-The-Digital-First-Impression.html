<p>Whether for a first date or a job interview, we increasingly rely on online profiles to help us prepare for the people we’ll meet. Online profiles can offer extensive information about an individual, but also lack any real-time physical cues to interpret. To better understand how computer mediated communication (CMC) affects our impressions online as opposed to in person, a team of researchers set up two Facebook profiles, one female and one male, to test participants’ initial reactions. The 211 male and female subjects ranged between the ages of 18 and 39, and 96% of them had Facebook accounts. </p>
 
<p>Researchers discovered that most subjects sought to relate to the profiles, viewing those more likeable as more similar to themselves, as well as reciprocally, those more similar to themselves as more likeable; however, gender stereotypes consistently appeared. Intriguingly, <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2012.0305">previous research</a> has found that subjects spend more time on the photos of female targets than descriptive information, such as an "about me" section, and more time on descriptive information for male targets than photos. This suggests gender plays a role in how closely strangers not only read your bio, but also examine your photo. To enforce this point, these researchers also referenced <a href=" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001502?via%3Dihub
"> another study</a> that found subjects preferred no photo at all to an unattractive one. This evidence supports the argument that digital first impressions form quickly with minimal cues and through gendered perceptions, which the study tested by asking subjects for open-ended descriptions, interpersonal attribute ratings, and likeability ratings for the two targets. </p>
 
<p>The anonymity of CMC is associated with creating "deindividuation," or a decrease in self-awareness and awareness of others: for example, how much easier it is to post a mean comment online rather than to insult a person to their face. Yet, CMC also creates in its participants a resultant and compensatory need to distinguish their identities among social and cultural lines, which makes this medium ripe for discrimination and stereotyping. Because CMC occurs without the physical cues of face-to-face interaction, it encourages participants to lean more heavily on pre-existing social stereotypes. </p>
 
<p>This study employed avatars, or illustrated images of targets, due to the fact that many Facebook users alter profile photos. They concluded that we still infer extensive information about a person from their avatar, and in both directed and open-ended questioning, researchers found subjects were more likely to describe men with instrumental traits like "outgoing," and women with expressive ones, such as "creative." Subjects also tended to overestimate positive traits while underestimating negative ones, and those who described the target as attractive in turn described their personality as attractive too, supporting the "halo effect" hypothesis. So, while many people turn to online profiles to extend, promote, or reinvent their identity, digital first impressions prove these outlets still face bias. It will be interesting to watch how this evidence might play out in the education sector, as the use of avatars in remote and distance education increases and CMC becomes more prevalent in learning spaces. </p>
