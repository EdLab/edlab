<p>Joshua Mandelbaum is the executive director of <a href="https://826nyc.org/">826NYC</a>, a writing center that supports students in their creative writing skills and helps teachers inspire their students to write. He formerly served as executive director of Words Without Borders and as advertising director of Poets & Writers Magazine. He was the co-editor and publisher of the now defunct literary magazine Ballyhoo Stories and has published fiction in other now defunct literary magazines.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work as executive director at 826NYC?</b><br>
<p>I was an English major and I've been an active writer since I was in sixth grade. I've had a few small magazine publications, but otherwise have kept my writing to myself. It has been an important personal outlet for me and the skills I've gained have helped me grow professionally. When I graduated from college I knew I wanted to remain active in literature and sort of fell into the nonprofit world where over time I gained experience in management, strategy, and fundraising. 826NYC allows me to combine that passion with a mission I care about. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at 826NYC will change the way students write and tell stories?</b><br>
<p>I hope that our students will have the skills and confidence they need to communicate and tell their stories in a way that moves them forward on whatever path they choose. If they apply those skills to a career in marketing or finance and never write another poem or short story again, that's great. If they keep a journal while pursuing a nursing degree, that's also great. If they want to be a novelist or journalist that's great as well. Writing is both a tool and a form of self expression.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Being in this work, I think the collaborations between public schools and nonprofit education organizations have the opportunity to shape things in a positive direction. When you bring groups into schools that come from a place of supporting and collaborating with educators, then students end up the winner and the school positions themselves as leaders. There are so many groups here in New York City that are having such a positive impact within classrooms for both the educators and students that they work with.</p>

<p>I also think the STEM to STEAM movement, while perhaps poorly named, is a necessary trend. There is no arguing that STEM learning has long-term value for studentsâ€™ futures, but a singular focus on one way of thinking has never served anyone well. We've been conducting programs with STEM and Writing for years and I'm always thrilled by what our students learn and create during those programs. </p> 

<p><b>Apart from your work at 826NYC, what else are you working on?</b><br>
<p>When not at 826NYC, I put most of my efforts toward my 7-year-old.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<p>While I have a Twitter account, I don't spend much time on social media.</p>
