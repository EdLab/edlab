          <p>
            In today's class we did a lot of review over the memos we handed in and, to be honest, I was actually surprised at what I saw on my paper when my professor handed it back to me. Comments and pen marks covered my paper from the heading to the last paragraph. Even though I had checked over my work thoroughly, there were still areas I had to work on, but then again there is always room for improvement on any work. On a positive note, the comments were mostly tips and only one or two grammatical errors were found.

For the remainder of the class, my professor actually taught English. I say “actually” because this was the first English class in which we discussed grammar, sentence rules and structures as opposed to reading boring literature and learning how to write essays (daunting tasks I have been cursed with since the 5th grade).

One particular area of our discussion that captured my attention was an interesting fact about the English language. It does not have a gender neutral word when referring to a noun in the singular form. Because of this, many tend to use “their” or “they're” to indicate gender neutrality instead of writing “he or she”; possibly because the latter seems more awkward and lengthy.

For example:” It is best to give the client what his or her heart desires”.

Many might write the sentence above as “It is best to give the client what their heart desires”, neglecting the fact that “the client” is singular not plural. This version of the sentence is actually incorrect, but I am sure that we have all hit this obstacle at one point and made this mistake. Nevertheless, there is no single gender neutral word in the English language that substitutes for the “his or her” gender uncertainty. It is best to just leave the sentence with “his or her” rather than continue on with this common error.
