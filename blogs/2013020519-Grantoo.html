<p><a href="http://www.grantoo.org/campaigns">Grantoo</a> lets college students earn tuition grants by playing social games. The grants are awarded to the winners of online gaming tournaments sponsored by companies, and students play for a cash reward that can be applied to their tuition bills. Grantoo’s tagline is "Do GooD," and its mission is to inspire charitable giving by students and companies. Student tournament winners are required to donate 10% of their winnings to the charity of their choice, and companies participate for advertising on the site and the visibility of contributing to higher education through such a channel.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The games on the site are original, but based on web gaming archetypes like Scrabble and Texas Hold ‘em. The animation on the site is pleasant, and the games are sufficiently compelling. The experience is executed with panache, but the main draw is the slick business model juxtaposed with an exceptional attention to good works. Grantoo accepted <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/grantoo-raises-1-7-million-for-social-gaming-platform-that-awards-tuition-grants">VC funding</a> to cover operating expenses initially, so students are able to use the platform for free. The funding also enables Grantoo to host tournaments without taking a cut from sponsors; monetary exchange on the site happens only among students, host companies, and charities. Companies donating through Grantoo gain recognition for charitable giving in a way not often seen in higher education. The site has so far partnered with other startups targeting student-age users, like <a href="http://grooveshark.com/">Grooveshark</a> and <a href="http://www.tradepal.com/">Tradepal</a>. In the future, the site is hoping to expand to include student loan repayment.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site is relatively new; as of January 2013 the site had only awarded around $6,000 in grants and $850 in donations. Grantoo’s success is contingent on attracting advertisers and sponsors to fund tournaments. The site also seems to be constantly working to expand the user base, recently allowing parents and admirers to play on students’ behalf and planning to expand the recipient audience to graduates. Since Grantoo has primarily attracted student-centric sponsors so far, these two directives may be at odds.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Being paid to view ads or participate in market research has been a growing trend on social sites, and Grantoo provides a potentially large reach to a fairly uniform audience. Though offering up a desirable and possibly vulnerable young population to marketers, Grantoo works hard to make up the karmic imbalance with a selfless corporate image and focus on giving. The tides of opinion may be changing around opt-in, mutually beneficial marketing, and Grantoo seems to be offering a unique and well-wrought plan for fixing a known issue. Founder Demetri Sillam said in an <a href="http://betakit.com/2012/03/06/grantoo-lets-students-play-to-pay-for-tuition">interview</a> of Grantoo’s purpose, "education costs have doubled in the last 10 years and kids aren’t able to attend college because of that. I think it’s time for the private sector to step in and help solve major issues with our means and at our level." Grantoo seems poised to fulfill this idea with great social network visibility, a mission that way overcompensates for its potential sleaziness, and a population that frankly needs all the financial assistance it can muster. Online games don’t seem like a bad way to bring these diverse interests together.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Grantoo’s games are a win-win.</p>
