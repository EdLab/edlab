<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> On a lot of levels the work that I did both at Teachers College Columbia University in my graduate program and then as a teacher at the <a href="http://www.beaconschool.org/">Beacon School</a> in New York City gave me a window into learning a lot about what I believe education could be. Both of those places were amazing places to grow up professionally and they informed a lot about how I think about what schools can do indeed for kids and adults.
<p>
<b>What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
As a teacher at Beacon, I got there when the first class was seniors. I got to Beacon at a very early stage in its development and got to be part of helping form what that school became. As a teacher, when you work in service of someone else's vision, and I was lucky enough to work in the service of Ruth Lacey and Steve Stoll's vision of what they wanted a school to be, you get the opportunity to dream there for what your vision might be. The work that Steve and Ruth did really gave me the opportunity to dream about what I believe.
<p> 
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> <a href="https://www.scienceleadership.org/">Science Leadership Academy (SLA)</a> was formed in large part to be a research and development school both for Philadelphia and the world beyond. The worked that we've done here has had powerful impact in showing people what a progressive model of modern learning with strong systems and structures can be for students and teachers. I am hopeful the work that we do at SLA can be an example for other folks who are looking to reinvigorate their school models and to make learning spaces that are powerful for kids.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
That’s a great question. I think we are at a moment in time when many of the ideas we've had for a long time around education, around constructivism, around student empowerment, around rich empowering communal experiences in education might be fulfilled. The technology that we have today may allow us to realize many of the best ideas that we've had over the last 100 years and we are finally at a place where the technology is catching up to our best ideas. My hope is that we can marry these incredible tools that we have today with the best ideas of education that we've had for a very long time now to create something really powerful and new that is more enriching, more empowering, and more authentic for the students and teachers that live it.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project? </b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
We are looking forward to starting year nine at SLA. We are also about to launch our second year of our second campus, SLA at Beeber, and we are working on trying to open up a middle school here in Philadelphia as well. We are keeping busy and are hopeful that we can bring more schools in the network. We are trying to figure out what it looks like both to sort of build more schools in this model and also try to help other schools transform their existing schools into something that is more aligned with this model. So we have that combination of school creation and school transformation while also trying to improve and innovate the schools that we have.
