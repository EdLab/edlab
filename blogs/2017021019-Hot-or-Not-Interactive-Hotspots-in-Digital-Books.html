<p>The amount of time young children spend on tablets and smartphones is only increasing, and this includes the time spent reading digital books. Digital reading apps and children’s eBooks are also on the rise, and parents and teachers are more frequently substituting printed books with digital. Although some digital books appear just like traditional books, many are more interactive, such as those that include hotspots, or interactive elements that respond with a visual or auditory reaction when touched.</p>
 
<p>In this study, researchers examined how hotspots in digital books affect young children’s attention and story comprehension levels while reading. They split 78 preschoolers into two groups: the children in one group were each read a digital storybook with active hotspots by an adult, and those in the other were read the same digital storybook but with deactivated hotspots. The researchers tracked the children’s use of touch in each group, as well as their attention and comprehension levels and how frequently they made verbal comments.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that on average, the children in the hotspot group touched the interactive elements 88 times throughout the 19-page book. The children in this group also made significantly more comments, both relevant and irrelevant, than the children in the group without hotspots. Interestingly, the researchers found that those in the hotspot group showed lower levels of attention than those without hotspots, yet the story comprehension levels were the same across both groups.</p>
 
<p>These results demonstrate that the children reading the digital book with hotspots had a slightly different experience than those reading the book without hotspots. They were more physically active throughout and made more comments, yet they also demonstrated less attention to the story overall. Despite this, the story comprehension levels were the same, likely because most children waited until a page had been fully read before tapping the interactive elements. In light of this study, the researchers suggest to digital storybook makers that hotspots should be able to be deactivated so that parents can customize the interactive features of a book to meet their child’s needs.</p>
