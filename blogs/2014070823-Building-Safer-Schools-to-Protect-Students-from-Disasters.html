          <p>
            Building school infrastructure has become one of the difficult tasks for many undeveloped countries due to lack of money. Additionally, their government invests a small portion of their country's GDP in education. As a result, students are often found learning under extreme and uncomfortable conditions. On the contrary, some countries have managed to build classrooms for their schools, but they face another issue. In Mozambique, many students' lives are at risk due to the country's extreme exposure to natural disasters. Natural disasters have caused a disruption of education in Mozambique for many years. Thus, the Ministry of Education <a href="<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/06/12/mozambique-initiative-aims-to-build-safer-schools-protect-children-from-disasters" target = "blank">plans to build stronger classrooms</a> that will withstand disasters and provide safety measures for students.
<p>
In 2012, a Tropical storm called Dando and Cyclone Funso damaged 1,000 classrooms along the eastern coastline. Similarly, in 2013, 250 classrooms were affected by heavy flooding. The World Bank's Africa Disaster Risk Management Group (DRM) will be helping Mozambique build strong classrooms that will protect their students. They have developed effective strategies to help build school safety guidelines for classrooms facilities, which is financially supported by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). Hopefully students in Mozambique hope to learn freely and not feel disturbed by natural disasters.
