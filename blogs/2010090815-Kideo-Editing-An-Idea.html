So this post begins with a short story.  Last summer, I taught digital storytelling to teenagers on the autism spectrum.  During the camp, I attempted to teach Adobe Premiere along with filmmaking tools to these kids.  Unfortunately, their learning was significantly hindered both by the difficulty of the video editing program and the dexterity required to use a mouse.  This got me thinking:  What if we could create a program that is easier to use than anything else on the market?  What if it could be controlled by hand motions and responded to the user's voice?  What if teenagers with special needs or disabilities were able to use a program like this?

This is a unique “what if” that I would like to pitch to you all.  I am really interested in developing a film editing program that can be controlled not by a mouse, but by some other device.  Essentially, a kid friendly, not-hard-to-learn video editing program that is easy to use and could be taught even to children with disabilities and/or special needs.  The program would be more intuitive than current video editing programs and less complex.  Some kids are more visually based ("I want that clip to dissolve with that one") and want to physically move film pieces together (grabbing at the screen and pushing clips together).  This would require us to develop both the interface and the editing program that could be in sync and use gesture recognition technology.  Think of it as a combination of the Wii, the Sony Playstation Eye, and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/kinect">Microsoft Kinect </a>(formerly known as Project Nadal) along with the technology of <a href="http://www.gesturetek.com/">GestureTek </a>.  

Editing a video can be the hardest part of making a movie.  Everything can be going fine until you need to edit, export, and finalize.  This application would help smooth out the process and continue making it fun the whole way through.

Here are the W's for this “Kideo Editing” Kit:
<b>What?  </b>- A kid friendly video platform with corresponding camera / recognition device that can replace a mouse for video editing.

<b>Why? </b> -  Because all kids think movie making is fun!  But some programs are difficult for them to learn.  Even iMovie can prove to be a challenge!  For kids on the autism spectrum, watching interviews and participating in the digital storytelling process can be therapeutic and educational.  Learning some movie making programs can hinder that process. 

<b>Who? </b> -  For kids and teens!  Also, for teachers who want an easy way to let kids edit footage and video for classroom projects.  

<b>Where? </b> - The project would be developed and distributed as a “kit” with the application and the interface together.  

What are your thoughts?  Are you interested?  Do you want to help make this a reality?  Do you know of any programs that might help me make this happen?  Do you know of any additional research?  Let me know!  I figured that the EdLab, where we have programmers, web savvy people, and video producers, this was the perfect place to pitch this idea!
