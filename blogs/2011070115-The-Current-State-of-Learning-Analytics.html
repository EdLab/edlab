          <p>
            I thought it would be especially timely to post on the blog about some of the research I had been doing about learning analytics after Joyce's post about Knewton and because analytics have been such a big part of the conversation around the EdLab in the past few weeks.

In a previous blog post, <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5785">The Six Technologies That Will and Are Changing Education</a>, I mentioned that <a href="http://www.newvisions.org/">New Visions for Public Schools</a> is already implementing some form of learning analytics in over 70 schools. New Visions has been working with <a href="http://datacation.net/">DataCation</a> to create programs such as: 9th grade tracker, college readiness tracker, high school readiness tracker, school snapshot, NCLB tracker, and graduation tracker. Analysis on the data team's end ranges from school wide to the individual student. When they look at a specific student, the analysis is based on all of the standard measures like standardized test grades and credit accumulation. If they find something of note, they will communicate with school officials and offer suggestions for further action. 

I suspect that the last step is because they currently do not have the tools to analyze other factors or to do micro-level data analysis at the individual standard or skill level. I was surprised by the amount of human time they invest in their analysis, especially since platforms like <a href="http://www.socrato.com/">Socrato</a>, which is like a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6024">Knewton</a>- DataCation hybrid, is around. Socrato seems to do everything that DataCation's platforms do, but take it a step further by taking it to the student and skill level. They even measure test taking tendencies and are in the test prep business now too.

On top of the data team from New Visions doing data analysis to monitor student progress and achievement, one of New Visions' partner schools, the East Bronx Academy for the Future, is part of the New York City Innovation Zone which is a part of a one to one computing initiative, which is building a blended learning environment that is supposed to be making micro-level analytics more easily and quickly available. 

Apart from New Visions, the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/community/innovation/izone/default.htm">NYC Innovation Zone</a> is also piloting personalized learning systems via two distinct methods. One program is using three adaptive software programs that tailor language arts and math lessons to students' progress and reports progress to the teacher in real time. 

The other and most notable program is <a href="http://schoolofone.org/">School of One</a>, which combines adaptive lessons with adaptive scheduling. <a href="http://www.wirelessgeneration.com/">Wireless Generation</a>, an educational technology company which works with schools to create new ways of assessing students, teaching curriculum, and analyzing data, is the lead partner with the NYCDOE on the project. With WG's algorithm, students and teachers' schedules are both individualized day-to-day based on students' demonstrated mastery from the day before.  Students' “playlist” of skills is then created for the day and their individual schedules are created to correspond to their best learning environment and resources available. Students can be scheduled into six different kinds of environments: large group instruction (the typical classroom), small group instruction, small group collaboration, virtual instruction, live remote tutoring, or independent practice. The data analysis for School of One goes down to the micro-level on everything from teaching style and tools used, classroom environment, and skill objective. 

While I am most impressed by the school of one's combination of the environmental and academic factors in their analysis, there are other factors that go into students' success that could be measured. Recently, there has been an expansion in the development of tools to analyze the social interaction of students. The tools SNAPP (Social Networks Adapting Pedagogical Practice) and LOCO-Analyst both make visualizations of the network of interactions that happen on learning management systems. SNAPP uncovers who posted and replied to whom, what major discussions were about, and how expansive the discussions were. LOCO-Analyst goes a step further and not only reports the number of initiated threads in a forum, posts read, posts submitted, frequently discussed topics in the forums, and chatroom interactions, it also analyzes the reading behavior of students by reporting the dwell time, revisits, and reading chronology of the material on the learning management system.

I think it will be interesting to watch the development of learning analytics platforms that expand past the required NCLB data and into social interactions and personalization.
