<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inventioneers/id926202053?mt=8">Inventioneers</a> is a game that encourages players to embrace their inner inventor! A series of unfinished inventions await someone to jump in and complete them. There are several objects available for each invention that the user must strategically place within the existing setup. For each invention challenge, the end goal is shown before the screen pans to the rest of the invention, so the user knows exactly what they need to accomplish. Goals include actions like dropping a scuba diver into a bathtub and returning a cat to an elderly womanâ€™s basket. This game gets players to think and to problem solve while they are trying for goals like sending the astronauts into space or dunking a basketball through a hoop.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>There are over 70 inventions to solve, which provides plenty of mental exercise and entertainment. There is also a creation space, where players can develop their own inventions from scratch using stock items and bonus objects unlocked during gameplay. The more users solve on their own, the more they are able to put those experiences into practice by applying what they have learned to creative innovations. Players can share their inventions with others to work together to complete them. Inventioneers has so many fun objects to use that teddy bears, birthday cakes, dynamite, and rocket ships may all appear in a single invention.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The only downside is that you have to purchase the full version of the app for $1.99 in order to advance beyond the first chapter and to save more than four original inventions.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Inventioneers gradually increases in difficulty with each level so that players build up experience and skill with patterns and methods. Plans become larger and more complex, which engages the user in a world of dozens of potential inventions and countless original creations. It is the type of game that keeps users glued to the screen, determined to decipher each problem. The great news is that while players remain enveloped in the world of Inventioneers, they are continuously working, strengthening skills that are applicable to STEM careers.</p>
