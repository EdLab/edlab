<p><i>"Forensic Outreach specialises in the delivery of public engagement focusing on forensic, crime and security science. Relaunched in 2014 as a start-up, it originally existed as an educational organisation founded in 2001. We lead the curation of world-class exhibits in conjunction with institutes of higher learning; as well as digital content."</i> (from the <a href="http://forensicoutreach.com/">Forensic Outreach</a> site)</p>

<p>Why does Sherlock get to do all the detective work? Thanks to <a href="http://forensicoutreach.com/">Forensic Outreach</a> students of all ages can engage in the exciting work of solving mysteries through rigorous scientific analysis. Founded in 2001, Forensic Outreach has embedded its unique interdisciplinary science curriculum in schools, museums, and non-profits across Europe. Its mission is to inspire learning through the study of forensic science, crime scene investigation, and security sciences like cryptography.</p>

<p><b>From Science Class to Startup</b><br>
Forensic Outreach recently rebranded as a startup and has continued its commitment to multi-disciplinary science education, but with a greater emphasis on collaboration with institutions of higher learning, social media, and online learning. The company has strengthened its focus on current science events and news with an expanded blog that covers a variety of science topics.</p>

<p>Forensic Outreach designs its curriculums for students, teachers, and the public. The curriculums for students are tailored to the needs of the school and led by professionals in criminology. Forensic Outreach provides a hands-on and rigorous professional development curriculum for teachers. Their intensive one-day workshop gives teachers the opportunity to earn a certification. For the public, Forensic Outreach offers one-day events and workshops in collaboration with local museums, community centers, and non-profits.</p>

<p><b>Get on the Case</b><br>
The online school of Forensic Outreach, Case Academy, is currently being developed. The faculty of Case Academy is a <a href=" http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/02/17/case-academys-online-csi-course-wants-turn-kids-forensics-experts/">multifaceted action team</a> of science teachers and former FBI agents. Case Academy promises to offer courses in criminal psychology, ballistics, forensic toxicology, forensic pathology, forensic anthropology, and crime scene investigations. Additionally, the academy will feature video lectures, formative assessment quizzes, simulations, games, virtual badges, social networking with other participants, and live streams. </p>
