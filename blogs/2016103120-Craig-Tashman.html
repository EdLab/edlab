<p>Craig Tashman is founder and CEO of LiquidText, a NYC based startup that develop products to help professionals and students find, understand, and share unstructured textual information. Tashman earned his Ph.D. in 2012 from Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing where he explored better ways to support deep, critical reading through flexible document representations. His previous research included interactive visualizations for desktop window management, visualizations for usable security, three-dimensional image creation, and data compression. Tashman also holds B.S. degrees in physics and computer science.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role at LiquidText?</b><br>
<p>My education directly led me to LiquidText. My doctoral work was on exploring the ways that people consume and make sense of textual information. Past research figured out what people need in a reading experience including things like rearranging ideas, making connections, comparison, etc. It seemed like present reading technologies, and even paper itself, lacked these features. We built prototypes as a highly experimental re-envisioning of the reading process and then we started getting really good results! That led us to start the company when I graduated. An essential dimension though was Georgia Tech’s environment that fostered high risk, disruptive experimentation.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at LiquidText will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
 <p>We think of learning in a broad sense; every time a student reads a textbook chapter or a manager reads an email, in many ways it’s the same process. One of our biggest hopes for LiquidText is to help people think in more innovative ways; to help them see patterns and make connections they couldn’t have done otherwise. In that sense, we see learning less as memorization or mere skill acquisition (although both play an important role), but ultimately as being able to see and operate within the bigger story of a body of knowledge.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>One of the interesting patterns that is developing nationally is increasing cultural fragmentation driven by disparities in media consumption, wealth, and norms. I think raw material like social media as a primary mode of cultural awareness, remote learning, continuous education, and automated AI-assisted learning will all play powerful roles. But what those roles are, and whether they’re positive or negative, seems like it will be very dependent on the context of the given cultural fragment in which they are being applied. I think it’s early to say too strongly, but this potential explosion in heterogeneity of learning seems like it could be bad in the long run.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at LiquidText, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I could tell you but then . . . No, LiquidText is kind of taking all my time for now! But we do have some dreams of where we can take it. The essence behind the value proposition of LiquidText is that we leveraged the increased expressiveness of multitouch to create different user interface metaphors; that in turn let us make interactions that would have been tedious become efficient and natural. So if interacting with a screen with 2 or 3 fingers can do all that, it leads one to wonder what we could do with virtual reality. </p>
