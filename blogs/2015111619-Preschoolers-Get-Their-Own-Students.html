<p>Research has shown the positive effects of peer learning and tutoring, but rarely do we seem to talk about preschoolers taking on the "teacher" role. Researchers from Sweden spearheaded this initiative by granting students between ages four and six the opportunity to take on this role with a "teachable agent" (TA)—an animated panda named "Panders." </p>

<p>In this game, the participants were initially tasked with helping baby birds return to the branch from which they had fallen by exercising their number sense skills. Subsequently, in the second round, Panders appears and watches as the students repeat the task. In the third, the children guide Panders to solve the tasks. And finally, they watch Panders solve the tasks accordingly after "learning" from these student-teachers. Students were observed nodding with the TA during the game, and some students talked with him while playing: "Yes you are right Panders!" Despite the fact that teaching the TA was an additional demand, the children did not seem discouraged by this and still wanted to continue playing.</p>
 
<p>Levels of engagement were measured by asking students whether they wanted to play another round after completing the task. The majority asked to play again, though only 9 of the 29 wanted to play once more with Panders. The researchers took note that all nine of these participants were girls, and that the lack of desire of the others to re-engage in play with the TA may have been because the students had to passively watch Panders solve the task in round four, and they may have felt it was "their turn" to play. However, the authors acknowledge that it was still unclear as to why exactly students did not want to play again with the TA.</p>
 
<p>Past research has revealed that "learning by teaching" (LBT) has benefits such as increasing student engagement, improving reasoning, heightening metacognitive thought, and developing conceptual understanding skills. This study shows that these benefits can extend to preschoolers as well, and the authors specifically emphasize the importance of avoiding underestimation of young children, especially when their use of LBT can provide meaningful scaffolding for their academic endeavors.</p>
