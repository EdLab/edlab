<p>Computer languages are constantly developing and are native to none. Coupled with the global tech industry boom, they're creating pathways for thousands of refugees to develop job skills that transcend borders. In Germany, Anne Riechert capitalized on this economic evolution by starting the Redi School of Digital Integration, a school that offers free coding classes to refugees.</p>
 
<p>"The way that our students are being portrayed and other students are being portrayed is very far from the reality, they are very resourceful people," Anne says about her students. She hopes that her school can begin to change negative public perception of the 1.1 million refugees that have entered the country and give them a chance in the German job market that currently has over 40,000 unfilled IT positions. </p>
 
<p>For these few lucky students, a crash course in coding that leads to employment could change their lives. Is there a way this program could be replicated? Are the opportunities in the tech industry overstated? What other barriers to enter the tech industry need to be addressed? Join the discussion on Vialogues. <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30909/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:47 Victoria57251:</b> I think that people underestimate the cultural understanding (emotional intelligence) of a workspace and community that needs to be available in order for IT professionals to truly stand out.</p>

<p><b>@00:17 Nantwi:</b> Germany is not only Europe's largest country by population but it also has its biggest economy. They have a lot of available jobs in the tech field so it makes sense from an economic (and humanitarian) perspective to engage in this endeavor.</p>
