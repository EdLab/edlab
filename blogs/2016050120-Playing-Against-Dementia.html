<p>Chances are, we all know someone living with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. With over <a href=" http://idrp.pbrc.edu/faq.htm">five million adults</a> with this challenging condition in the U.S. alone, it is one of the most common forms of cognitive decline. Many adults living with dementia live in community homes where the promotion of learning isn’t a priority. A recent study shows that not only is lifelong learning important for people with dementia, it can also be achieved in an easy way.</p>
 
<p>Researchers have found that one of the best tools to promote lifelong learning for people struggling with dementia is digital gaming. That’s right—iPads, Wiis, and Nintendo DS’s could all play an important role in healthy aging. This study, which was conducted with community-dwelling adults, found that digital gaming not only promoted learning, but also increased the general well-being of people with dementia. </p>
 
<p>This study is important for several reasons. Not only does it promote a new path to healthy aging, it also breaks certain stereotypes surrounding people with dementia. For one, it shows that people with dementia can learn new skills, including how to use technology and which button combinations to press in a game. It also shows that adults with this condition want to learn new skills. The subjects in the study were always excited for the gaming sessions and left feeling more empowered and alert.</p>
 
<p>Lifelong learning is important for the well being of all adults, and it can be even more so for adults with dementia precisely because they are normally assumed to be incapable of learning new skills. As this study suggests, digital gaming could be one of the most effective tools to help community-dwelling adults cope with cognitive decline. If we want to increase lifelong learning among adults with dementia—which in turn increases well being, social inclusion, and self-fulfillment—then perhaps we should be putting more technology and digital gaming into senior care centers. My vote? Bring on the iPads, Wiis, and Nintendo DS’s. Let’s make sure our loved ones with dementia also benefit from these devices.</p>
