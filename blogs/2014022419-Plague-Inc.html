<p><a href="http://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/">Plague Inc.</a> is a simulation game that lets players act as a pathogen, make strategic decisions to evolve into a highly infectious and lethal epidemic, and ultimately dominate the earth. Players can pick any country in the world to start their game, but have to pay attention to background conditions of the nation to find the best starting point. As the number of people infected by the pathogen increases, players get "DNA points," which allow them to enhance the infectivity, severity, or lethality of their pathogen. The data dashboard provides summaries and graphs of the status of infection and death in the world, which help players to make their next strategic steps.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game mechanics of Plague Inc. are a good representation of the way pathogens spread around the world and evolve into more lethal diseases and epidemics, and how widespread infection can be prevented and controlled. To win the game, players inevitably have to think about the potential influence of climate and economic development in the spread or prevention of an infectious disease. Players have to prioritize their evolving choices of vectors, disease symptoms, and mutation traits in order to infect more efficiently and effectively. Different gameplay scenarios such as global warming or sovereign default (in which the U.S. fails to extend the debt ceiling, and research and healthcare resources are cut significantly) help players understand political and cultural influences that may affect the spread of pathogens.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of play and at certain stages of the game, the pathogen spreads slowly and players have to spend time waiting for points to accrue so their pathogen can evolve and move on. Although it provides many scenarios for players to think and game about the mechanics, it costs $10.99 to unlock all scenarios and new plagues. The narrative of infecting all human beings in the world may appeal to students, but may not be welcomed by some schools even though the game is useful for teaching about infectious disease prevention. </p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b></p>
<p>The designer of Plague Inc. makes efforts to ensure realism in the gameplay, and this game is a great introduction to pathogens, disease transmission, and effective prevention practices. The big challenge for educational game designers is to integrate the game mechanics that represent how the real world operates while also facilitating knowledge attainment through gaming.</p>

<p><b>Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Plague Inc. lets players learn about the transmission, evolution, and prevention of infectious diseases.</p>
