            <a href="http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jrockoff/papers/rockoff_jacob_kane_staiger_september_09.pdf">Rockoff, J.E., Jacob, B.A., Kane, T.J., and Staiger, D.O. (2009. Can You Recognize an Effective Teacher when you see one? Education Finance and Policy, 2011, 6(1): 43-74</a>

When it comes to the big conclusions economics of education has brought us on the primary and secondary level, the results have been valuable, but nevertheless depressing.

The empirical evidence tells us that:

-Efforts to decrease class size are not worth it.

-Post-undergraduate education has no impact on teacher quality.

-Experience beyond a teacher's first three years has no impact on teacher quality.

-Certification is a near meaningless indicator of teacher quality.

As you can see, all of the aforesaid claims are fairly negative and only make statements about what does NOT work. The following paper actually investigates what observable characteristics in teachers actually predict teacher quality and student achievement. Up until recently, there was little investigation into this area beyond the information that schools were legally required to have. However, Rockoff et al have surveyed a sample of newly hired mathematics teachers for non-traditional predictors of effectiveness. While there is no one non-traditional measure that predicts teacher quality, there are a suite of indicators that can help in the recruiting process to yield a more effective teaching workforce.

<b>Some findings</b>:

While certification does not matter, whether a teacher passes a certification exam on his/her first attempt is a valuable indicator of teacher quality. Teach for America certified teachers did statistically better (with p=.15), while teaching fellows did statistically worse (with p=.16). Student test scores improved more, on average, among teachers who majored in math and science than among those who majored in education. Self-reported SAT scores and selectivity of undergraduate institution are positively correlated with teacher quality but are not statistically significant. My hunch tells me if SAT scores were not self-reported, the significance would be greater. Tests of cognitive ability were positively correlated with teacher quality but only with p=.35.

Through all of the findings, here were the factors deemed most significant: "being a TFA corps member, attending a more selective college, SAT math score, SAT verbal score, cognitive ability as measured by the Raven's test, and math knowledge for teaching" as well as "extraversion, conscientiousness, personal
efficacy, general efficacy and the Haberman total score."
