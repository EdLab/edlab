<p>
For over a century, the American higher education system has been evaluating learning and achievement with the "credit-hour." A <a href="http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Cracking_the_Credit_Hour_Sept5_0.pdf">new report </a>from the New America Foundation and Education Sector has made clear just how ill suited this ancient relic is to both the demands and the possibilities of our new era.  A relic, the report points out, that was ultimately born, not out of any in-depth investigation into how to measure or evaluate learning, but as a side effect of the Carnegie Foundation’s professor pension program.
<p>  
For obvious reasons, the practice of measuring learning by time spent in the classroom doesn’t transfer well to the online classroom.  Additionally, many non-traditional students are desperate for more flexible learning options that will fit into their busy work and family schedules.  And how the time is spent in the classroom (or on the class website) often has a much greater influence on learning than how much time is spent there.
 <p>
Many students find it necessary to transfer their earned credits from one university to another, so that, for instance, returning to school after a long break won’t require work to be made up.  Therefore, the more standardized a measure of learning can be, the more convenient it will be, particularly for the marginal student. The Federal Department of Education is uniquely positioned to bring a measure of rationality to this issue.  Unfortunately, as the report points out, its efforts so far have been largely unsuccessful. 
 <p>
Credit hours are used by the Department of Education to determine the amount of financial aid eligibility, and the institutions at which it may be used.  In 2009, in an effort to regularize practices in the new for-profit and online sectors, the Department issued a novel rule for measuring the credit that included both measurable learning outcomes, and 1 hour of direct faculty instruction as well as 2 hours of outside the classroom work, or an equivalent amount of work.  This has ultimately proved too vague to serve as a uniform measure.
 <p>
Because the issues with the credit-hour are large and growing, a better approach would be to implement a more accurate measure of learning that wasn’t reliant on the increasingly meaningless learning hour.  The report recommends that the Department of Education begin to shift the industry to more innovative thinking that moves toward learning standards that better mirror learning, such as direct assessment of learning outcomes.
 <p>
Reform in this direction could provide us with more efficient schools and more knowledgeable students, but unfortunately at this point we still have very little consensus on how to measure learning.  The standardized tests commonly used were developed to measure cognitive ability and predict student outcomes, and it’s a big leap from something like the GRE to a test that would accurately measure what a student should have learned after a certain number of hours spent in, for instance, a history course on Early Modern Europe.  The battles in primary and secondary school over standardized testing and "teaching to the test" indicate both the political and educational dangers.  That said, it shouldn’t be beyond our grasp to develop a more rational system, and the report’s call for experimentation, along with the existing innovations it highlights, is a step in the right direction.
