          <p>
            It's familiar to all of us to see the “Made in China” tag on many of the goods we own today. Although I myself could care less where a product is made, there are shoppers who despise everything made in China due to inferior quality. It wasn't until recently when I began to actually pay close attention to these tags- on my clothes, on my electronics, and even my bed sheets. What started this trend was when I purchased an Abercrombie and Fitch sweater off Ebay a few weeks ago, which turned out to be fake. It did not occur to me to read Ebay's warning ads advising buyers not to purchase certain clothing brands from China since they might be “bootlegged”, or just plain fake, like the counterfeit designer bags sold on street corners. The sweater I received had loose strings, fur that sheds when pulled, it was the wrong shade of color which doesn't match the original at all, and a tag that said in huge bold letters “Made in China.” It's no wonder why the sweater was about half of the original price sold in actual stores!

Angry that I could not return this sweater, I went back to the Ebay website and searched for this sweater again. Out of the hundreds of items that appeared on the screen, I suspect that more than half are fake since the descriptions and price were almost exactly like the one I purchased- and all of them ship from China. It is no secret that many counterfeit items sold are made in China, thus giving these items a horrible reputation. 
Although I am not completely against goods made in China, I do however believe that changes should be made to the quality of these products as well as their authenticity when even a Chinese person starts to become ashamed of goods made in their own country and admires Japanese or European products more.
