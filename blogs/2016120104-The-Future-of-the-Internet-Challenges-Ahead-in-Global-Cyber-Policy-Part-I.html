<p>The following is a synopsis of “The Future of the Internet: Challenges Ahead in Global Cyber Policy” panel held Wednesday, November 30, 2016 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM at the Faculty House Presidential Ballroom</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Panelists:</span></p>
<p>It includes a discussion with:</p>
<p>Laura DeNardis, Professor and Associate Dean, American University (LDN),</p>
<p>Ambassador David Gross, Partner, Wiley Rein (ADG),</p>
<p>Gordon Goldstein, Managing Director, Silver Lake, Adjunct Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations (GG), </p>
<p>Moderated by Merit E. Janow, Dean, School of International and Public Affairs (MEJ)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Panel Focus:</span></p>
<p>The panel is aimed at dealing with the following issues. Who should govern cyberspace and the Internet? Over the past decade, two approaches have emerged: a multi-stakeholder model (MSM) involving a diverse body of State actors that seek consensus through a complex decision-making process, and a cybersovereignty model (CSM) that is built around State sovereignty with less input from the private sector and civil society.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We are at the beginning, not the end, of geopolitical discussions about Internet governance. Our expert panel will explore how the incoming Trump administration should weigh these considerations and address the complex challenge of governing this essential resource, for States and citizens alike.</p>

<p>-discussion of recently published paper:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reference:</span></p>
<p>DeNardis, L., Goldstein, G., &amp; Gross, D. A., (2016, November). <span style="font-style: italic;">The rising geopolitics of internet governance: Cyber sovereignty v. distributed governance</span>.

<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part I: Talk</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Panelists:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[A] Laura DeNardis (LDN):</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">								</span></p>
<p>-the governance of the internet has shifted from: </p>
<p>(a) being interesting to a handful of academics and scholars, to </p>
<p>(b) being at the top of agendas for the G20 countries and is on par with humanitarian concerns, the global economy, terrorism, etc.</p>
<p>-as such, it has been a big shift over the past 10 years with regard to the importance of the internet as a global concern</p>
<p>-technical issues (e.g., protocol, names, numbers, etc.) are high on the agenda on all ends of the political spectrum</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why has there been this shift regarding the internet?</span></p>
<p>-the internet has become a strategic global resource</p>
<p>(e.g., the presence of the internet contributes $4T to the global economy)</p>
<p>-the internet has impacted every sector</p>
<p>-the internet is now considered the 5th domain of warfare (after land, sea, air, and space)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16478792" class="linkified" target="block">http://www.economist.com/node/16478792</a></p>
<p>-technology companies are also now at the top of global rankings of international businesses</p>
<p>-a number of high profile issues involve technology</p>
<p>[e.g., Snowden, Wikileaks, Stuxnet, Russian hacking of the U.S. election, distributed denial of service (DDoS), massive data breaches, etc.]</p>
<p>-as a cumulative result, technology is now in the public consciousness</p>
<p>-from this focus on the internet, there is corresponding greater attention to governance</p>
<p>(e.g., to impact/cope with joblessness, technological change, etc.)</p>
<p>-building on this, the Internet of Things (IoT) will add to these already high stakes</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Internet Governance:</span></p>
<p>-there is an essential conflict between two sides (as noted at the beginning of the panel):</p>
<p>(1) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi-Stakeholder Model (MSM): </span></p>
<p>-this model is universal</p>
<p>-it is an open network</p>
<p>-it is admininstered by a combination of the government and private sector</p>
<p>-as a result, it has led to multi-stakeholder governance</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(2) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cybersovereignty Model (CSM): </span></p>
<p>-this model is top-down in nature</p>
<p>-it works in the name of authority</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>-both (1) MSM and (2) CSM are not just visions</p>
<p>-instead, MSM and CSM involve policy choices with real implications for civil liberties, plus the actual security of the internet itself</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conflicts over Internet Governance: (e.g., behind the scenes)</span></p>
<p>-there are a number of issues dealing with the governance of the internet:</p>
<p>(1) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Interconnection of Regulations and Strategy:</span></p>
<p>-this occurs at places like the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the UN</p>
<p>(2) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Localization: </span></p>
<p>-there is a drive/desire to provide privacy in the wake of government surveillance</p>
<p>(3) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cyber Order: </span></p>
<p>-these are policies in countries like Iran, Cuba, North Korea, etc.</p>
<p>-this type of order is policed through Domain Name Registries, etc.</p>
<p>-there is a stronger level of multilateral control</p>
<p>(4) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Intelligence and National Security: </span></p>
<p>-the internet has implication for different types of security</p>
<p>-(e.g., financial security through compromising companies and individuals)</p>
<p>-(e.g., national security)</p>
<p>-(e.g., there are efforts to weaken encryption) </p>
<p>-ultimately there is a balance between privacy v. law and order</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shifting Narratives:</span></p>
<p>-as a result of all of the issues discussed above, there is a changing narrative from (1) MSM to (2) CSM</p>
<p>-all of these changes are not just theoretical discussions; they deal with: </p>
<p>-the stability of the internet</p>
<p>-the protection of human rights</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Differences Over Time:</span></p>
<p>- if the issues/interventions that are occurring today happened two decades ago, would we have the same internet as we have today? (e.g., during the infancy of the internet)</p>
<p>-the internet transcend borders, the internet also transcend national laws</p>
<p>-technologists can often compromise cybersecurity </p>
<p>(e.g., through encryption)</p>
<p>-even more problematic are the implications for civil liberties </p>
<p>(e.g., censorship, repress LGBTQ speech in Russia)</p>
<p>-how will the internet proceed/develop in the future?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fragmentation:</span></p>
<p>-should the internet be:</p>
<p>(1) universal or</p>
<p>(2) bordered?</p>
<p>-the internet is not universal today, it still have a lot of divides </p>
<p>(e.g., through filtering, access, technology)</p>
<p>-however, in jurisdictions like the U.S., it has enabled permissionless access</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., people can post content to WordPress whenever they want)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[B] Gordon Goldstein (GG)</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span style="font-weight: bold;">	</span>								</span></p>
<p>-CU/SIPA has built one of the leading thought centers in the world regarding technology, internet governance, cybersecurity, etc.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Role of Perspective:</span></p>
<p>-there is an old maxim in political science, “where you stand depends on where you sit”</p>
<p>-I come from 3 different perspectives:</p>
<p>(1) earned a Ph.D. at Columbia; this involved deep reading in neoliberalism, etc.,</p>
<p>(2) my work at Silver Lake, and </p>
<p>(3) being an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (GG), </p>
<p>-these internet/internet governance issues capture/intersect with these three competing perspectives</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Unique Characteristics/Development of the Internet:</span></p>
<p>(1) there has been an advance in the internet unlike any other strategic resource:</p>
<p>(a) the internet propels political movements (e.g., Arab Spring),</p>
<p>(b) incidences of hacking/cybersecurity threats have possibly intervened in the recent U.S. election, and</p>
<p>(c) the internet has become an engine of global competition</p>
<p>(e.g., the 5 largest companies in the world are all American: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Changing Face of Cybersecurity:</span></p>
<p>-there have been newer, and more spectacular, cybersecurity breaches</p>
<p>-internet-based breaches have become a driver of the underground economy</p>
<p>(e.g., by 2019, the projected gross aggregate value of illegal and malicious activity on the internet will surpass $2.1 T)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Changing Face of Geopolitics:</span></p>
<p>-as a result of all of these developments, the internet has become a game board for geopolitical competition and it is accelerating</p>
<p>-to exemplify these changes, think of the following four examples:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-Example #1: 2003: </span></p>
<p>-there was a UN-based multilateral setting</p>
<p>-at the time, the U.S. was managing the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-ICANN was renewed on a 2-year basis.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-Russia and China introduced resolution regarding ICANN</p>
<p>-there was a push to make ICANN, previously under the control of the US, under control of the UN </p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-this effort continued over the years</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>-as above, there were two competing visions of internet governance:</p>
<p>(1) multi-stakeholder model (MSM), and</p>
<p>(2) cybersovereignty model (CSM).</p>
<p>-CSM is state-driven and asserts state-sovereignty</p>
<p>-CSM has become ascendant in recent years</p>
<p>-there is a grand strategy for:</p>
<p>(1) MSM to use International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to challenge </p>
<p>(2) CSM</p>
<p>-GG and ADG worked together regarding original rules to govern the internet that were composed back in 1988</p>
<p>-the core issue regarding the internet:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-the US and its allies versus the others; from this, the internet was subject to some UN oversight/authority</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-for the US, this issue is a red line; there was no deferment to the US system and the line held until penultimate night of the conference</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-identified ITU in international internet governance and future of the development (e.g., occurred at1:30 am on a Thursday night)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-red line crossed, US decided not to support the treaty:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">			</span>-the US tried to rally its allies</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">			</span>-over a short period, the was US joined by 54 countries that wouldn’t accede</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">			</span>-but 89 countries did accede:</p>
<p>-as a result, the world was in two competing blocks (1) MSM v. (2) CSM</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-Example #2: 2010:</span></p>
<p>-this previously described development has continued since 2010</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-China’s position was supported by the G77</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-their manifesto? internet governance is subject to the sovereign right of states</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-Example #3: Early 2016:</span></p>
<p>-in 2016, the presidents of Russia, China, India have supported state sovereignty</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-they wanted to take technology to create a different internet governance structure around it</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-Example #4: Late 2016:</span></p>
<p>-during late 2016, the World Telecom’s conference in Tunisia</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-first to address futuristic tech (e.g., Internet 2.0: “Digital Object Architecture”)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-this was an attempt to organize the system of object identifiers</p>
<p>-as many as 200B devices and people will be connected</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-this effort was created by engineers for a non-profit Swiss foundation and ITU</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-when will the new navigational technology of Internet 2.0 be employed?</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-the entire industrial technology should be connected, including the capacity for surveillance, cybersecurity conflict, etc.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[C] Ambassador David Gross (ADG)</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span style="font-weight: bold;">	</span>						</span></p>
<p>-great expert on major telecommunications</p>
<p>-has a history with CU (e.g., attended Columba Law School</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Focus:</span></p>
<p>-asked to talk about the future</p>
<p>-if it isn’t obvious, nothing is bigger than this stuff in the world today…</p>
<p>-everything of importance involved in social and cultural aspects of the internet today</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-even though not everyone connected (e.g., 3.5B connected, active users)</p>
<p>-the internet is extraordinary due to its breadth and importance geopolitically</p>
<p>-great geopolitical game: now just an early precursor to what we are talking about today</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-geopolitics is not regional anymore</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-it impacts every government, and everybody, in the world</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-different issues and perspectives everywhere</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Future:</span></p>
<p>-harder than normal to predict</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Core Principles:</span></p>
<p>(1)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> values reflect those involved in it…</span></p>
<p>-this is the part of the problem of internet…</p>
<p>-its reflect very important US values:</p>
<p>-free speech</p>
<p>-connectivity</p>
<p>-entrepreneurial spirit</p>
<p>(2) <span style="font-weight: bold;">American internet-based success causes envy in the world</span></p>
<p>(e.g., China players play differently, few from Europe, SA, Africa, or Asia)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-has repercussions around the world</p>
<p>(3) <span style="font-weight: bold;">one thing easy to predict what will happen: controversy</span></p>
<p>-already have had some controversy…</p>
<p>-have not seen the level of controversy we are going to have, especially as the internet will become increasingly important</p>
<p>-there have been some quaint issues (e.g., U.S. control of ICANN)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-it doesn’t go to the core of the internet’s issues (e.g., social, political, economic)</p>
<p>(4) <span style="font-weight: bold;">will see governments expressing views of leadership to find their comparative advantage</span></p>
<p>(e.g., can be offensive or defensive: these divisions will always exist)</p>
<p>(e.g., N. Korea feels danger and is defensive)</p>
<p>-therefore, due to the internet, the chance of conflict increases</p>
<p>(5) <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a fundamental error for futurists: they often believe that the future will look like the past</span></p>
<p>-all we know is that future will be different than the past</p>
<p>(e.g., rules, beneficiaries, survivors will inevitably change)</p>
<p>(6) <span style="font-weight: bold;">need to be flexible (e.g., with respect to the rules governing us)</span></p>
<p>-new technologies? new drivers of technology?</p>
<p>(7) <span style="font-weight: bold;">most interesting discussions will be in the technical community</span></p>
<p>-new internet architecture</p>
<p>-new technology that will supplant DNS? what will replace the internet of today?</p>
<p>-these possible changes are what makes this so exciting and so difficult</p>
<p>(8) <span style="font-weight: bold;">those institutions trying to lock down the internet and technology will, in the long term, be the losers</span></p>
<p>(9) <span style="font-weight: bold;">hope U.S. and other societies will be flexible and innovative</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Dawn of 5G:</span></p>
<p>(e.g., development of new technology: met President of Bell Labs</p>
<p>-talking about 5G: 5th generation of wireless technology</p>
<p>-5G should be fundamentally different</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-4G: good for cat videos</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-5G: rolled out in S. Korea and Japan:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-5G has two exciting characteristics:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>(1) low latency</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>(2) high bandwidth</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-therefore can do things differently with 5G</p>
<p>(e.g., how we produce)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-not as much impact today in productivity with 4G than with 5G in the future</p>
<p>-winners? Those countries/institutions that build and operate 5G systems</p>
<p>-losers? Those countries/institutions that don’t have flexibility or economic power</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-therefore digital divide will become very substantial</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:</span></p>
<p>-the future is… uncertain</p>
<p>-the future will go to those who are flexible, responsive, and willing to change…</p>
