            Classrooms across the country has been hit with digital learning these past few years. According to the federal education research arm, public schools are looking at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/30/digital-learning-triples-department-of-education_n_1121269.html">distance education courses</a> which will be taught through some sort of technology. In the school year of 2010-2011, 55% of school districts were enrolled in distance learning courses with 96% of these courses directed towards high schoolers. These courses are used in different spectrums and allows for good students to take college classes and also allows for struggling students to catch up with credits.
 
A national survey show that distance learning have had many positives from school districts due to lax regulation on digital learning. Moreover the revenue given to public schools is the major factor why they are in support of distance learning instead of the traditional method. These courses are proven to be popular in poor zones and has been an alternative to school budget cuts due to the recession. Our nation's schools system shows a trend where the traditional way of learning is favorable in richer districts while learning through technology is for those districts finding it difficult to provide learning in the traditional way
