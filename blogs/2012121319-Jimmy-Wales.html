<i>Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.</i> (<a href="http://jimmywales.com/">Jimmy Wales</a>)
<p>
<b>From Finance to Facts</b>
<p>
Originally trained to trade on Wall Street, Jimmy Wales is now trading knowledge.  As the co-founder of Wikipedia and head of the nonprofit organization, <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">The Wikimedia Foundation</a>, Wales has been instrumental in the move towards open online accessibility.  Wales is also a Fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School and was voted one of <i>Time Magazine’s</i> "100 Most Influential People."  Wales began his own educational journey into the world of "open-editing" inauspiciously enough, with a bachelor’s degree in finance from Auburn University.  Wales then went on to receive a Master’s Degree, also in finance, from The University of Alabama and later completed additional post-graduate courses at Indiana University.   Wales was eventually awarded the Ph.D. he set-out to attain as an honorary degree later in his career.  Also, while completing his post-graduate work Wales taught at the university level, and perhaps it was this unique experience that planted the "seed" that would later grow-into <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">"Wikiversity"</a> and other wiki resources for education.  Wikiversity is dedicated to providing learners at all levels with, "learning resources, learning projects, and research..."  This initiative is a great example of the "web 2.0" movement towards transparent, free resources that Wales, Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation are helping to encourage.
</p>

<b>World-Wide Web of Learning</b>
<p>
Despite the fact that there are far more articles (over 4,000) on the popular British television series Dr. Who, than on that "other" Brit, Shakespeare, Wikipedia has become a valuable educational resource.  And one of the foundation’s newest projects, the <a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Education_Program">Wikipedia Education Program</a>, hopes to make it even more so.  Piloted in the US in 2010, the Education Program has grown to include chapters in Canada, Brazil and earlier this year, Egypt.  What sets the program apart and furthers Wales’ overall commitment to keeping information free, transparent and open is an emphasis on providing the right resources (both online and in-person) to help educators to use Wikipedia in their classroom.  Sometimes viewed as the bain of education’s existence by luddites, a select group of librarians and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/06/why-google-will-never-beat-old-fashioned-design-research/240566/">this professor</a>, The Wikipdedia Education Program has set out to change the perception that Wikipedia is only used for cheating or research-related shortcuts.  Instead, Wales sees this initiative as furthering his goal for Wikipedia to provide "free access to the sum of all human knowledge." The program includes a team of online and in-person <a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Ambassador_Program">"ambassadors"</a> who are specially trained by the foundation to help professors to create and execute lessons that include the creation and editing of Wikipedia entries.  To date, the program has added over "20,000 printed pages of quality content to more than 6,000 Wikipedia articles in multiple languages."  Shakespeare would be proud and Wales is on his way to creating what every educator only dreams of, a collaborative learning environment that spans the globe.
