            The <a title="January issue" href="http://jar.sagepub.com/content/vol25/issue1/">January issue</a> of the <em>Journal of Adolescent Research</em> has two interesting articles related to social media, including one that focuses on how normative developmental processes shape 124 individuals' blogging practices on LiveJournal, DeadJournal, Xanga, Open Diary, MySpace, and Friendster, during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Interestingly, the findings indicate that most young persons (15-19) write emotionally toned entries; focus on their daily activities, friends, and romantic relationships; and describe themselves, but less frequently their experiences, positively. Here is<a title="Here's the abstract" href="http://jar.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/25/1/124" target="_blank"> the abstract</a>.

In another study named “Coming of Age Online: The Developmental Underpinnings of Girls' Blogs,” Katie Davis, a doctoral student at Harvard Graduate School of Education, interviewed 20 young women (17-21) who have a blogging history of at least three years on LiveJournal, one of the oldest blogging sites (established in 1999) in the U.S. The study is part of the <a title="GoodPlay Project" href="http://www.goodworkproject.org/research/digital.htm">GoodPlay Project</a>, a research unit of Harvard Project Zero,  which investigates the ethical dimensions of young people's activities using new digital media.

The abstract is <a title="available here" href="http://jar.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/25/1/145">available here</a>.

In the context of other studies of youths' online activities, Davis found that the changes in the content and style of the blogs reflect the long-understood changes in social and cognitive development in youth. Away from the conventional approach of looking at how youths' online activities influence their offline world, she worked with a fresh assumption that youths' offline development can play a big role in determining how they will "play" in their online world – and how both worlds eventually complement each other:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When they first started blogging, the girls were unsure what to write and looked to their friends' blogs for guidance. Over time, they became more self-assured and developed their own style of writing. Although they no longer rely on their friends for guidance, friends continue to function as a primary motivation for blogging. By considering this evolution in light of developmental theory, I found that the girls' changing blogging practices parallel normative milestones in adolescents' and emerging adults' developing sense of self and peer relationships.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The embarrassment that the girls expressed over their earlier writings stood in contrast to the sense of stability and confidence they displayed when describing their current writings. Such self-assuredness is common among emerging adults, whose well-being tends to increase as their anxiety over peer acceptance and self-definition decreases (Arnett, 2004; Roberts et al., 2001).</p>
