<p>Many of the privileges and comforts we enjoy as a result of today’s technological advances have been made possible by the work of countless innovators. The seeds of their innovative spirit might have been planted at an early age by an interest in computers. Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg credit their innovations to an interest in writing code and computers as far back as elementary school. According to these innovators, writing code is an easy concept and fun activity that everyone should try.</p>

<p>The importance of teaching code and encouraging students to engage in STEM classes at an early age potentially can bear fruit for all of us. The aforementioned innovators, through their interest in code, were able to highlight a problem or need and build a tool that attempted to resolve that need. This falls in line with the growing belief among many that fostering early interest in STEM areas such as writing code will encourage students to find innovative and interesting ways to address many of the world’s problems. However, writing code should not be restricted only to students. Everyone, regardless of age or ability level, has the potential to be a coder and can help address the challenges facing our interconnected world. </p>

<p>Can you write code? Is writing code a prerequisite to being an innovator today? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18853">Join the conversation on Vialogues.</a></p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>00:56 Nantwi:</b> It seems some of the tech experts had an interest in computer science at an early age. Was this a result of a natural interest or school/parental push? </p>

<p><b>01:00 frankshrek:</b> One of the challenges some people might face in writing code is access to computers. </p>

<p><b>01:54 bizapp:</b> Simple mathematics, that’s all it takes. </p>
