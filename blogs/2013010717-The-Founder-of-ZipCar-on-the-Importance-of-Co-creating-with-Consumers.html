            Regardless of what you think of market research... keeping your ear to the ground and asking consumers of your product/app/project what they think, want and need has some value.  Here is the founder of ZipCar's take from <a href="http://www.inc.com/jeremy-quittner/zipcar-robin-chase.html">this Inc.com article</a> focused on the importance of sharing the collaborative process: 

<blockquote>
I think that all companies today can and should be really recognizing the fact that we are in an innovative, co-creating new economy with what was formerly known as "the consumer." That relationship has transformed and I think everybody needs to figure this out. You are looking at 30 different sources of information and jumping between these and commenting and tweeting and interacting and this is the way we want to interact with all sorts of services in our lives, we are part of that creation. No matter what we are consuming, we feel the need to be co-creators.
</blockquote>

<b>Questions to consider:</b>
When might consumers/users lead you astray or limit your product vision?  Perhaps most importantly... WHEN do you seek their thoughts?  Before, during or after launch/re-launch?
