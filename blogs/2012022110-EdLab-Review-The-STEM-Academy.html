<a href="http://www.stem101.org/index.asp">The STEM Academy</a> is a national non-profit organization devoted to improving STEM literacy for all students. Adopting innovative pedagogy and rigorous curriculum, the STEM Academy is geared towards closing achievement gaps, decreasing dropout rates, and increasing high school graduation rates with a particular focus on low-income, underprivileged minority groups.

<b>Pros:</b>
One of the unique features of STEM Academy is its small, gender-based class. The principal of Murray County Schools said that research shows that such classes with access to technology are helpful to boost student performance and academic achievement. And Murray County Schools, as was featured in this <a href="http://daltondailycitizen.com/local/x1457645541/Murray-starts-specialized-career-school">article</a>, are sending the students who don't reach the standard of assessment tests to STEM Academy for more targeted instruction. Students like the creative teaching methods as well as the single-sex learning environment. In addition, the academy is a textbook example of incorporating technology that students will use in daily life into classrooms, so as to more effectively prepare students for either the job market or higher education after finishing high school.

<b>Cons:</b>
Though there are numerous testimonials giving out more positive responses than negative in terms of learning in STEM Academy, there still lacks a convincing evaluation of the outcome of the academy's programs.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Focusing on improving STEM literacy for all students and incorporating technology into classrooms, the STEM Academy is pretty much aligned with our mSchool agenda. Maybe we can think about developing a series of mSchool courses for students who need targeted instruction on STEM subjects, and providing training for teachers to use technology for better class management.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
I think the STEM Academy can be an example to refer to when we think about mSchool curriculum.
