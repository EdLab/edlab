<p><b>Title:</b> Delivering on the e-Learning Promise: A Case for a Learning Environment that Enables Collaborative Online Problem Solving (2007)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sylvia Lauretta Edwards, Jason Watson, Ann Farrell, & Robyn Nash</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ903901">Journal of Learning Design</a></p>

<p><b>Research Questions:</b> How can we shift online education from learning content to learning experiences? More specifically, how can an inquiry-driven learning environment support a collaborative online problem-solving environment?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> The researchers sought to develop a program that teaches students indispensible skills for post-college success in the work force such as problem-solving, creative thinking and collaboration. They designed the system so that teachers are the experts. The researchers’ system, a collaborative online problem-solving environment called COPS, gives students "online learning opportunities whereby they explore problem scenarios, experiment, practice and reflect." It also enables "university teachers to develop clearer understandings of students’ teamwork and problem solving."</p>

<p>COPS allows teachers to pick the types of problems, the number of decision-making junctures and number of students participating. The system aids teachers in effectively using the program and designing problems that address all of the seven phases of development that create the basis of the COPS pedagogy. COPS is a system that is designed to develop through teacher use, feedback and teacher needs. COPS is still in development, but the researchers have developed a proof of concept and have begun testing use cases.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The authors found that a COPS system "stands to enable teaching staff to create reusable problem-centered ‘learning designs’ that can be integrated with face-to-face teaching to bridge the gap between the classroom and real world experiences." A collaborative online learning environment like COPS gives teachers maximum autonomy in lesson design. While an online program to create a learning environment can provide a template for teachers to design a problem-solving scenario, there still remain many dimensions the teacher will want to control to tailor the program to her class, including: the number of groups, the number of students, the number of decisions that need to be made, the type of decisions that need to be made, the length of the module.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> According to the study, "drop-out rates in e-learning have been quoted to be as high as 35%" and the researchers believe COPS promises to offer "high quality outcomes for student engagement and learning." The keywords here are "engagement" and "high quality." As the edtech industry is proving, many platforms and apps can be used to engage students, but the researchers believe that they are not engaging students in the right things in the right ways. </p>

<p>The researchers note that there is a lag in developing technology to support their vision of a collaborative learning environment that is "co-constructed, goal-directed and authentic." The authors have planned a pilot phase for COPS in which they will evaluate the usefulness of the tool using actual session data. This may lead to the creation of more like-minded programs in the future.</p>
