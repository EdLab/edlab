<p>When the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was founded in 1961, it adopted the familiar panda logo that it still uses a variation of today. It's also the first animal featured in the organization’s new app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wwf-together/id581920331?mt=8">WWF Together</a>. The app displays profiles for 16 endangered animals, each characterized by a descriptive word: <i>charisma</i> for giant pandas, </i>intelligence</i> for elephants, <i>longevity</i> for sea turtles, and <i>solitude</i> for tigers.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Each profile on WWF Together features beautiful graphics and engaging, interactive features. As you swipe through each frame, the app reveals photos galleries and videos clips of everything from habitats to a side-by-side comparison of the night vision of humans and tigers. The app also provides an extinction risk scale.</p>

<p>Finally, the app will fold up an origami version of the animal, which can be overlaid onto anything with your phone's camera, and shared at WWF's urging on social media.</p>

<p>Overall, WWF Together’s stunning images and sleek interface make the app impressively advanced and exciting to use. The virtual reality feature in particular is fantastic, and would be a great way for students to explore habitats.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because of the in-depth nature of each animal profile, there are unfortunately only 16 available, which may be limiting for both curious users and teachers looking to use it in the classroom. It would undoubtedly be challenging for the organization to include dozens of animals, not only due to the time and energy it would take to create so many interactive features for each animal, but also due to the memory it would likely take up on the app. As such, the app is better seen as a brief exploratory tool for a select few animals, though it would be interesting to see what WWF Together would look like if it included endangered plants and climate change dangers as well.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The WWF has been educating the public about endangered species and humans’ impact on those animals for decades, and the organization certainly rose to the challenge of utilizing modern day technology to continue, or rather, enhance its work. The app is free, easy to use, and will almost certainly make you feel more connected to the animals it features.</p>
