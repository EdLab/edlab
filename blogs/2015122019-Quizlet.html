<p>When students are busy speeding around town, living their fast-paced lives, who has time to create exam prep materials? And learning with a hardcover textbook? So passé. Preparing for a late night study session just became a little easier, and much more fun, with <a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quizlet-flashcards-study-tools/id546473125?mt=8 ">Quizlet</a>, a study preparation app. It allows students to create their own materials or choose from those already made by others within its user community.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>One of Quizlet’s major selling points is that it offers multiple modes to allows users to mix-up their normal study routines. "Learn" mode allows users to test their memory. "Match" mode makes users race against the clock when they perform a study task, like matching keywords to definitions. You can share your work with peers with audio and images, for those who prefer multimodal learning. Standalone text that sits lazily on the page becomes more exciting with Quizlet. </p>

<p>Quizlet is a relatively engaging experience, especially for something as potentially somberly serious as a study app. It offers an ever expanding constellation of study materials. Just when you thought you’ve engaged with all of the content within a particular corner of the study universe, the growing Quizlet community provides new study aids. As such, there is no fear of being bored or becoming worried that your materials will become stale.  Navigating the Quizlet interface is intuitive. By offering multiple layers of content, users can engage with a topic, prodded by vocal instructions, and review the content. Timed game play nudges you towards improving your speed and accuracy. This could be especially useful for high-stakes, time-sensitive, exams. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Quizlet offers a diverse set of learning modes, it does appear to trend in the direction of more recall-based, rote memorization work. In formal educational spaces like schools that are, at least nominally, attempting to move towards celebrating 21st century skills like creativity and problem solving, testing your memory with an app can seem old-fashioned and maybe even a little regressive. Also, for those who are more faint of heart, racing against the clock may not be their cup of tea. Instead, it is more of a hyper, caffeinated experience.  </p>

<p>Also, due to its focus on user-generated content, there is no certified, "money-back guarantee" of quality. I hope for your sake that whatever you are studying is of high quality, especially since it is being generated by a non-professional student community. For the most part, the content I examined seemed accurate. However, due to a lack of a rigorous editorial process with respect to content, Quizlet should play more of a complementary role in user studies. Think of Quizlet as what Wikipedia would do if it made its own study app. Also, due to the high volume of content, it can be a bit of a struggle to find those refined nuggets of highly specific content that you need to study. You just have to dig. Further, the jury is still out regarding the gamification movement with regards to learning substantive content. Abstract, highly theoretical content is not easily transformed into engaging game play. Plato’s <i>Republic</i> isn’t game show fodder. Finally, Quizlet is a community where the implicit quid pro quo is that if you want to take, you should give back. First-time users who find themselves under the gun in a stressful learning situation may need to remain just a simple user at first. Paying back to your community of creators may need to wait until after final exams. Taking your time, and waiting until you are not overburdened by your own work, may be the best way to ensure materials are of the highest quality.   </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Quizlet has an intuitive interface and user generated content that can diversify the study experience. </p>
