          <p>
            We are excited to announce the release of <a href="http://pressible.org/">Pressible  0.1</a> today! This is a very experimental release, though we are hoping  you (the lab) and others hop on board and give it a try! Please see our  <a href="http://pressible.org/features">features</a> page for more  details, but in a nutshell:
<ul>
	<li>Pressible is highly "templated" -- meaning that users can't change  much about the design of their site. Is this a good or bad idea? (Is it  good or bad for Facebook?) In any case, it allows us to try some things  out that wouldn't be possible otherwise. <em>Watch for more visual  elements in the future.</em></li>
	<li>We think Pressible is a reinvention of blogging as a vehicle for  publishing your ideas and work to the web in a fast, intuitive, and  powerful way. <em>Will you? Let us know!</em></li>
</ul>
Also, here are some things we think are cool about the project as a  whole:
<ul>
	<li>It's hosted entirely in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">the cloud</a> --  a new experiment for an EdLab application.</li>
	<li>It's built on the back of WordPress. We did kung fu on the data  WordPress throws around to create cool results now, and even cooler  results in the future.</li>
	<li>Right now it's experimental, but we are hoping it can mature into a  fully-fledged software project hosted by the Gottesman Libraries. We  think it can become a way to not only serve the TC community (and  alumni), but also individuals and organizations around the world.</li>
	<li>We hope you break it. <em>Really... we're ready to learn from our  mistakes.</em> So if you do, let us know!</li>
</ul>
We hope this is the beginning of a new stage in the lab's exploration  of the future of publishing (hey, it may also be the end of the road!),  and are excited to invite the lab to join us moving forward. We  envision a lot of other features and functionality that did not make  this release, and there are probably things we haven't even considered  yet.

So, what are you waiting for? <a href="http://pressible.org/wp-signup.php">Sign up for Pressible</a> today and begin your next big publishing project!

<em>Update on March 15th: Only someone with a Columbia University  email address can sign up for Pressible without a special invitation.</em>
