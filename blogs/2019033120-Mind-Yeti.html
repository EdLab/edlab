<p><a href="https://www.mindyeti.com/">Mind Yeti</a> is an app that provides guided mindfulness sessions for kids from kindergarten to fifth grade. It was developed by <a href="https://www.cfchildren.org/">the Committee of Children</a>, a non-profit on a mission to support children’s social emotional wellness. They offer a free version that includes 15 sessions, but require a premium membership of $8 a month to access all 80+ sessions. It’s also available for schools as a companion to other social emotional skills-building tools.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Mind Yeti’s mindfulness sessions provide clear and concise instruction that is accessible for young children. The complex nature of the mind is broken down into simple concepts, such as describing the various thoughts, feelings, and sensations that often overwhelm us as the hubbub of the mind. The instructions also feature a robust use of metaphor and visualization. For example, they have the user imagine they have a bowl of soup in front of them during the breathing exercise. When they breath in through the nose, they are smelling the soup, and when they breath out through the mouth, they are cooling it down. </p>

<p>The app is designed to be used by adults who guide children through the experience. It has a pleasing interface that is easy to navigate, with sessions organized into different categories according to need (e.g., focus or calm down) or practice (e.g., breath or gratitude). The sessions available in the free version of the app cover a wide range of categories and give you a good idea of the many ways you can practice mindfulness. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The onboarding process could be improved. New users aren’t directed to an introduction session, but rather to the same screen that is shown to all users. You have to scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the beginner’s playlist, which I don’t think every new user would see.</p>

<p>All the sessions are about five minutes long, which is great for beginners, but it would be nice if there were longer options available as children progress in their practice. I also wonder if some of the sessions might not be effective for younger children; it might be beneficial to include an age range for each session to help guide parents and teachers in their selection. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Although it doesn’t provide much opportunity for progression and customization, Mind Yeti offers a kid-friendly introduction to mindfulness. </p>
