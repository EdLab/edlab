<p>
<a href="http://uclass.org/">UClass</a> provides students and teachers with the opportunity to become better and more productive global citizens. The secure site is a place where teachers and their students can create an online classroom profile and connect with other classrooms around the world. The classroom profile serves as a platform for teacher-assigned homework and projects and a hitching post for student thoughts, ideas, and comments. These communications can be directed at one’s own class or other classes in the UClass network. This connectivity is continued in UClass’ global news stream functionality, which aggregates classroom profile updates from around the globe. This type of exposure and collaboration with other schools is meant to expose students to more diverse cultures and perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>UClass emphasizes global collaboration. This is an important and emerging skill for tomorrow’s leaders as digital communication and remote work become more common. UClass puts its far-reaching scope to work making traditional subjects like world history more relevant and engaging. Exposing students to other classrooms can give them an entirely new perspective on learning and throw a potentially dry subject into sharp relevance. Sharing their work with the world will motivate students to complete assignments and prepare them for an increasingly public and digital working life.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> At present it seems that users can connect with the community through text only. It would be beneficial if the site had webcam functionality. Video is an increasingly popular method of communication, and the webcam is becoming an essential piece of hardware in the classroom.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway</b></p>
<p>UClass is a classroom social network that puts emphasis on global sharing and collaboration. The world is becoming smaller as we become more connected; thus it is important for young students to learn how to communicate effectively with students of different cultures. Many future careers will require collaboration with other professionals not just within a country but across the globe. Teachers can prepare their students for this by reaching out to other classrooms on UClass and studying together. Students will have the chance to work with their global peers, who may have completely different perspectives on the same topic. UClass is a new site that received <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/UniteOurClassrooms?c=home">funding through Indiegogo</a> and has a great start on encouraging global collaboration and communication. It can build on the idea of global collaboration by adding functionalities that will assist students in creating learning artifacts in the platform.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>UClass connects classrooms across the world so they can learn together.</p>
