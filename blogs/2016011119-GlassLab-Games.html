<p><a href="http://about.glasslabgames.org/">GlassLab Games</a> develops online games, conducts research on game design, and provide services for game developers, all in the name of offering young learners online learning opportunities to hone 21st century skills.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The games that GlassLab itself has developed range from math to ELA to systems thinking, and all are presented in bright colors and eye-catching graphics. "Ratio Rancher," for example, puts the player in charge of a ranch, complete with vivid green pastures and fun, animated creatures. The games vary in terms of platform as well, which means that GlassLab’s audience is not limited to only iPad users or smartphone owners—some games are offered on PCs and web browsers. You can even preview each game by watching the accompanying video to get a better sense of which games you may want to pursue.</p>

<p>GlassLab’s games don’t just come with a product description; they also have a section describing alignment with Common Core State Standards, allowing teachers to pick and choose which games are best-suited for their current lesson or unit. Finally, GlassLab doesn’t just stop at producing their own games—they also conduct research on best practices for game development and offer support and resources for other aspiring game developers.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although GlassLab does offer a variety of games and platforms, those who want to play a very specific game on a particular type of device may be out of luck. Moreover, a handful of games are only offered to premium users, which limits users’ options, especially since premium subscriptions run anywhere between $25 and $50 a year. With only one or two games available for each subject, there is also always room for more game options.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>GlassLab’s commitment to educational games is clear, not only through their own development—which incorporates standards while still remaining engaging—but also through the way they have developed a network of educators and developers. By supporting teachers, students, and developers alike, GlassLab has helped make educational gaming more accessible and fun.</p>
