Jess Gartner is the CEO & Founder of <a href="http://bit.ly/1D5Sn1I">Allovue</a>, an education resource planning platform that allows K-12 school administrators to observe and improve the relationship between resource allocation and student outcomes. Jess has taught in schools around the world, including Thailand, South Africa, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Jess was featured as a leader in education for The Baltimore Sun’s 2013 "Women to Watch" and in Baltimore Magazine’s "40 Under 40," as well as being recognized on the 2015 Forbes’ "30 Under 30" list. In 2014, she was a featured panelist amongst prominent education leaders at the Education Technology Innovation Summit in New York City. Her writing and photography have been published in What Weekly, Changing Media, Skillcrush and Women 2.0.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
As an undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania, my studies and research focused on education policy. Specifically, I spent a lot of time working with Dr. Ted Hershberg and Dr. Claire Robertson-Kraft on various aspects of the <a href="http://bit.ly/1RzL494">Operation Public Education</a> framework, exploring models for teacher evaluation and compensation. After college, I moved to Baltimore as a Teach for America Corps Member, where I taught Middle School Social Studies and Language Arts and completed my Master's in Teaching at Johns Hopkins. </p>

<p>My academic background in education history and policy provided an interesting lens through which to experience teaching, as I was constantly thinking about the federal, state, and district policies that impacted my school and classroom environment for my students. One area that I became interested in—ok, obsessed with—was resource allocation. I was particularly interested in the district's move to a student-based-budgeting model. Giving principals a high degree of autonomy over the school budget created a wide spectrum of budgeting and spending practices that resulted in some schools moving to high tech 1:1 programs with a broad array of extracurricular offerings, while other schools lacked basic resources like toilet paper, textbooks, and copy paper. A bit of research revealed that most administrators lacked access to the data, tools, and training that would set them up for successful financial management. This struck me as an inherently solvable problem, so I founded Allovue to empower administrators to effectively align resources for student success.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
Right now the worlds of education, finance, and technology are very siloed. We have some incredible innovations in the edtech world to help teachers and administrators analyze student data and achievement. We have brilliant education finance researchers conducting case studies on best practices in resource allocation. And we now have an unprecedented technological capacity to bring those elements together through the power of software engineering, data science, and design, in a way that is accessible and easy to understand. I want to stress the importance of design in this work, because data is only as valuable as it is understandable and actionable. </p>

<p>In education, many of the people who are making critical decisions about resources (Principals, CAOs, Superintendents) do not come from a traditional finance or management background, but rather a teaching or administrative background. That means that design and user experience are especially important in terms of effects on analysis, planning, and decision-making when it comes to financial data and how we connect dollars to student achievement. Effective resource allocation involves optimizing limited resources (money, materials, people, time) for the greatest possible outcome. In the case of education, ideally the "outcome" is increased student achievement. At Allovue, we believe student success must be the bottom line, which means that every dollar must connect to student achievement. We're building the tools and providing the training to help make those decisions more data-driven, evidence-based, and easy to understand. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
I believe education finance is going to become one of the top issues in education in the next few years. We're seeing a convergence of several trends: rising costs of pensions and debt, reduced state budgets, attention to funding equity, and calls for increased transparency driven by the open data movement. Districts are going bankrupt, and the students and teachers will suffer the consequences. We saw this recently in Philadelphia, as schools opened last year without enough teachers, librarians, nurses, and social workers, but districts all over the country are facing similar challenges. </p>

<p>Spending and priorities are really the same thing, so districts need to ask tough questions about whether their spending is truly aligned with their top priorities for student achievement. If schools are struggling just to keep their doors open, they're not going to provide the best possible education for students. We have to stop pretending that budgets and spending are removed from the classroom. Spending drives everything: how many teachers there are, professional development, how well students are supported with wraparound services, the quality of curriculum, the safety and cleanliness of school facilities, extracurricular offerings, technology infrastructure, food, field trips, library resources, and college prep. We have to ask ourselves: are we stretching every dollar for students? Are we analyzing the cost-benefit ratio of these resources? Are we considering trade-offs? Right now, we're mostly not doing those things, and we must. We spend $600 billion on education annually in this country, and we do not have a $600 billion education system to show for it. Let's fix that. Now. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
I founded <a href="http://bit.ly/1D5Sn1I">Allovue</a> in February 2013 and it has consumed my waking (and sometimes sleeping) thoughts since then. I hope to be working on this for a long time to come, because I work with an incredible team of people and we are fiercely committed to our vision of making student success the bottom line in education finance. We're creating a whole new industry of edtech meets fintech. . . edfintech! Most district finance systems are 10 or 20 years old and we're losing important insights on trillions of data points about education spending. Our mission is to build world class software that unlocks that data for administrators and helps them connect it to student outcomes. We have laid a great foundation for this work since 2013, but there is still so much important work ahead of us. I think we have enough work here to keep us busy for the rest of our lives. </p>
