Hello everyone! George and I have returned from our trip to DC for the NCSS Conference, and we certainly had a good time there. 

Before I show you some pictures of our adventure George and I would also like to thank our fellow Edlabbers for the feedback and one-liners for our fliers. They were all very eye catching and we caught several people reading the slogans on the fliers, which felt very rewarding. I would like to thank everyone who gave feedback on the invitation cards and to the people who helped us cut and fold all 200+ of them. These cards were a big hit and people seemed so excited to receive them, we made sure to personally them all out. 

Now some pictures of the trip. On Thursday, after a few hours of promoting UFR at the convention, George and I headed back to the hotel for some much needed rest and after a 3-hour nap we went out searching for a nice place to have dinner. Along the way we spotted an Occupy Washington camp and decided to go exploring, and post up some UFR fliers (good thing we always had some on us, and scotch tape too).

<!--break-->
 We posted quite a few fliers in the front of the park, in the middle on some benches, and all around. The encampment itself was quite small and of course there was people banging on the drums. We circled around the park a few times and found people reading our fliers, and they seemed intrigued.  

After checking out Occupy Washington we had dinner at a restaurant next to our hotel that served some good chicken.

Then after getting a good nights rest we woke up Friday morning and headed straight to the convention at 8:30am to help out at the UFR presentation.

Our breakfast during the trip!

George and I passed out packets for the presentation and of course the invite cards. After the presentation we continued to leave fliers and personally hand out all of the invite cards.   

After giving out all of the cards, we walked around DC spreading the UFR fliers where ever we could. We saw the White House, walked about 20 blocks to the Capitol where we also saw and went into the Library of Congress, for details on that you'll have to tune into the <a href ="http://archivalrevival.pressible.org/"> Archival Revival blog</a>  where I'll include pictures. After our mini tour of D.C. we went back to the NCSS convention to continue promoting UFR and attend a presentation, before finally hopping on the Amtrak train to go back home. 

Here are some pics that we took!
