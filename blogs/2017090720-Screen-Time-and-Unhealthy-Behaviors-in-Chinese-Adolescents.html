<p>The negative consequences of screen time on students have long been studied in Western countries. Yet, research in China has been less focused on these behaviors and impacts. Using a recent sample of over 2600 students in Wuhan, China, a team of researchers explored the effects of screen usage during both weekdays and weekends on Chinese middle-school and high-school students. They found that increased time on computers, TV, or phones is negatively associated with a range of negative health or behavioral indicators for students, replicating research from the West. However, they also reported findings that contend with studies on student peer groups abroad. </p>
 
<p>The researchers tested for a range of negative behaviors and educational outcomes connected to screen time. They found that more time spent playing video games was associated with both an increase in snacking at night and a decrease in eating breakfast. Further, this usage was also found to be associated with sleep deprivation and lower self-esteem. The research also suggested that watching more TV and getting more online news/study materials on weekdays was connected to lower physical activity. During the weekends, receiving news or study materials online was also associated with higher levels of anxiety in students. These same connections with anxiety were additionally found for students who used social networking sites more often throughout the entire week.  </p>

<p>While some results were quite comparable to the West, others offer challenges to conventional studies on screen time. The researchers found that there was no statistically significant relationship between academic performance and receiving news/study materials from electronic devices. They believe that this finding was related to the Chinese partricipation in cram schools. The team also found that students who viewed more television on non-schooldays were more likely to have longer sleep durations, though they did not thoroughly elaborate on a hypothesis for this finding.  </p>

<p>For social media use, they found that students who were using these sites more often were also more likely to have higher degrees of physical activity and to be of normal weight or underweight, countering some research from the Western context. The nature of the Chinese sample offers some explanation for this disparity, as around 85% of students were normal weight or even underweight. The researchers further surmise that their weight finding stems from social mediaâ€™s influence on body image issues in adolescents. </p>

<p>The authors concede that these findings will need more in-depth research and could only offer brief cultural explanations. For now, their study provides a starting foundation for future work in China. Screen usage and the impact on societies around the world is only gaining importance. Additional research will lead to greater understanding of this important health and educational issue.</p>
