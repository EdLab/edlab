            Eric Schmidt, Chairman of Google, recently criticized the UK's education system as the reason that the country isn't at the top of the "digital media economy."  These comments were delivered last week during his opening MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival.  Perhaps to coincide with <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/26/google-tv-uk/">Google's upcoming release of Google TV in the UK</a>, Schmidt was allowed to make the prestigious opening lecture, which is usually reserved for news broadcasters. Listed below are key quotes from Schmidt and my summaries of thoughts from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14683133">this</a> BBC article:   

-"The UK is home of so many media-related inventions. You invented photography. You invented TV. You invented computers in both concept and practice."

-"It's not widely known, but the world's first office computer was built in 1951 by Lyons' chain of tea shops. Yet today, none of the world's leading exponents in these fields are from the UK."

-Computer screens & TV's are converging and Twitter and Facebook are adding a social layer to both TV & the internet.

-In the 80's as a part of their "Computer Literacy Project" the BBC distributed "Micro computers" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro to over a million UK schools & households and aired coding programs for children.  As a result of these initiatives Schmidt was especially "flabbergasted" that computer science wasn't taught as a "standard in UK schools." 

-When IT is taught Schmidt feels it is deficient,"Your IT curriculum focuses on teaching how to use software, but gives no insight into how it's made. That is just throwing away your great computing heritage,"

-Schmidt makes a claim that the UK needs to "bring art and science back together" much as the "glory days of the Victorian era" when Lewis Carroll penned Alice in Wonderland and worked as a mathematician.

<b>EdLab Relevance & Takeaways:</b>
Google's goings-on are a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6382">hot topic</a> here at EdLab headquarters.  As such, these comments by Dr. Schmidt are especially relevant for both our interest in search engines AND the future of education.  I would argue that "Googling" is an informal form of short-order journalism and a part of the journalistic process, though <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5930">some opponents</a> fear the "Google" will usurp old-fashioned research techniques.  Regardless of your thoughts on new modes for disseminating and acquiring information, in a knowledge-based society how you get your information seems less important than GETTING that information.

I was surprised to learn that the UK was the first to create an office computer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEO_(computer)">The LEO</a>!  Furthermore, much like their early attempts to democratize education through public television programming, the BBC also provided computer science information to children and even computers to the UK public.  Brilliant.  I can only imagine if PBS created shows that educated young people about computer science and programming today.  Pete the Python & Ruby the Rhino cartoons?  Sesame Street was on the right track with this early <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1235">"Computer Song"</a>... add your comments below!  

Finally, the concept of using the arts to teach STEM subjects is not new, but as we partner with the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6343">Rock & Roll Forever Foundation</a> to develop curriculum that teaches core subjects through music, we should explore Lewis Carroll's significance as a "rockstar" of literature who also happened to be a brilliant mathematician and tutor.  As I have explored in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6096">previous posts</a> beauty can be created when the STEM subjects and the fine arts are allowed to collide.
