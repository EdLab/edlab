            A mere seven months ago, on September 19th, 2014, Canada welcomed its first museum "solely dedicated to the evolution, celebration and future of human rights" set in the heart of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Never heard of it? Exactly! I had the unexpected opportunity to visit and prove the national museum's existence while visiting my college bestie and Teachers College alum's native land over Passover/Easter weekend. Intrigued? Read on.

The <a href=https://humanrights.ca/home>Canadian Museum for Human Rights </a> is the brainchild of late local philanthropist and founder of CanWest Global Communications Corp, Israel (Izzy) Asper, and the product of 15 years of planning, construction, and controversy. The museum is, in itself, an adventuresome architectural feat--beginning with a "descent into earth" where "visitors enter through the roots of the museum," meander through the Great Hall, and then power onward and upward through the 8 floor space via a series of stone ramps which all culminates at the Tower of Hope, a crystalline tower standing roughly 85 meters (which means little to me as an American) above downtown Winnipeg. How symbolic! (continue...)
But what's worth the trek, and this blog post, is the museum's forward-thinking, media-rich approach to the museum experience. While exploring indigenous perspectives, the Holocaust, genocide, and the endless struggles and progress made in the realm of women's, immigrant's, children's, persons with disabilities',  LGBT, language, and health rights and beyond (whew!) visitors have the opportunity to be part of the experience and solution through interactive media. Going at my own pace, I could coordinate with members of my community via an interactive table map to tackle local issues and make change; share my opinion in response to pivotal court decisions and compare it to the trend in Canadian opinion; dive into "open book" style digital monitors to learn more about people today who are fighting for what's right, thumb through images and documents related to mass human rights violations with the help of a digital study table, and more! So much more!

The museum is a living, evolving study of our human experience and an experiment in self-guided media-supported learning that truly inspires and educates. And while it's no <a href=http://jets.nhl.com>Jets game </a>
it proved to be the  highlight of my journey and new standard for museum visits to come.
