          <p>
            This semester, I'm taking a really helpful course with Professor Ellen Meier entitled "Assessing the Impact of Technology in Schools". Recently, we've read the following article by Alan Lesgold that raises a lot of pertinent questions for our work here in the Edlab:

“Detecting Technology's Effects in Complex School Environments” by Alan Lesgold from Haertel, G. & Means, B. (Eds.) (2003).  Evaluating educational technology:  Effective research designs for improving learning.  New York:  Teachers College Press.

This article explores the challenges of determining whether a particular technology or innovation is actually beneficial in a school environment. In particular, even if we do find some improvement in test scores, attendance rates, or some other agreed upon substitute for "academic success", how can we be sure that the innovation was not successful because of additional environmental factors needed to make it work? This is distinct from the traditional quantitative approach where we try to figure out some randomization strategy that will just make all other factors "equal" and so isolate any effect on the innovation. The distinction here is that some of those other factors may actually be endogenous to the success of new technology, so we can't just control them out.

The basic solution that the article presents is to include contextual factors in a systematic way during the evaluation and research process. In particular, Lesgold promotes the idea of "maturity indices" that capture how prepared a school environment may be to adopt a new technology (along dimensions like professional maturity, technology infrastructure, organizational structure, etc.). 

As we present innovations for schools and for learning in general, it is important to think about how we would define and measure effectiveness from the tools that we build.
