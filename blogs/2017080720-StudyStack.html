<p><a href="https://www.studystack.com/">StudyStack</a> is a flashcard smartphone app and website that’s free to use. It allows users to study cards from the company’s ready-made decks or upload original content. Aside from the normal flashcard function, the service also provides gamification options for studying. The games included on the smartphone app are hangman, crossword puzzles, and matching games. There are also several additional game options when using the service through the website. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The app offers a wide range of topics to study, including languages, standardized tests, and other academic subjects. There is an option to register or to just use the app as a guest. By registering, the service can keep track of your performance, even while switching between a phone and computer. You can also simply use the app or site as a "guest" if you just want to hop on for a quick study session without keeping track of any progress.</p>

<p>The gaming study options are StudyStack’s best feature. Some games are quite basic, like hangman or the crossword puzzle. My favorite game was Bug Match. In this game, you are a spider trying to catch bugs that correspond with specific vocabulary words for each round. If you eat the wrong bug (corresponding to an incorrect word) or the moths eat you, then you lose. It’s challenging and fun, and helps with both memorization and word usage. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>This app is in major need of an update. The design looks like it’s from the early days of internet flash gaming. The controls for the games on the smartphone version of the app are not all that responsive, making some games frustrating to play. My favorite game, Bug Match, is only available on the website version. There was also a problem with displaying non-Latin script. I tried to study Mandarin Chinese in one website game, but the game was impossible to play because it could not properly display the characters.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>In a crowded marketplace of flashcard apps and services, StudyStack is just an okay option. It can basically function for most memorization needs. The gamification tools can be a bit crude, but still entertaining. However, old design and other limited options hinder StudyStack from truly competing with some of the other higher-end flashcard apps available.</p>
