<p><a href="https://www.deekit.com/">Deekit</a> is a digitally shared whiteboard that helps facilitate brainstorming, participation, and teambuilding. Users can sign up through an existing social media account and are instantly granted access to Deekit's unlimited whiteboards and intuitive tools. Users can create boards based on their needs, catering to both specialized groups and specific projects. Each team member can draw, write, and add resources to the board enabling on-the-fly collaboration and instant idea sharing, giving everyone the chance to see an idea come to life. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> Deekit's greatest strength is its virtual accessibility. The tool allows users to collaborate with remote learners and colleagues anywhere in the world on an easy to use, responsive platform. Team members can share their thoughts and ideas in their preferred format, be it visual or text. Familiar tools like "pen" and "text box" ensure collaborators can quickly and effectively jot down their next big idea, without fumbling through a long list of confusing buttons. Share boards with potential collaborators through a unique URL and Deekit will seamlessly record (and save) the ensuing genius that transpires. Deekit streamlines the creative process while cultivating a hands-on learning environment in a virtual space. This platform is especially useful in classroom lessons involving group work and participatory exploration through teacher/student feedback as well as distance learning courses that require visual walk-throughs or explanations. Additionally, Deekit supports familiar touch gestures, like "pinch" to zoom in/out and two-finger pan and works on any device.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p> Currently, Deekit is only available for users with Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or LinkedIn accounts. Users can only sign-in using one of the aforementioned social media sites as Deekit does not offer a platform-specific account. Users working from a computer or laptop may find the drawing component difficult, as the interface is better suited to tablets or smartphones with styluses. The working model is in beta-mode and a few interior pages contain broken links or misleading paths. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Deekit is most useful to those who need more creative flexibility than what Google Drive supports. The platform works hard to translate the traditional whiteboard experience into digital one, but doesn't quite get it right. Deekit has the best intentions at its core, but ultimately the functionality might hinder brainstorming rather than help it.</p>
