          <p>
            In our constantly changing digital world, rumors are always rife about upcoming releases from companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft. For example, Apple is trying to launch their own television, Google trying to make futuristic goggles, and Facebook attempting to make its own phone. But you can forget about all these things happening any time soon. I was reading <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5971962/13-technologies-you-wont-see-in-2013">an article</a> that notes that all those aforementioned are simply rumors and there is no truth to those companies releasing such technology anytime soon. 

The article touches on problems that have risen during the process as well as doubts about the products. For instance, a Facebook phone has been rampant in rumor mills but founder Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the notion as he notes there is no need for a Facebook phone if practically almost every phone comes with the app already installed. It would be ridiculous as well as pointless for them to do so. 

The idea of an Apple TV seemed really cool as I am a fan of their products but we won't be seeing it on store shelves anytime soon for various reasons. First, Apple really need to come up with a reason for consumers to buy it since they will be going up against giants such as Sony and Samsung. Furthermore, Apple would need to team up with cable providers to make this happen. All these reasons and several others have led Apple to delay the TV project. Stay tuned.
