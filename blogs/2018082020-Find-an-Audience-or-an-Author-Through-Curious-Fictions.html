<p><a href="https://curiousfictions.com/faq">Curious Fictions</a> is a platform that connects authors of short stories to an audience. Writers can post stories and other content, and users can access their work through newsletters, social media, or other updates. The monthly subscription to Curious Fictions ranges from $5 to $15 and gives users access to all of the site’s content, newsletters, and hand-picked features. Alternatively, readers can choose to follow specific authors for around $2 to $10, which gives access to their writings and updates. </p>  

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The platform keeps 25% of specific author subscriptions and gives authors a cut of general site subscriptions depending on how many users read or like their stories. Paying writers for their work is an important and noble mission, and Curious Fictions makes it easy for authors to actually earn money from their writing. The site will also help to promote content and garner some publicity through its network, building a Kickstarter-like interest from fans.</p>   

<p>For readers, the site offers a way to directly interact with multiple authors in one place. With questions of transparency increasingly becoming a concern, users will feel better knowing that they are directly paying authors for the content they enjoy, rather than blindly tossing money at large companies. This service democratizes who gets to become a paid author, as fans are the ones making that decision.</p>  

<p>On a technical note, the platform is simple and easy to navigate. There are no banner ads or aggressive clickbait content. The <a href="https://curiousfictions.com/about">founder’s background</a> in web design and development really shows through in the site’s elegance.</p>  

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The site offers three payment options of $5 to $15 for the full site access or $2 to $10 for the single author subscription. These various payment choices do not offer any different experiences. On crowdfunding platforms like <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, there are tiered payments for more access or other prizes. Curious Fiction should add incentives for readers to choose the higher payment levels. Right now, the platform’s model is more akin to pay-what-you-want.</p>

<p>While I like Curious Fictions’ mission of directly paying authors for their content, the platform has other competitors that offer similar services. Fans have already been directly funding creators through sites like <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a>, which are more general and have massive user bases. To be a viable option for authors, Curious Fictions will have to prove that it can compete long-term with these established players.</p>

<p><b>Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>Curious Fictions has a noble mission of getting more people to read and of actually paying writers for their work. While it does this well, its biggest obstacle comes from competitors that offer similar platforms but with massive user bases. However, because Curious Fictions focuses on a specific niche, short story writers and their fans, it does stand out as a more intimate platform compared to the more general crowdfunding sites.</p>
