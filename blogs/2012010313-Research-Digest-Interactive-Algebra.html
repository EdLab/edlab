(2011). Solving Algebra problems with interactive diagrams: Demonstration and construction of examples. <i>The Journal of Mathematical Behavior, volume 30,</i>(issue 1), 48-61.</a>

<b>Description:</b> This paper explores the different ways students solve an algebraic problem through interactive diagrams and how they can create new examples with it. The problem discussed in the paper was writing an algebraic expression given a linear function graph with two marked points on the graph. The students would first solve the problem using a paper diagram of the graph as this would serve as the baseline situation when being compared to the three interactive diagrams students would use to solve the problem. The students would then solve the problem through three interactive diagrams, and the authors would observe how the student solved the problem. The three interactive designs were:

1) Illustrating- Diagram that looks exactly like the paper diagram but without the gridlines, and the ability to provide the x and y values of any points on the linear graphs.

2) Elaborating- Diagram that has more options for students to solve the problem, like typing any function expression in any structure.

3) Narrating- Diagram designed for students to obtain solution through use of specific tools like changing the values of parameters in the given expression f(x)=a(x-c)+m, where a=slope, and (c,m) are the coordinates of a marked point on the function graph.

The authors found that when students solved the problem through the Illustrating model, which did not offer much tools to help students solve the problem, they tried to bypass design constraints. With the Narrating model, the students treated the given example as a general example and were able to come up with a generalization. Finally the Elaborating model had varied methods in which students solved the problem even though the model had a more directed approach to finding a solution. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This paper seems to explore options for creating an algebraic problem for an interactive digital math textbook. Looks like when creating a type of problem like the one mentioned in the paper, giving students more ways to solve the problem will not only help students solve the problem but come up with a generalization so they can solve similar problems. In this era of interactive textbooks and digital learning resources, educators would need to be informed about new process of knowing about the stability of known processes.
