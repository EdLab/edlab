<p>How do instructors design quality online discussion for student teachers? A recent quantitative study examined the online discussion threads of 21 pre-service and in-service teachers based on their experiences watching videos in a graduate teacher education course. Specifically, the course instructor assigned a series of animated geometry teaching episodes for discussion. The animated video stories contained different versions of classroom teaching events, including critical events that might not align with the best practices in the field.</p>

<p>Students watched videos and time-stamped comments on <a href="https://www.lessonsketch.org">LessonSketch</a>, an interactive video-based learning environment featuring animated representations of math teaching. An explicit, succinct guideline was provided under each video: "The teaching is not necessarily exemplary or problematic. It is just a case of teaching that provides food for thought." Students were graded based on the thoughtfulness and insight of their comments. In addition, the instructor decided not to moderate the forum or comment on any of the student postings throughout the course.</p>

<p>The authors found that students initiated evaluative comments by critically reviewing some of the teaching practices shown in the cartoon videos. The students who made critical remarks about the videos were more likely to reflect on their own teaching practices and suggest alternative teaching approaches for improvement. The number of critical comments students made was consistently linked to how many self reflections and teaching recommendations they contributed.</p>

<p>The selection of contentious teaching videos might help to encourage students’ evaluative online discussion. In addition, the less structured, fluid discussion space featured in the study might further complement the design of an open-ended learning space for students’ in-depth evaluation and reflection.</p>
