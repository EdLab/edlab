          <p>
            <p>Recently I started working on a horizontal enhancement for all our projects. As of now we are running several applications, some Dockerized, and some &quot;old school&quot;. Old school applications write application logs the old way, into a file on the particular Server machine, which is cool. And Dockerized machines write application logs into the specific container, which is cool too in many cases. But being an organization that runs several applications, we needed a better mechanism for maintaining logs.</p><p>
A bigger need for this enhancement comes from the fact that most of our applications have been built to enrich the Education eco-system. Given this, we needed a way to look at our applications holistically, rather than as independent units. There is high potential for much better insights if we are able to look at how the consumers of our applications used them, and moved between each module.<br />
An obvious step for us to take, after understanding the need for this enhancement, was to centralize all our application logs. And this is when the work started. I started exploring ways to manage our logs, and play around with them, keeping in mind that a solution needs to be inter-temporally valid. This is when I came across FluentD.<br />
FluentD is an log aggregator layer between your applications and whatever you want to do with your logs. And the best part, it comes natively built into Docker as a driver. Following diagrams, sourced from the official website of FluentD, should explain much of what it does.
<br />

<br />
<strong>After FluentD:</strong>

<br />
I was successfully able to build a PoC to show that the aggregation aspect of this solution works well. After researching on how well it integrates with our NodeJs and Django applications, we decided to implement it on a pilot basis, while simultaneously testing out various services that we can use to analyze logs, and archive them for future usage.<br /></p>
