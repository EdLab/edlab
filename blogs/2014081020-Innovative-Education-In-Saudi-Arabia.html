Saudi Arabia’s education system is going through a transformation. In an effort to move towards a knowledge-based economy, administrators and other stakeholders in the Kingdom have established the <a href="http://ithraknowledge.com/">iThra Youth Initiative</a>, which has a special focus on STEM, collaboration, and creativity. The initiative comes at a time when Saudi Arabia and the region are going through political, social, and economic changes. The initiative, targeted at 12-18 year olds, is hoping to reach over two million Saudi students, mainly in urban and rural public schools.
<p>
Through workshops, students are able to collaborate, engage and learn from their peers and educators. Student reflections about their experiences at the workshops show that the initiative is starting to have an impact on their learning, but there is concern about lack of knowledge retention once it ends.  Ultimately, the iThra Initiative hopes to prepare students as citizens and professionals who will drive the Kingdom to unprecedented heights in the region and across the globe. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@00:18 Nantwi:</b> Saudi Arabia’s large youth population is representative of that in the Middle East. The region is ripe for innovation. How do governments, NGOs, investors and all stakeholders go about fulfilling this potential?<p>

<b>@00:36 abagigah92:</b> Saudi focusing much of their attention towards science and math is reasonable because it could result in future development that will generate revenue which could result in economical growth.<p>

<b>@01:27 melAIL8:</b> This helps the student think in a more creative way, get a more deeper understanding of it.<p>

<b>@02:53 kingyoussef:</b> People always want to learn and it seem that they really enjoy the workshops.<p>
