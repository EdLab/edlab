            <div class="gmail_default"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">So far, I’ve completed the readings and engaged with the multimedia components to the course. There are many things I can appreciate from this topic, although there are also certain readings and lectures that I wished was presented in a different way since it I am not taking it in a traditional classroom. </span></div>
<div class="gmail_default"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></div>
<div class="gmail_default"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">This is my first time taking an online class, whether for credit or simply just to learn. It has been an interesting experience. Like many things, it comes with its pros and cons. One of its pros is convenience. I have done the readings and watched the videos on my own time and in many places (e.g. subway). An advantage has been reading the materials one a time and digesting the information. You can also read through multiple lectures at once if you're someone who is comfortable learning a lot at once. The learner is ultimately in control of their learning and must decide when to complete the course before any of the suggested deadlines. </span></div>
<div class="gmail_default"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></div>
<div class="gmail_default"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">There are not many big cons with this course thus far. The only one I can think of is not being in a physical classroom to discuss readings and other content. The content from the course lends itself greatly to in-person discussion. Since that is obviously not possible, I wish the producers of the platform could have added a discussion board or some sort of form for learners to have a discussion. From my schooling experience, I enjoy talking with and asking classmates how they plan to complete, which gives me an idea of how to go about my work. It's been a challenge to do certain readings and assignments on my own, without any suggestions or recommendations. Overall it’s been an exciting course and I'm looking forward to the next set of readings and assignments. </span></div>
