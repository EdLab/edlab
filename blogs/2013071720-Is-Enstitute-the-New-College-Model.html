With skyrocketing tuition costs, many believe that the investment of higher education does not yield sufficient returns. Enstitute is a 2-year program that serves an alternative to the usual college route by providing their students an opportunity to learn relevant skills in high-growth industries while simultaneously working with industry professionals who also act as mentors. Enstitute’s "Learning By Doing" motto fosters a learning environment that truly immerses the student within an industry they hope to join upon completion of the program. <p>

Instead of a certain skill set for a specific career, the 21st century job market calls for a more adaptive and flexible set of skills. Programs such as Enstitute are catering to this new need for innovative, creative, and critically thinking individuals. They’re also providing alternatives for students who don’t quite fit the traditional school model of lecture, reading, and writing. Ben Darr, a student at Enstitute, felt he wasn’t getting what he needed from college so he dropped out and enrolled in Enstitute where he works side-by-side with a startup CEO, contributing to real projects for a real business. "After these two years, I’ll have so many options, but one that hasn’t crossed my mind is going back to college," says Ben.<p>

<b>@02:17 DLales:</b> So this is like apprenticeship learning. This was more commonly done hundreds of years ago. Now it seems to be making a comeback!<p>

<b>@04:57 DLales:</b> So he's deciding to forgo the degree and use his experience to get new opportunities. Is this a wise thing to do? I'd imagine most companies will still want new employees to have a higher ed degree.
