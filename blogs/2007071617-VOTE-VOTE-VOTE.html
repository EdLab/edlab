            With the general presidential election less than 18 months away, there is no better time for Americans of all ages to engage with the electoral process. America's voter turnout remains one of the lowest among the world's major democracies, especially those in Western Europe. France recently saw an 85% voter turnout for its presidential election. Though last fall's midterm elections saw a 4% voter increase from the 2002 edition, the fact remains that most Americans don't vote. In the last presidential election, voter turnout teetered around the 60% mark. This fact is more evident in America's youth-the 18-24 age group. 54% of that age group was registered to vote in the 2004 presidential elections but only 47% showed up on Election Day. <p>

Dubbed the “know-nothing” generation by political pundits, the lack of political activeness on our parts is very surprising considering the current political climate where scandals seem to be the norm coupled with the growing unpopularity of the war domestically and internationally. College students played an active and decisive role in bringing our troops home from Vietnam in 1973. Though my parents' generation may have picketed for an end in Vietnam for personal reasons, i.e. fear of draft, they spoke and fought for what history eventually deemed an unnecessary war. We are in the midst of a very unpopular war in Iraq and President Bush's approval rating is dancing around the 30% mark, the lowest since the failed presidency of Jimmy Carter, yet we see no activism on a large scale from members of my generation. There are countless reasons given for why my generation doesn't care to vote on Election Day, but elections are one of the major aspects of a democratic society and it is quite a shame that it is neglected. <p>

When the U.S. Constitution (Article 1(4), 2 (2)) was adopted by the states in 1774, it was states that were responsible for deciding eligible voters. In 1788, the American voter had to be: white, male, property owner, Protestant and at least 21 years old-a requirement that was met by only 23% of the population at the time. However by 1829, property and religious requirements were voluntarily abolished by all states with the exception of North Carolina and Virginia and the property requirement was removed altogether by 1860. One of the most important of the “civil war amendments” to our constitution was the 15th amendment, which gave free slaves the right to vote. Though it was seen by our leaders at the time as part of the reconciliation process following a war that was intended to divide the union, a game of constitutional “hide and seek” became the norm between states and the federal government for a century. Many states instituted the “Grandfather Clause,” which stated that one is eligible to vote only if their grandfather was eligible to vote before the Civil War, a policy that clearly abandoned the 15th amendment because slaves were disenfranchised prior to the Civil War and as such neither did their grandfathers. Subsequent policies, notably the Jim Crow laws, limited voting rights to only white males. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (recently extended for another 25 years by President Bush) authorized the Justice Department to seek injunctions against anyone who prevented a person from voting on the basis of their race. The Act banned the Jim Crow laws and removed the literacy test component of that law-which had required all possible voters to pass a literacy test that measured their reading ability in order to register to vote. The literacy test clearly targeted the largely poor and uneducated black population and the few blacks who were able to pass the test often faced physical and verbal abuse when they went to the polls. The turn of the 20th century saw a widespread women's movement for enfranchisement. The result of the movement was the passage of the 19th amendment by Congress in 1920 that outlawed voting discrimination on the basis of gender. <p> 

The reasons given for why Americans don't vote abound in academic and political circles. First, there are legal barriers that prohibit potential voters. In order to vote in any state or election, you must be a U.S. citizen. Most states require a residency requirement in order to register to vote in that state. There are also systematic barriers. Most elections are often a winner takes all single member election and since both major political parties appeal to the same group of people for votes, options are limited for the voter. There is also the common complain about the voting schedule. Election Day is often Tuesdays and thus people complain since it is a weekday, most people are at work during voting hours. Furthermore, elections are very frequent for local, district, city and state elections. <p>

The 2008 presidential elections is less than 18 months away and the time for Americans of all ages to decide the future of our nation is practically in our hands. The time for America to reassert itself on the international stage, politically and economically, is more urgent considering the rapid rise of our friends in the East and the European Union. We have the power to choose a leader who will bring our troops home from Iraq, decrease our huge deficit, bring back the international allies that the current president has lost, and appoint practical and worthy judges to our federal courts in addition to choosing a reliable cabinet. I have enumerated some of my grievances against the current administration and that will serve as my motivation come 2008. The right to petition the government for a redress of grievances is a constitutional right and voting is the most effective way to practice that right. So come Election Day 2008, you should vote if you have at least one grievance against the current administration or if you care deeply about the future of our nation.
