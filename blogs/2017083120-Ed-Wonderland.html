<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ed-wonderland-learn-basic-mandarin-chinese/id1037752913?l=zh&ls=1&mt=8">Ed-Wonderland</a> is an interactive language learning app from Alice Education Studio. The app lets users navigate an avatar around a digital environment while completing language lessons. The only language currently available is Mandarin Chinese, but players can choose either simplified or traditional characters. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p> The app looks and feels similar to a classic Japanese role-playing game (JRPG), but instead of fighting monsters, players complete language challenges for this quest. The design of the game is immersive, as users can chat with non-playable characters for hints, save animals during challenges, and click on random objects in the game, such as trees or lights, to reveal new vocabulary. The landscapes and buildings are even based on real counterparts in Taiwan, adding to the creativity of the environment. Just like in role-playing games, you earn gold by completing various tasks that can be used to upgrade the power and abilities of the character.</p>

<p>The challenges are fairly standard for language learning apps, such as simple matching or multiple choice quizzes. The vocabulary comes from the first three levels of HSK, a popular Chinese proficiency exam organized by the Hanban in Mainland China. All of the game’s action is integrated in language learning or testing. For example, in order to save animals from Dr. Mad in the Animal Valley, players must successfully choose the correct vocabulary during battles. Each action gives players more gold to level up or upgrade superpowers, which become necessary as the challenges increase in difficulty. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The free version of the game only allows for a few levels or challenges, and then users must pay $3.99 to move further along in the game. For me, I am beyond the basic Mandarin level offered, so the early part of the game did not really add much educational value. There are also some in-app purchases for additional help and vocabulary building. Users can also add digital currency by watching short ads, an annoying gimmick that is common in many in-app purchase apps today. </p>

<p>The biggest disappointment in the Ed-Wonderland app is the game’s audio. The app uses a computerized voice that has an unclear pronunciation. For a tonal language like Mandarin, sound is crucial for learners, especially early on in the process. Every beginner Chinese language class starts with a strong emphasis on tones. The app really should upgrade to a more natural sounding voice for learning this language.  
 </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Ed-Wonderland provides a fun gamification of language learning, especially for those who enjoy playing classic JRPGs. The design could serve as an early appeal in introducing beginners to the difficult journey of learning Chinese. However, the audio issues and limited language/advanced options hinder its long-term use. Upgrading the audio and growing the language capacity would greatly increase its usefulness, especially for $3.99 in a crowded language learning market. Still, Ed-Wonderland has a lot of potential for its interesting take on educational role-playing gamification. </p>
