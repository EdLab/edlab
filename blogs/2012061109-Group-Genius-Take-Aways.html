At last week's seminar each group provided a detailed look at chapters from Sawyer's Group Genius book.  The presentations leave us with some solid implications for our work and the annual performance review process in three major areas.

First, there are implications for how we as individuals utilize the work environment and the perspectives of our colleagues as springboards for innovation.  Developing skills in communication, particularly in listening and receptivity, stand out as key elements.  

* We might consider highlighting accomplishments and/or development opportunities in these areas.

Second, there are implications for how we form and re-form work teams to create a balance between sufficient similarity and sufficient dissimilarity in backgrounds and perspectives to generate innovation. Here there is a tension between the stability necessary to maintain on-going functions and the flexibility necessary to spur fresh thinking.  

*We might consider current team arrangements and the opportunities we have for enhancing them. 

Third, there are implications for our overall organization as an environment for collaboration and innovation.  Here there seem to be opportunities both for revisiting our internal organizational arrangements as well as for imagining new relationships with external partners and our on-campus patrons.  

*We might consider how we can deepen the innovation potential of both partners and patrons in the year ahead.

Finally, at the end of the seminar I noted that we would be looking for suggestions for development activities that could involve the entire staff in the year ahead.  Please reply to this post with suggestions you may have -- and please note that my example of singing lessons was not a serious suggestion!
