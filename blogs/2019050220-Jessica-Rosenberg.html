<p>Jessica Rosenberg is a body-mind educator, author, and the creator of the <a href="http://adventuresofsuperstretch.com/">Super Stretch Yoga</a> app and well-being program for children. She is committed to helping tots to teens live a healthy life free from stress and anxiety. Her <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-stretch-yoga/id1296649092/">podcast</a> empowers and inspires listeners to find joy and freedom from fear, offering tools to create balance from the inside out. She also brings mindfulness, breath work, and yoga practices to senior care centers, public schools, and underserved populations.</p>

<p><b> In an interview with Twin Cities Wellness Collective, you mentioned you earned "a gritty MBA," which I take to mean you learned a lot about building your company as you went along. Is there one lesson from that period that critically shaped, or continues to shape, your current work?</b><br>

<p>I have had tons of amazing life experiences and mindful moments on this business journey! But my biggest lesson has been FAILURE. What I have learned from all of the failures is that I have hustle and heart, and a grit and the growth mindset that gives me resilience, just like my meditation practice.</p>
 
<p>I have learned that all failure is critically connected to life experiences and that each failure, in my personal life and work life, has made me courageous. I now say, "Thank you!" and then invent better because I know that the work I do matters.</p>
 
<p>Balance is our superpower to enJOY life’s ever-changing adventures. And through Super Stretch I want to continue to be a catalyst for change in the healthcare industry and create tools to mitigate stress and anxiety. If I don't practice what I preach, I will never be able to inspire students to find joy and freedom from fear or provide skillful solutions to promote lifelong emotional health from the inside out.</p>

 <p><b>What are your greatest takeaways from the work you’ve done to bring Super Stretch, mindfulness, and meaningful movement into classrooms? Do you have any advice for teachers who may be interested in (or intimidated by) the process of implementing mindfulness and movement practices in their classrooms?</b><br>

<p>It might be scary at first, but I know you can do it! It just takes one breath to make a huge change in a child’s life.</p>
 
<p>Yoga is the art of breathing and looking. It’s creating calm, mindful moments of connection. It’s not what we do,  it’s <i>how</i> we do it! Smile. Be fascinated, with no judgement. Download some handouts, watch YouTube videos, and practice with your students. Get our flash card deck to use with your students. You can even lay down in Rest & DreamTime pose, savasana, to listen to some of our free Adventures of Super Stretch meditations on the Insight Timer app as you relax and practice together.</p>
 
<p>Let go, delightfully! It is awesome!</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I hope that my work will help to empower children’s bodies, minds, and hearts through yoga, breathwork, and meditation practices. We are powerful superhuman machines, powerful beyond measure. Our mind is our biggest asset, but we need to manage it, especially when we are in "negative land" and we’re worried, frazzled, stressed, or anxious, and life seems yucky. Mind-body practices like yoga help us to reframe. They are mind exercises and mind training that allow you to dive deep into your true nature, cultivating seeds of mindfulness and optimism. Yoga practice shakes us awake so we can fully enJOY life and be our best selves. </p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Technology will shape the fitness industry through wearables, smartphone apps, and training equipment that can be interconnected and networked. Gamification will continue to have an important impact on learning, as will advances in biohacking and neuroscience research.</p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Building out the gamified version of the app with all 60+ characters that live at 247 Mindful Path Way, writing a children’s mindfulness book using the Super Stretch characters, and writing a nonfiction book on yoga for anxiety for kids ages three to eleven.</p>
 
<p><b>Who is your favorite character from the Super Stretch series and why?</b><br>
<p>I love all of them!!! David and Leila are the instigators and are always getting into challenging, problematic situations. Then they can teach kids that go on the yoga adventures with Super Stretch to ‘Breathe. Stretch. Play.’ and respond wisely during life’s ups and downs.</p>
