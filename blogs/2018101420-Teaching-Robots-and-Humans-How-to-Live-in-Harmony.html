<p>Whether learning to live and work alongside robots is something that excites you or horrifies you, it's something we all need to learn sooner or later. The problem is that coexistence isn’t easy when humans don’t fully understand robots’ intentions and capabilities and our robotic counterparts don’t understand the rules of engagement.</p>   

<p>Researchers at the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at UC Berkeley are hoping to make these necessary interactions more natural and less intrusive through teaching robots to anticipate human behavior. Training drones to adjust their movements and actions to what humans might or might not do in the future helps them to build more cautious but capable models. In thinking about how robots are intended to help people, not hinder them, these researchers hope to create machines that are more compatible with our everyday lives.</p>

<p>What do you think are the most important things for developers and designers to keep in mind when considering how to make human-robot interactions as positive and beneficial as possible? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44602">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:11 Sara Hardman: </b>I think there is a fine line between a robot having human abilities and being too humanlike. For successful interactions, it makes sense for robots to be able to anticipate human actions. But at the same time, I wouldn't want to interact with a robot that tries to adopt all of human abilities and characteristics.</p>

<p><b>@03:09 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> "The limits of their creation's abilities" isn't a phrase I hear spoken very often by robot developers. Much more common, it seems to me, is something along the lines of "it has limitations now, but we're working to overcome these limitations." It's refreshing to hear talk about AI without the undertones of endless possibility.</p>
