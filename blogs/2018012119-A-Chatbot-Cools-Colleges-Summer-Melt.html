<p><i>"Never before has communication technology been capable of achieving such meaningful behavior change and improved outcomes for students at scale."</i> (<a href="https://www.admithub.com/about">About AdmitHub</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The Dreaded Summer Melt</b></p>

<p>Many universities face the challenge of summer melt, a phenomenon where college-enrolled high school seniors never set foot on campus come fall. While there are various reasons for this effect, many students who don’t make it to college lack the support and guidance they need to apply to the right schools, consider financial planning, and understand campus life.</p>

<p><b>Chatbots to the Rescue</b></p>
 
<p><a href="https://www.admithub.com">AdmitHub</a> addresses the summer melt problem using a platform already indispensable to teen life: texting. At any time of day, students can either text or Facebook message one of AdmitHub’s chatbots to receive guidance on any college entrance question, from filling out FAFSAs to submitting SAT scores. AdmitHub has one general chatbot, Oli, as well as several university-specific chatbots, such as Georgia State’s chatbot Pounce. Each is run on artificial intelligence and machine learning, ensuring that the chatbots bring a personal touch to conversations.</p>
 
<p>In 2016, Georgia State University, facing growing summer melt numbers, <a href="http://blog.admithub.com/case-study-how-admithub-is-freezing-summer-melt-at-georgia-state-university">used AdmitHub</a> to communicate with incoming students during the summer months as they prepared for school. Incoming students could chat with Pounce about college preparation, including immunization submissions and online orientation sessions. After one summer using Pounce, Georgia State had a 21.4% reduction in summer melt and a 3.9% increase in enrollment.</p>
 
<p>While any student can use AdmitHub, many teens this organization helps are low-income or first-generation college students. It is particularly useful for those who don’t have access to a high school guidance counselor, or who have to vie against hundreds of other students for one-on-one time with their college advisor. AdmitHub may be limited in its answers, as chatbots can only provide so much information, but in answering the basic questions, this organization could help more students get to college confidently.</p>
