            It's an enjoyable and exciting process of co-producing the video with Doug these past weeks. As he mentioned in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2999">a recent entry</a>, we want to share our experiences, tips, and reflection on this collaborative effort through “our trial and error method”. I hope the following categories can serve as a starting guide for beginners who would be interested in video production in the near future. 

<b>PLAN YOUR TRIP</b>

It is mainly about getting in touch with the sites you want to visit in advance, proposing your interested topics, letting them know what kind of support (e.g., type of interview, number of interviewees, etc.) you may seek from them, and keeping them aware of the major questions you want to ask. It might also be helpful to let them know the “significance” of videotaping their site. 

<b>PLAN YOUR STORY</b>

It is very important to pre-design and organize the scenes for your video story before your trip, even only with a few general ideas. You can do some sketches and arrange them through sketch sheets or sheets printed from Powerpoint. Then, once you arrive at the site, you will be reminded of the indispensable captures you need for your video story. 

<b>BE TECHNICALLY PREPARED</b>

(from Doug)

<b>Shooting Ratio</b>
About <i><b>10 : 1 (min)   (Capture : Publish)</b></i>

For each minute of <i><b>publishable video</b></i> you expect to put together, try to limit yourself to 10-12 minutes of <i><b>captured video</b></i>. For example, if you want to make a 4-5 minute video, try not to capture more than 50 minutes of video when you shoot.  This will help you start with a reasonable amount of footage to work through. 

<b>Positioning Camera</b>
-	Put the camera on your right, in line with your head/ear. 
-	Ask interviewee to face you (i.e., the interviewer) rather than the camera when being interviewed. 

<b>B-roll</b> 
In addition to some interviewing scenes, you also need to get B-rolls which are related scenes such as:
-	Interviewees' interaction with others 
-	Interviewees' activities around your theme 
-	Scenes of city, street, and/neighborhood of the site (establishing shots: establish where/when we are, what it looks, sounds, moves, etc) 

<b>B-roll Technique</b>
Count at least 5 seconds when taking B-rolls, which will also help you hold the camera statically.

<b>Room Selection</b>
Try not to choose a room with an AC being turned on to conduct your interview. The AC noise can be very distracting in video.

<b>Other Tutorial Material Gathered</b>
-	<a href="http://www.school-video-news.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=453:the-art-of-the-title-sequence&catid=44:edit-post-production&Itemid=111">The Art of the Title Sequence</a>
-	<a href="http://www.school-video-news.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=437:nine-digital-cinematography-tips&catid=43:videography&Itemid=110">More School-videotaping Tips</a> 

<b>AT THE SCENE</b>

Being at the scene interacting with people may let you feel a bit “amnesic” about the tips, e.g., shooting longer than 12 mins, taking B-rolls too fast, etc. But you will be fine with the following idea in mind: The slow and stable camera movement can better lead the audience of your video. Whenever you switch to a new shot, always begin with a still or slow motion (which is a lesson learned from Ting's clip). 

<b>CO-PRODUCTION PROCESS</b>

<b>Footage Selection</b>
According to your original story plan, you may want to go through the footage yourself first and filter out clean and clear clips related to your plan. 

Then it is the time to sit down with experts from the design group to go through the filtered clips together and discuss the content and possible effects. 

<b>Narration Formation</b>
It would be helpful to start writing narrations of your story on your own, then with a collaborative effort through a shared document (i.e., <b>Google doc</b>), you and the expert video producer can further decide and polish the story flow and narrations together. 

<b>Screen Capture</b>
<b>iShowU</b> is so far the best software to capture scenes/activities on a website.

<b>Transcription</b>
For interviewees who don't speak English, you may need to transcribe certain parts of the conversation that you feel interesting and want to include into your video. The transcription will bring convenience to the video producer to make cuts and organize the content of the video. The following is a short example from EdWorld: Shanghai:

<i><li>[Students' group interview: 5:29-5:31] "Do you have any questions for students in the U.S.? Like students there at about the same age?"</li>
<li>[Students' group interview: 5:41-5:48] "I read from newspaper about the U.S.'s ‘freedom' (democratic) education, I would want to ask them how their teachers teach them.</li>
<li>[Students' group interview: 5:50-6:04] "I heard about that in the U.S. students don't have homework in the summer but have lots of homework in the regular semesters. I would want to ask them what kind of homework they do?"</li>
<li>[Students' group interview: 6:06-6:10] "What kind of after-school activities do they attend in the U.S.?"</li>
<li>[Students' group interview: 6:14-6:18] "Do their teachers in the U. S. end classes very late? Do they feel relaxed with their study?"</li></i> 

<b>Peer Review</b>

<b>Group Review</b>

...

<b>Final Completion!</b>


This starting guide is definitely subject to further revisions and suggestions from experts at the design group. It combines Doug's suggestions and our experiences in the process and lessons learned. For myself, I look forward to bringing them to making a better and deeper digital ethnographic report in the future.
