Leon Young is the CEO of <a href="http://www.cogniss.com/">Cogniss</a>, an app-building platform focused on educational and behavioral technology; developers can tap into the platform’s in-built game and app design and research to create their own solutions. Young is also the founder of <a href="https://www.2and2.com.au/">2and2</a>, an educational games company. Young founded his first enterprise, LYSCo, at the age of 14 to distribute computer games he had developed. Leon started working in online learning in 1999 and has since developed a deep interest in the intersection of psychology and neuroscience. Young’s work in educational technology has been recognized internationally with the team he leads, winning over 50 major awards. He regularly speaks at conferences and higher education institutions on technology’s application to learning and behavior change.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Cogniss?</b><br>
<p>It's a long story that goes back to my earliest experiences. Growing up in isolated, rural Western Australia meant educational TV was my best friend early on. By the time I started school, I had acquired an eclectic but disjointed array of knowledge. I could speak simple sentences in German and French, was fascinated with concepts like the solar system and had basic numeracy skills. I entered first grade full of enthusiasm, expecting to launch into a wonderful learning journey.</p>
 
<p>However, I quickly learned that I was in a school environment where 'thinking' was given little or no value, and I struggled with the drudgery of schoolwork. Still, I believed in the value of real learning. I lived in the world of my own imagination, confident that I’d grow up to invent and create new things. At age 12, I found my savior in the form of a DEC PDP 11/34a, a mini-computer my high school had acquired through a grant program. It wasn't love at first sight. But eventually, someone showed me how to write a three-line program in BASIC. From there, it was off to the races.</p> 
 
<p>By the time I turned 14, I had founded my first business, a publishing company for games I developed. Growing it to represent 20 other independent games developers gave me a real sense that entrepreneurship can be a powerful means with which to positively influence key areas you’re passionate about. From there, it took several business ventures before finding a way to focus on what really mattered to me: improving education and developing the mind.</p>
 
<p>In 2007, I found myself leading the team at 2and2, a Sydney-based educational games company. 2and2 carved out a niche as a high-end developer of complex game-based learning and behavior change solutions. We would go on to win over 50 awards in the USA, UK, and Australia for our pioneering work.</p>
 
<p>As satisfying as it was to work in an area I deeply cared about, we encountered the same problem over and over: the solutions we created were time consuming, complex, and costly to make. And as good as they were, I thought they could be better.</p>
 
<p>In 2014, 2and2 created Koala Academy, a product targeting the Chinese market and a proof of concept for learning memory-based content. Its positive reception confirmed there was a huge opportunity to help others create more effective apps at much lower costs by offering a single, consolidated app-building platform with neuropsychologically sound feedback and engagement mechanisms at its core. This led to the birth of Cogniss.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Cogniss will change how individuals approach learning?</b><br>
<p>The rapidly growing healthtech, edutech, and behavior tech app markets consist of many quality stand-alone solutions, but few bring together all the essential features for effective tech-driven learning: neuropsychologically sound and adaptive learning, configurable rewards that drive positive behaviors, high quality games, social learning, and in-depth analytics tools.</p>

<p>Cogniss brings the best of all these worlds into a single, cost-effective platform that’s flexible enough to adapt to any complex learning or behavior change challenge. It means businesses, educators, non-profits, and other experts who lack the necessary tech know-how can now create solutions for those challenges faster, easier, and more affordably. It also means individual users can depend on the effectiveness of the learning apps they're relying on to achieve a certain goal.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The application of neuroscience and neuropsychology to learning is having, and will continue to have, a huge impact on learning. We've learned so much about how the brain processes, stores and recalls information, how understanding develops, and what really underpins individual motivation. Yet virtually none of this is being applied in the vast majority of edtech solutions. Edtech is still often relegated to cheaper and more cost effective ways of disseminating information and assessing knowledge, rather than being used to truly enhance the learning experience. We need to move beyond powering old ways of learning with technology, and instead completely rethink the process of teaching and learning.</p>
 
<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to Cogniss?</b><br>
<p>Cogniss occupies 100% of my professional focus. We’ve found so many different applications for this technology, all of which help improve people’s quality of life in some way. We’re now creating apps to help organizations improve cognition and slow brain ageing in the elderly, grow emotional intelligence in children, engage otherwise disengaged high school students, improve compliance with medications and collect data for clinical trials. That’s on top of the more obvious applications, such as STEM and literacy learning.</p>
