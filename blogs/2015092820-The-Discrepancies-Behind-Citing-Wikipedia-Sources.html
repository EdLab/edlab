<p>It is often emphasized in classrooms, from K-12 to higher ed, that Wikipedia should not be used as a primary source, but rather as a jumping off point for other research. However, its perceived reliability as a research tool varies drastically among classes, teachers, and fields. Some educators believe it's too prone to factual errors, and others counter that because of source verification standards, it hardly differs from errors in traditional print encyclopedias. Researchers in Alabama recently explored this gray area and analyzed a secondary school staff’s attitudes and research policies surrounding Wikipedia..</p>
 
<p>In building their study, the authors considered previous research showing that although librarians had positive attitudes toward personal Wikipedia use, they were more cautious when it came to research. Other studies highlighted school staff concerned with erroneous changes to articles—while 83% of librarians used Wikipedia, of those who did not, half reported it was due to unreliability. From there, the researchers conducted a survey of secondary school librarians and teachers, asking whether their school had a policy on Wikipedia, if they thought the school needed a policy, and what their overall attitude toward it was.</p>

<p>Of the 22 responses, most reported that their schools did not have a policy on Wikipedia use. Of the surveyed staff members, the responses were split relatively evenly between wanting and not wanting a policy, and between having a positive and negative attitude toward the site. Of those who had a positive attitude, they said it was "easily understood by most [middle and high school] students [and] up-to-date" and that students used it to get the basic ideas for their research, before verifying sources elsewhere. Of those with negative attitudes toward the site, some said "students are using Wikipedia without knowing the validity of the source" and "students rely on it too heavily and do not expand their research to prove or disprove their findings."</p>
 
<p>The researchers also focused on whether secondary school staff members were aware of Wikipedia’s Page Assessment Guide, which is a ranking system available to anyone with a login. Prior research had indicated that this guide was not being used by librarians, and in this study none of the 17 teachers had experience using it. The authors suggested that training educators on the Page Assessment Guide and teaching students about properly vetting sources are important steps in clarifying the role of Wikipedia in research. They emphasized that restricting students from using Wikipedia is not the most effective way to ensure both comprehensive research and source validity. Instead, ensuring that students can judge the credibility of information will come from integrating information literacy skills with curriculum in the classroom, particularly in an age where digital resources continue to expand.</p>
