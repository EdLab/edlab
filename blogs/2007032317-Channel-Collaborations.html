          <p>
            Thanks to everyone who participated in yesterday's Channel Project event. I am excited to take this project into the next level of development, and as you can see, no one is more enthusiastic about the possibilities and potential than Dr. Natriello himself. The man likes his puppetry.

The next phase of this project will be building a workgroup and covering parts of the project we talked about yesterday, from development of segments to all the technology and project management aspects.

So, if you are supercharged to work on this project, there are a few things you can do. First, think of those summer plans... yeah, you know, the plans you were making for reshaping the ed sector. Start there, as the first major development push will happen between now and July. <i>(read more)</i>
<!--break-->
Second, talk to your manager. Discuss how participating in the channel project may affect ongoing work. It would be great to capitalize on everyone's interests, but of course there are better and worse ways to transition to a new project.

And finally, please help us surface potential partners for collaboration. For example, we have already begun working with outside videographers and editors on a contract basis. Who else could help? I will be knocking on doors across the street â€” to see if there are Journalism students or others who would lend critical knowledge to this effort.

But start here. Please add any comments you had on the top of your mind as you left the event yesterday. Just keep in mind that, at this point, there will probably be puppets involved... so please tune your comments accordingly.

Thanks!
