<b>Title:</b> Improving the efficiency of dialogue in tutoring<p> 

<b>Authors:</b>  Kristopher J. Kopp, M. Anne Britt, Keith Millis, Arthur C. Graesser (2012) 
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> In a recent issue of <b>Learning and Instruction</b>, Kristopher Kopp and his coauthors investigated the use of <a href=" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475211001010">natural language dialogue</a> in intelligent tutoring systems. This feature can be relatively time-consuming to develop, and the paper addresses whether and to what extent this dialogue is necessary to produce significant learning gains. Can dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems be designed to be more efficient? 
<p>

For this paper, the authors  used <a href="http://www.autotutor.org">AutoTutor</a> in two experiments investigating issues of efficiency, quality of instruction, and learning gains. All of the participants were native English-speaking undergraduate introductory psychology students. They were asked to critique the experimental designs of a variety of scientific studies. Information on the studies was presented by AutoTutor animated agents (the so-called tutors). Students were randomly assigned to either <i>full-dialogue, mixed-dialogue or no-dialogue</i> settings. In the full-dialogue setting, students are provided with the full ledger of tutoring support (pumps, hints, and prompts) from the beginning to the end of the task; in mixed-dialogue, half of the tasks are supported with the tutor function; and in no-dialogue, students simply received information from the tutor with no other interaction. <i>Efficiency</i> was measured by calculating the ratio of performance (i.e., learning gains) to effort (i.e., time-on-task).
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Overall, the results show that participants learned less in the <i>no-dialogue</i> condition than in the mixed condition, and that students using the mixed condition performed just as well as or better than those using the <i>full-dialogue</i> condition, while taking less time. It turns out that the <i>full-dialogue</i> condition produced the least efficient scores. These results showed that increasing the amount of dialogue did not necessarily lead to more learning. However, <i>some</i> dialogue is better than no dialogue at all. This study concludes that a mixed dialogue condition is the ideal default setting. This suggests that dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems can be designed in a more efficient manner to maximize learning and minimize cost in terms of time-on-task.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The study confirms that learning can be maximized with an efficient semi-dialogue-based tutoring system. Such results endorse educators’ efforts in constructing and incorporating natural dialogue within tutoring systems. Meanwhile, it invites researchers and educators to think beyond the efficiency of students’ learning to the efficiency of instructional designs. How do we capture the <i>efficiency</i> of the entire educational eco-system? What is the winning formula when combining machine and human tutors?
