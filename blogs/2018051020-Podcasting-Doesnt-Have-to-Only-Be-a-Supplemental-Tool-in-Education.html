<p>Podcasts have rapidly grown in popularity in recent years, yet this medium’s connection to education is still not fully understood, and podcasts are often seen as merely a supplemental tool for educators. In an attempt to challenge this notion, Dr. Christopher Drew of Teesside University analyzed characteristics, practices, and trends in a sample of the most popular education-related podcasts.</p>

<p>The researcher first sampled the top podcasts listed in the "Education" category from the <a href="www.podcastawards.com">Podcast Awards</a>, along with other notable series. His final sample accounted for 20 of the most popular educational-focused podcasts. This selection ranged from science podcasts like Neil deGrasse Tyson’s <a href="https://www.startalkradio.net/">StarTalk</a>, hit history podcasts such as <a href="https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Hardcore History</a>, and even some various language-learning podcasts.</p>  

<p>For these 20 podcasts, Dr. Drew analyzed the first three episodes, five random episodes, and other special episodes. He identified key trends and themes: purpose, series structure, type, participants, materials, length, and subject. Some of his findings challenge commonly held notions of podcast usage in education.</p>  

<p>Despite the contention that long podcasts should be avoided for educational use, almost all of these chart-topping podcasts ran over 30 minutes per episode. History podcasts tended to have especially long run-times, as they often offered deep, nuanced approaches to the subject. Meanwhile, shorter podcasts seemed to only provide basic, introductory information.</p> 

<p>Another common belief challenged by the findings is that podcasts are just a supplemental tool in education. On the contrary, in the study, podcasts were the central educational feature, while other worksheets, transcripts, and blogs acted as the supplemental material. The language-learning podcasts especially incorporated outside materials.</p> 

<p>While Dr. Drew admits that his sample is small and non-generalizable, he does contend that his research should begin a dialogue about the use of podcasts in educational settings. The medium is becoming far too popular and important to be dismissed as a supplemental tool. He hopes that educators will begin to think of innovative practices to incorporate podcasting into curriculum and pedagogy.</p>
