          <p>
            One of the most pleasant rewards in the world is to be able to attend school for free. Education, as we all know, is the key to success and anything that brings success is usually very costly. However, for more than a century, a private institute in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan have been rewarding its students with a free pass to success have arrived at a decision to terminate that tradition; a tradition established by the industrialist Peter Cooper, who believed that the best education should be free and accessible to students who meet the qualification criteria, regardless of their ethnicity or social economic status.

On Tuesday April 23th, 2013, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/nyregion/cooper-union-to-charge-undergraduates-tuition.html?hpw&_r=1&">Cooper Union</a> announced it was going to charge undergraduates to attend due to the institution's financial setbacks. This decision was made by the board of trustees and will go into effect in fall 2014. Unfortunately, students who have decided to apply there for fall 2014 will be very concerned, but the institution claims it will still “provide a quality education” to students who can't afford tuition. 

As a student, I can understand the difficulties and hardships that the Cooper Union students will endure, especially after receiving free education and all of the sudden, having to pay for that education. Nonetheless, the institution also need to survive in these uncertain economic times and so if charging undergraduates is the best solution, I reckon they have little choice.
