            Most schools focus on designing a curriculum that will help students reach the highest level in their education. Without a doubt subjects such as Math and  English are very helpful to the development of students at all levels of their education. However, students barely have a course that teaches them about real life situations that they are more than likely to encounter outside the classroom. There are so many real life situation that range from how students should conduct themselves outside the classroom to how they are required to behave at their future work places. This <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2012/10/09/why-most-high-schoolers-dont-know-how-to-manage-their-money">article</a> talks more about how high school students are not given the opportunity to learn more about how to use their money judiciously. Students receive a few hours of financial literacy lectures each year. The issue of whether these hour long lecture are enough comes up as part of the bigger dialogue. Only 13 states have a mandatory finance course for students as a requirement for graduation. Some states do not have any course for financial literacy at all. Parents complain about this issue but it seems there is no improvement. 
<p>
I believe educators should be trained to teach financial literacy courses in addition to the courses they have specialized in. Students will find these courses engaging when it is designed to be an online course. Since technology has become part of our society, it will be helpful to use that as a way to make students eager to see the next lesson for their "financial literacy" course. Wouldn't the world be better if we had young people who can plan their lives even before they secure a career in the future?
