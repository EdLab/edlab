<p>Nasir Qadree serves as <a href="http://vilcap.com/">Village Capital’s</a> Head of Education practice.  Village Capital is an impact investment venture capital firm that sources, trains, and invests in early stage entrepreneurs who solve global problems. Qadree is responsible for helping companies scale their businesses, connect with customers, and gain exposure to investors.</p>

<p>Qadree began his career as an Analyst at Goldman Sachs, and later worked as an Associate at State Street Corporation. He served as an Education Pioneer Fellow and Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Education at the Connecticut State Department of Education where he focused on improving digital learning and infrastructure, and creating new strategies to empower teachers and school leaders to improve persistently low performing schools. Apart from his role at Village Capital, Qadree serves on the board of Center City Public Charter School in Washington, DC. He has also committed to running 51 full marathons in each U.S. state, including DC in an effort to raise scholarship funding for first generation college students. Qadree holds a Bachelors of Science degree from Hampton University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your role at Village Capital?</b><br>
<p>At the core I knew early in my career that my passion laid at the intersection between education, entrepreneurship, and investing in bold ideas that ultimately transforms U.S. and emerging markets’ most impacted communities. Instead of diving head first like most graduates coming out of college, it was important I developed a skill set, a robust network, and committed mentors to assist me along the way. Coupled with my personal narrative, interacting with innovative solutions that are fundamentally rethinking how we envision our PreK–12 classrooms, expanding post secondary options at lower cost, and leveling the playing field in the workforce has become my life’s passion.</p>

<p>One of my favorite proverbs states, "a child without education, is like a child without wings." Our goal at Village Capital is to train and invest in high growth entrepreneurs who are solving critical global problems, specifically entrepreneurs who are not receiving the best resources, mentorship, and capital they need to scale and impact more lives and communities. It’s exciting to be at the cusp of this challenging but rewarding work.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Village Capital will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>The reality is that we face many challenges within a highly competitive world. Sadly today we still marginalize innovation. We rely on incremental investments to pull us through the short term and continue to keep putting off long term investments. The best long term investment you can make is in education. In most cases, your ROI will not happen in one or five years but it is a higher yield when you are fiscally intentional in backing creative ideas that enhance students. Based on our work within our <a href="http://vilcap.com/sector/education/">global education practice</a>, we believe that when we effectively source, train, and invest in entrepreneurs who are building solutions that enhance learning, instruction, and opportunity then our hope is that the impact will become a key driver in increasing K–12 student outcomes. More students are completing college and citizens are prepared for the competitive workforce. It is important to understand that entrepreneurs have a vision for a better way of doing things, thinking beyond the constraints of current rules and resources. Perhaps more importantly, they have the passion and sense of urgency that compels them to take the risks necessary to realize that vision. Our education entrepreneurs at Village Capital strive to build sustainable businesses to make the changes they want to see in the world and by doing so they inspire others to follow. Education Entrepreneurs are the newer seat at the table, however keeping in mind educators will also lead this work.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>Recent data indicates that by 2020, 65% of all jobs in the U.S. will require at least an Associate’s degree or some amount of postsecondary school training or certification. However, only 1 in 4 students are academically prepared for college when they graduate from high school, and less than half of recent graduates are workforce ready. Thankfully today there are companies such as <a href="https://www.nepris.com/">Nepris</a> that are connecting teachers and students with the right industry experts, which allows students to engage in meaningful instruction in relation to their career interests. Nepris is not alone as there are other high growth companies across the country such as <a href="https://www.pairin.com/">Pairin</a> and <a href="https://www.mycollegeease.com/">College Ease</a> that are pushing schools to bridge the skills gap between education and employment. </p>

<p>Additionally, the postsecondary landscape is dominated by institutions where progress is marked by hours spent in a classroom and denoted by oversimplified transcripts. At the same time, employers are increasingly not looking for pedigree and GPA but for specific skills that match their immediate needs. This divergence is leading to unemployment and underemployment as qualified individuals are not being hired because they didn’t go to the right university or individuals cannot find the right educational pathway to skills because a four-year degree is excessive to their particular situation. I fundamentally do not think this right. If we truly believe education is the passport to a high paying job, we have to invest in the right resources that prevent students from lacking the academic resources and opportunities that will position them for success.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Village Capital, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Working with entrepreneurs and analyzing global market opportunities is rewarding and a lot of fun. However, too often I have noticed you can easily lose track on what’s happening everyday in schools. To ensure I’m keeping my ear close to our work, I decided to join <a href="http://www.centercitypcs.org/">Center City Public Charter School</a>, a PreK–8 Washington DC based charter management organization as a board member. Washington, DC is the most vibrant education reform community in the country. It’s exciting to work directly with the tireless school leaders and caring parents in DC’s most underserved communities.</p>

<p>Additionally, five years ago, I decided to run 51 full marathons in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia in an effort to raise $100,000 to fund scholarships for first generation college students. Today, I have completed 16 towards my goal. I look at first generation college students and graduates as the greatest and most ambitious group of people on the face of the earth, literally climbing a ladder no one around has climbed before. We should literally take a day off and celebrate their achievements. </p>
