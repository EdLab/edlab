          <p>
            According to this <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/nyregion/suit-seeks-relief-for-trade-school-students-with-years-of-debt-but-no-diploma.html">article</a>, at one point, Wilfred American Education Corporation operated about 60 cosmetology and business trade schools. It mainly advertised in welfare offices and at bus stops in low-income neighborhoods. One of its former students, Ana Salazar, a retired security guard who lives on government assistance, feels like Wilfred Academy has abused her. The school promised her a career as a beautician but she was unable to complete her training before the school closed up shop in 1994.
<p>
She was enrolled even though she could not speak English, lacked a high school diploma and not administered a test that examined her ability to benefit from the course. These were all requirements for her to be eligible for a federal loan. Now heavily in debt ($16,000), Salazar is part of a lawsuit seeking debt relief and reimbursement from the federal government. They are arguing the federal government was aware of the illegal practices of Wilfred such as falsifying documents and eligibility for student loans. If successful, the suit could open the doors for students from other for-profit schools who are also dwelling in heavy debt with no job prospects. 

What do you think is the future of for-profit schools in light of this current controversy about their practices and lack of jobs for their graduates?
