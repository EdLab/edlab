<strong>Title:</strong> Classroom of the future : orchestrating collaborative spaces
<strong>Author:</strong> Kati Makitalo-Siegl, Jan Zottmann, Frederic Kaplan, Frank Fischer (eds.)
<strong>Publisher:</strong> Rotterdam; Boston : Sense Publishers, c2010
<strong>Call no.:</strong> LB3325.C5 C523 2010
<strong>From the Publisher:</strong> The future of the classroom is an issue that essentially concerns many of us as students, parents, taxpayers, policymakers, teachers, design professionals, or researchers. A glance at the history of pedagogical practice reveals, however, that despite rapid developments in the outside world, classrooms have evolved very little over the years. While our understanding of learning and favourable learning environments has substantially improved and technological innovations are offering a variety of new possibilities, it still seems that most of today’s schools and universities remain more or less unaffected by these developments.

This book brings together the perspectives of researchers, architects, technical designers, and teachers on emerging theoretical and technological developments pertaining to the classroom of the future.

Innovative ideas are offered on how new technologies and learning approaches can be integrated into schools. It challenges us to think of learning spaces in a new way. Classroom of the Future is of interest to researchers and students, designers and educators across various disciplines including education, cognitive, social and educational psychology, didactics, computer science and design as well as to parents and policymakers.
