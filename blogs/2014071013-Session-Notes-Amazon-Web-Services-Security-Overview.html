<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I'm here at the AWS Summit conference at the Jacob Javitz center and am taking notes from a couple of sessions. My first session was on &quot;Understanding AWS Security&quot; by Bill Murray, who's two notches down below Bezos.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize Murray's argument into a single soundbite it would be:</p>
<p>The Air Force doesn't build airplanes. Lockheed Martin does.<br />
  You guys do business, we do security.</p>
<p>Also, the most intriguing slide from the talk is included here.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/ShreddedAWSssd.JPG" alt="Post Mortem: Amazon Web Services Solid Drive Disk" name="ShreddedDisk" width="453" height="289" id="ShreddedDisk" /></p>

<p> It shows a shredded solid state drive. Murray explained that no storage ever leaves an Amazon data center alive. It must be destroyed. </p>
<p>Another cool fact was that not even Murray can enter a data center at will. Even he will need to generate a ticket and get approval from his higher ups (in his case this includes Bezos) if he wants to go visit a data center.</p>
<p>Well, here are all the nitty gritty details from the session:</p>
<H3>AWS NY Summit 2014<br />
  Understanding AWS Security<br />
  Bill Murray, Sr. Manager, AWS Security Programs</H3>
<p>Security - different views</p>
<p>CEO - shareholder value<br />
  CIO - customer's info security <br />
  PR - keep company out of the news!!!!!</p>
<p>Security is a SHARED responsibility. Infrastructure + Application must BOTH be secure. AWS takes care of MOST of the security need.</p>
<p>AWS Logo: building blocks. This applies to security as well.</p>
<p>Customer Plug: “Based on our experience, I believe that we can be even more secure in AWS cloud thatn in our own data centers” Tom Soderstrom - CTO - NASA JPL</p>
<p>AWS Offers: more: Visibility, Audibility ,Control<br />
  Along 4 dimensions of security: Network, Physical, People, Data</p>
<p>VISIBILITY: <br />
  Can you map your network? <br />
  AWS Control Panel: lets you know whats running, where it's running, who's running it, etc.<br />
  Trusted Advisor: Cost Optimization, Security suggestions such as &quot;do you really want to keep port 80 open&quot;, Fault Tolerance, Performance</p>
<p>AUDIBILITY:<br />
  Audited a ton of different ways a ton of different ways: HIPAA, ISO 27,001, ITAR, FIPS, FISMA, etc. Fed is very anal (sic) about protecting data.</p>
<p>Security Control Objectives:<br />
  1. Security Organization<br />
  2. Amazon User Access<br />
  3. Logical Security<br />
  4. Secure Data Handling<br />
  5. Physical Security and Environmental Safeguards<br />
  6. Change Management<br />
  7. Data Integrity, Availability and Redundancy<br />
  8. Incident Handling</p>
<p>AWS CLOUDTRAIL - logs every API call made by person or machine. Who does what, when why? Records API calls and delivers to a log file on S3, every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>LOGS: Obtained, Retained, Analyzed</p>
<p>There are dozens of 3rd party providers that analyze amazon logs</p>
<p>Amazon Glacier - $.01 per gig per month. A service to hold on to data FOREVER.</p>
<p>CONTROL: various levels of security, down to the physical byte.</p>
<p>Everybody is on an equal footing security wise. From a huge corporation, to a small startup to a single college student -all have access to same services.<br />
  Can do VPN across various AWS services, or have direct pipes NEVER going through external non-AWS internet.</p>
<p>LEAST PRIVILEGE PRINCIPLE. Separate networks for corp. vs. customer data. (CORP vs. PRIV). Ticketing system implements this. Only get access for specific reasons.<br />
  Even Murray can't enter a data center!!!! He needs a ticket approved by Bezos!!!!</p>
<p>SIMPLE SECURITY CONTROLS. e.g. no storage media leaves data center in tact!!! Whenever drive comes out it's shredded (cf. photo of shredded solid state drive).</p>
<p>Granular: Bob can only access this data, from his desktop, from 9am to 5pm.</p>
<p>Can use hard tokens or soft tokens.</p>
<p>Can ensure that certain machines can't talk to others.</p>
<p>Amazon DynamoDB: Fine Grained Access Control. Can encrypt data at the granularity of a single data cell.</p>
<p>MFA DELETE PROTECTION: </p>
<p>Data stays WHERE you put it. 10 regions - 26 availability zones (AZ)- 51 edge locations: content delivery networks (CDN).</p>
<p>Cloudfront CDN (Edge locations).</p>
<p>USE MULTIPLE AZs. Default, data goes into 3 AZs ensuring 3 good copies at all times. AWS constantly queries the md5, looks back to the last non-corrupted state and uses that. that's where you get 11 9's of durability (lose data once in 10,000 years).</p>
<p>DATA ENCRYPTION<br />
  Choice: Automated - managed by AWS, Enabled - user manages w/ AWS,  Client-side - totally controlled by the users meaning that AWS wouldn't even be able to see the data if they wanted to.</p>
<p>AWS CloudHSM (Hardware Security Modules) - he's very proud of it - This is a box that if you attempt open, if you loosen a screw, if you do anything, the data is automatically zeroed!!!!! This was created to make insider threat negligible.</p>
<p>ENCRYPT YOUR DATA - server side encryption: glacier, redsift, RDS</p>
<p>60% of organization agrees that CSPs provide better security than they do.</p>
<p>AWS Marketplace Security Solutions - entire environment that will help you do security.</p>
