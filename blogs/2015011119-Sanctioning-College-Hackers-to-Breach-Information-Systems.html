Cyberthreats are serious business, with big names like Target, Apple's iCloud, and Sony falling prey to big time data breaches. But anyone and everyone is at risk! Seizing an opportunity, Carnegie Mellon University is training a hard line of defense against these attacks through inventive course programming. <p>

Armed with know how that could take down a government (or at least a CVS), students set out to find security vulnerabilities in real systems over the course of a semester. They are actually required to hack into systems as part of their grade. These students are among the best in the world at what they do. Case in point: the CMU hacking team,<a href="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/">Plaid Parliament of Pwning</a>, has won numerous Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. CTF is a computer security competition that allows participants to practice attacking and defending computers and networks. <p>

The above video brings up a provocative scenario that Iâ€™ll present for your debating pleasure here: This course (and others like it) is designed to develop young people into expert hackers. What if these students choose to use their newfound powers for evil over good? Is it a risk we take in offering these learning opportunities? Add your thoughts to the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/18427">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@02:34 Clark:</b> Everything in this field is so new that they don't have a textbook; there's just no way to keep up with relevant info using an archaic medium.<p>

<b>@04:28 Carla:</b> I presume that the winners of these competitions are highly sought after in the field of cybersecurity. In fact, it seems these competitions are a great way to keep your skills sharp; do people do these competitions for PD ever?
