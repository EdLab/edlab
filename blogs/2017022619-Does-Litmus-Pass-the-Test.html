<p><a href="http://www.projectlitmus.com/">Litmus</a> is a free app, available in both the Apple and Google Play stores. It offers a choice of three different tutoring characters to assist students line-by-line as they work through math problems. The tutoring agents provide contextual information and hints, allowing students to see where they may have gone wrong in problem solving. Once learners have selected a tutor, they can choose to have the character help them study, help with homework, or join a class.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The app offers features for both students and teachers, which could make it easy to use in the classroom. Learners can solve problems directly in the app as though they would in a notebook. Additionally, Litmus allows learners to solve problems using the methods they learned in the classroom without requiring them to use alternative formatting.</p>

<p>Litmus aims to help teachers save time when correcting student work as the app evaluates problem sets. The app also provides insights into student performance, which would presumably help teachers adjust their instructional methods.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Litmus could duplicate the workload of students if their teacher isnâ€™t also using the app, as they would need to finish their homework on both paper and in the app. Homework help within Litmus resembles a calculator with students inputting information set-by-step, which might distract from understanding how each step contributes to solving a given problem as a whole. Finally, students who become over-reliant on the app might struggle when the scaffolding provided is removed such as during assessments.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Though this app could help struggling students break math problems into manageable steps, it also assumes that students have a minimum level of technical proficiency to complete their problems on a device. Tutoring systems are not necessarily novel, but the workbook approach is an interesting way to help students step-by-step.</p>
