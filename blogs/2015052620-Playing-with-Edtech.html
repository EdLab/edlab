<p>How do experiences with technology influence pre-service teachers? The results of a recent study show that technology field experiences before and during teacher education programs could have long-term positive impacts on the participating teachers' willingness to integrate technology into their future classrooms. These findings suggest that schools of education should work to identify and foster a technology orientation in candidates and provide opportunities for technology field experiences long before the formal student teaching and practicum that most programs require.</p>

<p>In the study, 84 undergraduate teacher candidates enrolled in the universityâ€™s educational program observed and then participated in a technology club at a local school. The participants were then given a survey to gauge the impact of this experience on their perceptions of teaching. The survey found several positive impacts of this early field experience, including increased comfort with the role of technology in the classroom and a better understanding of the role of teachers in supporting classroom technology. The experience also reinforced participants' desire to become teachers and made them feel more confident in their ability to be effective student teachers and classroom teachers.</p>

<p>Most other research studies in this area have focused on technology integration in teacher education classrooms rather than university-sponsored external field experiences. Most teacher education programs, especially those aimed at undergraduates, do not support these early field experiences and only have one designated technology class that is didactic rather than hands-on.</p>

<p>Based on the outcomes of the study, the author suggests that it's very difficult for pre-service teachers to learn how to use technology effectively from classroom study, rather they must learn through experience. Moreover, teacher education programs must encourage students to foster their own relationships with technology through experimentation in order to be effective supporters of technology in their classrooms. Field experiences are one way to accomplish this, but the integration of technology into every aspect of teacher education, from candidate selection through curriculum, is also necessary for producing educators ready for tomorrow's digital classrooms.</p>
