            Is this <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/05/if-supermarkets-were-like-public.html">analogy</a> Greg Mankiw claims to be thought-provoking really all that provocative? Normally he does post thought-provoking stuff, but someone ought to have called him out for this rather stupid post.

It seems rather silly to compare food to education when it seems clear as day that we're really good at producing food but not so much at education (we can sufficiently feed everyone, we can't sufficiently educate everyone). Food is a limited vehicle for social mobility in society's eyes, education isn't. But probably the easiest point to make in all of this is that food stamps exist! Let's think about this...if we had education "stamps" that amounted to the poor money they could only spend on private education...that would be vouchers! This is precisely why the analogy is so mind-numbing. If education was like food, vouchers would work, but, as most serious people should realize, the empirical evidence reveals no such finding about vouchers in education. We tend to forget that private education creates very little value-added beyond its ability to signal and offer better peer quality. Take those away, and the problem of public education becomes one of education in general. The problems in education are difficult; I wish they were not trivialized with inane analogies.
