<p><a href="https://www.lessoncast.com/">Lessoncast</a> is taking teacher preparation and professional development to the next level. A lessoncast is a short, 3-minute multimedia presentation, created by teachers for teachers. With a suite of easy-to-use tools and resources, users are guided through the process of creating interactive and engaging lessoncasts. In terms of teacher preparation, new instructors can now access clear and concise explanations of ideas and objectives, based on the advice and experience of senior teachers. A lessoncast can also be a great tool for teacher professional development, as it allows for easy collaboration between users. It can be used to demonstrate best practices and to showcase effective teaching strategies for specific areas.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The biggest advantage of a lessoncast is its short length. Limiting each clip to just 3 minutes ensures that teachers are engaged and focused while absorbing the material prepared by their peers. Viewers can easily grasp the important takeaways regarding specific topic areas and teaching techniques without excess information. Tools are available to help instructors establish clear learning expectations. Instructors can also attach a transcript of their recorded lesson, as well as supplementary resources that can be downloaded by viewers. Alongside each lessoncast, there is a space for comments, questions, and feedback from other users. If an instructor were to share their lessoncast with their students, rather than other teachers, they could also insert an assessment area.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>When it comes to teacher preparation, many new instructors may still prefer to observe seasoned teachers in a classroom setting. While Lessoncast is a great additional resource, it cannot replace the traditional aspects and methods of teacher preparation. Additionally, Lessoncast requires the active participation of expert teachers to develop multimedia presentations. Instructors must devote the time to prepare these resources and share their techniques and best practices.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>While Lessoncast is currently being marketed for teacher preparation and professional development, there is certainly the potential for use with students as well. The ease of preparation and customization of lessoncasts allows for flexibility in a variety of settings and subject areas. While there is standardization of length and the tools that are available to develop these recordings, the scope of the lesson is completely up to the instructor. If used in a classroom setting, Lessoncast can offer guidance on how to align the lesson with the applicable Common Core learning standards for that topic.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Lessoncasts are great bite-sized resources for teacher preparation and professional development.</p>
