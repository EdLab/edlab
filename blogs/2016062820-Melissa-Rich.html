<p>Melissa Rich was most recently CEO of InterSchola, a company that sells unused school equipment in eBay-style auctions. She first became involved in education when she was at Intel Capital, a division of Intel that makes investments in technology innovations. There she led the company’s successful investment in Classroom Connect, a platform that offers professional development programs and online instructional materials to K–12 school districts. Rich is a graduate of Dartmouth College and earned an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.</p>
<p><b>How have your education and professional experiences shaped your current work?</b><br>
<p>I first became involved in education when I was working in venture capital for the Intel Corporation. My initial area of investment focus was web-enabling technologies and media. At the time, Intel was also making investments in the education technology sector. One of my colleagues who was looking at the edtech space was heading on maternity leave, so I raised my hand and asked if I could cover. I knew nothing about the edtech space but it had always interested me because as a student growing up, I found school very easy and I enjoyed it.</p> 

<p>My brother had dyslexia and really struggled in school. He started using a RadioShack handheld computer to take notes in the classroom when he was in middle school when nothing else worked. He also started programming games for these same handheld computers at the same time. By high school, he was not only being written up in computer magazines, but he was getting articles that he wrote as a dyslexic writer published in the same magazines. He was also selling the games he developed through a business he created in high school. Meanwhile, despite all of this success, he was failing his math and computer tests in high school and in college. I found it interesting that something like technology could be so helpful to him in demonstrating his ability to learn and thrive.</p>

<p>Therefore, education has been an interest of mine. I finally had the opportunity to look at edtech from an investment perspective back in the late 1990s and that introduced me to the education sector from a business perspective.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way we learn?</b><br>
<p>I invested in some edtech companies when I was at Intel. I eventually jumped over and joined one of the companies I had invested in on behalf of Intel, Classroom Connect. That company, as well as several of my previous investments in the edtech space, all involved classroom learning and teacher professional development. It was an online curriculum that directly impacted students. When I started InterSchola, we targeted the district level, administration and the elements that make school districts operate. Our initial work was not immediately impacting the students. It was the other side of education, not the teacher side, not the professional development side, and not the student side. I struggled with this as I wanted to impact education and my company was more focused on operations.</p>
 
<p>We discovered that so much of the assets school districts had were being unused: school supplies like computers, textbooks, and desks, and asset categories like food service equipment, maintenance equipment, and even vehicles. I thought if one school district is throwing them away, what if we could get those same items into the hands of a school district or school that needed them. As it turned out, most of InterSchola's business was not necessarily school to school, it was assets being sold from a school but the buying community was more along the lines of mom and pop businesses, other nonprofits, and individuals for non classroom specific items. The initial idea was richer schools would give to needier schools, and it ended up being a nice revenue stream. Sales revenue could be applied to the general fund for school districts, which is not earmarked for anything specific and therefore school districts could choose how to spend it. It was flexible dollars that each district could use to impact their students the way they wanted.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>It took me closing down InterSchola to lift my head up and recognize how the education landscape had changed in the decade I was running it. When I started the company, I had just left venture capital investing in edtech companies where there was very little money invested in new solutions for education. Education was still about philanthropy and was not deemed an investable space. Shortly after I closed InterSchola, I started reading about trends in education and all of a sudden, in 2014 and 2015, all these cool innovative and interesting ideas, companies, and products were introduced to the market and funded like I've never seen before. For example, AltSchool, a private school network, raised $135 million in eight months. During my investment days, no company received $135 million over eight years much less eight months. I really think rapid investment of venture capitalists an interesting trend that is going to impact education as a whole. I also hope this will translate into more innovative solutions for education.</p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I just started having discussions with a small group of people about what I think is a very interesting idea in education. It is not a specific product as much as it is a service that will allow the education industry to learn about and realize valuable tools, technology, and products that could impact their students going forward and make it easier for school districts to engage in change.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on social media?</b><br>
<p>I follow more organizations than people on Facebook and LinkedIn and a bit on Twitter. I am interested to see what education organizations like ThinkItUp and Project XQ are doing. It's interesting to see some of the old school edtech folks still involved and some of the newer folks interested in and funding education products, solutions, and services! I also follow a lot of social impact and social entrepreneur groups such as the LinkedIn Impact Entrepreneur group.</p>
