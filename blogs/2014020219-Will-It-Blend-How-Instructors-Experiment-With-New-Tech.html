<p><b>Title:</b> Using an adapted, task-level technology acceptance model to explain why instructors in higher education intend to use some learning management system tools more than others (2013)</p>

<p><b>Author:</b> Judith Schoonenboom</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513002790#">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> 
For all the emphasis education technology advocates place on implementing blended learning programs, less attention is afforded to understanding what makes learning management systems useful to educators. A recent study from the Netherlands evaluated the factors that affect instructors’ decisions to select different learning management systems. By applying an information systems theory to explain the process of technology acceptance, the author examined the influence of instructional tasks, learning tools, and user interfaces on the selection of popular learning management systems.</p>

<p>Online survey questions given to 180 higher education instructors at The University of Amsterdam used a Likert scale to evaluate their experiences with systems such as Blackboard, Adobe Connect, Turnitin, and SharePoint for administering tasks like self-tests, student discussions, collaborative writing, peer feedback, and meetings. Questions probed educators’ thought processes as they chose whether or not to assign a task, adopt a program, and incorporate student discussion and feedback. The results provided insight into how some instructors approach these technology choices.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> 
Overall, the survey confirmed the hypothesis that technology acceptance is influenced by several factors, including the nature of the task, the context in which it occurs, and the interface used to execute it. It simultaneously raised pedagogical questions about the significance some professors placed on instructional tasks.</p>

<p>Responses revealed that at the very least, instructors used online tools to transfer information to students (e.g., posting presentation slides on Blackboard). More interactive uses were determined by the perceived usability and practicality of specific tools within a learning management system, and not necessarily the platform as a whole. Tasks that could potentially benefit from the use of digital platforms included administering self-assessments and collecting student feedback during meetings. Existing platforms were not found to be conducive to tasks like organizing meetings (the technology was considered too difficult and impractical) and holding office hours (instructors did not view this as an important task).</p>


<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> 
This study confirms previous research that has shown learning management systems are most frequently used for the distribution of materials rather than as a means of discussion or assessment. Understanding educators’ approaches to these systems will inform the development of more effective blended learning programs and provide better technical and pedagogical support for teachers.</p>
