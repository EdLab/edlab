            <b>"Experience Points" in lieu of grades</b>

A professor at Indiana University has established a system of gaining experience points (XP) instead of traditional grades. 

Professor Lee Sheldon, an accomplished screenwriter and game writer, now teaches game design courses at Indiana University's Department of Telecommunications. Just last year, he taught two of his classes with a system that resembles the popular online game World of Warcraft in which experience points are earned to track progress:

<blockquote>
Students commenced the program as avatars at level one, which corresponded to zero XP and a grade of 'F'. They gained XP by completing 'quests', 'fighting monsters' and 'crafting'-- in other words, giving presentations, sitting quizzes and exams, and handing in projects.

[Students] were also grouped into 'guilds' and had to complete quests solo, as guilds, or as 'pick up groups' with members of other guilds.
</blockquote>

(<a href=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/031810-game-design-professor-beta-tests.html>More</a> on how his syllabus is designed)

According to <a href=http://www.itnews.com.au/News/169862,employers-look-to-gaming-to-motivate-staff.aspx>ITNews</a>, professor Sheldon said that his university colleagues had questioned the applicability of this system to non-game related, "regular," classes. His response?

"What they are missing is that we are teaching the gamer, social networking generation...I have no doubt the students will respond positively to any number of non-game-related classes taught in a similar manner."

XP points have not yet threatened any GPA system, but I think it's worth giving it a try. Maybe starting with our own T&L Network courses?
