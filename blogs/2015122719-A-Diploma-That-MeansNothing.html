http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/us/as-graduation-rates-rise-experts-fear-standards-have-fallen.html?ref=education&_r=0&module=ArrowsNav&contentCollection=U.S.&action=keypress&region=FixedLeft&pgtype=article">high school graduation</a> rate could be a negative thing? Since the President Obama came in power, graduation rates have increased to about 82 percent. Student are finishing high school now, however, it does not mean they are ready for college and the real world. According to college entrance exams, although the number of high school graduates is increasing, only one out of ten students are truly ready for college. Major organizations such as Boeing, Volvo, and BMW lament the lack of skilled college graduates who can work for them.
 
The organizations argue that although students are graduating, they are not learning essential skills such as collaboration and communication; skills needed to succeed in today’s workplace. One of the major problems is that schools are teaching to the test and not testing skills that will be helpful to students in the long term. As a result, test creators are even considering making the test harder.
 
I don’t think they are addressing the true problem by making exams more difficult. The true problem is teaching the right type of material in schools. Schools seem satisfied with just teaching materials that help students graduate. The focus should be on offering classes that emulates or teaches real life skills that will enable them to be successful in college and beyond.
