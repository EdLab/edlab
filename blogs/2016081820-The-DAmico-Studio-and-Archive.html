There are different ways to see a room. As a static space, a room, a home or an art studio can look like a collection of objects and furniture arranged in a space. As a space for movement, a room has energy and direction. You enter through somewhere, have an experience, and then exit the space.</p>

<p>Moving efficiently through space was very important to the late Victor D'Amico, founding director of education at the Museum of Modern Art for over 30 years. He designed his home and his studio to be places for forward movement: multiple doors in each room so one could always be moving forward through new paths, and never going backwards. After working in stage and theater design as a young man in the 1920's, he took his skill for rapidly preparing and re-organizing sets to his career in art education in New York City. In the 1950's, he and his wife, Mabel, who was a high school art teacher, constructed a summer home on eastern Long Island, where they eventually retired. Under D'Amico's direction, the Museum of Modern Art had sponsored summer painting classes in East Hampton, but Victor dreamed of creating a permanent natural setting for teachers and students to come together and create art. He purchased and transformed an old navy barge into an art studio near his home, establishing the The Victor D'Amico Art Institute in 1960.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25754/"> episode of Seen in NY explored The Art Barge</a>, which is something of an oasis for painting and experiential education tucked away in Napeague Harbor. But to truly understand The Art Barge and Victor D'Amico's philosophy of art education, one has to see and experience his home, which was just a few minutes away from the barge, and equally paradisiacal. It too lives on as a fascinating, peculiar archive of their lifeâ€™s work, open to the public. Both the barge and the D'Amico home are cared for by Christopher Kohan, who grew up next door to the D'Amico's and from the time he was a teenager, became their lifelong friend and supporter. Today, Kohan continues to live just across the street, taking daily visits to the D'Amico's home, which, despite the absence of its owners, continues to be a living, breathing space of movement and philosophy.</p>
