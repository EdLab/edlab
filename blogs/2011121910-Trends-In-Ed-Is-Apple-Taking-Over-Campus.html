Today, I was reading a forum of people talking about how <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/19/2646066/does-apple-dominate-your-campus">Apple dominates today's college campus</a>. It reminded me of a previous EdLab seminar where the guest speaker looked around the room and exclaimed: "Wow, there's not a single person in here who isn't using a Macbook. Amazing." 

And it made me think if Apple is really taking over college campuses and if so, why? 

Well, when I was starting out college, Apple was hosting their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ZUBWOrCL8">Back-to-School sale</a> where each student received a free iPod nano and a free HP printer with their Macbook purchase. That was probably a pretty smart move on their front, targeting college students, but other computer companies were also having these types of sales too. It worked so successfully for Apple, not necessarily because the laptop was coveted by students, but the iPod nano that came with it. Even just 5 years ago, the Macbook wasn't all that popular just yet, but the iPod was selling like crazy. It just made sense to associate one hit product with another. 

Along the same lines, the company seems to have won campuses over mainly because of their proven record of excellence.

<i>"There has to be a reason for Mac computers dominating college campuses nationwide, with 70 percent of incoming students adopting the platform over a PC. It defies logic. Stereotypically cash-strapped students flocked to a laptop line whose products start at $1,000. But, in what is now typical Apple fashion, their computers "just work," and for a student not majoring in information technology, that makes all the difference in the world."</i> (Source: <a href="http://www.dailygamecock.com/news/item/1800-steve-jobs-legacy-crucial-to-apples-success-technical-innovation">The Daily Gamecock.</a>)

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Does this mean that educators should work with the assumption that every college student will have an Apple product? Of course not. This is especially true in multinational college classes with a lot of international students, where in their home countries, Apple products (even iPods) are nowhere near as common as it is in America. Also, I hope this Apple-fad doesn't turn into a bad education fashion trend. One of my biggest pet peeves is when I see iPads in kindergarten classrooms JUST for the sake of having iPads in the classrooms. When the school splurges on the product just to stay "on trend" without knowing how to properly utilize it to supplement a student's education, you end up with a 5-year old with a very expensive coloring book.
