          <p>
            Earlier this month, part of the EdLab's Development and Research Group (Ching-fu Lan, Jessica Blum, and I) started to brainstorm how to develop a website that can connect all the academic resources at Teachers College, which can help graduate students gather TC material on their interested topics and further provide opportunities to bring efficient learning experiences. Compared with Harvard's <a href="http://www.uknow.gse.harvard.edu/">Usable Knowledge</a>, we aim to design a website which will provide richer academic resources  as well as further offer adaptive learning options (possibly including credits programs)for graduate students.

To get a fuller understanding of what digital resources are available before thinking about the design, we looked at three selected topics (i.e., media literacy, democratic education, and social action), and have found a set of rich resources for each topic. The resources include video products from AfterEd TV, faculties' works, related TC classes, publications from TCR and TC Press, resources from PK and TC dissertations database, as well as related research projects from TC research centers and labs.

At this stage, we are thinking about the possible interfaces for all the potential academic topics, related learning tools, and possible overlapping with the EdLab program.

Each of us is trying to contribute different prototype designs and functions for the website.

My personal (rough) idea is to create a widgets-based website (like <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> and <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a>) through which (1)<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tingyuan1999/EdLabTCAssetsProject#5296888774528482690">Content around each topic</a> can be flexibly organized through widget; (2)students can make their own <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/tingyuan1999/EdLabTCAssetsProject#5296888840805271714">personalized page</a> based on their academic interests; (3) new widgets of topics can be published collaboratively by either EdLab or students but reviewed and approved by the EdLab in advance. Other thoughts for the widgets-based topics include giving students guiding links about how to do research in this area (I have attached a draft proposal for your reference).

We need your thoughts for the prototype design and ideas on how to direct students towards their interested topics through a journey we create. The journey might be a self-adaptive learning experience, might also be a game, a participating design process, a certificate-granted course, or any other great ideas you may have in mind!
