<p><i>"Our work is critical at a time when educators, parents, students, and employers increasingly recognize the value of SEL. Together, we are united in our call for schools to educate the whole child, equipping students for success in school and in life."</i> (<a href="https://casel.org/about-2/">About CASEL</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Creating a New Framework for Learning </b></p>

<p><a href="https://casel.org/">Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL)</a> is an organization that aims to advance the science, practice, and policy related to social and emotional learning (SEL). The founders created the organization in 1994 as a response to what they saw as ineffective and uncoordinated school programming that didnâ€™t get to the heart of what students needed. CASEL developed a framework that defines SEL across five dimensions: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making. Through their efforts to advance this framework, SEL has gained wider acceptance and adoption in education. </p>

<p><b>Advocating for Change </b></p>
 
<p>Today, they engage in various efforts that highlight the benefits of integrating SEL in schools. Spearheading research is a key priority. For example, in their 2017 meta-analysis, they found that students exposed to an SEL intervention had higher academic performance 3.5 years later than non-SEL students. They also share lessons learned from their experiences partnering with 20 school districts across the United States to systematically implement high-quality SEL. In terms of policy, they advocate at the federal and state level for increases in funding and support for SEL efforts. </p>
 
<p>As a result of these efforts, CASEL continues to be one of the leading organizations in the growing SEL space.</p>
