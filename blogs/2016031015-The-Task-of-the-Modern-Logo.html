            Fast Company published an article today entitled: <em><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3056993/the-precarious-state-of-logo-design/2">The Precarious State of Logo Design</a></em>. It touches on the vicious critical response to the new <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/the-met-explains-its-controversial-new-logo/">Met Logo</a> and the increasingly impossible task of the modern logo to fulfill all of the necessarily needs across the spectrum of platforms we now use every day.
<blockquote>"In the past, logos only had to look good in print. Today, brands exist on dozens of platforms, many of which are very small, like smartphones. This logistical challenge has limited what designers can do. Sixty years ago, the Met probably only needed to emblazon its logo on signs, admission buttons, and printed ephemera. Today, its logo is on mobile apps, the favicon on desktop web-browsing tabs, Twitter avatars, and elsewhere. Efficiency matters more than flourish, adaptability more than cleverness. One has to wonder if the FedEx logo, with its sly arrow hidden in the word mark, would be invented nowadays, at a time when logos have to be legible on screens as small as a watch face."</blockquote>
EdLab Design is in the exciting process of creating ideas for a logo for the Learning Theater, and potentially a new graphic style that could encompass the Gottesman Library signage in the future. There are so many great ideas and directions in play and when we have settled on a winner I will share some of the paths and wisdom the design team experienced along the way (not to mention a huge collection of sketches!).

As the design team and I continue to develop approaches for logo designs for the Learning Theater we are trying to take all of these contexts and frustrations into account. Not to mention trying to embody the graphic character traits of the continually changing entity of the LT, which according to an <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3056130/evidence/why-the-shape-of-a-companys-logo-matters?utm_source=mailchimp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=codesign-weekly&amp;position=2&amp;partner=newsletter&amp;campaign_date=02022016">earlier Fast Company </a>article can make an enormous difference to audience sentiment.

Amitava Chattopadhyay,  professor of marketing at INSEAD writes:
<blockquote>"From a marketer’s point of view, every cue—whether it’s the scent, color, taste, shape—all of this is explicitly engineered," he says, "That’s because we know that those perceptual cues affect people’s behavior."

"When companies are designing their logos, they should be thoughtful about making these associations fit with the associations they want for their brand,"</blockquote>
Studies also suggest that small design decisions do make a difference in the way that an audience interprets the message of a company, not to mention the trends in color, type and complexity that change over the life of a company, and thus over the lifespan of a logo.

Even the seemingly <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ubiquitous&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">ubiquitous</a> <a href="http://www.famouslogos.us/ibm-logo/">Apple logo has evolved over time</a>, as has it's classic competitor (and now partner) <a href="http://www.famouslogos.us/ibm-logo/">IBM</a>.

It's amazing even with all of these <a href="http://warrington.ufl.edu/departments/mkt/docs/janiszewski/BrandLogo.pdf">studies</a> and changing parameters that so many of our decisions have come from the gut. We know what we like when we see it, and the directions that we have taken so far have evolved naturally from one another- not necessarily from an attempt to check every box or conform seamlessly to every need.

This process, and, I suspect the final logo decision, will hopefully resemble the Learning Theater itself: it will be open and adaptable, a symbol of what we aspire to and catalyst for innovation to come.
