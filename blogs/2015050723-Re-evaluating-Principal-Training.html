            Leadership is central to the success of any organization, institution and industry. This is especially true in education. However, it seems principals have often been overlooked in recent policy discussions and changes. This might be due to several factors. First, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/opinion/want-reform-principals-matter-too.html?ref=topics" target = "blank">most training and professional development</a> for principals are not strong enough to build strong schools. Most of the candidates for principal trainings are often teachers looking for an increase in salary.  It seems very few are passionate about being principals. This has caused a decrease in the number of years principals stay at a specific school. In the past, principals stayed at a school for an average five to seven years. Now, they stay an average of three to four years. This proves that the training is not effective enough to teach them the skills they will need on the job.
 
The trainings should emphasize should how to improve teaching and student learning during principal trainings. Also, the curriculum for the principal training should be more challenging so that it can be more effective.  What are some activities and workshops that can effectively train principals to prepare for the rigors of their job?
