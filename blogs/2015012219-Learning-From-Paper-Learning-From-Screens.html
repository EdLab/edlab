<p>Tablets and computers are ubiquitous items in today’s society, but how well do these technologies support reading comprehension and retention? Do they truly get the message across? A group of researchers from Beijing Normal University attempted to measure the comprehension levels of students across three popular media: computers, tablets, and paper. The goal of this experiment was to determine if there are any differences in reading comprehension across platforms, and, more specifically, if tablet reading is affected by one’s familiarity with the platform. As technology pushes forward, the popularity of computer-based reading is likely to continue its exponential growth. Therefore, it is crucial that researchers explore potential implications for this medium’s continued use. </p>

<p>Researchers enlisted the help of 90 second-year college students, aged 20-23 years old, from a university in Beijing. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of three groups (computer, tablet, and paper) and required to read four texts chosen from a standardized Chinese exam. Each medium presented the texts in exactly the same layout and used the same font, font size, color, and line spacing. Students answered two types of questions relating to the reading passages: multiple-choice, which measured shallow level comprehension, and summarization, which measured deep level comprehension. All answers were recorded with paper and pencil.</p>

<p>Results revealed a significant difference in multiple-choice scores across media, with the paper group performing better than the tablet and computer groups; no significant differences were found in scores regarding summarization answers. However, in the tablet group it was discovered that those who were more familiar with tablets performed better on summarization questions than those with medium or low familiarity. Overall, this study concluded that tablet users generally scored higher than computer users but lower than paper users on shallow and deep level questions.</p>

<p>These results call it into question the efficacy of tablet and computer use for reading comprehension. Is technology advancing faster than learners can adapt? Are other factors at play, like eye fatigue and glare, which impact "screen" based learning? Are some subjects easier to comprehend on a digital device? Further research on this topic will likely influence future designs and learning landscapes.</p>
