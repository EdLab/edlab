Jahrestagung der Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Informatik,Informatik</em>, 41-50</a>.</strong>

Spatial cognition includes acquisition, organization, use and revision of knowledge about spatial environments. It is important to know how people represent and process spatial knowledge and the theoretical issues involved. The German Priority Program focus on (1) basic concepts and processes on spatial cognition; (2) spatial representation and higher cognitive processes like how is spatial knowledge acquired, e.g. how is landmark knowledge transformed into route knowledge and into survey knowledge?; (3) spatial representation and action; and (4) spatial representation and language. 

<b>Landmark, Route, and Survey Knowledge</b>
Difference between landmark, route, and survey knowledge of an environment: 
Landmarks: unique objects at fixed locations
Routes: correspond to fixed sequences of locations as experienced in traversing a route
Survey knowledge: abstract from specific sequences and integrates knowledge from different experiences into a single model. <br>

<b>A Taxonomy of Spatial Knowledge in Navigation Tasks</b>
- Hierarchical taxonomy of spatial knowledge based on navigational behavior
- In tactical navigation, a route consists of a sequence of navigation steps
- Strategic navigation includes planning 

<b>Acquisition of Route Knowledge</b>
1. Exposure to a route without additional information on the context or surroundings merely leads to a series of connections between a configuration of points. In this simple form of a route, the surroundings are irrelevant. A more elaborate from of route knowledge might result by resorting to schemata.<p> 
2. Route knowledge is also gained if one becomes familiar with the context of the surroundings. When following a familiar path, one can look right and left and notice that there is a small park at the corner, or that a road runs parallel to the path followed. Having followed a route may also entail having stood at a junction, and making a decision to go either right or left or straight ahead. The junction then becomes a decision point.<p> 
3. Another way to acquire route knowledge consists of combining parts of two or more known routes into a new route.<p>
4. Route knowledge can be acquired by use of a street map.<p>

In respect to spatial knowledge, a lot of places and objects around us will be labeled route marks in contrast to distant landmarks. To know which of these are mentally represented, the tasks that people perform regarding these entities have to be evaluated. Then route can be viewed as a sequence of objects or events. Sequences can either be continuous or discrete.

Route knowledge begins in field perspective. It requires that one can find the way from an arbitrary point on a route to another point further away on the route. Route knowledge can be elaborated by using operations of inversion or by recoding of field perspective to observer perspective. 

Three different kinds of routes in route knowledge
1) the original route which was not elaborated and is in field perspective
2) a route which was inverted and is also in field perspective
3) a route which was recoded and is now in observer perspective
--> it may even  be possible to estimate route distances from the number of route marks mentioned. Given route knowledge, it should be possible to find the way to a destination, and, after elaboration, to find the way back. It should also be possible to give judgments of direction on the route and estimates of distance. 

Survey knowledge should enable a person to find new ways. <p>

<b>Spatial Reference System</b>
In route knowledge: (a) information is accessed sequentially as an ordered list of different locations, (b) the number of paths emanating from each location is small, and (c) an egocentric reference system is used to decide where to go from a given location

In survey knowledge, route are integrated and represented with fast and route-independent access to individual locations. It enables the inference of spatial relationships between arbitrary pairs of locations and it is organized in a global, often allocentric coordinate system. 

- Classification of spatial representations
sequential vs. random access to spatial information
egocentric vs. allocentric reference system
single global vs. multiple local reference systems
	
<strong>EdLab Connection</strong>
Since we are still working on the TC Routefinder project, considering mechanism of how human represent spatial information and get familiar with environment is critical and closely related to improving usability of TC Routefinder. Based on this paper, it is important to have users easily develop landmark knowledge into route knowledge without providing too much information at once. Also, to get destination, we do not have to develop our map knowledge up to survey knowledge, which is a full fledged map knowledge of space. Also, we can place a landmark on the map such as a John Dewey bust sculpture as an aid for easier access to the destination.
