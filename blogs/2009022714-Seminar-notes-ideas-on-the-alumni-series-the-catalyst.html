          <p>
            Last week, the two groups that worked on refining the TC Alumni series (aka, "The Catalyst") came up with two very different directions.

Erin's group veered in the direction of finding younger alums who were doing interesting work in the field: teachers and school leaders. They imagined finding these people by word-of-mouth. They weren't shying away from possible "puff" pieces so long as the content was substantive and interesting. They would look for innovative individuals and try to capture how they work and what drives them.

My group was skeptical about finding young professionals who would talk candidly about their work â€” and so we imagined that we'd be limited in the stories we could tell. Instead, we thought it would be interesting to talk to teachers and school leaders who are 70+ years old, and ask them to talk about challenging times in their career. We thought one source of leads could be the TC alumni magazine from the 60s, 70s, and 80s. These videos would be brief reflections in the style of oral histories (but hip for a 20-something audience??). We want to post them to TC's Facebook page.

So, we think we will experiment with both these styles in the upcoming series: choosing individuals at different points in their career, and possibly even making comparisons between them. Let us know if you have any further ideas to help refine this project!
