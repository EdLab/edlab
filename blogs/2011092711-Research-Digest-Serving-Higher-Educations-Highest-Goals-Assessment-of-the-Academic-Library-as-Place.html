            Jackson, H.L. and Hahn, T.B. (2011) Serving High Education's Highest Goals: Assessment of the Academic Library as Place. <i>College & Research Libraries,</i> 72(5), 428-442

In this study, instead of the more traditional business model approach, researchers turned to the psychology of religion to assess library effectiveness in the academic environment. The idea is that the library is a "sacred space" in the sense that it's presence and atmosphere makes students feel more connected to the higher goals and missions of their institution. This feeling inspires them to participate more. Through a survey, the researchers were able to discern that while library patrons preferred more classically styled library items, this stopped being true when it would make the item less useful. The best example of this was the card catalog, which gave people a positive feeling, but was something they would not be likely to use. 

I find this to be an interesting study because of the transition in assessment factors. As they mention in the article, libraries have been attempting to evaluate themselves using models from the business world. These models are limiting at best, and at worst, damaging to the long term success of the library due to the nuanced elements of the services provided by a library. I think using a religious metaphor here, while apparently scandalous, it is actually more appropriate than a more capitalist approach. I hope that as the field of assessment evolves, these various approaches will give way to a library specific approach, which handles all of these angles.
