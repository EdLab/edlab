<p>There are undoubtedly several reasons why students dislike writing research papers, but  a likely cause of angst and procrastination is the daunting task of organizing and formatting citations. Two MBA graduates from the University of Rochester have created a long-overdue solution in <a href="http://www.citelighter.com/">Citelighter</a>, a browser extension that elevates research notes to the cloud. Billed as a "free way to organize education," the tool smoothly streamlines note taking through an easy process of highlighting and capturing texts that later allows users to re-organize, annotate, and share facts. And best of all, website and publication information is compiled into an automatically generated bibliography that can be exported or emailed.</p>

<p>In addition to creating a place for project notes to live, users can save their citations to a growing collection of curated user-created facts, covering everything from <a href="http://www.citelighter.com/mathematics/mathematics/knowledgecards/the-fibonacci-sequence">The Fibonacci Sequence</a> to <a href="http://www.citelighter.com/music/artists/knowledgecards/tupac-shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The process of creating an account, adding new projects, and capturing texts is extremely easy and facilitated by helpful FAQ and video tutorials. The intuitive design of the site and browser extension allows Citelighter to do exactly what it’s intended to: disappear into the background and eliminate the tedious aspects of research. One of the most significant time savers it offers is the automatically generated bibliography, which can instantly translate citations between APA, MLA, and Chicago styles, with the possibility of supporting more formats depending on requests from its already large user base. With students from more than 1,500 campuses, Citelighter has the potential to curate and deliver relevant personalized research recommendations. And aside from the obvious uses for students and professionals, it also delivers valuable benefits to teachers; it can be used to assign team projects, assess students by tracking resources, and detect incidences of cheating by searching quotes. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Citelighter cautions upfront that bibliographies should be reviewed for accuracy; because website information can be incomplete, automatic citations may require tweaking. Fortunately the process for editing citation fields is straightforward and new information is saved for users who cite that source in the future.</p>

<p>Several useful features are only available in the premium version, which costs $10 per month plus an additional $3 per month for integration with Google Docs. Without going pro, freemium users won’t be able to capture citations from PDFs (this feature only works with Firefox, although compatibility with Chrome and Safari is being developed), can only store a limited number of projects, and won’t receive personalized recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Veteran researchers already using similar products like <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> (works with PDFs), <a href="http://endnote.com/">Endnote</a>, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/">Research Gate</a> (has recommendation features), and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> may be inconvenienced by migrating all their work to a new platform, but this tool makes sense for new students. Citelighter’s simple and friendly user interface may appeal to a broader group of users and have more (and less scholarly) uses.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Just the facts: Citelighter is an easy way to collect and organize your research as you browse.</p>
