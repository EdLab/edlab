French teachers are experimenting with Twitter as a way to teach primary school students to write and read.  Twitter's 140 characters are viewed by teachers like Jean-Roch Masson as a way to encourage budding writers to, "be the journalists of our (their) own lives."  This <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2092300,00.html?xid=tweetbut">Time.com article</a>, translated from Le Monde by   <a href=" http://www.worldcrunch.com/">WorldCrunch</a> describes a typical morning in a Twitter-positive classroom:

<i>Every morning, one or two pupils are in charge of posting the first tweet of the day. However, before posting it, he or she needs to write the sentence in his or her exercise book, get it corrected, type it on a shared digital document and copy and paste it in the software managing Twitter. The short message then appears on the smartboard on the classroom wall, along with messages from followers of the class.</i> 

A few of the supporting points made in this article seem a bit suspect, like the following quote from a psychologist, "Children quickly learn that something written on paper stays whereas on the Internet, things can be erased. It avoids the guilt a mistake can provoke, and allows you to try new things without fear."  I would argue that the opposite is true, once you've posted something on Twitter it could enter the the Twitterverse for all eternity.  Trusty <a href="http://www.dickblick.com/products/pink-pearl-eraser/">pink pearl erasers</a> have served generations of young students desperate to erase mistakes well... Twitter on the other hand, is untested as a "safe" option for budding authors.  On the flip-side it would definitely teach a young student how to be extremely succinct! 

<b>Cautious, but Hopeful...</b>
As we have explored <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3799"> here at the lab</a>, privacy concerns need to be taken into special consideration at all times for anyone, and in this case students under 13.  While the article mentions safety precautions like always tweeting with an adult present and not sharing personal information, you are still asking an underage person to create a digital record that for all intents and purposes, cannot be erased.  Until we get more serious about teaching digital privacy issues to kids of all ages, perhaps we should enter the Twittersphere in the classroom with prudence.   

All caution aside, I am excited that these teachers are reaching beyond the conventional methods of teaching writing and reading.  We need more education pioneers who are willing to test the "edges" of classroom comfort.  Are there more "private" options like <a href="<a href="https://vialogues.com/support/help/permissions-to-vialogue/"> Vialogues </a> for creating secure dialogue socially online in the classroom?   Do you feel the benefits of social media at the primary school level out-weigh the risks?
