          <p>
            Several commemorations were held across the globe to honor former Beatle John Lennon, who was shot and killed outside his apartment on Central Park West 30 years ago. Known for his staunch and sometimes radical stance on the need to address some of the world's pressing humanitarian issues, Lennon used his music as the medium to derail his opinions and message to the world. His Vietnam War protest song, “Give Peace a Chance” is still a rallying cry for many anti-war activists.

It is in Lennon's spirit and contributions to music with which the <a href="http://www.lennonbus.org/">John Lennon Educational Tour Bus</a> was created over a decade ago. The bus is equipped with the latest video and audio recording machines and criss cross the country at various events and venues. The bus is primarily aimed at providing students with a chance “to play music, write songs, engineer recording sessions and produce video projects using the latest audio, video, and live sound equipment.” The organizers of the bus work in conjunction with schools and youth programs across the country to provide youth in those areas a chance to experience and work with the equipment on the bus. Directors of schools and youth programs must submit a request through the website if they want the bus to make a stop in their city or town.
