            We have thousands of images on the EdLab servers. Navigating through these images using operating system file browsers can be a difficult task, and searching for a specific image can at times be nearly impossible.  Josh and I recently tested out some approaches to image management which might make the sharing and archiving of image data easier.  We tested Apple Aperture and Adobe Bridge as possible solutions, and Flickr as a possible internet-based tool, though there are many more possibilities. Image management is a subset of Data Access Management, often abbreviated DAM, and there are a number of professional and enterprise DAM tools available. 

Our primary conclusion was that some additional use of Metadata with our images would be a good thing. Editable metadata keywords could be customized to edLab applications, and a common set of persistent keywords could be useful to many users. For example, I created a keyword ‘TC Architecture' to tag images of Teachers College buildings, then was able to search the network for this keyword, using Bridge. Flickr supports keywords, but can't search system volumes. Aperture also supports metadata keywords, but has only limited network functionality, which lead to our secondary, provisional conclusion, that the MDC experiment with the use of Bridge as an image management tool. 

We already have Bridge software installed on the edLab macs, it quickly generates image previews, and allows metadata to be modified in a straightforward way. 

Caveats to this recommendation were (1) that bridge is not a true DAM program, in that it is not database driven, and does not create a ‘vault' to store original images centrally or backup images, (2) Separate Bridge installs must be updated individually to include new custom keywords, and (3) some file formats, notably *.png, seem unable to support custom keyword metadata. 

Metadata support is an emerging feature in DAM and photography/imaging applications, and one which could have useful implications both for internal data management and for ongoing projects including PocketKnowledge.
