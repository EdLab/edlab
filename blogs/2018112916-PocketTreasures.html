There is a boy carry a stone fighting another boy in the class. Xingzhi stops him and asks him to come to the office. Later when he came back to the office. The boy has already waited there. He gives the boy the first candy: 'This is a reward for you because you come to my office on time while I'm late.' Then he gives out the second candy: 'This one is because when I ask you to stop fighting, you stop immediately, which means that you respect teachers.' After that, he gives the boy the third candy and says: 'I did some investigation and I found that the reason you are fighting with others is that they were bullying other girls in the class. I'm glad that you are fighting for the justices'. The boy cried with regret and says: 'They are not bad guys, they are just my classmate, I should not fight with them, I'm sorry.' The Xingzhi gives out the last candy: 'This is for you since you realize the fault. This is the last candy I have and it is the end of the conversation'</p><p><br /></p><p>I was surprised to learn so many Chinese education pioneers have come from TC!.
