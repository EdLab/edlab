<p>It is no secret to teachers and administrators that data-driven instruction is becoming the gold standard to which nearly everyone aspires. <a href="https://www.scootpad.com/">ScootPad</a> is one of many industry attempts to combine student data collection and adaptive instruction together in one platform. With a layout not unlike WordPress’s blogging dashboard, ScootPad integrates curricula for math, ELA, and eBooks and allows teachers to track student progress throughout instruction and assessments.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Once teachers set up their classroom on ScootPad, students are given math and ELA placement assessments, creating adaptive learning pathways unique to every student. Teachers can set the class learning mode to manual or adaptive, where manual is more rigidly aligned to a schedule and adaptive is self-paced. Teachers can select from already developed learning paths in the ScootPad database or develop a new path for an individual student. Teachers, students, and parents can see where students are in their learning paths and view their level of mastery for each subtopic in the unit.</p>

<p>Throughout the duration of a unit, students work through various assignments as well as instructional videos called <i>Scootorials.</i> ScootPad also uses an algorithm to assess proficiency and automatically generate appropriate questions to extend understanding. During this flexible and differentiated process, data is constantly being generated, providing teachers with real-time information on how their students are faring in each subject. Teachers can also identify specific areas in which students are struggling, and use the actionable interventions the platform suggests. Throughout the learning process, students feel motivated by ScootPad’s leaderboard and coin exchange, adding a rewards-based component to the experience.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The concern that often accompanies products and software that attempt to fully integrate all elements of classroom learning in one digital platform is that <i>something</i> gets left out. Particularly when these platforms require so much full-fledged commitment and effort on the teacher’s part, the hope is that everything can be included, so that the teacher does not have to juggle both the platform <i>and</i> a hodgepodge of other offline data tracking and lesson planning. Although this is not what ScootPad purports to be, it certainly creates a high threshold for adoption, where teachers might find the cost-benefit tradeoff unsatisfactory.</p>
 
<p>Another challenge is that in its sweeping attempt to generate data from all of the integrated assignments and assessments, the experience is heavily defined by standardized-test-like questions that can feel limiting and dry. On one hand, this allows teachers to see a score report for everything the student does. On the other hand, there isn't sufficient space for a student portfolio of work that can't be graded by a machine, making the learning experience feel largely test-oriented rather than exploratory.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>ScootPad has a great interface that is intuitive and easy to use, and it includes numerous features that seem very well thought-out and useful. Ultimately, it provides an unprecedented amount of tools for teachers to engage in data-driven instruction. However, there are just some elements of learning that still don’t seem to be replicable online, and that serves as a significant drawback in an online learning platform like ScootPad.</p>
