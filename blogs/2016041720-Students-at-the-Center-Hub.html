<p><i>"The Mission of the Hub:
<ul><li>Help raise the visibility of student-centered learning in New England and beyond.</li>
<li>Offer a centralized location for tools and resources on student-centered learning approaches.</li>
<li>Provide a user-friendly, interactive space for practitioners, implementers and supporters of student-centered approaches to learning."</li></ul>
</i> (<a href="http://studentsatthecenterhub.org/about/">About the Students at the Center Hub</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>What "Students at the Center" Looks Like</b></p>

<p>There are many organizations and initiatives that seek to provide resources and build education networks. The <a href="http://studentsatthecenterhub.org/">Students at the Center Hub</a> is one that is specifically focused on student-centered learning and development. Its framework is centered around four key tenets: personalized learning, competency-based learning, student-owned learning, and anytime/anywhere learning. These principles are meant to prompt students to take ownership of their own learning experiences and hold themselves accountable for an education that best fits their individual needs. They are interwoven concepts to help achieve the overarching goal of deeper learning and attaining the requisite skills and knowledge for college and career readiness.</p>

<p><b>Resources and Opportunities</b></p>
 
<p>The Students at the Center Hub offers a variety of speaker events, webinars, and conferences in the New England area; most are free and open to all. The organization also compiles a long list of resources on student-centered learning—everything from research and case studies to podcasts and infographics—meant to get educators thinking about how to incorporate student-centered learning in their practice. These resources are diverse, and fit under the organization’s own principle of anytime/anywhere learning by being digitally accessible for all.</p>

<p>Student-centered learning certainly breaks many traditional models of school and educational experiences. This organization does so in a way that puts digital resources and tools at the forefront, all accessible through its website for educational professionals across the country to use. In order to move toward new student-centered models, teachers, principals, and parents will undoubtedly need resources and advice to help them in that transition—the Students at the Center Hub may just fill that need.</p>
