                The Secret Service was initially created for the sole purpose of detecting counterfeit money. The Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in Washington D.C. It was under the United States Department of the Treasury. The Secret Service was also used for espionage and counterespionage during the Civil War, as well as investigating crimes from murders to robberies because the U.S. Marshals did not have enough power to investigate situation. The secret service did not become protectors of the President until the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. That's when Congress asked for the agency's help in guarding the president.

    The president and former presidents are not only the people that are provided with their protection. The first ladies continue to get protection as well, even after their husband's death. But sadly enough legislation passed a law that denied future presidents from getting lifetime protection. Any president that was inaugurated after 1997 no longer receives lifetime protection, but just ten years protection after their last day in office. 

    In history, people have been known to be killed when found guilty of counterfeiting money. When the US fought the British during the American Revolution, the British used their knowledge of economics to try and destroy our economy. They counterfeited the American so much that it became worthless. Also during the time of the Civil War, almost half of the money in circulation was counterfeited and each one of the 1,600 banks, created their own money. Spotting counterfeits during the time of the Civil War was very difficult since you had to look for counterfeits in over 7,000 different types of real money. Because of this problem, the US created a national currency in 1862. But soon it was realized that they needed an agency to track counterfeits as more and more of the currency was being counterfeited. Therefore, the United States Secret Service was created in 1865 to suppress the ever growing threat of the national currency collapsing. The Secret Service proved their worthiness and suppressed the counterfeits substantially.

    This week I only discussed two of the jobs and history backgrounds of the Secret Service this week. Next week, I will discuss more of their assignments and what they would do on intelligence assignments.
