<b>Title:</b> The Impact of an Honor Code on Cheating in Online Courses  (2011)<br>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank M. LoSchiavo & Mark A. Shatz</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b> Cheating and plagiarism have plagued academia for decades, but the rise of online education and recent cheating scandals at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/education/harvard-cheating-suspects-go-on-leave.html?_r=0">Harvard</a> and on <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/08/20/coursera_plagiarism_why_would_students_cheat_in_a_free_online_class_that_doesn_t_over_academic_credit_.html">Coursera</a> have changed the landscape of academic dishonesty. The growth rate for enrollment in online courses<a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol7no2/loschiavo_0611.pdf"> now outpaces</a> the overall growth rate for enrollments in higher education. Because of auto-grading, many of these online courses rely on fact-based information and multiple-choice assessments to measure academic performance. This study examines measures for preventing cheating,  but the very definition of cheating in online courses may be changing.
</p>

<p>The researchers conducted three studies that were designed to assess the effect of an honor code on self-reported cheating during online quizzes. Students in an introductory psychology course were selected for the study, and two versions of the course were used, a fully asynchronous online course and a blended course that used online and in-person instruction. The first study simply measured the incidence of self-reported cheating in an online version of the course. The second and third studies tested the use of a signed honor code document presented at the beginning of online and blended courses on the incidence of cheating. Cheating was defined in the course as "consulting your textbook, notes, friends, family, the Internet, etc."
</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> The results of the first study showed that 72.5% of students reported cheating on at least 1 of the 14 quizzes, and the second study showed that signing an honor code seemed to have no measurable effect on student cheating in online courses. The third study, which examined the blended course, showed that students who signed an honor code were about 30% less likely to cheat.
</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Cheating seems inevitable in online education, but perhaps thatâ€™s not such a bad thing. The quizzes in the study were fact-based, and it is likely that students found the information online because it is easily accessible and they are used to solving fact-based questions with online information. Students working online and seamlessly connected to a wealth of information may not see utilizing this connection as cheating. This was not so much the case for the blended course. There the accessibility gap could have been responsible for the significantly fewer instances of cheating. But an equally or even more important issue than cheating might be aligning demands on students with the delivery mode of a course. With Wikipedia always a click away, effective online instruction might more appropriately focus on collaboration, curation, and interpretation. These are classically difficult skills to measure online, but the results would be more effective than any honor code at preventing students from straying.
