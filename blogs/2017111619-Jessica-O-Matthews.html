<p>Jessica O. Matthews is the Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.unchartedplay.com">Uncharted Power</a>, an energy company that designs renewable energy technology systems for infrastructure and smart applications. Founded by Jessica when she was 22, Uncharted Power's flagship product is the <a href="http://www.unchartedplay.com/tech">SOCCKET ball</a>, an energy generating soccer ball that provides off-grid power for the developing world. Jessica invented the SOCCKET when she was 19 years old.</p>

<p>Jessica was invited by President Barack Obama to the White House to represent small companies for the signing of the America Invents Act in 2012, and currently serves as an Ambassador of Entrepreneurship for Nigeria. In 2016, she was selected to ring the NASDAQ opening ceremony bell, representing all Forbes 30 Under 30 alumna.</p>

<p>Jessica’s research and career centers around the intersections of disruptive technology, human behavior, and the psychology of self-actualization. A dual citizen of Nigeria and the U.S., Jessica has a degree in Psychology and Economics from Harvard University, and an MBA from Harvard Business School. Her list of accolades include Fortune’s Most Promising Women Entrepreneurs, Forbes 30 under 30 list, Inc Magazine 30 under 30, and Harvard University Scientist of the Year.</p>
 
<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work as CEO and founder of Uncharted Power?</b><br>
I don’t think that there is anything really particularly difficult in the concept of being a founder. All a founder has to do is say "I want to start a company. I want to take this idea and make it something with which people can do business." The process was more something that came out of necessity; in starting to go around to different events where people had heard of the SOCCKET ball, top people in different organizations would say, "We’ve heard of you, but you have to become a business so people can do business with you." So, in that essence, I had to create some sort of platform or organization that allowed me to begin to scale and sustain and think about growing my idea.</p>

<p>I think it’s much harder to go from the student/inventor mindset to a CEO and I think there’s a really big difference between a founder and a CEO. A CEO has to really think about the overall organization as the invention in and of itself. It’s not just the product that you’re making, it’s also facing the difficulties that go into being the person responsible for every individual and decision at the company. Being the person who has to think about what’s going to happen in the next day but also what’s going to happen in the next five years. Basically, the big difference is being someone who is willing to learn every single day yet still keep running as fast as possible as though you are 100% confident in where you’re going.</p>

<p>What’s really exciting is that many people believe there’s a pattern to entrepreneurship where if you come from a wealthy family or from a family where people look a certain way, then it’s easier to get into that space. But, what was interesting for me, and something that helped me get through some of the tougher times in running the company, was actually having a slightly different background than most CEOs in the tech space. Whether it’s coming from Poughkeepsie, or being the daughter of immigrants, or being a Black woman, all of these things created some degree of uncertainty in my life growing up. But it’s the ability to be comfortable with this uncertainty that gives me the strength for running a company. Entrepreneurship is 100% owning and living in uncertainty, and I’ve found that this wasn’t something that shook me as much as others I knew. For those who have always had really comfortable experiences and haven’t really experienced struggle in their lives, the struggle of being an entrepreneur can be something that really turns them upside down. </p>
 
<p><b>How do you believe that Uncharted Power, and specifically the Uplift 1 Million program, can impact positive social change?</b><br>
Uncharted Power is inherently a sustainable company. With its dedication to ensuring universal access to renewable energy, UP is working to build equitable cities that can fit the needs of people today without compromising the needs of future generations. However, Uncharted Power's energy infrastructure is only one type of innovation that can help cities. In order to ensure that populations where we work are also able to actualize the cities they want to see, it is imperative for us to not only offer new technology, but also create a platform where citizens can create new technologies. <a href="http://www.unchartedplay.com/uplift1m">UPlift 1 Million</a> is Uncharted Power's educational campaign, which deploys our STEM and creative thinking curriculum, Think Out Of Bounds (TOOB), to the communities where we work. TOOB aims to build creative confidence and teach principles in STEM and social innovation, culminating in a social solutions design sprint where participants invent a prototype to solve a problem in their community. Uncharted Power's MORE technology offers a present solution to impact positive social change, while UPlift 1 Million and TOOB ensures there is a pipeline to create future solutions.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope Uplift 1 Million will change education worldwide? </b><br>
UPlift 1 Million subverts what one normally thinks about a STEM class. Instead of focusing strictly on science, technology, engineering, and math, UPlift 1 Million incorporates vulnerability, creativity, social innovation, human-centered design, art, teamwork, and many other principles imperative to global empathy that are typically left out of STEM curricula. UPlift 1 Million focuses on meeting students where they are instead of forcing individuals to engage in a "one size fits all" program, and the program is led by students and adjusted to fit every class’s specific needs. More curricula need to encourage learners that STEM can be for them, rather than only encouraging those with an innate interest or ability in it. Ultimately, not every student who completes UPlift 1 Million has to be an engineer or inventor, but the goal is for UPlift 1 Million to provide individuals with the confidence to pursue whatever they want to pursue, with a specific focus on positively influencing their communities.</p>
 
<p><b>What other projects are you currently working on or have planned for the future?</b><br>
I’m really excited about several things. I think it’s very exciting to take an ethos not just about the technology itself, but also the way people should interact with technology and how it should benefit the world. Our <a href="http://u-more.co">MORE</a> (Motion-based, Off-grid, Renewable Energy) technology is what’s in the soccer ball and jump ropes, but it’s also in the new infrastructure products we are building. It’s really exciting to think about how to take the Uncharted Power ethos, starting with a soccer ball, and scale it to infrastructure systems that can affect people around the world in really expansive ways.</p>

<p>But I’m also really excited that we haven’t lost who we are as a company in this whole process. The more we grow, the more we’re able to suggest that it’s not simply the tech that’s new, but further, the way we build this tech and the way companies that build technology in general should look. That’s a big thing for me. As a woman of color, it’s important I encourage others to think about diversity not as charity, but as something that’s good for business. To know we are setting that example and suggesting an alternative in the overall technological revolution is something that really, really excites me.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’m excited about translating thoughts and psychological ethos into applicable technology. I’m excited to see how individuals react to what we’re building and how it affects their thoughts and lives. Our mission is to democratize energy access. I think we live in a world right now where people sometimes don’t feel like their voices are equally heard or that their voices matter. So there’s something inspiring to building technology that not only works on providing individual agency, but also does so in a scalable way. I think the key to our technology is that we’re able to create these energy microgenerators and efficiently combine them in a way that produces a very loud voice, both literally and figuratively.</p>
