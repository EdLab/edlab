Adrian Sannier has been called a "software evangelist," with a career spanning the fields of research engineering, product development and teaching.  Sannier was the Stanley Professor of Interdisciplinary Engineering at Iowa State University and is credited in part, with helping Arizona State University (under ASU president <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/134">Michael Crow</a> to strategize the move of <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Adrian-Sannier/130933/">select resources to "the cloud"</a>) and helping one of America’s largest state-run universities to fully embrace online learning.  Sannier currently leads the product team responsible for creating <a href="http://www.openclass.com/open/home/index">Pearson’s OpenClass</a> learning management system.  Watch Sannier describe this year-old open learning environment, <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/7986">here</a>.  <p>  <b>EXCLUSIVE NLT INTERVIEW</b><p>  <b>Question: </b>How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> As an undergrad, I studied engineering systems, but I hated computers. It was the tail end of the punchcards and mainframes era, so all my interactions with computers were miserable. I didn't enjoy them at all.  <p>But in graduate school, I lucked into an assistantship in an interactive graphics lab and I fell in love with computing machines. Unlike mainframes that you operated at arms' length, I found you could develop a personal relationship with these computers. Mainframes were like pen-pals, you wrote them long letters, and sometimes they wrote back; these graphics computers, you could text them, and they'd text back right away. These computers talked to you...in a clumsy language it's true, but if you learned it, these computers could allow you to do things far beyond your native capabilities.  <p>I spent 5 years earning my PhD at Michigan State and developing a relationship with computers, studying the emerging field of computer graphics and doing research in a form of artificial intelligence called genetic algorithms. <p>  <b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>  <b>Answer:</b> I've had an unusual trajectory for someone with a career in higher education, one I hope has allowed me to see our challenges from a variety of perspectives. I've created educational content as general manager of a team of 250, I was a chaired professor and researcher at Iowa State University, where I taught computer graphics and technology management, and did research in human/computer interaction. I served as Michael Crow's university technology officer at Arizona State University, and learned about providing support to a community of faculty and students. Currently, I lead the Product team that created OpenClass for Pearson, the world's largest education company. <p> <b>Question: </b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> I think the potential for technology to dramatically improve education is still largely untapped. First television was going to revolutionize education, then personal computing, then the internet and now smart phones and tablets -- each in its turn has promised to dramatically accelerate improvement, but back in class it's still pretty much the same as it ever was.  <p>I've been working in education, in one role or another, since the 20th century, but this year feels different to me. I see signs of real change, change powered by technologies that can spread educational innovations in moments. The next several years will see the rise of massive online courses replacing textbooks and other digital aids as the learning materials supporting faculty members. The scale of these courses will allow levels of instructional design, production value and analytics that are beyond the reach of a sole practitioner. The design of these courses will depend, for their full effect, on the skill of talented faculty working with a group of 5 to 50 students, either in person, online or both.  <p>Having worked at this for so long, I'd really love to be in the thick of it when change finally does come. <p>  <b>Question: </b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> I think we are on the verge of a cultural shift in the scale at which the learning materials -- the published materials chosen by a teacher for the edification of her class -- are produced. Today, the lion's share of courses are created by an individual instructor to teach one section of between 5 - 500 students. The digital components of most of the course sections served up by LMS's everywhere are rudimentary by modern standards, as faculty and students will attest. Most faculty members have limited time, interest and experience with the technologies they are asked to use, largely on their own, to create the digital content for their courses.  <p>I think the MOOC craze has done a great service - it has helped people understand the power of scale in education. Digital courses made for 100,000 students can justify far greater effort, energy and expertise than courses developed by individual professors. Courses with student populations in the hundreds of thousands are laboratories for continuous course improvement through the application of analytics. Ironically, one of the keys to creating digital experiences that are specific to an individual is to gather and analyze data from the broadest populations of learners, to build a large enough base of statistical knowledge from which to infer what is likely to help a given student achieve a desired outcome.  <p>But unlike the MOOCs I think these new digital courses will prove most effective when they are part of a course offered by a talented teacher to a cohort of students between 5 and 50. <p>  <b>Question: </b>  What are you currently working on & what is your next big project? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> We are in the middle of the growth phase for OpenClass, Pearson's free learning platform. Our active user base has doubled since Educause, and we are closing in on 6,000 institutions that are actively evaluating OpenClass. We have several institution wide adoptions under our belts now, in both high school and higher ed.  <p>We're working hard to improve the product week by week, based on feedback from our design partner community, and we're preparing to take OpenClass global in 2014.  <p>As our platform is building momentum, I'm starting to focus on the next phase of OpenClass development, the creation and distribution of effective courses at scale. Distributing a free learning platform was an enabling step -- we must now show we can use that platform to create and distribute course experiences that attract faculty, engage students, and demonstrably improve educational outcomes. This is the kind of work that has the potential to move the needle, to help schools improve retention and graduation rates. In the end, it is all about more and more people, learning more and more, faster and at greater depth. <p> <i>Image: </i>Courtesy of Adrian Sannier.
