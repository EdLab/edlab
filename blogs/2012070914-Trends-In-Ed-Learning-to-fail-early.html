            Students at a Silicon Valley high school have become startup founders at the age of eighteen. Collectively, they have already launched two ideas — an online education venture and a video-sharing app for the iPhone — with more ideas being developed at their "Paly Entrepreneurs Club" lunchtime meetings.

These students are the first to admit to their early "failures". But with that said, these young entrepreneurs are resilient for their age, actually appreciating their failing experiences. (Note: Failure is a common theme revealed by Silicon Alley founders, as seen in our <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4085">Ed Tech Talk</a> interviews). While most students in the traditional education system struggle with the notion of failure, the founding members of Paly carry the hope that their early foray into the tech startup world will at least help them be more memorable to investors in the future. What perspective, young ones!

Do they want to have the best idea on the first try?
No.

Do they want to rake in the big bucks on their second try?
No.

“The goal here is inspirational,” says Aaron Bajor, one of the Paly Entrepreneurs Club founders, in a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/technology/palo-alto-high-club-fosters-would-be-tech-moguls.html?ref=education&pagewanted=all">New York Times article</a>.

Students want to spur each other on in one another's quests to change the future. Even if a fellow member of Paly sits at the lunch table with no ideas, he or she is still welcome because the objective of the group at this stage is to inspire. This perspective is a contrast to the "seize and conquer" mentality of tackling concepts and passing tests. 

If high school students can adopt concepts such as failure and patience through startup initiatives, perhaps we can catalyze the invention and innovation process for the next generation. Are we doing enough, and early enough, to set up the next generation to become game changers?
