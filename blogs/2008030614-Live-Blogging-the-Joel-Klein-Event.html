            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Klein">Joel Klein</a>, chancellor of NYC Public schools since 2002, gave a talk titled  "Children First: Creating a System of Successful NYC Public Schools."

<img src="files/Joel Klein Event 002.jpg">

Don't worry if you didn't make it - Luciana and I were there!

3:00 We showed up at Grace Dodge 177 along with about 50 others eager to hear Mr. Klein speak.  We grabbed a lovely Chianti and some not-as-lovely cheese, and took a spot at the back, ready to blog.

3:02 <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/3779?browseby=chart&sortfiles=alphabetically&optdisplay=0">Sharon Lynn Kagan</a> welcomed everyone and warned us that Mr. Klein would be late.  "That's because he's a politician and not an academic" joked Kagan.

3:08 Professor Kagan announced Mr. Klein's arrival, followed by <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/27545?browseby=chart&sortfiles=alphabetically&optdisplay=0">Douglas Ready's</a> formal introduction of Mr. Klein and his professional background.

3:10 Mr. Klein briefly discussed his professional past, including the fact that his participation in Microsoft litigation as a prosecutor almost jeopardized funding NYC schools by the Gates foundation (cue laugh track...)

3:14 Mr. Klein began his well organized power point presentation.  He made three over-arching points:

1) He cited several major challenges for NYC schools, including unified standards, integration of technology with learning, and budget issues.  While there are multiple challenges, in Mr. Klein's view there is an overriding crisis in racial & ethnic achievement disparities in NYC schools.

2) To answer this dilemma, Mr. Klein said many people claim that poverty must be fixed in order to fix education.  But he declared with gusto, "It's the opposite: We need to fix education in order to fight poverty!"  To prove that poverty does achieve, he cited the <a href="http://www.uncommonschools.org/ecs/home/index.html">Excellence Charter School</a> in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

3) But if public school discussion follows its same path, things won't change and we'll continue to spend money poorly on schools and education.

The core set of solutions to these problems are quality teachers evenly distributed across schools and meaningful accountability.

3:22 What was our set of solutions?  He described two phases of operation, the first of which he characterized as a service delivery problem, citing <a href="http://www.methuenbookshop.co.uk/shop/product.php/1649/0/">Michael Barber's Instruction to Deliver</a> as a great example of his thinking.  Phase I included:
1) a new management system to depoliticize the structure - previously a NYC Chancellor averaged 2 years in office, whereas Klein is at 6 and more...

2) focusing on school leadership, i.e. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/nyregion/08principal.html?scp=1&sq=New+York+City+Leadership+Academy+22&st=nyt">J.H.S. 22</a>

3) enhance & standardize curricula - referred to <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php/browse/3792?browseby=chart&sortfiles=volume&optdisplay=0">Lucy Calkins' work</a>

4) engaged families, including a parent-staffed coordinator position

5) improve safety by reducing school crime by 13%

3:33 Phase II, which became a reality after Mayor Bloomberg's re-election, focused on three tiers of transformation to decentralize the system.  Mr. Klein said that NYC needs "a system of great schools, not a great school system!"  The three tiers were:

1)Empowerment - make decisions in individual schools as the unit of meaning, fund students not schools, give budget control to schools

2) Accountability - focusing on a "return on investment," the ARIS program for professional development and evaluating performance (cited <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/bookstorenow57-20">Jim Collins' Good to Great</a>, pay for performance contracts, rigorous tenure review ("how can 99% of 3rd year teachers get tenure?!?"), attract best teachers to tough places with incentives

3)Leadership - creating school choice for students, reduce student teacher ratio from 14.2 to 13.2 since 2004, leadership academies

3:45 What have these phases accomplished?

More students graduating, gaining ground on the rest of New York state, slight decrease in drop outs, marked improvement in public polling on school performance

4:00 Q&A

1st Q: "Can you be more specific about Teacher Quality as part of the set of your solutions?" asked <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/equitycampaign/detail.asp?Id=Council%2C+Board+%26+Staff&Info=Campaign+Staff">Michael Rebel</a>. A: A great principal is the most important thing to attract great teachers, $$$ is next

Q: Many questions after this were asked around issues of High-Stakes testing negatively affecting classroom pedagogy, including that instruction on test-taking skills took too much time. A: Mr. Klein admitted that no test was perfect, but at the same time, children who scored 1s or 2s really were not prepared for life.  He felt classroom pedagogy should teach skills, which are testable.  He also felt test-taking skills taught the vital tool of time-management and effective argumentation.

Q: Professor Kagan asked the final question: "Where is education going according to each of our presidential candidates?" A: Debate at that level doesn't seem to want to tackle this.  The two parties are too polarized for productive change since republicans want vouchers, while democrats want to end testing and increase teacher student ratio.

5:00 More wine and cheese!

We hope this feels just like the real thing!  'till next time...
