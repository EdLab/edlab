<p>In India over 50% of students in grade five cannot read at second grade level, despite primary school enrollment rates in excess of 95%. The country has pushed to increase the use of technology in instruction to disrupt the status quo and improve productivity in education. However, evidence suggests that realizing the potential of technology-aided instruction requires detailed attention to the specific intervention, and the extent to which it alleviates binding constraints on learning.</p>
 
<p>In this study researchers tested the impact of <a href="https://centres.mindspark.in/index.php">Mindspark</a>, an instructional program that dynamically customizes information to match the level and rate of individual progress. They recruited 619 students enrolled in grades 6-9 from schools in low-income neighborhoods in Delhi, and compared administrative data on final exam scores, in the preceding school year, with study participants and the full student body.</p>
 
<p>A key feature of the Mindspark software is its ability to deploy its database, of over 45,000 questions, to benchmark the learning level of a student and then dynamically customize learning materials to match the level and rate of progress. The software also identifies patterns in student errors and precisely targets content to alleviate conceptual bottlenecks that may be difficult for teachers to diagnose, or address at the individual level in a classroom setting.</p>

<p>The results showed that access to the program led to large and rapid test score gains in both math and language. The software was successful at targeting instruction precisely to individual level of achievement, and effective at teaching students at all levels of prior achievement, including academically weaker students who are often left behind by business-as-usual instruction. The authors caution interpretation of the results as supporting a de-emphasis of the role of teachers in education, and argue that technology complements rather than substitutes teachers.</p>
