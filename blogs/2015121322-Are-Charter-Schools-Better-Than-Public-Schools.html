Since its inception and implementation, few educational policies have generated as much debate as charter schools. The issue is rearing its head again. Parents who cannot afford private schools but cares about their children's education often resort to charter schools as the alternative. It has virtually become the modern rival to public schools. Unlike public schools, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/upshot/a-suburban-urban-divide-in-charter-school-success-rates.html?ref=education">charter schools</a> are funded institutions run by their conduct and programs. It has the freedom to establish their policies, similar to private schools. They can implement new teachings strategies, hiring and firing of teachers and the academic calendar, among other freedoms.
 
These are some of the main characteristics that attract parents to send their children to charter schools. But are charter schools better than public schools?  Recent research suggests that the answer is yes, especially for low-income and non-white students in urban areas. Besides, not all charter schools are good. Urban Charter Schools often have higher student achievement than suburban ones. This is largely due to urban charter school being very selective. They often have a lottery process to manage the countless number of applications they receive. 
 
In light of this new research, are charter schools the long term answer to public schools?
