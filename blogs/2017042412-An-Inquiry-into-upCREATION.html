            People ask me "What is up creation?" For me it is a word that says a lot. It has a hundreds of stories hidden within it. It teases, appeals, speaks a rhythm and a pattern. It speaks to infrastructure, frameworks, culture, and sets me toward a long view, a big hope, and an audacious task.  I found it while reading Kevin Kelly's blog pages.  For me it speaks a world in the becoming and offers many clues and some traps for my next steps.

Llike many of the video games today, the secret is in finding meaning and actions for myself in the word.  I toyed with the concept of upcreation for several years. When I suggested we name our Columbia engagement an upCREATION Experience, we all felt the idea settle in our minds. Yes, we said. Then we set about defining it for ourselves.  Four different aspects of upcreation showed up in our minds and stories. Its not a thing, or a process. Rather it is a way, a thread running through our lives, at least the lives of those who wonder and wander and declare themselves to be lovers of Earth, humanity, and all Universal life.  Simple rules, simple steps, big gains for individuals and universe.

In 2005, we offered the World Economic Forum the phrase: The Future by Design, not Default.  That was the year "Design" became a phenomena, the word of the month, a salvation, a new market place.  Now it is ubiquitous and rarely understood. What the heck is design thinking or design centered?

And so the same thing is likely to happen with the word "Upcreation"? It is easy to say, fun to say, to put a few words to.  Upcreation is very likely to slip away from its authenticity unless we use it with care ... as a way of exploring ourselves, the way we work together toward finding our way with good information, experimenting, feedback, the shared feelings we have about the past, present, and future.

As my mind wanders through upcreation and the inspiration it offers me, I find myself sometimes believing myself to be in the midst of Alice's Wonderland, at other times grounded in the reality of what I see to be our current conditions on Earth.

I believe that there is no-one who understands upcreation without working their way through it, fiddling with it, asking questions, seeking proof, laughing at the zen way of it.  But, just think if enough of us could experience it as a group and come to work for and with its true meaning, how we might come to do and know upCREATION.

<a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/education/ifi/inquiry" target="_blank">Inquir</a>y.  The dictionary dumbs down the meaning of this word, so I have gone to the <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a> for my definition of inquiry.  How often do you go into a white space, a space open and free from your existing assumptions? Your doubts and habits and certainties to inquire about something you know too little about? How many hours a day should be int the state of inquiry?  Inquiry and upcreation  go hand in hand for me. Usually when I spend good time with one or the other, I learn more about both.
