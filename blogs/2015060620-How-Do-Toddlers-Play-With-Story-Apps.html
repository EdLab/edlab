<p>A recent study critically analyzed how toddlers in two early learning settings interacted with adults while using story apps. The data was drawn from a larger study in which the author and his colleagues videotaped how children used story apps with or without adult support and specifically coded the speech and hand movements children used while controlling the iPad.</p>

<p>The author found both similarities and differences between iPad-based reading and traditional story-sharing. While the physical positions of adults and children in the study were similar to traditional book-sharing behaviors, using the iPad required a particular kind of kinesthetic control different from holding a physical book. Moreover, the traditional hierarchy in which the adult serves as the leader in reading aloud was disrupted by iPad reading and settled into a flatter co-listener and co-explorer role, since the featured story apps provided automatic reading with animations and audio-visual directions on screen.</p>

<p>The findings also revealed that children presented different levels of confidence and independent enjoyment while using the story apps based on their prior home experiences with the iPad. Contrary to popular ideas about the tool, many students approached the iPad as a new technology rather than immediately using it intuitively. The author calls for educators to consider children’s digital-culture backgrounds and prior experiences with digital literacies beyond the school walls when making decisions about how to teach and introduce new digital tools. </p>

<p>The study presents a positive case for adults and children learning together with digital technology, but calls for teachers to rethink the idea that all their students are digital natives. New technology tools should be introduced in the classroom with use scaffolding to ensure that all students can use them well. In addition, the study encourages educational designers and developers to produce more quality early learning apps that can tap into young children’s learning capacities and provide opportunities for creative thinking and joyful learning.</p>
