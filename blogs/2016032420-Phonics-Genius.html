<p>Words are the name of the game, but sounds give them voice. For English Language Learners (ELLs) or students with speech problems, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phonics-genius/id461659980?mt=8">Phonics Genius</a> may be just what they need. This simple language app groups words according to their phonics signature to help simplify the complexities of the English language. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Phonics Genius includes over 6,000 professionally recorded words grouped along 225 categories according to their phonics. The app allows multiple modes of gameplay, from short simple phrases (e.g., two words) to long hard ones (e.g., six words). Advanced users can also add an unlimited number of new words by recording their own speech. If you feel a little speechless when you are in public, Phonics Genius allows you to add your voice to its chorus in the privacy of your own room—no worrisome bystanders around. </p>

<p>The interactivity in Phonics Genius is stripped-down, straightforward, and functional. No bells, whistles, or funky animated treats here—just straight-up learning consisting of text and sound. The interface is quietly inviting with white slates labeled by dark colored text and grouped by family of sound. As such, children should be able to figure out how to use Phonics Genius quickly. When you launch the app, just turn it on and start learning. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Native English speakers, older kids, or students with parents who have a vast vocabulary may find Phonics Genius a little <i>too</i> easy and not challenging enough to merit their consideration. Also, only text and voice are provided; other media like video or animation that most apps seem to offer are not included. As such, children who are interested in learning phonics may quickly become bored and launch another app with more pizazz. Interaction is intuitive but uninspiring; the app performs the language learning trick but in a very businesslike way. Phonics Genius is a mirth free zone. </p>
 
<p>I once took an amazing course on French phonics. I was fortunate to study with a highly engaging teacher. He helped us learn the intricacies of pronunciation that are essential in listening and speaking. Although Phonics Genius could be useful, it pales in comparison to learning with a veteran teacher who is a master of languages and can help you perfect pronunciation. Having an expert native speaker monitor your speech would be useful if you have difficulty comparing your own pronunciation to the examples included in this app. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Phonics Genius is a meat-and-potatoes technology that will help motivated people learn how to pronounce a variety of words correctly. Students who are learning English as a second language or struggling with speech problems should have more help in speaking fluently. Learning phonics can be a chore, but Phonics Genius is a useful tool to help speakers communicate better in English. </p>
