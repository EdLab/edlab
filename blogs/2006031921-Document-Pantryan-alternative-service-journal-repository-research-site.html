            I've been thinking and cooking, there are more ramifications of this idea not included here, once they get clearer and I'm able to phrase them I'll concretely present them.  So here is the Pantry ramble:

Instead of just managing information more efficiently, the document pantry provides you with an evolutionary approach to an idea.  There you can witness all the ingredients that at one point or another were involve in the development of the final recipe (paper).  This would demand a paradigm shift on the scale and measurement of knowledge units (My theory of fragments instead of whole--dissertation) from macro to micro and even nano elements of information. Also move from an essentialist approach still embedded in our Euclidean Geometries of External Frameworks to a Population Thinking, or Topological Geometry, where flows among networks constitute the strength of a system. Why I mean be this is if we could locate a submission or entry on a culture or civilization of practice where ideas about information, cognition, education, environments, etc are included, not extensively but as fragments of influence and attraction. This idea adheres to alternative ways of using and organizing information based on procedure of creative practice, reiteration and larger conceptual landscape instead of a point of understanding define by coordinates in a map.

It would include canned goods, perishables, dry foods, powders, spices, utensil, etc. Gaining back the pleasure of cooking instead of just accepting the “tv dinnersâ€? that most journals have to offer.

The allocation of a pantry room is temporal–to be determined–as it is intended to exist along the lifespan of a conference.

Through a Brown Bag or Picnic Basket provided to the TC community on their way many conferences, this container will allow them to store all the ingredients they may need to support their presentation.  Once you get there you may become aware that the flavor or seasoning is different, therefore easy access to your pantry. The research features for institutional purposes will include the migration of ideas to conferences and presentation.  Real time assessment of the ideologies and practices of the college—I think a mention this before researching researchers–generating an agenda for the library as we detect what the preferred ingredients of the college.  

For example to gain access to a document pantry you need to answer question, simple assumptions on the understanding of what is education, the mind, culture, etc, giving us a real sense of what the community is thinking beyond the well crafted papers.

Ok, I'm ready for tomatoes, stones, even knifes, anything you want to throw back.
