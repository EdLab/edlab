<p>Often when we talk about game-changing technology, we focus on programs and software that solve some of the world’s most difficult and longstanding challenges. <a href="http://www.aipoly.com/">Aipoly</a> is that kind of technology. It’s designed to help visually impaired individuals identify objects and colors by pointing a smartphone at their surroundings. The app will then identify items and verbally call out their names, like "strawberry" or "brown," in real time.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Perhaps one of Aipoly’s best features is its ability to learn more objects from its users. If the app does not initially recognize an object, users can add a description for it, and the app will gain new knowledge to expand its database. Aipoly uses what it calls a "multi-layered neural network" to identify objects and colors. This allows users to identify several objects in one frame without having to take individual photos to analyze the scene. Instead, when the app is on, it will continuously see whatever is in the frame of view and state out loud everything it identifies.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although Aipoly’s identification capabilities are quite advanced (for example, when pointing your phone at your MacBook, it will specify that it is indeed a MacBook and not just a laptop), there are some technological limitations that the app has not overcome. Most of these limitations have to do with context, actions, and specific details; for instance, pointing your phone at a person dancing the Electric Slide will not result in the app saying "Electric Slide dance." In this way, the app is quite basic in the support it provides, and those needing a more specific and detailed visual aide will not be able to find this in Aipoly.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Technology’s potential is vast and unknowable, and one of its best applications is to tackle challenges that humans have faced for ages. Students with disabilities could really benefit from more companies investing time and energy in developing apps that address special needs, and Aipoly does exactly that. Its technology is impressive and highly useful, and its potential both in and out of the classroom is huge.</p>
