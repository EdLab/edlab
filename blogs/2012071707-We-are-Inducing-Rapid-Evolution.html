          <p>
            In the following <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/science/alaskan-salmon-evolve-along-with-the-climate.html?ref=science">New York Times Article,</a> the story of the recent trend in natural selection in Alaskan Salmon is told. Climate change has brought about a radical change in the salmon population makeup. During the 1980s, the population comprised of 70% early migrating salmon and 30% late migrating salmon. A genetic tag was placed on the late migrating salmon. Throughout the years, the number of late migrating salmon has dramatically decreased to 5%. This has very interesting implications, as migrational behavior in salmon has proven to be something genetic. This phenomenon is showing natural selection in action. It is generally supposed to be a slow process, but nature itself is also supposed to change more slowly. What we're seeing now could be something similar to a great extinction at work, like the end of the dinosaurs. Although probably much slower than that extinction, rapid changes in the environment caused by us are going on too quickly for many species to keep up with. Incidents like the BP Oil Spill only make it worse. As the polar ice caps continue to melt, changes in the environment will become more and more drastic. Fewer species will be able to keep up and our biodiversity will continue to drop. However, if we are really going through a mass extinction right now, biological history has some good news for us. At the end of this period of mass extinction, a population explosion in many new species should occur. These species will have to be equipped to handle the new environment. What do you think? Is the apparent mass extinction reversible?
