<p>Participants in this study of digital badges came from a network of urban high school afterschool programs called the <i>Afterschool Network</i>. The researchers interviewed students, faculty, program mentors and a college admissions director. The researchers talked in focus groups with students from diverse demographics, which correlated to the diversity found in the participants’ school district. </p>

<p>Interview questions focused on the participants' knowledge of digital badges and their experiences with them while attending the Afterschool Network’s for credit program called <i>Expanded Learning Experiences</i> (ELE). The researchers also asked participants to describe how the digital badges fit in with their goals and other activities within the program, the opportunities that these badges created, and the difficulties that arose during implementation. The researchers recorded and then transcribed and coded the interviews to identify similar themes that emerged across the process. Researchers analyzed these codes and how they related to each other.</p>

<p> Credibility was a major concern for participants, who wondered whether the badges would help students after they left the afterschool program environment and when they were applying to college. Participants were skeptical about quality control in the development of the system and wondered whether it could be trusted.</p>

<p>Teachers stated students were motivated to do more when badges were involved, but some felt that this motivation would ultimately hinge on whether the badges were recognized outside of the Afterschool Network environment. The badge system empowered students to learn at their own pace and take greater control of their educational experiences. </p>

<p>Lastly, the program staff reported that introducing badges into previously established curricula was a challenge. Educating students, staff, faculty, and college admissions officers on what the badges were and how to use them effectively in existing projects was essential to the success of the program. Participants felt that the ability to use the badges to their maximum potential was not something that could be self-taught. </p>

<p>Digital badges are becoming more popular but they are still not fully accepted across the board as valid academic credentials that accurately reflect student achievement. Work still needs to be done in order to educate communities of their potential and validity. Administrative changes, including making sure computer networks are able to support various types of digital badge systems, and making sure badges match up with student educational objectives and their values, will pave the way for greater acceptance of badges as credentialing tools.</p>
