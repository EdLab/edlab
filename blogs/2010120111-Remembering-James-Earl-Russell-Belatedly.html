One of the strangest effects of conducting historical research is the affection one develops for the men and women whose accomplishments and stories you come to know.  Surveying the first 50 volumes of <i>Teachers College Record</i> has certainly brought me “close” to many authors, editors and contributors, so I was saddened when I learned — in <a href="http://www.tcrecord.org/Issue.asp?volyear=1946&number=5&volume=47"> Volume 47, Issue 5 </a> — of the death of the first editor of the journal and the first Dean of the College, <b>James Earl Russell</b>.   In much the same way as the belated news of Professor <b>David Snedden's</b> 1951 suicide (documented in PocketKnowledge) recast my perceptions of and assumptions about the man, the <i>TCR</i> tribute to Dean Russell highlighted many interesting and personal recollections that I thought worth sharing below….

-- <b>May Van Arsdale</b> pointed out that Russell was born “the year in which Abraham Lincoln was re-elected to the presidency.” Wow!

 -- <b>Edward Thorndike</b> also offered a characteristically to-the-point reminiscence: 

<i>“To me he was, among other things, a great Puritan. He despised ostentation and luxury. He was suspicious of pleasure for pleasure's sake, and spent almost no time in games, active or sedentary, or in frequenting concerts and theaters. His nearest approach to deliberate relaxation, apart from family life, was breeding fine Guernsey cattle. His last years were spent in the preparation of a book that would really help young farmers. Most of his pleasure came from doing his duty. He was a Puritan, but never a sour or uncharitable one. He suffered much from asthma but did not complain.”</i>

-- Russell's son and successor as Dean, <b>William F. Russell</b>, likewise recalled his father's struggles with asthma (particularly while writing his Dean's Reports), and shared as well this touching image:

<i>“His sheltering arms were always about me, from the time that he would march me to school past the piles of huge rocks, later to be used to form arches of St. John's Cathedral, down to fifteen months ago when, hardly able to walk, he made the long trip from Trenton to see me when I was ill in New York Hospital. His sheltering arm was around Teachers College.”</i>

I, for one, am simply glad that I got the chance to miss Dean Russell — if only from a great distance.
