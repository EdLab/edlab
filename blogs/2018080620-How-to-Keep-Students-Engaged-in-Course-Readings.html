<p>The famous scene in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhiCFdWeQfA">Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</a> featuring a teacher standing helplessly in front of his class, attempting to spark participation with a group of students who clearly know nothing of the lecture topic, represents one of the worst situations you can find yourself in as a classroom instructor. This happens most frequently when students haven’t properly prepared by reading assigned materials, and it is a sadly <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87567555.2010.509376">common occurrence</a>. How can student reading habits be improved, and how can this change better their performance? A group of researchers decided to use online forums for pre-class reading discussions in physics classes to find out.</p>

<p>Researchers used <a href="https://perusall.com/">Perusall</a>, an online social learning platform developed at Harvard, where the study was conducted, to better understanding student reading patterns, comprehension, and discussion habits in physics classes. They also hoped to see if such a platform could improve performance. Perusall features reading assignments uploaded by instructors and then asks students to annotate the reading through posting comments and replies, upvoting annotations, and reporting confusion.</p> 

<p>Two cohorts of about 75 physics students were included in the study; though both had the same instructor, only one used Perusall. Researchers tracked the amount of time students spent reading, how long before each class students did their reading, and how often they returned to the same reading assignment. They also collected exam results and performance data from prior semesters.</p>

<p>Results revealed that having a social platform on which to read and contribute promoted active reading strategies and produced high-quality learning interactions between students outside of class. Between 90 and 95% of students who used Perusall completed all but a few of the reading assignments before class. Compared to the 92% of students in the non-Perusall group who spent less than three hours on course readings, students in the Perusall group spent an average of three hours and 20 minutes on readings per week. Perusall students also performed better on exams.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to engage in meaningful pre-class reading not only makes students more likely to be prepared for class, it also helps them perform better on tests and, presumably, learn more effectively. While online reading platforms might not yet be the mainstream, this study shows that they hold serious promise for classrooms of all types.</p>
