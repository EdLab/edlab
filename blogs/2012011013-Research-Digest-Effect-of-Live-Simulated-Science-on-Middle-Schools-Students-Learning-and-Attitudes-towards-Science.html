Effect of Live Simulation on Middle School Students' Attitudes and Learning toward Science. <i>Educational Technology & Society, 13</i> (1), 133—139 </a>

<b>Description:</b> This paper describes an experiment preformed by the author to see whether or not a student's attitude towards learning science is better after live simulation learning. The subjects for this experiment were 311 middle-school students, from West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Before the live simulation, learning teachers and students would go over the curriculum and procedure needed for the live simulation, as well as completing surveys on their learning experiences before the live simulation. The live simulation is known as an e-Mission, and the tools used are a video conferencing software and the Internet. Students are divided into teams and are in communication with mission control to solve a “live” problem as the scenario unfolds. The scenario in this experiment was a 1996 volcanic eruption on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, the actual data from the event was used in the live simulation. Students would perform calculations, create graphs, assess the situation and make decisions, based on the new data being delivered to the classroom every couple of minutes from mission control. After the e-Mission, there was another survey filled out by the students about their learning experience. The results showed a significant increase in students perceptions towards scientists, and their attitude towards science. It also notes that males generally have a larger interest in the science subject than females. Further research will be done to compare students learning through live simulations, and students who do not.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> This paper shows a great way to get more students interested in STEM education, specifically in science as it attempts to give students a more positive perception on scientists. It also shows that simulation learning is a great way for students to apply their skills and motivate them towards advance learning. There is a huge problem in the STEM education field where many students aren't motivated to learn in the classroom, let alone outside of the classroom. It will be interesting to see EdLab's take on simulated learning, for any subject, as we try to envision new ways of educating that are more effective than traditional means.
