          <p>
            Living in the South Bronx is not that bad, but knowing that many schools struggle to have their students graduate high school is really a let down. I've lived in the South Bronx most of my life, but I've never attended any school in the Bronx. I was always told not to attend a school in the Bronx because they were so bad. Now I hear there are a lots of improvement in schools in the bronx, I recently read an article about a school in the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/south-bronx-prep-school-graduates-class-article-1.1383174">South Bronx</a>.

The only prep school in the South Bronx recently had its first graduating class. 62 out of the 66 12th graders graduated from this high school, which surpassed the citywide average of 64.7%. They worked on convincing students that completing high school was the first step with the college the ultimate goal. 

The aforementioned article made me proud to know that there is actually a good school in the Bronx. I hope and wish for more improvements in the South Bronx. I feel there should be a lot more schools with the motivation of making students focus not only on graduating but also moving on to higher education.
