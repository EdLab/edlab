<p><b>Title:</b> The Future of Teaching Programming is on Mobile Devices (2012)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Nikolai Tillmann, Michal Moskal, Jonathan de Halleux, Manuel Fahndrich, Judith Bishop, Arjmand Samuel, & Tao Xie</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Today’s students live in a mobile world. The Pew Research Center <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TeensandTechnology2013.pdf">estimates</a> that 78% of teens own a mobile phone and more than half use a smartphone for communication, recreation, and access to personal data and media. In this increasingly digital world, mobile programming has become an essential skill. Programming on their own devices gives students an experience of coding that is directly applicable to their daily lives. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2325336">The Future of Teaching Programming is on Mobile Devices</a> describes a tool called <a href="https://www.touchdevelop.com/">TouchDevelop</a>, an app that provides a framework for programming on smartphones.</p>

<p>TouchDevelop is available as a free application on the Windows Phone Marketplace. There are currently more than 3,000 user-created games and applications in the library, from Tetris knockoffs to utilities like speech recognition. The authors piloted the TouchDevelop app in 2 high schools for 9 weeks, and 19 games were developed by students during that time. They further tested the application in a computer science class where the students had learned introductory programming concepts, but had no experience with mobile programming. All of the participants were able to create new applications using TouchDevelop in the course of 90 minute class sessions. These results were so convincing that the researchers, who are affiliated with Microsoft’s research team, were invited into a middle school to work with 8th grade students. The company provided devices and participants worked in groups of two. After a brief introduction to TouchDevelop, the students had 60-minutes to explore the language and write their own mobile applications.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The participants filled out questionnaires before and after the session. Before class, only 12% of the students stated that they had programming knowledge with 43% reporting that they had no experience with programming. 61% of the students in the study did not own a smartphone. Most of the student participants reported that creating an application in Touchdevelop was difficult or somewhat difficult, but 86% of the students wanted to create more applications in the system. Among girls in the study, in the pre-survey only 38% reported that they were aware of mobile programming concepts, but afterwards 92% wanted to continue writing applications.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
This study did not test learning outcomes with the TouchDevelop system, but did suggest a unique role for programming in learning and teaching. Students in the study reported that coding in TouchDevleop was difficult, but they wanted to continue learning about mobile development and app creation. Perhaps the direct application of programming for mobile and touchscreens made the difficult task of development seem useful to students. Most existing curricula cover desktop-focused programming languages, but the growth of handheld computing and the increasing acceptance of BYOD programs means that teaching mobile programming will become a more viable option. This study suggests that mobile connections may be a direct path to student engagement with this challenging subject.</p>
