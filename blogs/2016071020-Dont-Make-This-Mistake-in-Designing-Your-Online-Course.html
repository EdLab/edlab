<p>Retention rates for online freshman math courses are alarmingly low, and so researchers are looking for ways to enhance the online learning experience. The focus of this particular study was to see if replacing publisher-generated content (e-books, animations, and guided tutorials produced by publishers) with videos created by actual instructors would improve overall student performance.</p>
 
<p>As learning systems like <a href="https://www.aleks.com/">ALEKS</a> and <a href="http://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/mymathlab/">MyMathLab</a> appear more frequently in online courses, instructors should question whether they're too reliant on these tools without enough supporting pedagogy. The author of this study notes that a strong teacher presence has an enormous effect on class climate and the overall learning experience. This study focused on students who self-enrolled in an online college algebra course that utilized MyMathLab and a lecture capture system. The original course was in 2012, and the redesigned course, which used instructor-generated video lectures and note-taking sheets instead of the publisher-generated ones, took place in the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
 
<p>Although the differences in homework assignment results were not statistically significant between the original and redesigned course, the online quizzes and exams, as well as the handwritten midterm and final, all showed that students in the redesigned course performed significantly better than their counterparts in the original course.</p>

<p>The author concludes that because the redesigned course puts the instructor at the center of the course, the students were able to de-emphasize procedural or rote learning and focus on conceptual understanding. With so much effort being thrown into developing high quality online courses, this study may be an important one to consider, so that enrolled students get the holistic learning experience they signed up for instead of dropping out due to lack of engagement.</p>
