<p>The researchers behind this project are rethinking assessment. Dissatisfied with grading systems that focus on final grades while neglecting to cultivate student motivation, they designed a game-based assessment model called GameCraft and tested its efficacy in three undergraduate classrooms. In the GameCraft model, 40% of each studentâ€™s grade is determined by criteria set by the instructor. For the remaining 60%, the student chooses from among various types of assignments, deciding both which to complete and how much weight would be given to each. Certain assignments also earn students badges, which they can use to improve their grade, make up for absences, or unlock assignments. The purpose of this game-based grading system is to engage and motivate students by offering them greater autonomy.</p>
 
<p>The researchers employed slightly different iterations of their game-based grading system in three different college classes. At the end of each semester, they requested feedback about the system through online surveys. A total of 492 students completed the survey. The researchers found that students who liked the system also thought it was fair, gave them more control, and made it easier for them to get good grades. Students who were high performers in traditional grading systems, however, held more negative views of the gamified system. They considered it harder to achieve their desired grade in this new system and did not perceive it as fair.</p>
 
<p>This study presents a creative new approach to grading that might engage and motivate traditionally underperforming or unengaged students. However, more research must be done to offer a complete comparison between the effectiveness of gamified assessment and more traditional models.</p>
