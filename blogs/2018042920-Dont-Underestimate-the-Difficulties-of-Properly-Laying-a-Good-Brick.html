<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/osh2.pdf">U.S. Department of Labor</a> reported that in 2015, 31% of all nonfatal illnesses and injuries requiring time off from work were due to musculoskeletal disorders, including strains, sprains, or tears from overexertion and lifting. Construction workers, including masons, are particularly susceptible to these sorts of injuries due to the nature of their work. Based on previous research establishing experienced journeymen as suffering fewer injuries than apprentices, researchers from the University of Waterloo decided to use motion sensors and AI software to better understand what expert masons were doing differently.</p>
 
<p>The study utilized 21 participants with varying levels of expertise, ranging from complete novices to those with 15+ years of experience. Each participant laid 45 masonry blocks on a wall in five sessions while wearing a full-body motion capture suit. This suit collected data on posture, captured 3D motion, and tracked key angles and joints in the knees, hips, wrists, and C7-T1 junction (at the base of the neck). Besides this kinematics data, visual data was also collected from three video cameras that followed the participants’ movements through their work.</p>
 
<p>Though it is not surprising this study revealed that expert masons experience less joint stress and novices and apprentices often take unsafe poses while working, what was surprising was that many of the techniques used by the experts are not typically the ones being taught to newer masons. Experts carried bricks close to the torso, reducing the load on the lower back, and their poses generally shifted load-carrying to the hips, while novices relied more on their backs. Masons with more experience also had a specific way of swinging bricks rather than lifting, causing their backs to bend less and improving the efficiency and quality of their work.</p>

<p>The information gained in this study can be translated into human posture models and training materials for those entering construction-related professions. Researchers also commented on the potential of equipping companies with motion capture suits to train and prevent injuries in new workers in various fields of manual labor. This way, they can receive immediate feedback and modify movement to relieve their body of unnecessary and harmful stress. Overall, the information yielded by this study could lead to smarter training practices that benefit both workers and employers.
