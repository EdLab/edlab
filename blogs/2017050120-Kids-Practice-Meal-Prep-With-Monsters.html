<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lala-lunchbox/id519037961?ls=1&mt=8">Lala Lunchbox</a> is a free meal planning app designed to help kids and parents plan school lunches. Families can meal prep together by using this fun app to involve kids in the meal planning process.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>New ideas in nutrition and family meal planning are inspiring new products like <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4237/getting-kids-involved-in-cooking">Nomster Chef</a>, Pinterest boards, and apps like LaLa Lunchbox. The user experience within LaLa Lunchbox is clear, simple, and easy to navigate. Kids create a virtual lunchbox with a monster of their choice to feed and are encouraged to select healthy foods for their monster to eat. Children can learn about the food groups by choosing up to six items from typical food categories like grains or fruits to create their meals. An itemized grocery list then shows parents what their kids have selected for their monsters, or themselves, to eat for the week.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The biggest drawback of LaLa Lunchbox is that it attempts to target both parents and kids without a structured co-play approach. The app doesn’t have parental gates for areas not meant for kids, so young users could rack up in-app purchases or edit sections meant for parents like the grocery list. While the design is geared toward young children, the tasks required of kids, such as selecting calendar dates, may be a bit above their understanding and require parental help. Though the monster illustrations are fun, the app doesn’t teach kids about balanced eating. For example, a kid could ‘feed’ their monster 6 fruits without including any veggies, grains, or protein.</p>
 
<p>Another obstacle to children’s independent use of Lala Lunchbox is the social media integration throughout the app. The parent-targeted inspiration page links directly to an Instagram feed of lunch ideas. While these types of ideas are of perennial interest to parents, this integration seemed a bit unnatural as it takes users out of the app. A better use of this space could be to provide completed meals that can be easily added to feed your monster. The pre-made lunch feature is available but only as an additional in-app purchase.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Lala Lunchbox is a simple way to include kid’s preferences in school lunch planning. However, it requires parents and kids to use the app together as many sections are not appropriate for young users. For parents with picky eaters and free time on their hands, this would be a fun app to playfully consider their kids’ input when meal planning.</p>
