          <p>
            English language is being taught in many countries around the world. As a result, there is a need to have the right teachers to ensure that students acquire proficiency. A <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/international/21643148-why-are-countries-failing-so-badly-teaching-english-mute-leading-mute" target = "blank">recent survey</a> found that in Mexico, students usually lack interest in learning English because their teachers cannot speak English. Teachers are required to take written tests but not oral ones. Other surveys indicate that the situation is similar in other countries across the globe. In most cases, teachers lack of fluency in English means there is little or no conversation in English during English language lessons. Others blamed the inability of English teachers to perform in non English-speaking countries on the increasing demand from parents for their kids to learn English.

I believe this is a problem that should be solved by all governments that are involved. Teachers should be given both oral and written tests in order to test their proficiency. Students will not be able to communicate in a language if they don't ask questions in that particular language. For instance in Ghana (where I grew up), French teachers were mostly native French speakers because Ghana is an English-speaking country. I believe students will learn better if their teachers understand what they teach.
