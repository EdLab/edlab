            Business leaders and educators are turning to new technologies to fill jobs and train workers. Development in technology, science and engineering has created a gap between the need and availability of skills required in the market, which in turn is making it difficult to fill critical jobs.
A study has revealed that many students feel it is the on-the-job skills that got them through their daily workload and not what they learnt in college. While it is necessary for colleges and universities to remain focused on education rather than skills training, many educators have acknowledged the skills gap and are trying new methods, based on skills assessment online practices and group-based online learning to find and train the workforce needed today.
Many Fortune500 companies- especially in technology-based industries- are using hiring practices that place more emphasis on skills and aptitude. People from different work places- like mailroom employees, pizza franchise workers, retail shelf-stockers and many others- have been employed into high-level management positions solely based on their aptitude skills. Previously untapped workers can now gain entry to fields that were once closed to them.
The skills gap is a real threat to productivity in the U.S. The education world and the professional world can address this issue by finding ways to work together with the help of online education, opening up more avenues to learners and employees alike based on skill and ability.
