            <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01215.x/full">Selwyn, N. (2011), Editorial: In praise of pessimism–the need for negativity in educational technology. British Journal of Educational Technology, 42: 713—718</a>

I'm often surprised by how optimistic predictions about the future of educational technology can be.  By nature my personality is somewhat cynical, and I rarely generate more than lukewarm enthusiasm for even the most promising of endeavors, and so I had previously assumed that my skeptical response to some of the more utopian claims in the field was a natural and meaningless response.  However, in the latest issue of the British Journal of Educational Technology is featured an editorial by Neil Selwyn titled “In praise of pessimism,” which gives me the cover and justification I need to discuss this issue.
<!--break-->

<b>Description</b>:

Mr. Selwyn has noticed the same trends I have: “Educational technology is an essentially ‘positive project.' Most people working in this area are driven by an underlying belief that digital technologies are–in some way–capable of improving education.”  This is, of course, reasonable, and to be expected (why else would they be working in the area?), but he further goes on to argue that “this optimistic view of the potential of education and technology runs counter to many of the recent realities of educational technology use. As anyone familiar with education provision or practice will attest, fundamental elements of contemporary learning and teaching have remained largely untouched by the waves of digital technologies that have been introduced inside and outside of the classroom over the last three decades. Despite repeated predictions of inevitable change and impending transformation, digital technologies are used inconsistently in educational settings, usually with little large-scale conclusive ‘effect.'”

Essentially, he believes this optimism in the face of disappointment or too-narrow progress has misled inquiry in the field, leading academics and teachers to focus too much on Utopian and unrealistic projects, and neglect the more day-to-day applications in which progress might actually be made.  “It is simply not good enough to look only for instances of where educational technology ‘works', or to focus solely on examples of ‘best practice' and the ‘leading edge.'”  More pessimism, he believes, will help the field move away from science fiction daydreaming and towards developing practical applications.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:

Some of the wilder daydreaming comes from dreams of becoming the next Zuckerberg, and some from panic about the state of American education, but generally speaking it's better to strive to be useful than revolutionary.  This is what impressed me, for instance, about the company <a href="http://www.proctoru.com/">ProctorU</a> that came and <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/504">visited us</a> a few months ago.  The technology they used was clunky, and their product wasn't a grand new innovation in the educational field, but it was because of their humility, not despite it, that they were able to solve a small but meaningful problem and find their niche in the world.
