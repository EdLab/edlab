<p><a href="http://www.showme.com/">ShowMe</a> is an iPad app and a web platform that allows users to create lessons using the app and share them with other users on the web. The ShowMe app empowers educators to create lessons on a handheld whiteboard analog. The app is able to record audio and actions on the iPad whiteboard to produce a shareable video. The web platform allows users to upload their own video lessons and browse through video lessons uploaded by other users. The tool would be appropriate for flipped or blended learning classrooms because it facilitates sharing video lessons between teachers and students. This app and web platform combo can promote both passive and active learning; students can learn from watching teacher-created videos but they can also use the app to create their own videos for a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>ShowMe simplifies the video lesson creation process for both teachers and students. The app provides the tools needed to create video lessons and makes it easy for students to demonstrate their knowledge to their peers and the ShowMe community. Creating a video lesson is easy, and the tools provided are intuitive enough for novice iPad users. Creating a video is as easy as pressing record and "writing" on the whiteboard with a finger while speaking. Images stored locally or taken with the iPadâ€™s camera can also be added to the whiteboard and annotated. This tool is useful for analyzing images, charts, and graphs.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Creating and viewing video lessons is an excellent strategy for learning new concepts, but the site could benefit from integrating quizzes and polls into the video lessons. The only way students can currently interact with the lessons is through "liking" a video. A comments section on video lessons would also be a useful addition. This would give students a chance to ask questions and provide feedback, which might provide a deeper learning experience, especially in the case of student-created videos.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>ShowMe is a unique tool that allows users both to consume and to produce learning content. The student video creation feature has the potential to model critical consumption in an age of information overload. Creating content and remixing knowledge have the potential to promote deeper learning. If the ShowMe team develops their platform into a customizable video creation app with a low barrier to entry, then they could cinch the market in what is sure to be a pillar of engaged e-learning. ShowMe has the potential to become an interactive community of learning.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>ShowMe blurs the line between educators and learners.</p>
