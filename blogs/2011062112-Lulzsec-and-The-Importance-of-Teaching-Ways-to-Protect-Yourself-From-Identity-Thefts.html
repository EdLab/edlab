            Have you heard of Lulzsec? Well, if you haven't, then you probably didn't know that they recently released over 60,000 email-password combinations hacked from popular organizations like-they claim-Paypal, facebook, twitter, etc.-to the general public. If you haven't, you should probably make sure you check against that quite easily-accessible list so that your personal information has not been compromised.

This cyber-terrorist group claims to be standing up against the corrupt governments and financial organizations-as well as rich people in general-from hoarding all privacy information for themselves. They recently "declared war" against the aforementioned group, rallying all discontented nerds to openly attack to send out a message.

Organizations such as Lulzsec must remind us the importance of teaching to the children how to guard from identity crimes. Nowadays, even elementary schoolers have at least some form of email and facebook. However, they are often left out in the open when it comes to practicing smart ways to protect themselves from those that would do them harm.


Posting something on the internet is like spreading salt in sea water: there's absolutely no way to get your grains of salt back. It must be emphasized in the current educational system that even if they don't leak the info themselves, someone out there is trying very hard to do so.
