          <p>
            <i>As the New Learning Times (NLT) team continues to generate more content streams, I was inspired to revisit a previous, albeit brief, content stream I started two years ago concerning <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2526">school finance laws</a> (sadly only two posts on this topic). Though I am not sure if or how this might potentially fit the overall NLT mission, I want this content stream to focus specifically on highlighting previous and current trends in educational policy (legal, finance, curriculum, etc.). Please see the post below to get a sense of where I am heading with this and any thoughts on the content, a possible format for the content stream and where it might fit with NLT or other EdLab projects.</i>

<b>What is school finance reform?</b>

For the better part of the early 20th century, most education related legal cases concerned segregation of public schools, which on face value was seen as a moral and social issue (which it was) but also concerned financial inequalities. Once the Supreme Court ruled its unconstitutionality using the 14th amendment's Equal Protection Clause, segregation, for the time been, took a backseat to other legal educational issues such as student and teacher rights, and state funding of schools.

As it had been the case with segregation, proponents for equal educational funding used the constitution's equal protection clause to argue for a change in how states funded public schools. Most local school systems receive a fair amount of their total school budget from revenue generated through taxes collected among that district's residents. Contrary to popular belief, the most commonly used determinant of a school district's wealth is the property tax of that particular district and not the income wealth of its residents.  

Since property tax is the most commonly used factor in determining the wealth of a school system, the ratio is then taxable property (houses, factories, utilities, natural resources, etc.) divided by the number of students. Therefore, logic goes that a “wealthy” school system will have more valuable property and fewer students while “poor” school districts will have less valuable property and more students. Opponents of this system argue that wealthy school systems can raise more money due to lower tax rates than poor school systems. Since education is the duty of the state, allowing such a system to operate favors the wealthy and leave students in poor school systems at a disadvantage.
