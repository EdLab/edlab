<p><a href="http://www.edupath.com/">College Passport - SAT Edition</a> is a college preparatory application developed by the <a href="http://www.edupath.com/about/">Edupath company</a> based in Berkeley, California. Marketed as a high school student’s only necessary tool for keeping track of the application process, this app provides SAT training, school searches, and a task manager. It includes detailed timelines and it highlights the end goal of enrolling in the student’s dream school as a motivator. It focuses on customization, and bases the task list on the particular schools the student saves. The SAT prep is also tailored to each user, as the program continues to learn the student’s strengths and weaknesses and adapts the practice questions accordingly to help improve overall section scores.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The SAT prep provided in this app is quite extensive. There are many practice questions, and each has a detailed solution. There are also timed drills and evaluations of student progress. The school explorer is another highly beneficial aspect of College Passport. By providing many details about colleges at a glance, it helps students to get an idea of the type of schools that best fit their needs and goals. There are also suggested schools based on the student profile information. Knowing stats about a school, such as what type of setting it is in (urban, suburban), how high the tuition typically is, and how many students there are, is extremely helpful to narrowing down the pool of choices. Finally, you can invite parents to see your progress by granting them access to your SAT prep reports and your list of schools and timelines.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The sources that the app draws its information from are sometimes unclear. Although all facts and figures are taken from the US Department of Education, everything else is from multiple unknown sources, as the website’s <a href="http://www.edupath.com/faq/">FAQ page</a> shows. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the quality of the information. At times, the tone can be quite sarcastic which appears inappropriate for an app designed to present general stats and overviews about schools to help students decide upon the best fit for their college experiences. In the customized task manager, the app will automatically find deadlines and application requirements for the schools student select. However, you cannot alter any of this information, so if the information is somehow outdated or incorrect, you are unable to fix it.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>College Passport - SAT Edition is certainly a useful tool for high school students who are trying to plan their college application processes. The SAT prep is also extremely helpful, with many opportunities for practice questions, drills, and self-evaluation. Although the customized timeline and task manager for each college gives an idea of what is required for admission, it is unclear how reliable this information is and should probably only be used as a guideline, with students checking the websites of the schools for the most accurate information. If the task manager could be edited by the user, this would be a much more comprehensive tool for the application process. As it stands, it is worth using for the stellar SAT prep on the go, the school explorer, and even the task manager, if only as a general guideline rather than an exact list of what needs to be done. </p>
