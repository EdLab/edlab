February 6, 2011, is the one hundredth anniversary of Ronald Reagan's birth. To mark the occasion, Ron Reagan has written <em>My Father at 100</em>,  an intimate look at the life of his father-one of the most popular  presidents in American history-told from the perspective of someone who  knew Ronald Reagan better than any adviser, friend, or colleague. As he  grew up under his father's watchful gaze, he observed the very qualities  that made the future president a powerful leader. Yet for all of their  shared experiences of horseback rides and touch football games, there  was much that Ron never knew about his father's past, and in <em>My Father at 100</em>,  he sets out to understand this beloved, if often enigmatic, figure who  turned his early tribulations into a stunning political career.

Since his death in 2004, President Reagan has been a galvanizing force  that personifies the values of an older America and represents an  important era in national history. Ron Reagan traces the sources of  these values in his father's early years and offers a heartfelt portrait  of a man and his country-and his personal memories of the president he  knew as "Dad."
