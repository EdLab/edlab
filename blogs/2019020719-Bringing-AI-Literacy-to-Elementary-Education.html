<p>Although there are many workshops and curriculum pushes for coding and computer science, the realm of artificial intelligence is only just beginning to make its way into elementary education. The <a href="http://mitmedialab.github.io/cognimates-website/projects/">Cognimates</a> platform is expanding opportunities in this area by providing teachers and children ages 7-10 with AI programming activities and games. Using Cognimates, kids can get a better sense of a feedback loop, where a computer program learns from the information they feed it. The more information you convey, the smarter it will become.</p>

<p>Learning how AI works is an essential part of modern-day education according to Cognimates creator Stefania Druga and the director of the Personal Robots group at the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>, Cynthia Breazeal, and it can best be accomplished through hands-on engagement. Although the activities presented on the Cognimates platform mostly involve silly or fun games such as rock, paper, scissors, the skills these games teach are shaping the future of an education that includes AI literacy. AI is sure to play a greater part in kids’ lives as they age, and with an early understanding of how this technology works, they’ll be better equipped to help shape that future.</p>

<p>Do you think AI education is essential for children today? Should this subject matter be taught within school hours or as an after school activity? Join the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47747">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:17 Melanie Hering:</b> I think framing the activity as kids teaching computers is brilliant; the authority that comes from being able to teach someone something is really empowering and also reinforces those concepts they're teaching.</p>

<p><b>@01:42 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> It's exciting and relevant to have kids work with AI and experience machine learning. I hope as AI curriculum develops, however, it also emphasizes the ways machine learning differs from human learning. For example, a robot can't care or be motivated to learn the same way these students are.</p>
