          <p>
            Technology today pervades every inch of our society.  You can see technology everywhere from our personal homes, to even in parks and fields.  Nobody can really argue with the benefits that technology has bestowed upon us, since it helped revolutionize our world as we know it.  It has helped us improve communication, transportation, and research.  

However, with the advent of technology, comes a very big negative. Just like how a child seems to drift towards any new stimulus, we as a generation of people have gravitated towards the technology that is readily available to us.  New inventions like the Nook, the smartphone, and the personal computers have rendered previously important inventions, such as the book, completely obsolete.  Nowadays, people read through their personal rather than through their books, and there is a growing concern with the younger generations and their dependance on simple electronics.

The video below explains how to read a book in excruciating detail, almost to the point where we are dumbfounded in the way the speaker explains it.  It is almost as if she is treating us like a baby.  She simultaneously criticizes technology while she teaches us how to read, by saying things such as "you won't be able to swipe to turn a page, but don't worry your book isn't broken".

It was a very interesting video that focused more on the negative effects of technology rather than teaching us how to read.  My concern for the future is that one day, we might actually need these types of videos to be able to access such archaic objects.
