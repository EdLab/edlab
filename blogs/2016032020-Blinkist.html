<p><a href="https://app.blinkist.com/">Blinkist</a> is an app that houses the abridged versions of all the nonfiction reads that you want to commit to but don’t have the time for. It is the digital bookshelf of works published to make you the businessperson you strive to be, and the athlete or romantic partner you’ve dreamt of becoming—all this in the time it takes you to wait in line, order your coffee, and vacate your frequented cafe. If Blinkist sounds too good to be true, that’s because it comes at a price of $4.99 per month. Completing a literary endeavor in fifteen minutes definitely beats slowly scaling your local library’s lengthy wait list for the newest catch in nonfiction. </p>

 <p>Blinkist introduces you to its interface with a category selection. Some of these options are Self-Help, Business & Management, Psychology, Health & Fitness, and Politics & Society. These genres surely pique the interests of those lacking the time for a leisurely read. The nuggets of information contained in the 10-15 pages of my own nonfiction choices were not only substantial, but also well crafted in their brevity. I now know how to practice mindfulness on a subway train in five steps. Once finished with the read, the app suggests related options and provides a feedback text box. Let’s hope that the designers are as speedy as their reads when replying to your concerns. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>It seems hard to believe that this idea could be novel in our bite-sized learning era. Podcasts condense stories and abstracts make articles digestible. The benefit of this app is that it curates your personal interests, has a consistently growing database of books, and accommodates your on-the-go lifestyle. You can sync the reads to your Kindle and then info-snack choosing either form for consumption: audio or text. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The downside of this app is probably the mirror it shines on humanity’s increasingly impatient lifestyle, our shelved priorities, and of course, the fact that we are willing to pay for it. Sure, it prepares us for the 15 minutes of time waiting at a bar for our tardy date who will be astounded by our newfound knowledge; meanwhile, authors conducting research and threading words together in seamless perfection around the clock are probably cringing. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> There is a time and place for respite on the couch, reading the findings of groundbreaking researchers in entirety. There are also times where we are confined, cramped, and trying to kill time. For these latter moments, Blinkist can leave you feeling less guilty about speed-reading your library book a day before it’s overdue. This app helps make killing time something to anticipate eagerly. </p>
