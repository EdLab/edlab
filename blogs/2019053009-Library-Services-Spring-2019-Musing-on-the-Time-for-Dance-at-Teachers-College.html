          <p>
            When the new doctoral program in Dance Education welcomed its first cohort of students in the 2018-2019 academic year, the library was presented with an exceptional opportunity: to <a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2019/05/Patricia-Dye-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2502.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32889"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32889" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Patricia-Dye-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2502-150x150.jpg" alt="Patricia-Dye-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2502" width="150" height="150" /></a>collaborate with faculty and students (through our document delivery service and other mechanisms) in building the collection in support of their research needs, to identify and make accessible the best resources in the field already available through Gottesman and the Columbia University Libraries,  and to begin
a conversation with program participants on how best to facilitate and promote their scholarly endeavors, in order to assure their access to resources and services for the enrichment of their academic lives on Morningside Heights and of course elsewhere in the city.

I was fortunate to make contact in Fall 2018 with members of the incoming cohort to answer questions about past dance education dissertations done at Teachers College and <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Joan-Finkelstein-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2024-copy.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32891"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32891" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Joan-Finkelstein-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2024-copy-150x150.jpg" alt="Joan-Finkelstein-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2024-copy" width="150" height="150" /></a>other resources, and in January of this year I began a correspondence with Professor Barbara Bashaw about access to various e-resources through our library and Columbia University Libraries, and about our compiling an online research guide to address the research needs of the Dance Education program in general and more specifically those of the course she was teaching this semester, <em>Historical Foundations of Dance Education</em>.  We also discussed her bringing her students to the library for a class session, and because providing presentations of this kind, and building research guides to accompany them, are key component of my work, I was happy to schedule a library information session to take place during her regular class meeting time.

I find that preparing to meet with a class (gleaning as much as I can about the principal<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Susan-Pope-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2239-.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32887"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-32887" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Susan-Pope-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2239--150x150.jpg" alt="Susan-Pope-TCCU-EdD-Dance-Ed-Program-2239-" width="150" height="150" /></a> foci of the course, topics or resources that the instructor would like me to be sure to cover, and the research interests of the students, whether discipline- or subject-specific) in conjunction with compiling a research guide (an annotated bibliography listing, within key categories, a selection of salient printed and electronic resources germane to the course and to students' research concerns,  and also detailing library services crucial to student success both in the course and in general) comprise a significant part of the satisfaction I take from my work.

My research guide for the <em>Historical Foundations</em> course includes resources, primarily electronic, for research in the field, within categories that include online catalogs, <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Jennie-Miller-Photography.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-32995"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-32995" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Jennie-Miller-Photography-150x150.jpg" alt="Jennie-Miller-Photography" width="150" height="150" /></a>periodical indexes, encyclopedias and dictionaries, e-collections, handbooks of research, reviews of research, and digital archives.  The process of identifying resources available through our library and Columbia's libraries, is in itself a process akin to detective work, and I find it immensely satisfying to uncover unexpected and (to me) entirely unfamiliar treasures among the holdings of Gottesman and CU Libraries.  My <a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/refman/library-resources-and-services-for-ahd-5046-historical-foundations-and-contemporary-issues-in-dance-education">guide</a>, which resides on our library's blog <em>Learning at the Libraries</em>, will remain permanently in place, and it will be updated over time as new resources emerge or are brought to my attention.

The most exhilarating part of the overall process, the real payoff, is of course actually meeting with the students and the instructor, both as a group in the classroom setting and<a href="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Full-Dance-Ed-Group-2184.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-33002"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33002" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2019/05/Full-Dance-Ed-Group-2184-150x150.jpg" alt="Full-Dance-Ed-Group-2184" width="150" height="150" /></a> (often) individually through one-on-one research consultations.  The 10 students in the Historical Foundations course, along with Professor Bashaw, are amazingly accomplished, to which their <a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/arts-and-humanities/dance-education/current-students/">biographies</a> on the Dance Education program website eloquently attest.  I can't make any claim for my own "performance" in the role of library "instructor," but without question the students expressed in class their enthusiasm about the e-resources (which are genuinely rich and ultimately integral to their research) and their appreciation of my efforts.  They were kind enough to send me a thank you remembrance that I consider unparalleled among acknowledgements from class members (see below).  I am most grateful for having had the privilege of working with this first Dance Education doctoral cohort, and I wish them and the program great success in the future.
