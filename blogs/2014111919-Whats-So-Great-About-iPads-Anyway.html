<p>Since its release in 2010, the iPad has become a formidable educational force, but has it really revolutionized teaching and learning in elementary classrooms? The authors conducted a mixed-methods case study of the implementation of a 1:1 iPad initiative in an independent PreK-4 elementary school. Observations, interviews, and an online survey helped the researchers examine the beliefs of administrators and educators around the use of iPads with students.</p>

<p>Teachers and students used iPads for differentiated teaching and learning across multiple content areas. Most teachers integrated the iPads with their classroom curricula to complement or enhance their conventional lessons and to provide choices for studentsâ€™ learning. The tool not only helped to address content for learners at different academic levels but also provided differentiated processes for individual students sharing a classroom, including those with special needs, to learn at their own pace. However, the authors found that these individualized experiences needed to be closely monitored by teachers. For example, some students strategically worked on the earlier levels of educational games though they could handle more advanced content, and teachers had to guide them to more advanced levels and teach the ethical aspects of "gaming the system."</p>

<p>In addition, the iPads provided fun, multisensory platforms for students to customize their own experience as well as their classroom lives. For example, visual learners were guided to take pictures of objects and label them while auditory learners were encouraged to record and listen to themselves reading. Students were given choices for the presentation and production of their schoolwork including choosing among technologies like iMovie, Keynote presentations, iStopMotion, and BookCreator.</p>

<p>The study contributes to the literature on classroom-based integration of iPads. It could further inform practices in public school settings for how iPads and other tablets might be used with small groups of students to support their various learning needs and to create new spaces for them to approach knowledge across content areas.</p>
