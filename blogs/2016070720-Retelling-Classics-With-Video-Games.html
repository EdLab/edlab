<p>A class in Connecticut found a new way to keep the classics alive: through video games. What started as an experimental theater project became the focus of one teacher’s English class as students reimagined stories from Ovid’s Metamorphoses through Halo. Using the game’s original characters as puppets, the class choreographed and blocked their production on a theater-sized screen. As the characters walked through the staged story, the students added voiceovers, music, and lighting to make it a true theatrical production.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition between classics and video games asks us to consider how we can bridge the ancient and modern worlds. Of course, even with the best choreography, Halo can only offer a loose interpretation of a classic text. Despite this, the students who created this play seemed excited by the Metamorphoses, a text that teens tend to find archaic or dull. In light of this project, perhaps connecting the ancient and modern worlds is as simple as using technology to bridge the gap.</p>

<p>Do the classics need to be adapted to contemporary lifestyles and technology in order to be taught? Can reimagining a classic story truly capture its essence? Join the discussion

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:59 jennyshen:</b> I never would have associated classic plays with video games before this. It's interesting having students narrate; it prompts them to make observations and interpret what is happening in each situation, which is an important skill in literacy, just through the video game interface rather than through traditional text.</p>

<p><b>@01:19 ABARRY:</b> I like the idea. However, I don't think using games with firearms is the right way to depict a play.</p>
