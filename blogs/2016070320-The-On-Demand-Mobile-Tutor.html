<p>Students today may be all too familiar with the experience of getting stuck on a homework problem, texting a picture of it to a classmate, and waiting impatiently for some kind of response. There is never a guarantee of a response, and classmates might be just as stuck. <a href="http://www.gotitapp.co/">GotIt!</a> is revamping that experience entirely. Students can get homework help on math, chemistry, and physics problems by taking a picture of the problem through the app, after which they're immediately connected to a GotIt! expert, who provides ten minutes of explanations.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>GotIt! offers help in eight subjects: algebra, algebra 2, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, calculus, chemistry, and physics. Each subject has certified experts who will answer any questions through live chat. These paid experts have to apply through GotIt! by completing a content-based test and undergoing a quick training session. The experts are trained to guide the user through understanding the problem rather than simply providing the answer on its own. </p>

<p>Each conversation starts with the expert prompting the user to identify what about the problem they don't understand. This is an important part of developing learning autonomy, and it is a positive model for homework support, especially for those who are used to asking for help and getting <i>what</i> the answer is rather than <i>how</i> to get there.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>GotIt! only offers subjects that are heavy on numbers and computation, so students looking for English or biology help are out of luck. GotIt! also only provides a short help session, ideal for just one homework problem, so students who are really struggling with a concept may do better to seek one-on-one in-person help. In-person tutoring can provide the interactive, adjustable support unavailable through the GotIt! model.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Anyone who has been stuck on a homework problem for what felt like ages can sympathize with the amount of frustration that will follow. GotIt! provides a fantastic, quick solution to this problem, without providing <i>only</i> the solution, so that students can walk away understanding challenging concepts from class.</p>
