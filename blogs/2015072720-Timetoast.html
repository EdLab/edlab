<p><a href="http://www.timetoast.com">Timetoast</a> is a website that allows users to create their own interactive timelines for free. Timelines can be saved in categories, such as music and history. Users can browse through timelines that others have created and view popular and featured timelines. When developing timelines, users set a timeframe and create specific points to represent events. Each event displays a date, title, and thumbnail. When clicked, the window expands to show a longer and more detailed description of the historical moment.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Timetoast is very simple to use, and is more exciting than the average static timeline. When scrolling over the timeline, each point illuminates to catch the eye with little pictures and titles. This ensures that it is quick and easy to see events at a glance to determine which ones the user may want to expand to investigate further. Timelines can be viewed either horizontally or vertically, and are even printer-friendly. Timetoast is easy to access from anywhere with an internet connection, which makes it a good option for classroom or homework assignments. It has both a full and a mobile version.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some might find the overall simplicity of this website to be disappointing. Those looking to really jazz up their timeline with colors or pizzazz wonâ€™t find options that allow them to deviate from the stock format. Also, when trying to search for a specific timeline, it almost never seems to come up, which is a definite downside.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Timetoast is super simple, but could be useful as a classroom assignment to get students to start interacting with technology. It is also a fun resource to use to create personal timelines, to use as study aids or to keep track of events when learning about a subject. Educators may also want to use Timetoast within lessons to provide visuals for a sequence of events as they teach new topics. Since it is free and especially easy to use, it is perfect for teachers looking to ease into incorporating digital technology into their lessons.</p>
