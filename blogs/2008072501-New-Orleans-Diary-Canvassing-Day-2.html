          <p>
            Day two of canvassing wasn't as intriguing and eye-opening as the first day. The neighborhood was an equal mix of African Americans and Caucasians (the first I've seen in either the Upper or Lower Ninth Ward) and a plethora of art studios that reminded the other volunteers of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Most of the residents I met were not very interested in the affairs of the community but rather their own individual ends. I felt it wasn't really my place to judge how people view their community and wanted to know why they felt the way they did. The neighborhood was more clean and lively than the one I visited the day before.

Houses looked better and cleaner and BMWs and Mercedes Benzes were parked on every corner. It seems as if the residents in that part of the Upper Ninth Ward didn't have an interest in other people's problems due to their economic standing. The first house we visited was occupied by a young African American woman with a four-year-old son. She immediately told us that though things were improving, she was saving and hoping to move to Shreveport, Louisiana in the next 18 months. The lack of schools and activities in the area coupled with crime were the reasons for her disillusionment with New Orleans.<p>

For the next 30 minutes, most of the residents were too preoccupied with something else to talk to us until we ran into an interesting middle aged Caucasian man working on his house. Astute and aware of the history in the community, he moved to Tennessee on the eve of Katrina and stayed with family there for about two months before returning. Besides a slight damage to his rooftop during the storm, his house was left intact and thus he was able to return to some sort of stable life right away.

He showed little interest about the lack of infrastructure and rampant crime in the neighborhood and even went as far as to show us his state of the art security system. His hopes for the community relied heavily on gentrification, which in his eyes, will rid the neighborhood of violence and improve the infrastructure.

The next house was occupied a college aged African American woman who introduced herself and then immediately informed us that she was a Republican. I guess she saw us as left wing liberal Democrats bent on criticizing the Republican administration of George Bush for everything that is currently wrong with New Orleans. Nonetheless, we talked and she pointed out that her life in New Orleans is stable and calm and she cannot relate to those affected by the storm because she didn't live in New Orleans prior to Katrina. I saw her constant emphasis about people having to fight for themselves and not rely on the government as her way of reminding us of her political ideology.

Next, we encountered a 30-something Caucasian woman who recently gave birth to her first child. She asked us if we had heard about the oil spill in the canal the previous night. She showed us the photographs she had taken earlier in the morning and seemed particularly worried about our health as she kept questioning whether we should be outside canvassing with the faint smell of fuel in the air. She informed us that since there were more dogs than children in the community, the only playground was recently turned into a dog center.

Her disappointment with the lack of progress in the community has led her to seek for new pastures. Skye joined us later that evening and his eloquent introduction to the students and chaperons at debrief, in which he informed us that his first name is Skye and his last name is "Ma-cLeod" (cloud) brought a joyous end to what was a frustrating day of canvassing.
