          <p>
            Inspired by Greg's <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7763">recent post</a>, I researched several of the dynamic people who will be presenting at the ALA Virtual Conference next month. One of the most inspiring librarians I discovered is Brian Mathews, Associate Dean for Learning & Outreach at Virginia Tech, who blogs as <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/theubiquitouslibrarian/">The Ubiquitous Librarian</a> for The Chronicle of Higher Education. In a recent post, he shared a recent project titled, <a href="http://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/18649/Think%20like%20a%20STARTUP.pdf?sequence=1">"Think Like a Startup: A White Paper to Inspire Library Entrepreneurialism."</a>  Basically, he translates ideas from startup culture to libraries (and other educational instituions) who are being required to rethink/rebuild/repurpose what a library (or school) is and what it does. Mathews wrote this paper to "stir the entrepreneurial spirit" of librarians, and it definitely resonates with EdLab's mission. 

<blockquote>“Don't think about better vacuum cleaners, think 
about cleaner floors.” That's what I frequently 
remind my staff during our brainstorming sessions. 
Get beyond what's familiar. It's easy to just focus on 
making small tweaks to existing services, rather than 
considering the bigger, bolder, broader possibilities. 

Vacuum-cleaner-thinking is about asking: “How do 
we make it better?” A stylish new design? Stronger 
suction? Larger capacity? Attachments?  Quieter 
motors? It's all about building better features. And 
there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, we should 
definitely strive for incremental improvement; but 
we have to go beyond that. We have to exceed our 
imaginations. We can't just find new ways of doing 
the same old things. What we really need right now 
are breakthrough, paradigm-shifting, transformative, 
and disruptive ideas. </blockquote>

Also, while I'm writing about Brian Mathews, last week he tantalizingly <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/theubiquitouslibrarian/2012/06/06/hack-the-learner-experience-or-get-yourself-some-pedagogical-perspective/">mentioned</a> a new initiative being launched at Virginia Tech this fall, which sounds a bit like EdLab.

<blockquote>At Virginia Tech we're launching several a new initiatives this fall that position the library as an R&D operation as well as a strike force (more on that in the near future) but this paper outlines the way I am approaching my position. The mission of my team is to “hack the learner experience” — and to repackage our perspective and involvement across campus.</blockquote>
