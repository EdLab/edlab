            <strong>Title</strong>: Development of movement coordination in children: applications in the field of ergonomics, health sciences and sport

<strong>Editors</strong>: Geert Savelsbergh, Keith Davids, John van der Kamp, Simon J. Bennett

<strong>Publisher</strong>:  Routledge

<strong>Call number: </strong><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=Development+of+movement+coordination+in+children+%3A+applications+in+the+field+of+ergonomics%2C+health+sciences+and+sport&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">RJ496 A63D48 2003</a>

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

Co-ordination of movement plays a key role in human development and  is an important area in sport and health sciences. This book looks in  detail at how children develop basic skills, such as walking and  reaching for objects, and more complex skills such as throwing and  catching a ball accurately or riding a bicycle.

<em>Development of Movement Co-ordination in Children</em> is informed by five major theoretical perspectives and are explained in an introductory chapter:

* neural maturation
* information processing
* direct perception
* dynamic systems
* constraint theory.

The  international contributions are brought together under the headings of  ergonomics, health sciences and sport. Focusing on practical  applications, individual chapters cover many different aspects of  movement behaviour and development, ranging from children's  over-estimation of their physical abilities and the links to injury  proneness, to the co-ordination of kicking techniques. Both normal and  abnormal development is considered.

This text will be of  considerable interest to students, teachers and professionals in the  fields of sport science, kinesiology, physical education, ergonomics and  developmental psychology.

<strong>About the author: </strong>

<strong>Professor Geert Savelsbergh</strong> is the Desmond Tutu Chair Holder of the  Faculty of Human Movement Sciences. He studied Human Movement Sciences  at the VU University and also obtained his PhD at this university. His  major interest lies in the role of visual information in the guidance  and regulation of movement. His research group, entitled  “Perceptual-motor control: development, learning and performance”, is  part of MOVE, the Faculties main research programme and is very  international oriented. The research group examines these aspects with  infants, children (with and without special needs) and with athletes in  peak performance.

<strong>Keith Davids </strong>is the professor on the Faculty of Health at the School of Human Movement Studies. He was a first-class honours graduate of the University of London  and gained a PhD at the University of Leeds. Between 1993 and 1999, he  led the Motor Control group at the Department of Exercise and Sport  Science at the Manchester Metropolitan University, before being  appointed the Department Research Coordinator. At the UK RAE 2001, the  Department of Exercise and Sport Science gained a 5* rating, the highest  possible award for research excellence.

Currently Professor Davids supervises doctoral students from  Portugal, England, Germany, Wales, Singapore and New Zealand. He is also  co-editor in chief of the International Journal of Sport Psychology and  holds editorial board positions for the Journal of Sports Sciences,  Infant Behavior and Development and the Psychology of Sport and  Exercise. He is an Associate Editor for the Behavioral and Brain  Sciences.

<strong>John van der Kamp</strong> is a Lecturer at the Faculty of Human Movement Sciences at the <em>VU</em> University in Amsterdam. His Master’s thesis involved the role of body  orientation in the development of reaching and grasping in 3- to  9-month-old infants. During his PhD-work, which was completed in 1999  and supervised by Professors Geert Savelsbergh and Claire Michaels, he  investigated the use of optical information sources in the control of  interceptive movements.
