<p>Most people are susceptible to peer pressure, even for the most basic ideas or actions. But when the <i>peer</i> in peer pressure refers to social robots instead of humans, does the pressure hold? Researchers examined this question with adults and children to study whether people of different ages had different reactions to robot peer pressure.</p>
 
<p>To analyze peer pressure, researchers used the Asch paradigm. This involves grouping one participant with three peers (who are secretly part of the experiment) and having each answer a basic question about line length, where they must identify which line is equal to another. The peers answer before the participant, and they all give the same, incorrect line. Researchers then observe whether the participant matches her answer to the incorrect peers, or goes against the pressure and answers correctly.</p>
 
<p>In this particular study, researchers conducted the Asch paradigm with a control group (with no planted participants), a group with human peers, and a group with robot peers. Adult participants were significantly influenced by human peers. Their accuracy was reduced when other humans gave incorrect answers before them. However, they were not influenced by robot peers, as all the adult participants continued to answer correctly even when robots answered incorrectly before them.</p>
 
<p>For the child participants, researchers used only a control group and a robot peer group; asking children to act as human peers in the Asch paradigm has too much room for error (e.g., children might have trouble acting convincingly as they knowingly give the wrong answer). In the robot peer group, childrenâ€™s accuracy significantly reduced, just as with the adults with human peers. When the social robots gave incorrect answers, the child was likely to follow suit.</p>
 
<p>This study demonstrates how differently adults and children view robots. Whereas adults did not succumb to peer pressure from robots, children did. This shows that children are more likely to trust and be influenced by robots, which should have an impact on how we create social robots for education and therapy uses in the not-so-distant future. While robots could be effective in these roles, users must also be careful about the presence of unintentional biases or even malicious programming as children might be particularly vulnerable to these influences.</p>
