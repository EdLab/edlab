<p>There is no shortage of research being conducted on the educational and cognitive benefits of playing video games. However, the relationship between playing video games and developing cognitive skills—whether it be related to memory, problem solving, logic, or any other academic ability—is complex and requires more careful analysis, particularly how it relates to test-taking anxiety. Thus, two researchers from Kentucky conducted a study on how action-based video games might affect performance and anxiety related to math. The researchers chose to focus specifically on education majors because they consistently show the highest degree of anxiety toward math tests among college students.</p>
 
<p>The participants were asked to describe their experience playing action video games (AVGs) and were subsequently sorted into "experienced AVGers" and "non-AVGers." They then completed five separate evaluations, including a mental rotation test, a working memory test, a geometry test, a perceived cognitive load survey, and a math-related anxiety survey. The non-AVGers were then split into two groups—one that played a first-person shooter AVG and the other that played Angry Birds, a non-AVG. They all played their games for ten hours and then retook the five evaluations.</p>
 
<p>Some of the key findings were that the experienced AVGers revealed higher cognitive skills overall, but the authors were careful to note that this does not determine causality between playing AVGs and doing well in math. Both the first-person shooter game players and the Angry Birds players showed improved scores on the mental rotation, working memory, and geometry tests. The differences in the test scores between the two groups, however, were statistically non-significant. This surprised the researchers, who expected to see this trend only in those who played the AVG.</p>

<p>Although the results of this study may have implications for how video games affect students’ cognitive skills and math test performance, there is still a great deal of gray area in terms of how they do so. This research suggests that AVGs may play a role in mitigating anxiety students feel toward mathematical thinking. Future research may seek to better understand these relationships to determine how video games might even play a role in encouraging participation in STEM learning and careers.</p>
