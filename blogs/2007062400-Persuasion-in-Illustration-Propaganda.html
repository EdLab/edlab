            Propaganda has been a crucial tool used in warfare for many centuries. Historically speaking, the force of propaganda in a government's quest to wage and win wars can be equated with the innovative strength introduced by machine guns during World War I.  Initial interpretation of the word ‘propaganda' was not negative. It used to be defined as public information, as a form of freedom of expression, often characterized in illustrative terms.  However, times have changed. Trusty <a href=http://webster.com/dictionary/propaganda> Merriam-Webster </a> defines propaganda as the “spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person.” The true aim of propaganda is to influence the opinion of people so as to actively change their perception and behavior of something; it is one of the most persuasive forms of deceit. 
<p>
Since delving into historical revisionism in my last blog, propaganda stands out as most prominent in revising factual information. Propaganda is most often used during warfare, as a way to manipulate the state of affairs in a country. It is also best exemplified in totalitarian regimes. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are prime examples of this use of propaganda.
<p> 
Under the National Socialist regime of Germany, Adolph Hitler embodied the idea of persuasion through the extensive use of propaganda as a powerful instrument for war. In a total war, the German people were subjugated to the influence of Nazi theory in everything: food, cars, the “West,” race and even vacations. This type of propaganda came in the form of art, radio, cinema and the press. The German people were conditioned to believe in Hitler's claims regarding war, race and religion. The “Strength through Joy” (Kraft durch Freude) program sought to provide suitable “leisure” activities for citizens of Nazi Germany. <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/images/nazi_propaganda_kdf.jpg> This poster </a> depicts an ideal German woman enjoying herself in the perfect German car, the Volkswagen (literally translated as the People's Car). Propaganda also reinforced the concept of anti-Semitism that was prevalent in Europe at the time. <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/images/nazi_propaganda_eternal_jew.jpg> This poster </a> crudely depicts the stereotypical notion of Jews under Hitler's regime. 
<p>
Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union's dictator, embraced propaganda as a means to spread communism. Revealing images of communist utopian harmony and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LeninBild013.jpg> great leadership </a>. Soviet propaganda sought to reach out to its large population in support of the Marxist goal of communist world revolution. Despite the Red-filled banners of communism, propaganda during the Cold War became more of a means to support failing communist leadership than anything. The United States was also involved in the use of propaganda during Wars in support of the army and of the home front. Idealized concepts of soldiers in recruitment posters were rampant which is apparent in <a href=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-posters/american.htm> this poster </a>. War aims had become the goal of every citizen and propaganda aided in the quest to win the war.
<p>
 Propaganda today is a much subtler game. Big business and media play a strong role in delivering the news of the state of world affairs. News on the Iraq war is delivered quite differently on American news channels than on foreign ones. Although the illustrative factor in the use of propaganda is no longer widespread, the tools of persuasion are still there. Don't believe everything you read, or see.
