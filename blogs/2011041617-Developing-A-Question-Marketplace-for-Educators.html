          <p>
            A few days ago, Hui Soo and I talked about developing question marketplace targeted for educators. As developers, we are constantly using question market applications like Stackoverflow and Quora. These websites provide good features, upon which we just made a study. 

The primary components shared by this kind of websites are questions and users. However, the way they are organized is very different between the two websites. 

The major difference is in the question of organization. Stackoverflow doesn't ask users to follow topics while  Quora does. In Stackoverflow, users can view question by grouping them by the tag. Stackoverflow does have a powerful categorizing and tagging system. It allows users to view questions in a good number of ways by using combination of tags and ordering by a certain attribute. All these actually allows the questions to be categorized dynamically. In Quora, however, the topic structure is very much like a book content list. The topics and subtopics are already there and won't change very often. Before users post a question, they will first try to find the right topic. The good thing here is that, they allow a hierarchy of topics. For some generic concept, we do need questions to be organized by multiple layers of subtopics under the concept.

The second important difference is that Quora maintains a stronger user networking. It allows users to follow each other and allows them to send message to people who are following them. Besides, users can be mentioned in text by typing “@USERNAME”. So it turns out, Quora emphasizes the action "follow" (on both question topics and users). And this gives rise to a bunch of interesting use cases in the application.  

Based the observations, we may combine the strong features from both websites and also add our own features in developing our own question market for the educators.
