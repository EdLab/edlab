            Just passing this along:

Dear edLab, 

The Graduate Department for New Media at The New School is proud to announce a call for abstracts for the 11th annual Critical Themes Conference. We would like to invite the students at edLab the opportunity to submit abstracts pertaining to New Media. The Critical Themes conference is a great opportunity for graduate students to have their work critiqued, discussed, and receive diverse feedback in a professional environment. 

I'm writing to let you know that we have extended the deadline for abstracts to January 31. This year, with the addition of multi-modal projects, will be a very exciting experience. More information about the conference can be found below as well as on our website, http://criticalthemes.net/. Attached is the full color call for abstracts that I hope you will be able to print and distribute to the students. We look forward to hearing back from you!

Thank you for your time;

CALL FOR PAPERS AND PROJECTS
Critical Themes in Media Studies

A Graduate Student Conference at The New School in New York
The graduate students of the Department of Media Studies and Film at The New School are pleased to announce a call for papers and projects to the 11th annual Critical Themes in Media Studies Conference, taking place April 15-16, 2011 in New York City.

Founded in 1919, the New School was conceived to promote innovative and progressive education. The Media Studies Department, founded in 1975 as the first in the country, was designed from its inception to be a home for both theory and practice-based scholarship.

In the spirit of these traditions, this year we would like to encourage the submission of traditional scholarly papers as well as multi-modal research projects. We ask all applicants to be prepared to present their work in a traditional academic format, but individual panels may also be arranged to encompass projects in a variety of configurations. Critical Themes in Media Studies is not organized around a single theme. Instead, we welcome work from across a wide range of topics related to media theory. Panels will be formed around common areas of interest that emerge from the works received.

Presenters are invited to submit project proposals that include but are not limited to: papers, interactive installations, maps, walking tours, performances, and so on. We will send notification in advance to all presenters for whom we are able to accommodate any non- traditional formats and provide technical services.

ABSTRACT DEADLNE: January 31, 2011 - EXTENDED NOTIFICATIONS: February 15, 2011 FINAL PAPER DEADLINE: March 15, 2011

SUBMISSIONS: Send abstracts (250 words or less) to criticalthemes@gmail.com 

For general inquiries or further information, please contact: criticalthemes@gmail.com
