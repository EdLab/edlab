<p>We’re using robots now more than ever in classrooms, from <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4068/can-students-learn-with-teaching-robots">robot teachers</a> to </a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/4340/this-robot-breaks-down-social-barriers-for">robot therapists</a> to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3774/building-better-robot-tutors">robot tutors</a>. But despite their advances, there are obvious limits to how well a robot can teach or mentor children in an educational setting. A recent study helped find those limits by figuring out what causes breakdowns in child-robot tutor interactions.</p>
 
<p>The researcher conducted the study over the course of three and a half months at an elementary school in Sweden, where 46 students in grades four to six took lessons with a robot tutor in geography and social studies. The robot tutor directed children to complete activities on an interactive table that recorded their responses. Students completed two different types of lessons multiple times over the course of the semester, with one lesson completed individually and the other in pairs. The sessions were videotaped, but the researcher was not in the room during the tutoring; instead, if the child needed additional help, they simply had to knock on the door and the researcher would intervene. After each session, the researcher conducted a short interview with the students. </p>
 
<p>Ultimately, the researcher chose to analyze the cases of six students, who had a total of 41 breakdowns over the course of the study. A breakdown refers to a child having a negative emotional reaction for more than five seconds, such as frustration or confusion. The researcher found four main reasons that breakdowns in child-robot interactions occurred:<ul>
<li><b>1. Unclear directions:</b> The robot tutor gave its directions at the start of each session, but students often found it difficult to pay attention the entire time (due to the bot’s monotone) or to understand the directions completely the first time through. Also, the robot often did not command the children’s attention enough, meaning they frequently missed pieces of information necessary to complete the task.</li>
        	<li><b>2. Confusing scaffolding:</b> At times, the robot tutor would confuse its words and gestures; it would direct the students verbally one way but point the other. Also, the robot would mistake a child talking to themselves to solve a problem as addressing it, and respond in confusing ways.</li>
        	<li><b>3. Lack of fairness:</b> There were often times when the robot made decisions as a co-player in the activities that negatively affected the students’ performance in the game. Because students could not control the robot or communicate effectively with it, they became frustrated with what they perceived as a lack of fairness.</li>
        	<li><b>4. Controller problems:</b> Sometimes the touch interface didn’t work correctly, or the robot would malfunction and need the researcher’s assistance to set it straight again.</li></ul>
</p>
 
<p>These situations caused the greatest number of breakdowns among the students, which negatively impacted their learning and enjoyment of the activity. These significant breakdowns prove that robot tutors work best in educational settings when giving clear directions, but with the current technology, robot tutors aren’t able to take advantage of learning opportunities. In fact, the biggest problem in using a robot tutor now, says the researcher, is the fact that robots know when students answer incorrectly, but not why they do. It cannot be a real educator because it cannot direct students on how to fix their mistakes and correctly solve problems. Perhaps it’s no surprise, but for now, robots simply aren’t up to the artful task of teaching.</p>
