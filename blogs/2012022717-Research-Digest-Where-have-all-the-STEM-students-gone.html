<a href="http://policy.rutgers.edu/faculty/salzman/steadyasshegoes.pdf">Lowell, B. L., Salzman, H., Bernstein, H., & Henderson, H. (2009, November). <i>Steady as she goes?  Three generations of students go through the Science and Engineering pipeline.</i> Paper presented at Annual Meetings of the Association for Public Policy Management. Washington, DC.</a>


<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all">Recent reports</a> have given new strength to the growing chorus of jeremiads lamenting America's decline in technological pre-eminence.  That we produce too few scientists and engineers is a constant refrain in the business press. A recent paper from Rutgers offers a more serious and nuanced analysis of the issue.
<!--break-->
<b>Description</b>:

Using longitudinal data, the authors take a long-term view of the STEM educational career track in America, in an attempt to discover how and why it has changed since the early 1970s. They find that the issue is neither with production nor retention of STEM students along the path from high school to college to employment in the workforce.  As a matter of fact, we produce more STEM students than we can use.

The problem, as it turns out, is that there has been a marked decline in “high-performing” STEM students.  As they put it: “Our findings indicate that while STEM retention along the pipeline shows strong rates of retention overall from the 1970s to the late 1990s, these overall strong STEM retention rates are accompanied by simultaneous declines in retention among the highest performing students in the 1990s.”

Unfortunately their study is too narrowly focused, as they point out, to offer convincing explanations of why this might be so, but there's no reason to doubt their speculation that “Highly qualified students may be choosing a non-STEM job because these other occupations are higher paying, offer better career prospects such as advancement, employment stability, and/or prestige, as well as less susceptible to offshoring. Potential alternatives include business, healthcare, and law.“

It would seem then that, even if it is true we that don't have enough qualified workers in STEM industries, sending more students to engineering class might not be rational solution.

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:

Education, which in some sense deals with the foundations of society, has always had a utopian streak.  Reforming education, as philosophers from Plato to Dewey have argued, is the surest and most necessary route to reforming society.  And yet society has its own needs, which may make mockery of such earnest efforts. Certain educational reforms may, paradoxically, require a reform of society before they can be worthwhile, and planning for the future should take this into account.
