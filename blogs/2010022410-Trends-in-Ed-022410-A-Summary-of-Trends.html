          <p>
            There were a lot of great articles this week about non-educational products and companies that could inform our design process and the development of educational products. I've summarized the different themes below. 
<body>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
function toggleVis( elemID )
{    var elem = document.getElementById( elemID );
    if( elem.style.display != 'none' )
        {        elem.style.display = 'none';
        }
        else
        {        elem.style.display = 'block';
        }
}
</script>
</body>
<a onclick="toggleVis('Facebook');">
<b>The Facebook Hook</b></a>
<div id="Facebook" style="display:none">
Facebook is a wildly popular platform for social games. Companies like Ohai! are utilizing Facebook's popularity to build a base of users<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13846_3-10458181-62.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20" target="_blank"> and then moving the game to a stand-alone site</a>. As educators, we can start thinking about Facebook as a way to generate interest for our product before moving it to a more customizable stand-alone site. Since Facebook is working hard to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10458590-36.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20" target="_blank">pitch itself to the open-source crowd</a>, the time might be right to start experimenting with educational Facebook apps. </div>

<a onclick="toggleVis('Recommend');">
<b>The Downside of Recommenders</b></a>
<div id="Recommend" style="display:none">
There has been a push recently for more and more sophisticated recommendation tools that will perfectly predict what types of items a user will like. A recent article in Nature News outlined <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100222/full/news.2010.86.html?s=news_rss" target="_blank">the potential pitfalls of a perfect recommender</a>:
<li>Users miss out on information and items that may be interesting to them but don't currently match their profile of interests.</li>
<li>Users end up in a self-reinforcing cycle of recommendations that progressively limits their options (think of the Pandora song cycle).</li>
<li>Users may quickly become bored by the recommendations and revert to traditional browsing to satisfy their need for diversity and surprises.</li>
The Netflix.com site has an interesting way to generate spontaneous choices for users. The Netflix recommender matches you with specific individuals and then mines their choices for suggestions. This helps keeps the unexpected human element in the system. </div>
<a onclick="toggleVis('Google');">
<b>"Container Creators" Are Not Immune to Prosecution</b></a>
<div id="Google" style="display:none">
It used to be assumed that the company that created the platform could not be held responsible for the content users generated. The "We only made the container, we can't be held responsible for the content" defense has been mostly successful in the US. However, platforms are used across borders and the container defense has just been <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000092-264.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20" target="_blank">shot down in Italy</a>. Three Google executives were sentenced to six-month jail terms for violation of privacy. The case involved a YouTube video posted of a teenager with Down's Syndrome being beaten by classmates. For developers of educational containers, this case brings an important point up for discussion: How will we balance the need for user freedom with the need to protect ourselves from prosecution for the content on the site? This ruling <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/02/italian-verdict-on-google-privacy-sets-dangerous-precedent.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss">sets a dangerous precedent</a> that will hopefully be overturned, but we need to be aware of the potential risks we may face when developing products intended for global use. </div>
