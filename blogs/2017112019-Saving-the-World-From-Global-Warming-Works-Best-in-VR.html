<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cleanopolis-vr/id1045463085?mt=8">Cleanopolis</a> is a free app that turns education about energy-saving techniques into a fun, interactive experience. Led by the game’s superhero guide, Captain Clean, players move between the four districts of the imaginary city of Cleanopolis, which has become overrun by bad habits and high CO2 emission levels. Through games and quizzes, players earn points and new technology for the city while learning about global warming and how to prevent it. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The premise of the game is very creative, and the messages conveyed are valuable and effectively communicated. Accompanied by your dog companion and Captain Clean, the player has the opportunity to choose between dozens of activities, ranging from high-speed heating pump delivery to destroying polluting vehicles and energy inefficient appliances. What impressed me most about this game was the fact that topics like sustainable insulation and seasonal fruit selection were integrated into games that were actually enjoyable. The quizzes are also interactive, in that they require players to move about a space and select certain objects to answer questions. Players exercise judgement, gather tips, and apply knowledge learned throughout the game alongside the typical speed and coordination skills tested in most video games. </p>

<p>Additionally, the tips and lessons taught in this game are legitimately helpful and applicable. While global warming can seem like an impossible task to tackle, Cleanopolis is chock full of examples of ways in which an individual can reduce their own carbon footprint. </p> 
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The main failing of Cleanopolis is its design. This is clearly a game intended for a VR headset, and while the game attempts to market itself for the regular iPad or iPhone user as well, in such a medium, this game can be extremely frustrating. I was easily frustrated by the necessity of constantly swiping back and forth to see my surroundings, and games that involved navigating took time to get the hang of, given that shifting perspective while guiding an object towards a target demanded much more effort. Furthermore, I didn’t find the shooting games to be very intuitive; often the focus was on correctly lining up the target with an object, not tapping the object itself. </p>

<p>Finally, the graphics were simple, and though satisfactory, were not particularly exciting or inviting. The soundtrack energized me much more than the basic visuals, so this is an area with room for improvement. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you have 3D capabilities, Cleanopolis provides a fun, effective, and empowering way to learn about a relevant topic that can seem overwhelming and scary to a lot of kids. However, if you are a regular iPad user, perhaps pass on it until you make a friend with a VR headset. </p>
