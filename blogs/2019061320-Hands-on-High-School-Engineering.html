<p>Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), Chicago’s major electric utility, partners with high schools to offer low-income students a four-year, hands-on learning opportunity. For 25 years, the <a href="https://www.hfschicagoscholars.com/">ComEd HFS Chicago Scholars</a> program has offered scholarships for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend the city’s top private high schools. Their new STEM program supplements their offerings by exposing their scholars to the benefits of learning by doing. At workshops, students hear from experts and gain hands-on exposure to ComEd’s current project of installing a microgrid in a neighborhood of Chicago’s South Side.</p>

<p>ComEd encourages all students to participate in this program regardless of their future career goals. Whether they eventually work in business, engineering, or theater, the students hearing the experiences of ComEd executives and gradually gaining the skills to build their own electric grid can begin to consider their future career path.</p>

<p>What effect do you think an experience like this might have on high school students? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/50782">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:35 Anna Curry:</b> I think hands-on experience can be incredibly valuable when executed well. Students need to get more than a tour of the company, but rather get actual experience and practice doing relevant work for the company. Otherwise, it's merely letting students know what opportunities are out there.</p>

<p><b>@02:04 Dallas Milanovich:</b> I think generally it's great to give kids direct exposure to the kind of work they might be doing in a particular field in the future. I had a friend who went to university for nursing and as soon as she got into a hospital for clinical practice her second year, she immediately knew it wasn't for her. The sooner you're put into real career environments as a kid, the sooner you'll know what's a good (or bad) fit.</p>
