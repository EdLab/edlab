Article Review</div>
Teacher  professional community has been advocated by scholars in the field of  education as a vehicle for professional development and growth. Inquiry  communities (Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle, 1992), communities of learners  (Barth, 1984), and community of practice (Wenger, 1998) are but some  variations on this research theme of teacher community. While teacher  community help educators to address historic isolation of its  profession, this widely and loosely used term might become a shallow  concept without careful conceptualization. Levine (2010) addresses this  issue in this paper by summarizing various conceptualizations of teacher community and adding two theoretical foundations-activity theory and  third space--to the popular conceptions of teacher community. Levine  (2010) summarizes four camps of teacher community conceptions--inquiry  community, teacher professional community, community of learners, and  community of practice, and provides several caveats on these current  conceptions. In the context of historic isolation of teacher's work in  the United States, scholars might romanticize the experience and work of  teacher communities. Levine (2010) contends that teacher community  should be understood as a means for educators' self-specified ends. In  addition, these teacher community conceptions should draw on more  learning theories to frame the actual experiences and activities  occurring within these teacher communities. He suggested that activity  theory, with one of its focuses on (conceptual) tools, and the notion of  third space that encourages divergent perspectives, could be two  theoretical frames to strengthen the concept of teacher community. 

EdLab Connection
Building strong online communities is a critical consideration of current  development of Teaching &amp; Learning Network (TLN). One of such TLN  features is <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/4337"><span style="color: black;">message channel/bulletin board</span></a>that allows TC students and alumni to network through  constantly sharing, updating and receiving professional information. In  addition, expertise sharing will be the focus of TLN online community, which responds to Levine's caveat of specifying ends for  teacher/educator (online) community. Undoubtedly, there are more  innovative ends we could create for the TLN community. Any thoughts?&nbsp;
