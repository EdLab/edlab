            1.	Social Adaptive Navigation Support

Vialogues currently provides mostly the standard navigation facilities and less focus on social navigation support. In modern web2.0 apps, standard navigation facilities and social navigation support go hand in hand. (Two obvious places of social navigation support: the number of dialogues of each video and timeline of when the dialogue happens). However, this could be improved with an adaptive touch to cope with the overwhelming amount of social information readily available today. For example, instead of letting the user judge by the video title or the number of dialogues to decide whether it's worth spending half an hour on it or skim it through, number of views, number of bookmarks (possibly) may also be other indicators. Suppose the number of the dialogues is a strong index for locating a good video, which is great (less is more). The longer the dialogues, the harder the user navigates. In such cases, would we still want a bigger number of dialogues? How do we filter out good comments or jump to review an interesting dialogue or a useful clip?  I think, a navigation bar (visualization cues) to indicate the “heat” of the video is important. Showing the usage of certain period of time may just well indicate the “importance” “coolness” of the video. So, how do we make it adaptive? To profile a user, we could either use natural language processing to process the dialogues (which I don't think it's something we would like to dip our heads into :p) or provide functions like bookmarking to do item-based collaborative filtering. By doing so, the system will learn more about the user. 

2.	Study
	To improve users learning experience, I think it's crucial to look at current data and possibly conduct lab studies. A tentative study design can be: comparing different settings of using realtime Vialogues vs. regular video, post hoc Vialogues vs. regular video for a given task. I'd expect the hypothesis of whether Vialogues significantly enhances collaborative learning being quantified and let the numbers speak for themselves â˜º. And it certainly opens up tons of research questions to follow up, such as how does the experience increase knowledge transfer; will the effects be significant enough to entice people to pay for per view, etc.

3.	Advanced Search & Explore
	I was looking for the commencement talk given by Sheryl Sandburg at Barnard. I searched “Sheryl Sandburg”, and nothing returned. I ended up entering “commencement”, and BINGO!  Imagine you are looking for a lesson to learn about Ruby-on-Rails on YouTube, you want to learn how to push the Rails to GIThub. What do you do? You put all the keywords you can think of…and search.  I would imagine, the temporal exploration display is definitely current and necessary. But wouldn't you want a classified browsing? Like faceted browsing?  More than that, adaptive faceted browsing? (only present the “categories” that interest the user)

4.	Recommendation
	While the system gradually learns about the users, it's natural to provide something extra to lure them to stay in the system. Look how many times Amazon.com tricks us into buying few more books while you are just about to check out. So, I guess, the question goes back to, how are we modeling the users? Will the adaptive presentation technique be applied? Will we need to model groups? Will we need to consider content semantics?
