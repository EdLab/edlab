<p>Massive open online courses, or MOOCs, have grown significantly in popularity and influence in the past few years. Over <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/mooc-stats-2017/">800 universities</a> around the world offer at least one MOOC, and there was a <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/mooc-stats-2017/">37% increase</a> in total offerings between 2016 and 2017. These courses’ influence on the education sector has been explored many times over, but one group of international researchers was particularly interested in what kinds of learning strategies are being employed in MOOCs and the relationship between these strategies and students' performance and experiences. </p>
 
<p>Participants in this study were comprised of 23,648 students enrolled in an introduction to basic functional programming course offered on edX. Participants completed pre-course surveys asking about their enrollment motivations, expectations, and prior knowledge of both the course subject and the MOOC platform. A post-course survey was also utilized and asked students for their opinions on course quality, overall experience, and their use of different course components. Researchers also collected edX trace data logs, final grades, and online discussion transcripts, and conducted a cluster analysis with the compiled data.</p>
 
<p>Findings revealed that there were substantial and consistent differences in adopted study strategies for three types of student MOOC users: limited users, selective users, and broad users. Limited users, defined by their below-average course engagement, made up the largest cluster of participants (67% of the dataset). Selective users (15% of the dataset) showed high levels of involvement and used a diverse set of tools and resources, but didn’t engage often in online discussions. In contrast, broad users (18% of the dataset) showed strong course engagement across different activities and were the only group to consistently and actively participate in online discussions.</p> 

<p>These different trends in course resource usage reflected varying levels of motivation and resulted in different grade groupings, with limited users having the average lowest scores and broad users having the greatest chance of a high course grade. Since selective users were typically found to be more goal-oriented in that many were enrolled in the course specifically in order to earn a certificate, they did not obtain the same range of knowledge as the broad users because they did not consider discussion to be helpful.</p>

<p>Knowing that different kinds of students have different learning motivations, goal orientations, and approaches to learning in MOOCs could help guide better development of and support for online courses. MOOCs aren’t always able to accommodate students’ individual differences, but this study shows that giving students more options to personalize their MOOC experience will increase the utility of these courses.</p>
