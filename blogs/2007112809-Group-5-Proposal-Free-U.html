          <p>
            Group 5 discussed a number of educational problems, and decided to pursue the problem of access to educational resources.  So often educational aspirations are constrained by inadequate access to resources, and while these obstacles can take many forms, financial obstacles seemed to the group to be the most prevalent and constraining to educational aspiration.  While there is a great volume of free educational material available on the Internet, these resources are generally not organized into curricula, nor are they independently rated for accuracy and reliability of information.

To begin to remedy this situation, Group 5 proposes a completely free online educative experience - Free U.  Free U is an online alternative to school, and open to anyone with the desire to pursue self-directed education.  Free U is particularly designed to accommodate those who feel in any way "alienated" from traditional schooling processes, yet are determined to cultivate their minds.  Free U aims to accomplish this by creating an online resource which collates and organizes the myriad free online content and curriculum materials available on the internet, including but not limited to those listed below.  The cornerstone of Free U is combining existing and robust sites, such as Wikipedia, Facebook, and MIT courseware, into a single destination which makes such sites even more useful to the thirsty scholar.  Users will have the ability to rate, review, and share the educational resources that they find most useful and compelling. Free U is tuition free and teacher free, and the learning goals are completely up to the participant.


Free U would serve either those interested in exploring the breadth of online materials at the site for self-educative purposes, or those students interested in earning institutionally recognized diplomas, degrees, or certifications. In the latter case, Free U would guide students through a curriculum generated by their specific goals.  Whether it be a high school diploma, college degree, or professional certificate, Free U would aid in the construction of a curriculum which meets a specific state's guidelines, information which is also freely available on the web.


Other components:
    * Second Life site  
    * Facebook integration
          o leverage existing Facebook tools (groups, message boards) for communication and social networking, to build a true virtual community of Free U students
          o write new Facebook plug-in application(s) to allow Free U students to share what they're currently studying
          o obtain a Facebook network specifically for Free U students to join
    * Partnerships through Wikipedia
          o Tag articles by curriculum using Wikipedia's "category" system
          o Free U article-rating system to allow users to rate the reliability of various Wikipedia articles (to identify articles that are sufficiently authoritative to be used for educational purposes)
    * iTunes U integration / directory of highly-rated free A/V learning content
    * Partnerships with accredited institutions that recognize nontraditional students. 

Here's just a sampling of online resources which will provide the foundation of our site:
