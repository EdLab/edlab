          <p>
            I'll admit, the primary motivation for visiting Animoto was to visit Faisal. Nevertheless, as a result of my visit to Animoto, I learned a lot about the company and its mission. 

Animoto offers dynamic slideshows and video pieces that are easy to put together but do not have the amateur feel often seen in most home productions. Users simply upload pics/video clips (or share them from Flickr, Youtube, Picasa, Facebook, etc), add text, and choose the music; the folks at Animoto do the rest to create a customized production. 

Animoto uses "Cinematic Artificial Intelligence" which analyzes the various details of the video, music, and pictures to create a final presentation that is synced with these details. As it says on their website, "Choose a slower song, and your video will appear more subdued. A fast song will add to the intensity of transitions and effects." Upon visiting their headquarters and getting some insight into how these video productions are put together, I certainly believe they are 'bridging the gap' between amateur and professional video production.

In addition to Animoto's AI algorithms, there are also options to increase customization. The user can choose 'styles' which serve as backgrounds and themes to the final video. The user is also given flexibility with regards to video resolution, with high-definition being one of the potential options. 

The <a href"http://animoto.com/about/buzz">press</a> they have managed to garner is truly impressive. It looks like they have a valuable product on their hands; for those who simply who cannot afford an expensive video production team but would not mind paying a modest sum for a video that looks professional, this is a great option.

As far as work environments go, it clearly is very laid back and I did not see one unhappy person there. We happened to drop in on their 'Beer Fridays' at 5:00, where there's pizza, beer, and RockBand.

Happy employees, a seemingly viable and valuable product, and lots of buzz...looks like Animoto can go far.
