<p>Charles Thornburgh is the founder of <a href="https://www.civitaslearning.com/">Civitas Learning</a>, a cloud-based, predictive analytics platform that provides data to students, faculty, advisors, and administrators to deepen learning and improve outcomes. Thornburgh’s career has focused on using technology to improve access and efficacy in a variety of educational environments. His earliest businesses included ClickSafety.com, an online safety training company, and Testtakers.com, the first rich-media, diagnostic, and prescriptive test prep tutoring application online. Kaplan acquired his business in 2002 and retained him as In-House Entrepreneur for the next nine years during which he launched several successful businesses and innovative products. He is a former director of the Education Board of the Software and Information Industry Association. He is listed on "16 People Changing the Landscape of Online Education Forever" by Find Education Online.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Civitas Learning?</b><br>
<p>I grew up in a house with a serial entrepreneur for a father and a mother whose family had played active roles in several of the twentieth century's most important civil rights struggles. Both of my parents modeled a courage I could only hope to emulate. The combination of my father’s lack of risk-aversion and my mother’s sense of service were probably my first qualifications to be a social entrepreneur.  When, as an undergrad, I had the opportunity to learn to teach, I quickly fell in love with education. I soon discovered that it would be a lifelong pursuit that would allow me to take my dad’s foolish risks and my mom’s confidence that the impact could be meaningful.</p>

<p>I wanted to explore new ways of affecting education in a more scalable way. Combining these passions, I bought an education business upon graduation and then started three more education technology businesses, all with the expressed purpose of pursuing the use of data and technology to improve access and efficacy in education. Eventually this caught the interest of Kaplan Education. They acquired one of my businesses and retained me as an In-House Entrepreneur for nine years. During this time I launched a few other successful startups and served on the executive team of Kaplan Higher Education.</p>

<p>All of this experience led me to the conclusion that we could build something even bigger, perhaps a platform for innovation that would impact both access and efficacy on a dramatically larger scale. With this in mind, I launched Civitas Learning® in 2013. Civitas Learning was designed to bring together the best of leading-edge technology, design thinking, and data science in its mission to help students successfully traverse the complex journey of higher education.</p>

<p>All of that said, the scale of the opportunity at Civitas is humbling. I’ve spent much of the last couple years on developing my skills as a businesses leader in hopes that I’ll continue to be up to the challenge of leading this talented team.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Civitas Learning will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>We founded Civitas Learning in 2011 with the idea that technology, data, and human-centered design, used in the right way, could help address the stagnating outcomes in American education. This is a problem that costs our society trillions of dollars and immeasurable human capital. We recognized that the only way to address a need of that magnitude was to bring together a diverse, talented group of people from across industries (e.g., high-tech, healthcare, education, public safety, etc.), harnessing the best of transformative phenomena from other industries, and combining it with education domain expertise to create a massive and measurable impact on students’ likelihood of success. This impact target, which we refer to as our <i>Million More Mission</i>, is the total focus of our organization, our culture, and our work. It helps us to decide which customers to work with, which products to build, which features to add, and how to support our customers in the most effective utilization of the new capabilities we are bringing them.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think there will be an increased focus on understanding which outcomes matter most, a clearer connection between educational inputs and learning outcomes, and an increased level of accountability to accomplish that. Learning should be truly lifelong and span across formal education, career, and a person’s lifetime. Everything we do should move us closer to maintaining that practice.</p>

<p>The stakes in education are increasing, too. To compete globally and to improve the prospects of striving students in higher education, we know that we that we need to narrow the gap in the number of graduates our country needs. The United States must produce roughly one million more graduates a year by 2025 to ensure the country has the skilled workers and entrepreneurial leaders it needs, not to mention more deeply engaged and informed citizens. Of the 25 million students in higher education today, about half will graduate, with huge disparities based on the income levels of incoming students. Today, a child born poor in the United States is more likely to remain poor than at any time in our nation’s history. For the first time, we are seeing younger generations that will be less educated than their elders. Many other nations outperform us in economic mobility and educational attainment.</p>

<p>As daunting as the challenge of one million more graduates sounds, we can reach that goal by improving outcomes for current students and finding creative new pathways for returning students.</p>

<p><b>Apart from Civitas Learning, what else are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>Education has been my lifelong work. My next big project, though, is to transition these theories to practice with my family and be a better dad.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I serve as a coach for EDU startup events, speak at fireside chats for the Austin startup community, and am an active mentor with Austin’s Capital Factory. I also serve on The Andy Roddick Foundation’s board. I have tried to focus my investment and mentoring work on social entrepreneurs, specifically those with a passion for education. I hope to help Austin to become a nationally recognized hub for effective innovation in education.</p>
