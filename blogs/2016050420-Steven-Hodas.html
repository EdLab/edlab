<p>While at NASA in the 1990's, Steven Hodas built the U.S. government's first public website, connecting teachers and students with rich scientific resources to support innovative STEM education, and launching his career as an edtech entrepreneur. In the private sector, he went on to create the web's most popular sites for high school and college students as well as the first large-scale formative assessment and personalized professional development platforms for large school districts.</p>

<p>From 2012 to 2014, Hodas served as Executive Director of the NYC DOE's Office of Innovation and designed its Ecosystem Initiative, which seeks to foster smart demand and create new modes of problem-solving for departments of education. In that capacity, he created the first-ever district software challenges as alternatives to procurement, the first test-bed collaborations between schools and early-stage edtech companies, and the first district application program interfaces (APIs) for student and system data.</p>

<p>Hodas is currently Practitioner in Residence at the <a href="http://bit.ly/1TAk35A">Center on Reinventing Public Education</a> and the Senior Advisor to the Digital Promise <a href="http://bit.ly/219yqm0">Innovation Cluster Initiative.</a></p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>I majored in seventeenth-century English poetry and then went to medical school. Close reading of poetry—finding and making meaning—is all about proliferating possibilities while the scientific method and clinical practice is all about winnowing them down. Having those complementary frameworks has always been helpful to me. In many ways my work has been an attempt to demonstrate the value of creating equal space for imagination and rigor in thinking about how we organize schools.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>I hope that policymakers and central office workers will come to understand that the best way to improve outcomes for kids is to give teachers and principals the autonomy and decision frameworks they need to try many different tools and approaches.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>The consumerization of education software and the widespread acceptance of design-thinking and lean-startup approaches to all kinds of educational and organizational needs will have profound impacts on how schools work. I believe their force is irresistible and that attempts to resist the creative and productive energies they enable will only cause the organization that does so to appear ridiculous and illegitimate.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>Right now I’m mostly occupied with the Education Innovation Cluster initiative at Digital Promise, where I serve as an advisor. I’ve also been working on a non-profit that will make everything to do with school facilities much easier and more flexible, a sort of "We Work for Schools," and a national adult education initiative that I’ll be able to say more about in a few months.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>People that make my day for ed-related thinking are <a href="http://bit.ly/1QtwGc3">Robin Lake</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/12EIeaE">Audrey Watters</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1QVjSLT">Rishawn Biddle</a>,  and <a href="http://bit.ly/1PSiFHz">Alexander Russo</a>. For a New Yorker, of course, <a href="http://bit.ly/1VzoGKM">ChalkBeat New York</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1TAlhxu">Gothamist</a> are indispensable.</p>
