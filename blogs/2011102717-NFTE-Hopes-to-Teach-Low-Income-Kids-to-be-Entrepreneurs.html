          <p>
            The  <a href="http://www.nfte.com/">Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship</a> was founded in the late 80's by Steve Mariotti an entrepreneur.  Mariotti later went-on to become a Bronx-based math teacher and was inspired to found NFTE as a way to improve the NYC drop-out rate.  The mission of NFTE is to, "provide programs that inspire young people from low-income communities to stay in school, to recognize business opportunities and to plan for successful futures."  The group accomplishes this goal by providing entrepreneurial workshops, leadership opportunities and contests.  For example,  NFTE recently launched a pitch contest (see example in the vialogue below) to help foster entrepreneurial thinking and business skills among young people.  

The group gives the following explanation of the benefits to the nearly 350,000 students who have gone through the program: 

<i>Combining his business background with his desire to teach at-risk students, Steve discovered that when young people from low-income communities are given the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship, their innate "street smarts" can easily develop into "academic smarts" and "business smarts." Through entrepreneurship, young people discover that what they are learning in the classroom is relevant to the real world.</i>

What other programs are there for fostering entrepreneurial thinking for young people?  As we continue to generate and think about LaunchPad 39B here at the lab, what is the role of starting to teach entrepreneurial thinking at the secondary level?   How might this later feed higher ed efforts to incubate entrepreneurs?
