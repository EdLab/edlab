Perhaps Facebook execs got <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1012">the message</a>... or read <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6326"> our recent blog posts</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">Anonymous</a> and our on-going internet/data privacy debate.

As Mashable reported yesterday, "Facebook unveiled a massive wave of privacy changes on Tuesday. It's one of the biggest privacy overhauls in the company's history, one that includes more than a dozen changes to profiles, status updates, locations and tags." After surpassing one trillion page views per month for June & July 2011, and perhaps for the one of the reasons above, Facebook has finally gotten the message and revamped their stance on privacy.    

<b>Just how many changes has the social media behemoth decided to make?  The following is a run-down of the top 6... for more in-depth exploration and a complete list of changes <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/23/facebook-privacy-changes-guide/#view_as_one_page-gallery_box2185">read this</a>:</b> 
1) You can now select which sections of your profile to make private & even select a "Custom" option?!  

2) Users must now select or deselect an "Approve all Posts"  option that will allow people to opt-in or out of location & photo-based tags.   

3) Also, you can now ok photo tag requests from the main photo page. 

4) "View Profile As..." is now more prominently called-out on the main profile page, allowing people to quickly see how others view their current profile.

5) More clearly delineated status updates... buttons more clearly show you what is public and private. 

6) "Places" has been integrated into the publisher bar & mobile apps will feature a "nearby" icon instead of the previous "places."

<b>Takeaways...</b>
Overall, from an initial exploration, I would say that the biggest changes are that users have a more granular control over their privacy.  Furthermore, these changes are more clearly defined & called-out by "buttons" instead of the previous easily overlooked and often-forgotten nested privacy options.  While any improvements to Facebook's privacy policies are a step in the right direction, one of my biggest complaints has not been addressed with these updates, data.  I find it distressing that you can never fully close a Facebook account.  You can turn-off visibility, but your data still remains with the company and who knows what the future ramifications of this will be? While a more user-friendly design of privacy features is a good idea, I would argue that these features should have been present from day one.
