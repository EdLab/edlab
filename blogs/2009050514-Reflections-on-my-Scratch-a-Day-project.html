            <i>*This little essay has been sitting in a Google doc for months now - I'd completely forgotten to share it. Since <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2698">tomorrow's EdLab Seminar</a> focuses on the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> programming environment, I thought I'd wipe the dust off of this short reflection on a month that I spent creating a new Scratch program every day. I called the project "<a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/29148">Scratch-a-day</a>."*</i>

I like to think of myself as a creator. My approach to education, art, and technology is wrapped up in the process of creating things. I create things myself, but I also think a lot about how to engage audiences in the process of creation. 

Within the do-it-yourself and craft communities, the "<a href="http://www.thing-a-day.com/">Thing a day</a>" project has been a great one to draw together people like me - people who like to tinker, build, and create physical objects. Thing a day challenges people to do just what the name implies: they make a new thing (something... anything!!!) each day for an entire month. Participants usually blog the experience, relying on photos, videos, and text descriptions to communicate their ideas and intentions with a community of creators, most of whom are engaged in their own thing a day process.

I gave myself the thing a day challenge as a way of digging me heels into a new (to me) creative tool: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. Scratch is an environment that kids and other novice programmers can use to program games, animations, interactive art, and other creative projects. The programming environment works off of a building block metaphor, and the programming structure is very much influenced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> programming language. This is no coincidence: the creators of Scratch have been working on ways to help kids learn to program in Logo for decades. This branch in the family tree of computer programming begins with Seymour Papert (who brought his thinking about artificial intelligence and cognitive science to into the education sector in the late 1960's). Scratch merges the Logo "branch" with another programming language, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeak">Squeak</a>, which was initiated by Alan Kay and colleagues in 1996. In many respects, Scratch is a "best of both worlds" programming environment, merging lessons learned from decades of innovative research into programming environments that support the authoring, sharing, and representing of new ideas. The Scratch project, in development since 2004, was officially released in 2007 by the MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group.

There's something really unique about Scratch: the community. The Scratch <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">website</a> joins over 280,000 members, over 20% of whom actively contribute projects through the programming environment's well-integrated system for uploading new work. Once shared online, projects can be grouped into galleries, tagged, commented upon, and perhaps most importantly, downloaded. Once downloaded, a user can "remix" the project and share it online. The Scratch website automatically provides attribution, labeling the new project as a "remix" of another user. In addition to sharing code, I've been interested to observe users' sharing attributes, such as custom-created sprites, that can be incorporated into new projects.

By creating a new project each day and uploading it to my "<a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/29148">Scratch-a-day</a>" gallery, I was able to experience firsthand how this online community of creators plays a vital role in the creative process. I've been able to, quite literally, follow the thread of an idea after it is uploaded. I've watched as projects are praised, critiqued, curated into galleries, commented upon, downloaded, and remixed. This is so exciting for me. For the first time, I can follow the full cycle of the creative process as members of the online community create, share, reflect, and revise not only their own project, but those of others. I can download versions of code as it follows an evolutionary path, and I can map how ideas travel. I'm interested in looking at ways that we can better understand and support making and remixing among communities of creators.

Stay tuned for more thoughts and observations! And in the meantime, here are a few ways to learn more about Scratch and related research:
