<a href="http://www.saylor.org/">The Saylor Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization devoted to creating free educational resources.   Their goal is to create a complete set of online college courses, including exams, readings, and all kinds of media.  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/1985">Here's</a> a video describing the Saylor Foundation.
<!--break-->
Pros:
Unlike many other free education resources, the courses offered on Saylor are developed by credentialed professors, and organized into courses divided by lesson, to allow for the students natural progression.  Although Saylor develops original content, a fair amount of the resources offered are brought in from elsewhere on the internet, which I count as a plus, not a minus.  They also provide a rough sense of how much time each course will take to complete.

Cons:
Although it strikes one as a fairly professional and comprehensive effort, there are still some big questions left unresolved, such as: “who will use these resources?”  As everybody knows, there's a lot of idealism in the education world, particularly when at the intersection of educational idealism and technology idealism.  But those already in college don't need Saylor, and it's difficult to imagine many people not in college, not captured by those adult-learning courses advertised in the new york times book review, who do.

Edlab Relevance:
I think Saylor demonstrates how much can be done just by offering professional organized free web resources, while also warning us to think a little harder about the purpose of such organization.  This is something to keep in mind, for instance, when making moodle courses.

Our Takeaway:
I think it's an impressive effort on the execution side, but I'm not sold on the concept.  Until I have a better sense of who will be using it, and why, I'm going to put this is in the dubious category.
