The other night I had the chance to go to something of a fireside chat with <a href="http://www.avc.com">Fred</a> and <a href="http://www.gothamgal.com/">Joanne</a> Wilson, a VC power couple in the city. Both of them being there caused most questions to revolve around gender imbalances and philosophies in the entrepreneurship scene.

About 80% of the companies Joanne invests in are women-led. She says women tend to build businesses that fill voids in their lives that men just don't understand. This doesn't sound too far-fetched, I certainly don't understand the need for <a href="http://www.manicube.com">Manicube</a>.  And men, controlling most purse strings in the venture community, won't fund them for the same reason they won't start them. This chasm between female entrepreneurs and capital is what Joanne aims to bridge.

Fred agrees with Joanne's argument, but he likes to fund software projects where the founders can build the first version themselves. Leaders who are also makers foster the right culture for a startup. This presents a difficulty in funding women led companies: as previously discussed on the blog, not enough women code. He says the reality is that if you just looked at the female-started businesses so far, their male counterparts have produced far better returns. It's not a good thing, it's just true. Things won't change until women start creating companies worth investing in. Joanne thinks programs like ITP, Nara's alma mater, with its 50/50 gender split, will be key in bringing women into this space. 

On another note, they both agreed that higher ed has no bearing on the success of an entrepreneur. In fact, Fred says he's almost positive that the companies in his portfolio led by the degreeless have been the most successful. On top of that, the debt associated with a degree makes potential entrepreneurs far less willing to take risk, and consequently far less likely to do something innovative. Joanne, however, still thinks it's a good idea to go to college if you can afford it.

Another interesting but unrelated tidbit, the couple's asset allocation looks something like:<ul><li>1/3 cash</li><li>1/3 real estate</li><li>1/3 companies in which they have ownership/influence</li></ul>
No stocks. No bonds. No derivatives. Between the various accounting scandals and all the nonsense that happened in 2007/2008, they are convinced that you can't trust the information provided by publicly traded companies and their intermediaries. They only put money into things they have enough control over. While interesting, I suppose their asset allocation model isn't really all that accessible to us common folk.
