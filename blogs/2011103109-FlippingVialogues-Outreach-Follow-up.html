            <b>KEEP THIS PRIVATE!!</b>


Last Friday Joann and I were on the phone with Dr Lodge McCammon and Katie Gimbar (she was in the video that I showed you guys in the D&R presentation), two educators that flipped their classrooms, discussing ways that Vialogues can be a useful tool for them and their students. Both were very interested in Vialogues and thought it was a very cool product. Before our conversation, I emailed them both the example flipping Vialogue that was shown in the D&R presentation and they really liked it. Katie liked how she can have polls in the comments, divide her lecture into different parts through the comments, and the timeline graph above the comments displaying comment activity.

When I suggested that Vialogues can also be used as a way for students to get feedback on a project or presentation, Lodge was very interested in trying that out with his students and said that he will introduce Vialogues to them. Hopefully we will see more users on Vialogues soon. We asked them to give us feedback on the site and also to keep in contact and let us know how they're using Vialogues and what we can do to make Vialogues a better.

All in all, we thought it was a good phone call but we will keep trying to reach out to other educators throughout the country and spread the word about Vialogues. We hope to hear updates from Lodge and Katie on how they're using Vialogues in their classrooms. 

Special thanks to everyone who helped out, and to Joann (with 2 n's) who helped explain Vialogues to these educators.
