<p>
Senator Tom Harkin, as chairman of the Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions Committee, has released the culminating <a href="http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/Contents.pdf">report of his investigation</a> of the for-profit higher-education sector, and the final product has turned out to be a jeremiad against the entire field. Enumerating the sector’s sins has made for a lengthy and unwieldy document, but the case can be reduced to a few basic arguments. 
</p><p>
The problem starts before the potential student has even considered enrolling. The report argues that what we see in the for-profit sector is a gross and almost fraudulent over-investment in recruitment, at the expense of services for actually enrolled students.  The average school employs around "two and a half recruiters for each support services employee," and often trains them to use deceptive practices. Spending on actual instruction accounts for only a small portion (on average, around 17%) of the for-profit school’s budget.
</p><p>
Whatever the specifics, however, one can reasonably infer, as the report does, that there is an overemphasis on recruitment in this sector from the bare statistic that more than half of all students enrolled will drop out without getting a degree. Most of the growth in student enrollment during the past few years for this sector has been in online education, where dropout rates are even higher.
</p><p>
Even here the problem doesn’t end.  For even after the student has dropped out, he or she will be burdened with the debt racked up paying for courses.  A bachelor’s degree from a for-profit school costs about 20% more than from a public university, and associate or certificate programs manage to clock in at around four times their equivalents at traditional community colleges.
</p><p>
96% of for-profit students take out loans.  Often this comes in federal loans, although when these prove inadequate the schools themselves are happy to provide institutional loans with interest rates of 11-18% (the only rates appropriate for the enormously high risk of default from these borrowers).  All told, the for-profit sector accounts for 10% of all higher education American students, but 50% of all student loan defaults.
</p><p>
The idea of for-profit education has always been somewhat dubious in America, and its understandable and justified for the sector to face extra scrutiny.  That said, this worthwhile suspicion serves to deflect attention from the serious failings in the field as a whole.  Our entire higher education system, which produces drop-out rates and student loan debt of comparable magnitude, would stand condemned under the implicit standards of this report.  The result is that sober evaluation is neglected and real reform is perennially delayed as the non-profit schools get a pass.
</p><p>
The heart of the problem, corrupting the practices of both the for- and non-profit education institutions, is a general over-emphasis on enrollment (i.e., how many students and what kind of students apply to the school), coupled with an indifference towards whatever might happen during and after the educational process. The vaunted elite institutions are the poster-children for this approach as they seek to climb in the national, and now international, standings. The ballooning student loans and poor job placement that result will eventually prove unsustainable, but for the moment, there seems to be little pressure for change.
