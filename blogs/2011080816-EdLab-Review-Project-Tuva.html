<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/index.HTML">Microsoft Research's Project Tuva</a> is focused on presenting the first seven lectures of Richard Feynman's lecture series of at Cornell titled "The Character of Physical Law." The lectures were originally the property of Cornell University but Bill Gates decided to purchase them a few years ago and has collaborated with Microsoft Research to create curated content using Silverlight. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The quality of the content. I believe that some of the lectures are illegally available on YouTube. Why you would choose to watch them on YouTube instead of the Project Tuva website? I will explain later. Nevertheless, be sure to see these lectures whenever you get the chance; they clearly demonstrate why Feynman was not only one of the best physicists of the twentieth century, but one of the best teachers. Without dumbing down any of the concepts, he manages to teach the most basic and most complex aspects to science in a clear and coherent manner. One would be hard-pressed to find a better set of science lectures that would be valuable to anyone who has just a basic interest in science. There are a few other minor pros. The curation of content includes many features that allow for effective notetaking while watching the lectures (similar to vialogues). It is easy to browse through each lecture and view additional resources during the lecture. Each video comes with a running transcript.

<b>Cons:</b> The curation of the content is very poor. There are some nice features but they do not work all the time. While I was watching the video lectures, I constantly had to restart the video because it would stop running, often because I would try to take notes or scroll to other parts of the video. There were fewer bugs when I used Project Tuva in Internet Explorer than in Mozilla Firefox (surprise surprise). I think the fact remains that the Silverlight platform is too unstable to provide quality curation of academic content.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> It would be awesome if these videos were available in Vialogues instead of the Silverlight platform. Vialogues is far more stable and easy to use. I think we should start curating already-available content on YouTube by other great lecturers, such as Michael Sandel's Justice series and these <a href="http://www.onlineuniversities.com/blog/2010/02/100-incredible-lectures-from-the-worlds-top-scholars/">great lectures</a>

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> 
While Microsoft Research has created some great features to surround this high-quality lecture series, the bugs and the unhelpful user-interface make this a disappointing presentation of some of the greatest lectures online. Definitely watch it, but beware of the bugs involved.

In the comments section, please place suggestions for great lecture series you have come across that you think could use a Vialogues Upgrade
