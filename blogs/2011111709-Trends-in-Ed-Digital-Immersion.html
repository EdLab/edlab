A recent article in the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/In-the-21st-Century/129744/">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> warns of the coming bookless campus. The argument is for digital immersion learning. By banning books on campus, students will be forced to interact with technology as immersion language students do with their supplemental tongue. The author brings up the possibility of pushback, especially in the humanities, from faculty attached to particular books. He's right that most contemporary books are published in digital format, but as physical books have become remarkably simple to obtain, digital publishing has become hopelessly fragmented. 

The idea of a book-free campus has recently graduated in to the sphere of possibility, but we're still far from being able to offer the best resources to our students in strictly digital form. There's a lot of content still trapped in p-books, especially in an omnivorous field like education. Worse still, many e-content providers are married to the idea of single-user digital materials, an archaic model that isn't friendly to the needs of a digital research community. Even among single-user models, some providers are bound to nonsensical digital lending periods that emulate physical checkout. I deeply disapprove of any book that doesn't provide its own light source, but I get a little misty for the comfort of knowing where to order a book, when it will arrive, that we won't have to pay for it forever, and that it's guaranteed to work with our current systems. That era is behind us, but I hope before we can lay a little infrastructure before we charge ahead.
