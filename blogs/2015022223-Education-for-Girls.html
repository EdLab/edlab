          <p>
            Through her research to find the reasons behind the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/world/africa/bringing-education-to-african-girls.html?_r=1" target = "blank">school enrollment among girls in rural Zimbabwe</a>, Ann Cotton, a British educator and philanthropist discovered that poverty was the main cause. For instance, in the homes of many poor families in Africa, parents have no problem spending the little they have on the education of their sons. They believe the boys are more likely to land jobs. Unlike the boys, many poor families in Asia and Africa prefer to have their daughters marry early to alleviate some of their financial burden. This realization provoked Ms. Cotton to establish Camfed.

Since the organization was founded, it has helped millions of young girls in countries such as Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Over a million students have benefited from the organization. Additionally, those who were at the point of dropping out have remained in their various schools. Overall, Ms. Cotton has proven that it's possible to resolve major issues affecting students worldwide. She wants to make the world a better place for young girls, and by far she has accomplished that goal.
