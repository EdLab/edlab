<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></p>
<p>The following is a synopsis of the question and answer period following the panel talk “The Future of the Internet: Challenges Ahead in Global Cyber Policy” panel held Wednesday, November 30, 2016 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM at the Faculty House Presidential Ballroom<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Panelists:</span></p>
<p>It includes a discussion with:</p>
<p>Laura DeNardis, Professor and Associate Dean, American University (LDN),</p>
<p>Ambassador David Gross, Partner, Wiley Rein (ADG),</p>
<p>Gordon Goldstein, Managing Director, Silver Lake, Adjunct Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations (GG), </p>
<p>Moderated by Merit E. Janow, Dean, School of International and Public Affairs (MEJ)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Panel Focus:</span></p>
<p>The panel is aimed at dealing with the following issues. Who should govern cyberspace and the Internet? Over the past decade, two approaches have emerged: a multi-stakeholder model (MSM) involving a diverse body of State actors that seek consensus through a complex decision-making process, and a cybersovereignty model (CSM) that is built around State sovereignty with less input from the private sector and civil society.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We are at the beginning, not the end, of geopolitical discussions about Internet governance. Our expert panel will explore how the incoming Trump administration should weigh these considerations and address the complex challenge of governing this essential resource, for States and citizens alike.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[D] Merit E. Janow (MEJ)</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"><span style="font-weight: bold;">	</span>								</span></p>
<p>-I have 2 major questions for the panelists:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question (1):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(1) Is there a dominant U.S. consensus regarding the internet? </span></p>
<p>More specifically, are we aligned with:</p>
<p>(a) <span style="font-style: italic;">Multi-Stakeholder Model (MSM): </span></p>
<p>-this model is universal</p>
<p>-an open network</p>
<p>-admininstered by a combination of the government and private sector</p>
<p>-as a result, it has led to multi-stakeholder governance</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(b) <span style="font-style: italic;">C<span>ybersovereignty</span> Model (CSM): </span></p>
<p>-this model is top down in nature</p>
<p>-it works in the name of authority</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>-similarly, what is the degree of stability, predictability of this consensus (assuming there is any)?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[A] Laura DeNardis (LDN): </span></p>
<p>-internet governance is not simply one thing</p>
<p>-there is a strong consensus regarding the multi-stakeholder model (MSM) </p>
<p>(e.g., there is a need to support private industry)</p>
<p>-but this does not just mean that the private sector led this initiative </p>
<p>(e.g., we take it for granted that we can simple post online whatever we want, whenever we want to a WordPress site for an example)</p>
<p>-but in other areas, the technical community, not the private sector, is more important</p>
<p>(e.g., we see innovation below the surface through things like apps such as through the Internet Engineering Task Force for an example)</p>
<p>https://www.ietf.org/about/</p>
<p>-in the good old days (e.g., back in the 1990s), we just started to be able to send emails between different systems and other email providers</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., AOL.com, Excite.com, Lycos.com, USA.net, Netscape.net, Hotmail.com, Juno.com, Netzer.com, Yahoo.com, etc)</p>
<p>-these developments needed a market, good will by different parties, etc.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[C] Ambassador David Gross (ADG):</span></p>
<p>-Laura DeNardis (LDN) is right, but there are also other pieces to this puzzle…</p>
<p>-innovation is a cliché… we live in a culture of innovation</p>
<p>-cultural issues like risk and risk-taking are part of U.S. culture </p>
<p>(e.g., promoted, somewhat, by bankruptcy law, etc.)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-these cultural issues are important to the US approach/perspective to the internet</p>
<p>-I would like to raise a question mentioned earlier in the panel:</p>
<p>-Q: Why does US companies do better than other companies regarding technology?</p>
<p>-A: issues about privacy: say we care about privacy, but actions belie this</p>
<p>-US companies trade on the fact that Americans generally don’t care about privacy</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., people disclose personal information for email, social media, purchasing, etc.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[B] Gordon Goldstein (GG):</span></p>
<p>-as discussed earlier in the panel, back in 2012, the US walked out on the global treaty conference</p>
<p>-back then, we had bipartisan support for a resolution on the internet</p>
<p>-there was a uniting value and vision that transcended partisanship</p>
<p>-there was a critical mass supporting that vision</p>
<p>-but there were still some issues:</p>
<p>(a) net neutrality issue: the internet was reclassified as a utility under 1930s law</p>
<p>(b) ICANN transition: became very divisive and polarizing</p>
<p>-both of these issues slightly eroded the ability to fight</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-these differences in issues were not just in Iran, Sudan, Russia, etc.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-but these issues were also included Europe</p>
<p>-digital trade and policy positions were driven, at least partially, by resentment of American hegemony of technology </p>
<p>(e.g., opposition to companies like Google and Facebook)</p>
<p>-we have fully entered a global debate regarding the internet</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[D] Merit E. Janow (MEJ)<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">									</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Question (2):</span></p>
<p>-this question is regarding the governance of the internet</p>
<p>-fragmentation of the internet and technology has some unavoidable aspects</p>
<p>-the US is such a dynamic country, it will still succeed in the global technology economy</p>
<p>-our future position may be suboptimal, but there is so much dynamism and innovation underneath</p>
<p>-due to these underlying reasons, therefore these sources of innovation will not be hampered….</p>
<p>-I was recently in Beijing during China’s Singles Day</p>
<p>-Alibaba earned $17B worth of internet based sales for Singles Day</p>
<p>-as a result, this leads to two interrelated questions/issues:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-(a) are underlying commercial values transcending complexity of conflicting values?</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., as demonstrated by Alibaba in China and American/European internet companies)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-(b) commercial consequences make for bigger/smaller accountabilities between government and companies?</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[A] Laura DeNardis (LDN): </span></p>
<p>-first regarding the issue of fragmentation:</p>
<p>-the internet both seems to cause and address fragmentation</p>
<p>(e.g., different servers could and possibly could not access certain info)</p>
<p>-now we use the concept of “layers” and move away from interoperability</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., data sovereignty: we store data in certain countries and other jurisdictions)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., businesses trending toward proprietary systems)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., governments being defensive with regards to borders)</p>
<p>-Q: what are the effects of these collective impacts on US market forces?</p>
<p>-A: these effects/forces do impact the digital economy</p>
<p>-in China, these effects/forces may not have the same impact due to the size of the economy</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., the Chinese technology economy can sustain itself internally without regards to international market forces)</p>
<p>-in contrast, US companies monetize the free flow of information</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., information and data collected through social media, etc.)</p>
<p>-as a result, if there is a global (or even just American) move from universality and open standards (e.g., as per Multi-Stakeholder Model [MSM]) towards the Cybersovereignty Model (CSM), this will impact the US economy (e.g., to develop a product)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[C] Ambassador David Gross (ADG):</span></p>
<p>-there are (at least) two types of fragmentation:</p>
<p>(1) imposed fragmentation: </p>
<p>-want to restrict or impose regulation, etc.</p>
<p>(2) natural fragmentation: </p>
<p>-although “natural fragmentation” sounds pejorative, discrimination is not naturally harmful</p>
<p>(e.g., fragmentation and/or discrimination follows natural economic relationships)</p>
<p>-in the future, there can be pressure for universality while still allowing market and/or product differentiation</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">[B] Gordon Goldstein (GG):</span></p>
<p>-in terms of fragmentation/discrimination, we need to think about complexity</p>
<p>-this is similar to when Merit Janow was discussing China’s Singles’ Day</p>
<p>(e.g., Alibaba is like eBay, Amazon, and Google all together in one company</p>
<p>-Alibaba is the dominant player in the Chinese economy)</p>
<p>-my company Silver Lake is an investor in Alibaba</p>
<p>-we invested in Alibaba due to the brilliance of its market model</p>
<p>-Alibaba is moving/has moved from a national champion to global power</p>
<p>(e.g., Alibaba is in the top 10 of significant global technology companies)</p>
<p>-Alibaba functions along with China </p>
<p>(for example, it works along with “The Great Firewall” in terms of policing content and access)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., The Wall Street Journal wrote a story regarding efforts to make a social media score for Chinese people for the role they play in upholding norms of society)</p>
<p>-there are two competing notions:</p>
<p>(a) huge innovation (e.g., Alibaba)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>v. </p>
<p>(b) social control and monitoring</p>
<p>-therefore, there is a complexity within/of these models:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-either fragment or consolidate</p>
<p>(some companies/governments communicate with each other, some do not)</p>
