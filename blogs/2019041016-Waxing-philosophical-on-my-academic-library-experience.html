          <p>
            <p>I never used my undergraduate library. My interaction with library patrons was limited to when they visited me in the university's writing center (located on the library's second floor) for consultations and reprimanded me for playing AC/DC too loudly in said writing center when no one was signed up for appointments. I didn't use the library for a variety of reasons: I conducted all my research online, the building was old and lacking in natural light, the library felt very cold and isolating because there were no collaborative spaces, and none of my friends ever spent time there. Additionally, I'd grown up always doing homework at a desk in my room so it didn't occur to me that I might change that habit when in college. Of course many students do, but perhaps because my library was not particularly inviting and no one I wanted to be around was there, it didn't seem like a change worth considering.</p><p><br /></p><p>When I arrived at TC three years years after graduating college, I'd changed a lot, but I assumed my relationship with the library would be similar to how it had been in undergrad. When I had to choose between various informational sessions to attend on orientation day, I didn't choose the library info session because in my mind I already knew what an academic library was and I knew I wasn't going to be using it that much. Funny, because at this point I was already pretty far along in the EdLab interview process, but I wasn't connecting the dots between my work and my academic life quite in that way.</p><p><br /></p><p>While my first semester I maintained research and study habits similar to those I'd had in undergrad, in my second semester, the extensive amount of collaborative work required by my program had me meeting classmates on the second floor of the library regularly. My peers and I started staying after meetings ended, connecting with others from our classes who'd also congregated there, and continuing working on individual assignments in the company of others. I started coming to the third floor to do my readings instead of holing up in my apartment. It got to the point where I could show up at any time of day, any day of the week, and find at least a couple people I knew in the library to say hi to and exchange thoughts on an assignment or research project before getting down to work.</p><p><br /></p><p>During my last meeting with my advisor before finishing my Master's thesis, he asked me an interesting question. As a new, young professor, he recognized that a big part of his job in advising students was in mentoring them, yet he really wasn't sure how best to help students outside the strict realm of academia, especially when it came to translating academic success into professional success. "You seem to be really good at meeting people, Melanie," he told me. "That's how you got your internship, that's how you've made important research connections. How did you do that at TC?"</p><p><br /></p><p>My response was, "Honestly, all my friends and I joke about it, but we all met at the library." I made lifelong friends at the library commiserating on assignments and arguing passionately about the things that interest us most, the things I came to this place to study and didn't always feel like I had the time or opportunity to discuss in class. Of course we eventually left the library and went elsewhere to enjoy each others' company, but it was always such an important meeting place for us. My professor's response to this was to seriously write down "Gottesman Library" on a sticky note, which I found both endearing and a little alarming, but he understood; networking takes many forms, and getting to know your peers opens doors not just to enriched personal lives, but to job opportunities.</p><p><br /></p><p>In thinking about the future of the library as well as its current state, I know the space and specific resources offered here will continue to evolve over time. I think it's important to think about what exactly they might look like five to ten years from now, what exactly "innovation" means for an academic library, and how our library will change to anticipate shifts in technology, culture, budget, and education. I have my criticisms and suggestions for the library of the here and now, but in thinking about the purpose of a graduate library of the future, I found myself focusing on the fact that among the critical resources this library provides are access to two huge things: a social common area for a busy, adult student body that has no other social common area in which to congregate casually on campus, and a reliable place to find consistent quiet when the rest of New York City won't shut up. Regardless of what students are using to read, study, and learn, these two uses of the space seem like constants to me, though I'm no expert. </p><p><br /></p><p>Anyways, those are my ramblings. Hopefully it's helpful as we continue the conversation about what it looks like to provide important and relevant services and tools at a graduate library. Thoughts/questions/comments welcome.</p>
