          <p>
            The popular site, Facebook.com, has amassed more than 30 million registrants since it started in February 2004. It is another social networking site, just like MySpace.com and Xanga.com, which is common to High School and College students. But this is no ordinary site; people's lives literally revolve around Facebook. I have a Facebook account and log in at least once a day. I personally believe that Facebook is a fun and interactive site. However, some students may not feel that same way because they have encountered some negative aspects, aside from Facebook's legal problems. 

Students who want to find <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20202935/">jobs</a> may regret posting private pictures and comments on Facebook. Employers not only screen resumes and conduct interviews, but also view job candidates' Facebook profiles. The boss wants to know if the applicant is actually a “professional.” Pictures may show the person drinking, smoking, or doing other unprofessional activities. Offensive comments can also hurt an applicant's chances of getting the job. 

Not many Colleges check up on their students through Facebook, but <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19813092/">Oxford University</a> is an expert at doing just that. Any picture or comment pertaining to illegal activities will lead to a student being charged with a fine. Since I am about to head off to college soon, I would disapprove of this invasion of privacy. Nonetheless, other colleges may soon pick up this way to spy on their students. 

Just as MySpace has online predators, Facebook may have some too. Some Facebook users have profiles with personal information that are visible to everyone. AOL screen names, phone numbers, and even addresses are posted on the site. Police are now looking into Facebook because a few <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20041040/">convicted sex offenders</a> have registered on the site. 

The entire Facebook company is being sued by <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19937202/">three owners of ConnectU</a>, which is another social networking site. They claimed that Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, stole their ideas when they all were attending Harvard University. Millions of users would be unhappy if Facebook is shut down. 

All Facebook users need to be cautious of the pictures they upload and the comments they say. No one has privacy on the internet. And people may not even have to worry about the problems of Facebook if it does get successfully sued.
