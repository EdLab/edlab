<p><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/signup">Wattpad</a> connects people who love to read and write together. Avid readers Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen started the Toronto-based company in 2006. The members of the fast-growing Wattpad community (over 40 million writers and readers worldwide) share ideas and exchange feedback with one another. New and seasoned authors can share their work as it is developed, and at various stages- drafts, chapters, a complete book or one in a series of many. Along with commenting on individual stories, users can also join clubs, participate in writing contests, and win awards. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Readers can select from many genres and formats. Short stories, fiction, fan fiction, non-fiction and poetry are freely available for Wattpad community members to read. Each of these works is tagged with author-designated keywords. These tags are clickable and can lead users to content they might not otherwise discover. The "Similar Stories" section acts as a kind of readers’ advisory, which can also assist users in discovering new stories. </p>

<p>Wattpad presents writers with an opportunity to share their work and get feedback. The site is free for writers with an understanding that the stories they post are theirs, and never become Wattpad’s property. Writers are able to further define their copyright preferences before they post any content. Authors can post and publish the content publicly or privately at various stages of the creative process. Authors can also upload their own book covers using a still image or YouTube video.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Even though Wattpad content is free, users must create an account to experience the majority of the features. Also the comments section is set up differently depending whether you are reading on a desktop or mobile device. On mobile the comments are paired with the related paragraphs, although users can elect to turn off this inline commenting. On desktop the comments are placed below the content only.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Wattpad is easy to navigate, intuitively designed, and can be accessed across desktop or mobile devices. Whether you want to read, contribute content, share thoughts or just browse, there is much to explore.</p>
