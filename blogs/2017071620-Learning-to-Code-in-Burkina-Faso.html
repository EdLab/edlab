<p>Access to education remains elusive for many children in developing countries. Often times, parents are too poor to afford school fees and other education-related costs such as transportation and books. Even those fortunate enough to be enrolled in school have to contend with poor instruction. The result is a never-ending cycle where school-aged children are often at work instead of the classroom, laboring for their daily existence. But a technology driven program in the small West African nation of Burkina Faso is inspiring a new generation of students. </p>
 
<p>With support from the TuaRes Foundation, <a href= "https://www.participaid.com/project/view/3">Girls Tech</a> is an exclusive program that teaches young girls basic coding and other technology related skills. The goal is for the girls to translate these skills into their future learning and ultimately professional life. The tech gender gap often noted in Western countries is even more apparent in places like Burkina Faso, where cultural norms mean female students are discouraged from pursuing certain academic interests. </p>
 
<p>How can developing countries integrate technology in their classrooms? How can we foster interest in coding among traditionally underrepresented groups? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/38407/">Join the discussion on Vialogues.</a> </p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

 <p><b>01:27 Nantwi:</b> This program is so needed in a place like Burkina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world. It provides the girls with access to technology and learning they otherwise wouldn't have. It also fosters an interest and curiosity they can carry with them on their educational and professional journeys.</p>

 <p><b>02:16 saraehardman:</b> The gender gap in tech is real, but in cases like this, tech also helps decrease that gap. By learning how to use computers and code, these girls know that they're not only improving their own job opportunities, but also those of the younger girls who will follow in their paths.</p>
