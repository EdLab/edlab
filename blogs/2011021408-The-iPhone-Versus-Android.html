          <p>
            I recently gave in to the smart phone race and acquired a T-Mobile G2 mobile phone. I was sure to prove a point and return it within its 20 day trial but I can confidently say I am hooked ! It's definitely a smart phone and has made my life a lot easier, but I am still exploring if  I am smart enough for it. My sister acquired the iPhone recently and the house is filled with a constant discussion of which technology/phone is better and who specifically will emerge the winner in the next few months...so here is what I think, please feel free to comment:

As of Q1 ‘10, Nielsen data shows that 23% of mobile consumers now have a smartphone, up from just 16% in Q2 ‘09. Vying for their share of the smartphone market are two of the tech industry’s fiercest competitors:  Apple, with its iconic iPhone, and Google, with its fast-growing Android operating system. Between Q4 ’09 and Q1 ’10, Android and iPhone’s share of the smartphone market grew by 2% each. At the same time, smartphone leader Blackberry lost 2% share to fall to 35% of all smartphones while Microsoft’s Windows Mobile OS also lost 2% to fall to 19%.

<strong>The short term victor (next 6 months) is the Apple iPhone. The long term victor (next 3-5 years)  the Google Android.</strong>

The industry lifecycle imitates the human lifecycle. The stages of industry lifecycle include fragmentation, shake-out, maturity and decline (Kotler 2003). Android Operating Share (25.8%) is still behind Apple iOperating Share (28.6%) and Verizon will likely hold on to unlimited plans as longs as it feasibly—and profitably—can contributing to significant Iphone sales. For its part, Apple admitted during its own earnings call last week that it has had trouble keeping up with iPhone demand. "We're going to do everything possible to get the iPhone into as many hands of those customers as possible," indicating its ‘Maturity’ in the third stage in the industry lifecycle. Maturity is a stage at which the efficiencies of the dominant business model give these organizations competitive advantage over competition (Kotler, 2003). The competition in the industry is rather aggressive because there are many competitors and product substitutes.

Furthermore, among users planning to get a new smartphone, current smartphone owners showed a preference for the Apple iPhone (35 percent), while 28 percent of both smartphone and featurephone planned smartphone upgraders indicated they wanted a device with an Android operating system as their next mobile phone. Price, competition, and cooperation take on a complex form (Gottschalk &amp; Saether, 2006). Some companies may shift some of the production overseas in order to gain competitive advantage, which the Iphone is already employing with its new CDMA technology. Android technology on the flip side continues to be characterized with ‘Shake- Out’ features in which a new industry emerges. During the shake-out stage, competitors start to realise business opportunities in the emerging industry. The value of the industry also quickly rises. While the iPhone has been the headline grabber over the last few years in the smartphone market, Google’s Android OS has shown the most significant expansion in market share among current subscribers. Android’s rise is even more noticeable among new smartphone subscribers in the last six months where Android has nosed past Apple’s iOS in the last quarter to grab a 27% share of those recent smartphone subscribers.

Another consideration which presents the argument that the Iphone demonstrates relative market share growth is that Americans continue to hunger for mobile phone apps. According to the latest edition of The Nielsen Company’s Apps Playbook, the average number of apps that smartphone app downloaders have on their phones is now 27, up from 22 in December 2009. Games continue to be the most popular category by far, with 61% of smartphone owners and 52% of feature phone owners reporting using a games app in the past 30 days. Weather apps are the next most popular category. But while all categories of applications are more popular on smartphones than on feature phones, the difference is more pronounced in categories such as Maps/Navigation, where more computing power, larger screens and touch interfaces deliver a more satisfying experience.

In conclusion, the iPhone seems to rate high on the following:
<ol>
	<li>gaming apps</li>
	<li>sex appeal (there was a <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/dont-be-ugly-by-accident/">study</a> that showed that iPhone users have more sex !)</li>
	<li>female preferred</li>
</ol>
The Android on the other hand rates high on:
<ol>
	<li>variety apps</li>
	<li>versatile and more converted customers</li>
	<li>male preferred</li>
</ol>
