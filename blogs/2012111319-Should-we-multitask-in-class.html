<b>Title:</b> Examining the Affects of Student Multitasking With Laptops During the Lecture (2010)
<p>
<b>Authors: </b> James M. Kraushaar & David C. Novak
<p>

<b>Study Design:</b> It is difficult not to notice how common the use of laptops and mobile devices in the classroom has become, particularly over the last few years. This seems to be an inevitable trend. Naturally, questions arise: are we all capable of multitasking in class? Are these devices helping or hurting learning? To what extent do multitasking activities affect learning outcomes?
<p>

Authors Kraushaar & Novak, in a paper published in the Journal of Information Systems Education, investigated students’ use of laptops during lectures. The study used <i>spyware</i> to monitor students’ activities, as well as self-reports. The researchers divided student activities into productive and distractive tasks, which they referred to as "course-related" and "non course-related" tasks. They also identified the frequency and duration of the activities performed. A productive task is defined as one directly related to completing a primary task associated with the course material (i.e., browsing the lecture slides, taking notes, etc.); the distractive tasks include surfing and entertainment, email, Instant Messaging (IM), PC operations, etc. 
<p>
The study involved 97 undergraduate students from 3 Management Information Systems classes, in which laptops were required. Although the students were assured that the activity monitor would conceal their names with codes, some students did not share their activity logs. 42% of the students activated the activity monitor, so that their laptop activities were logged and analyzed. However, correlational analyses indicated no significant differences in the academic performance (GPA, SAT scores, computer literacy) of those sharing logs and those declining to do so.
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
Using the students’ usage data and their self-reports, there was no significant evidence found that a higher frequency of multitasking is correlated with lower academic performance. The only multitasking subcategory that was negatively correlated with students’ quiz averages, projects, and final exam grades was instant messaging.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
These results demonstrate that students are indeed capable of multitasking in class. In fact, other studies, <a href=" http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212001926"> In-class multitasking and academic performance </a>, <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/fg3g161336041905/">Notebook or Facebook? How Students Actually Use Mobile Devices in Large Lectures</a>, have also indicated that students are able to multitask in the classroom without negative impact on their performance. In the new era of greater connectivity in classrooms, perhaps educators might even find ways to capitalize on students’ multitasking ability, for instance, by providing more diverse learning materials or integrating various in-class activities through mobile devices.
