The Online Revolution: High-Quality Education for the 100%
Daphne Koller

Monday, March 26th, 3:30pm
Davis Auditorium

Last year, Stanford University offered three online courses, which
anyone in the world could enroll in and take for free. Students were
expected to submit homeworks, meet deadlines, and were awarded a
"Statement of Accomplishment" only if they met our high grading bar.
Together, these three courses had enrollments of around 350,000
students, making this one of the largest experiments in online education
ever performed.  In this talk, I'll report on the outcome of this bold
experiment in distributed education, and why we believe this model can
provide both an improved classroom experience for our on-campus
students, via a flipped classroom model, as well as a meaningful
learning experience for the millions of students around the world who
would otherwise never have access to education of this quality.  I'll
describe the pedagogical foundations for this type of teaching, and the
key technological ideas that support them, ranging from easy-to-create
video chunks, to a scalable online Q&A forum where students can get
their questions answered quickly, to sophisticated autograded homeworks.

Whereas technology and automation have made almost all segments of our
economy---such as agriculture, energy, manufacturing,
transportation---vastly more efficient, education today isn't much
different than it was 300 years ago.  Given also the rising costs of
higher education, the hyper-competitive nature of college admissions,
and the lack of access to a high quality education, we think there is a
huge opportunity to use modern internet and AI technology to
inexpensively offer a high quality education online.  Through such
technology, we envision millions of people gaining access to the
world-leading education that has so far been available only to a tiny
few, and using this education to improve their lives, the lives of their
families, and the communities they live in.
