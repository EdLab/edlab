<p><a href="http://www.artbit.com">Artbit</a> is like the <a href="http://www.shazam.com/apps">Shazam</a> of art. Just snap a picture of a painting, and the app will recognize it and instantly pull up information about the work and the artist. Much of the information on the app is crowd-sourced, which means users can add new artwork at any time to contribute to the database. In addition, Artbit provides information on nearby museums and exhibits so that you’re always in the know when it comes to art.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Artbit has incredibly accurate recognition capabilities. It recognized even the most obscure paintings I pointed my phone at. The app currently has over 1 million paintings in its database, although because much of its info is crowd-sourced, that number continues to grow. When Artbit recognizes a painting, it provides you with the title and year of the painting, three "did you know?" tidbits, and a brief history of the painting and the artist. The app also has an audio option for people who would rather listen to the info than read it. In addition, for some of the more famous paintings, the app even provides an educational video on the work sourced from Khan Academy. Artbit also lets users peruse museum and gallery collections on the app, and <a href="http://www.artbit.com/artbit-for-education/">its website</a> provides resources for educators who want to use it with their students.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Artbit seems to work only on 2D pieces of art; its recognition capabilities do not extend to sculpture or other three dimensional artistic pieces. Therefore, it’s database is far from an exhaustive collection of art or any museum.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you’re interested in museums and art, Artbit will be useful for you. It would be a great companion for visiting museums so you could snap your favorite pieces and save them in your digital collection to revisit later. Also, it would give you an inside scoop on the piece and the artist that a museum generally doesn’t provide. The app would also be a great tool for anyone who’s ever encountered an unlabeled painting, say at an office or school, that they’ve simply needed to know more about.</p>
