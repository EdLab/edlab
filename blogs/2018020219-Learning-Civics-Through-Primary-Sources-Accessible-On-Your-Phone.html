<p><a href="http://engagingcongress.org/">Engaging Congress</a> is an app developed by Indiana University’s Center of Representative Government in collaboration with the Library of Congress. This free app lets students explore primary sources and explanatory videos in order to understand the challenges of sustaining a representative democracy in a complex and diverse nation. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Engaging Congress turns civics learning into an interactive, multimedia experience. Targeted toward high school students and older middle schoolers, the app features animated videos on central topics and relevant debates regarding the U.S. political system, revolving around themes such as voting rights, the federal budget, and the separation of powers. After each video, there is a set of primary sources that users can read and complete assessment quizzes on. At any time, users may also engage in trivia practice or a scored and timed trivia challenge.</p> 

<p>The ability to view dozens of primary sources up close and personal, from photos and newspapers to political cartoons, gives students the opportunity to understand the inner workings of government from different perspectives across time. Engaging Congress not only allows access to these relics, but incorporates them into student learning about government processes that are still in effect today.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>After each animated video, the user is shown a primary source and a set of questions. However, no background information is given on the source or event it portrays before the student answers the quiz questions. I found this lack of context frustrating, especially since quiz scores demonstrate deductive abilities and prior knowledge rather than what the user actually learned from the primary sources. Having students make educated guesses based on clues and deductions from close observation is an interactive way to learn, but it would be more productive to first lead users through an example of how to look for clues to piece together historical mysteries, especially when it comes to images or political cartoons. </p>

<p>Regarding technical aspects of the app, I found a few of the activities confusing to follow. The event map in particular didn’t have clear instructions, and while there is a question mark icon to click on when you need more explanation, it wasn’t successful at clarifying what it expected me to do. Additionally, some of the activities require a very responsive, precise touch screen, which I found my iPhone SE couldn’t provide.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>While this is not the sort of educational app that students will likely be inspired to use outside of the classroom, Engaging Congress definitely holds promise as a classroom and test prep tool. If educators are looking to appeal to different learning styles in their social studies, government, or civics courses, this app could be an effective resource.</p>
