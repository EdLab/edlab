<h1>The Forgotten Student</h1>

<p>A substantial online system has developed outside of the confines of the traditional higher education establishment. Over the past decade, online schools, taking advantage of the greater flexibility and growth potential of online education, have enrolled, educated, and certified thousands of students.  As if waking from a dream, the mainstream educational world is belatedly beginning to examine this brave new world that has sprung up in its midst (approaching about 15% of all higher education students at the moment).</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.learninghouse.com/">LearningHouse</a>, an online education consulting firm, partnered with <a href="http://www.educationdynamics.com/market-research.aspx">Aslanian Market Research</a> to conduct a large-scale survey of online education students, and has published a <a href="http://www.learninghouse.com/resources/whitepapers/research-study">report </a> detailing their findings.  In broad strokes, it appears that students at online education institutes constitute, demographically speaking, a very different body than those attending to and acquiring traditional schooling.</p>
<p>They come in all ages (only a fifth are younger than 25), and come generally to advance in their already established careers.  Online education gives them the opportunity to qualify for promotions or career shifts while still remaining employed. Although this qualification often takes the form of a bachelorâ€™s or graduate degree, 25% are seeking some form of a more specialized certificate or license.  The majority is enrolled in non-profit schools, dispelling the image of the field created by the prominence of schools like the University of Phoenix.</p>

<p>Online education, as indicated by this survey, offers a more convenient and flexible experience, but at the cost of weaker and less consistent contact with instructors. It appears that the greatest concern for students when selecting an online school is the reputation of an institution.  Reputation, already an object of concern for students at traditional schools, is understandably of even greater importance in the arriviste field of online education where most programs have not had time to build reputations.  Nonetheless, there is the very real prospect that online education will continue to grow as a second or lesser tier option.</p>

<p>With elite universities beginning to devote more serious attention to online programs, many of them partnering with companies like Coursera or edX to provide online courses alongside their traditional offerings, it will be worth watching to see if the growth of online education at these established institutions can break through the emerging stratification that has kept online education on the margin.</p>
