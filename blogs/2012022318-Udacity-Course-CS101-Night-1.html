            <b>Tweet on the course from @thechaz:

“I never liked school, but man, I loved CS101 so much. I already did the first unit. I'm excited.. for homework, what is wrong here?”</b>

I can relate!  I literally squeeled with delight as I answered my first quiz question right... it is so satisfying and fun to get instant feedback from the mini quizzes embedded after each micro-video (embedded from YouTube).  Users can ask questions and receive badges for engagement in what looks like a <a href="http://disqus.com/welcome/">Disqus</a>-inspired discussion board (see screen shot below).     

<b>Here are my initial take-aways from the first night fo interacting with this course material:</b> 

<b>1)</b> The format is similar to <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6992">Stanford and Thrun's ground-breaking Artificial Intelligence course</a>, but the interface is cleaner and easier to navigate. 

<b>2)</b> The addition of two tabbed categories below the video screen with both "Instructor Comments" and "Supplementary Material" further helps to reinforce the course material (see screen shot below).  The "Supplementary" material includes lengthy PDFs, which the time-pressed night-schooler can either ignore or download as needed. 

<b>3)</b> Badges are really an incentive to interact with a discussion board. I felt silly, but gratified when I got my first, "Popular Question," as a result of my question receiving over 100 views: "Are these interactive videos fully functional on a smartphone (i.e. can I access & complete quizzes etc.)?"  I received answers within hours... yes, but Python coding tests could not be accessed.  

<b>4)</b> What looks like a Wacom Pen is used to hand "draw-out" course content and quiz material... this is then projected in real-time onto a second layer.  Imagine a video of the instructor drawing on a white piece of paper with invisible ink that then appears on a transparent piece of glass in front of his hand.  Hard to explain, but amazing to watch! *Check-out this discussion board description of the process (at the very end of this post).   

<b>5)</b> This course has over 70,000 students enrolled... online learning with short, interactive content, that awards a grade/credentials for completion/accuracy and costs nothing is truly a viable way to learn and an important model for the future.

<b>EdLab Relevance...</b> 
I plan to conduct an upcoming D&R session in which you will all get to try-out and analyze the Udacity platform and experience as a possible model for mSchool!

*As quoted from "Zebriah" on <a href="http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/1132/pen-and-software-used-in-the-lectures">this thread</a> of the Udacity message board: <i>From the pen you can tell he is using Wacom Cintiq, as Nemesis has mentioned before, with a fairly good overhead camera and a screen recording software such as Camtasia Studio. The recorded video appears to then be matched up with the software using chroma keying. Or the team, being as smart as they are, wrote a program to do the screen recording and keying at the same time for easy video layering later.</i>
