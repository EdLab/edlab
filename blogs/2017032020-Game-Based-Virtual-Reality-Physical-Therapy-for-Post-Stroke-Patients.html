<p>Virtual reality (VR) has been shown to be an effective therapeutic tool for <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3746/how-virtual-reality-can-help-you-overcome-your-fears">overcoming fears</a> and helping children with autism<a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3595/testing-an-autism-therapy-with-virtual-reality"> work through social anxiety</a>. Now, it is being tested as a supplement in physical therapy. A new study examined whether VR could have positive therapeutic effects on post-stroke patients as they relearned how to walk.</p>
 
<p>The study included 30 patients who had recently suffered strokes. Half participated in regular physical therapy, while the other half participated in a VR-supplemented therapy. While no VR headsets were used in this experiment, the latter therapy involved creating a virtual environment by projecting Nintendo Wii games onto a wall in an isolated room. In each case, the researchers measured differences in gait balance and occurrence of falls before and after therapy.</p>
 
<p>Regarding gait balance, both the control group and the VR group improved on a comparable basis. Although both groups also saw a reduction in the occurrence of falls, the decrease was more significant in the group emersed in the virtual environment. In addition, the researchers noted that the patients who used VR-supplemented therapy had greater levels of motivation to complete their sessions.</p>
 
<p>This suggests that VR-supplemented therapy, through the use of a Wii or similar technology, could have significant impacts on physical therapy for post-stroke victims. The differences between the two groups were not great enough to suggest throwing traditional physical therapy to the curb, but the study does support game-based VR as a motivational tool to help patients regain balance and walk steadily once more.</p>
