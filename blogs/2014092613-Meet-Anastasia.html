            <em><img class="size-medium wp-image-21063 alignleft" src="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2014/09/60322_557431081523_3752466_n-201x300.jpg" alt="image" width="201" height="300" />Are you a Teachers College student, and, if so, what are you studying?</em>

I'm  coming in from outside the TC community; I got my MS in library and  information science from St. John's University in May 2014,  concentrating in academic librarianship, and did my undergrad at  Wesleyan University in East Asian studies.

<em>Where’s your hometown?</em>

San Diego, CA.

<em>What did you want to be when you grew up?</em>

I  wanted to do something conventional and stable by day, and be a  classical pianist and flautist by night, sort of like the Ron  Swanson/Duke Silver duality in <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>.

<em>What was your first job?</em>

Aside from the odd tutoring gig here and there, my first job was as a salesperson and balloon "specialist" at a party goods store.

<em>What has been your best job?</em>

If we're defining the word "job" loosely, being a student is probably the best job I've ever had. If we're talking about <em>paid</em> jobs, I loved working in the Children's Library at the New York Society Library, a private  library on the Upper East Side. My colleagues and supervisors were  amazing, and I enjoyed being a part of the institution's long and  fascinating <a href="http://nysoclib.org/about/history-library" target="_blank">history</a>.  I loved reconnecting with children's literature, new and old, and there was something really satisfying about finding and building the ability to  connect with kids as an adult.

<em>What do you remember about your first day of school?</em>

Literally  nothing. I do remember starting a lunch-item swap ring with my friend  somewhere in the middle of my kindergarten year, though. I like to think  that that entrepreneurial spirit remains with me.

<em>Your favorite meal:</em>

That's  highly variable because it's usually the one that I've most recently  derived more-than-average enjoyment from. Right now, it's a corn,  scallion and cheddar strata that I made from a <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2014/09/corn-cheddar-and-scallion-strata/" target="_blank">Smitten Kitchen recipe</a>.

<em>Are you a morning or night person?</em>:

I consider myself a late-afternoon kind of person on the morning-night spectrum.

<em>A delicious dessert:</em>

Hot chocolate from Valrhona chocolate. No marshmallows.

<em>Song you love no matter how many times you hear it</em>:

The  Prelude from Prelude and Fugue in B Flat Major from Book 1 of Bach's  Well-Tempered Clavier. Or, since that's not technically a song, "A  Little Priest" from <em>Sweeney Todd</em>; try not to read too much into that.

<em>A country you’d like to visit</em>:

Japan. I took Japanese to a fairly advanced level in undergrad, and by my last year, I was the only one who'd never actually <em>been</em> to Japan.

<em>A book you strongly recommend</em>?

<em>The Flavor Bible</em> by  Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg. It provides a basis for understanding  why you like the food you like, and is a great tool for figuring out  what else you might like to cook or eat.

<em>A sport you enjoy playing (or watching)</em>?

Swimming, both pool and non-pool.

<em>TOP THREE….</em><em>Best places to read?</em>

3)  On the train when it's not too crowded. 2) In bed, either with a  flashlight or near enough to a light switch that  you don't have to get out of bed after you put the book down. 1) Sitting  sideways in an armchair with high arms so that your back is  supported by one of the arms and your legs are dangling over the other.
