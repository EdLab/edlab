            In our ongoing struggle to live longer, <a href ="http://io9.com/5924210/could-going-into-space-actually-make-people-live-longer"> Doctor Nathaniel Szewczyk of the University of Nottingham is leading a new study</a>that says going into space can make you live longer, which would be awesome if we could go into space without getting into NASA. It's true that when astronauts spend a long time up in the great unknown the effects of zero gravity can weaken the body and attribute the muscles. Only four people have lived longer than an entire year continuously in space. Sergei Krikalev holds the record for most time spent in space, which is 2.2 years over the course of six space flights. That's just enough time to see easily how the muscles can waste away and bones can deteriorate. However, this study shows that worms taken into space and exposed to zero gravity cause certain genes to be expressed at lower levels than when they were at earth. In addition, toxic proteins that normally accumulate the muscles are usually suppressed. Well apparently, the worm C. elegans which is the worm use frequently for space travel suffers muscle atrophy surprisingly similar to humans and when Szewczyk replicated those changes in genes expression in the worms in the lab they started to live longer. That's really fascinating and all, but the scientists working on this experiment are not really sure what causes this effect. Dr. Szewczyk has some ideas and there is a good chance that humans can enjoy the same effect as he explained in a recent statement, “We identified seven genes, which were down-regulated in space and whose inactivation extended lifespan under laboratory conditions...We are not entirely certain, but it would appear that these genes are involved in how the worm senses the environment and signals changes in metabolism in order to adapt to the environment. For example, one of the genes we have identified encodes insulin which, because of diabetes, is well known to be associated with metabolic control. In worms, flies, and mice insulin is also associated with modulation of lifespan.”
Okay so what does this mean for the frequent space flyers? It means that aging in space may be better than here on earth. It could also be that space flights slows down the aging process. So the question is, Is going to space to expand you lifespan really worth it with all the risks space traveling has already and do you think we are heading in the right directions focusing on space matters or do you think we should just focus on what happens here on earth? I would love to hear your opinions in the comments below.
