<p><i>"This collaboration with StartEd enables our faculty and students to interact with exciting, emerging companies from all around the world, and some of the countryâ€™s most successful Edtech entrepreneurs."</i> (<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/july/started-and-nyu-steinhardt-launch-ny-edtech-accelerator-and-incubator.html">Dominic J. Brewer Dean of NYU Steinhardt </a>) </p>
 
<p><b> Universities and Job Creation</b></p>
 
<p>The gap between industry and education has been a hot-button issue over the past 15 years as scores of positions go unfilled and hundreds of recent graduates have trouble finding jobs. Though some argue that it is not the university's job to provide students with hard skills that could depreciate with time, some universities are taking a new approach to solving this problem by encouraging students to create the jobs of the future through start-up support. </p>
 
<p><b> Merging with Venture Capitalist </b></p>
 
<p>One notable example is the new <a href=" https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/july/started-and-nyu-steinhardt-launch-ny-edtech-accelerator-and-incubator.html ">NY Edtech</a> accelerator and incubator created by NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and StartEd Companies, Inc. This 3-month incubator awards finalists upwards of $170,000 each along with business, technology, and education mentors, and coaches to help them build successful businesses. The collaboration offers students and members of the public the opportunity to create their own employment and change the industry landscape. However, this innovative thinking is not only reserved to NYU; other universities around the nation are taking it upon themselves to fund student ideas in exchange for equity in their companies. </p>
 
<p>This new approach to entrepreneurship brings industry directly into the education space in a way that has rarely been seen before. Despite this potential, some people are skeptical of the educational and practical benefits of the university funds. <a href="http://bit.ly/2ey0REU"> Forbes magazine</a> pointed to the 80% failure rate for most start-up companies and the potential for wasted funds that could have been used elsewhere. However, NYU Dean Dominic J. Brewer believes combining scholars and tech-savvy innovators will create "pathbreaking educational solutions." The only way to know for sure is to wait and see.</p>
