<p><a href="http://www.graphite.org/">Graphite</a> is a nonprofit site from <a href="http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission">Common Sense Media</a> that contains a library of online learning websites, games, apps, and digital curricula along with  ratings and reviews for each product. The reviews are written by the siteâ€™s in-house professional educators and augmented by reviews from classroom teachers who provide their opinion of the resource based on how they have used it in the classroom. Teachers rank the learning possibilities of the tool on a five-point scale. Metadata like price, targeted grades, subject, and platform are also provided for each learning resource.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The metadata makes it easy for educators and parents to find the right educational resource. Reviews are a good length to provide need-to-know information. The review gives educators ideas for how to use the tool in the classroom. The ratings provide a quick overview of the features of each learning resource. This is particularly useful for teachers choosing between two or more similar learning resources.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The reviews provide a general overview of the app and how to use it in the classroom. It would be interesting if these reviews considered how the learning resource helps students learn a concept. The learning rating has only three dimensions: engagement, pedagogy, and support. It might be helpful for educators if the reviews addressed more dimensions to give educators a deeper understanding of how students will learn through a particular resource. Another suggestion would be to include a description of how a learning resource helps users learn by remembering, applying, analyzing, or creating.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Graphite provides an expansive library of online learning resources with sufficient information and reviews to give educators a sense of the product before they dedicate time and money. There is an exponentially increasing number of online learning resources that are becoming available for educators to use, and a platform to make sense of these resources will become essential for busy educators. The filtering functionality makes it easy for educators to find learning resources that are relevant to their teaching needs. The next step for the growth of Graphite will be to make resources easier to find and provide more in-depth reviews.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Graphite is an online learning resource bank with reviews for busy educators.</p>
