          <p>
            In past posts on the semester's library services activities, I've made an effort to use images, many from our digitized Historical Photographs collection (all of which can be found in our online archive PocketKnowledge), to put current developments in the library and the College in context from a historical standpoint.

[caption id="attachment_22098" align="alignleft" width="150"]<a href="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/267/files/2015/01/TC-Neighb-16.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22098 size-thumbnail" src="http://gottesman.pressible.org/files/2015/01/TC-Neighb-16-150x150.jpg" alt="House On Mrs. McKert's Farm, North Side Of 121st Street, Between Broadway And Amsterdam Avenue.

This remains an attractive idea to me, I remain a sucker for these great old photographs, but I may have at the moment run out of (attempted) insightful meditations on the nature of library services that can be illustrated or substantiated via pictures from TC history.

Therefore, I've decided in this post to use photographs of what the neighborhood looked like in the very early days of the College's residency in Morningside Heights.  It does seem to me that these pictures help put our current occupancy of this piece of Manhattan in some perspective, and in general it's never a bad thing to be reminded of how radically landscapes, especially urban landscapes, in this city, country, and elsewhere, have changed in the course of a century and a quarter, or less.

Here then, accompanied by scenes, a few wintry, from the old nabes, are some figures summarizing research and information services the library provided to its users during Fall 2014:
<ul>
	<li>From September through December, Services responded to a total of 1,479 in-person and telephone reference queries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Library Services staff members received and responded to 839 queries of various kinds submitted via the library's Support Request (ticketing) system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>

Services librarians provided 83 research consultations to individuals or small groups over the course of the fall.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Services team members presented 25 course-specific library information sessions, either in the courses' regular classrooms or in the library, for a total of 612 students.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>At the beginning of the semester, research and information services librarians provided 8 library orientation tours for a total of 136 new students.</li>
</ul>
And these are some notable areas of research about which we consulted with students seeking information or guidance:
<ul>
	<li>How hospital mergers affect nursing management and staff;

Actually, to revisit what I said at the outset, it's never a bad thing to be reminded of how radically intellectual, social, and political (as well as geographical) landscapes have changed in the course of the College's 125 years, and if one thing emerges from the odd juxtaposition of historical TC photographs and the topics our students sought help with this Fall, it's a sense of how members of the first generation of students and faculty here would likely find nearly unrecognizable our students' present-day research concerns; and this leads me to think that a future post might explore, to the extent that it's recoverable, what the first students here were seeking to take away from their Morningside educational experience, what they brought here, and from where, and where they went next, and beyond.
