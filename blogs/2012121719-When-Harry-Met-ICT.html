Harry is an 11-year-old student whose daily school life revolves around technology, a lifestyle he is eager to explain. As he walks through his day, it is apparent that his school has prioritized technology-based learning: In class, his teacher uses an interactive whiteboard in lieu of the antiquated chalkboard; digital cameras allow students to add pizzazz to projects; Wii’s offer "brain training" as well as exercise; students conduct internet research and go on virtual tours. 
<p>
Technology appears to play a very large role in Harry’s education day-to-day, and he seems to love every bit of it. As he explains, "My school uses technology in all kinds of ways. They call it ‘ICT’." In his case, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is helping Harry and his classmates become digitally literate members of society. 
<p>
Is Harry’s experience as a "next generation learner" atypical or the norm? On a related note, are you finding that your learning experiences are becoming increasingly more technology-dependent? 
<p>
Join the <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/5859">ongoing discussion on Vialogues</a> and discover how others have responded to Harry’s exuberant take on ICT.

<b>@1:41 yxzhang.cugmail.com:</b> That's too much computer things for teenagers, I think they should have REAL sports instead of a Wii...
<p>
<b>@2:30 DLales:</b> This is probably the most interesting part of the video. The fact that a student can bring school learning home can hopefully inspire students to further explore an interesting topic introduced in the classroom.

<p>
<b>@2:31 Katezvdp:</b> Mobile learning! Secure, ubiquitous and a way to upload homework.
