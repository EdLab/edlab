            There will be only one orchestra left on earth, giving nightly worldwide concerts; when all universities will be combined into one super-institution, conducting courses by radio for students in Zanzibar, Kamchatka and Oskaloose; when, instead of newspapers, trained orators will dictate the news of the world day and night, and the bedtime story will be told every evening from Paris to the sleepy children of a weary world; when every person will be instantly accessible day or night to all the bores he knows, and will know them all: when the last vestiges of privacy, solitude and contemplation will have vanished into limbo.
-- Bruce Bliven, "The Ether Will Now Oblige," in The New Republic, 1922.

The time will come, and in less than 10 years, when the children in the public schools will be taught practically everything by moving pictures. Certainly they will never be obliged to read history again. 
Imagine a public library of the near future, for instance. There will be long rows of boxes of pillars, properly classified and indexed, of course. At each box a push button and before each box a seat. Suppose you wish to "read up" on a certain episode in Napoleon's life.
Instead of consulting all the authorities, wading laboriously through a host of books, and ending bewildered, without a clear idea of exactly what did happen and confused at every point by conflicting opinions about what did happen, you will merely seat yourself at a properly adjusted window, in a scientifically prepared room, press the button, and actually see what happened.

-- The New York Times, from an interview with D. W. Griffith - 1915

These excerpts are taken from a New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/weekinreview/28edid1.html?pagewanted=2&8hpib">article</a> on new technologies and predictions about the future with an emphasis on radio, film, and television. There are some interesting parallels between these predictions and those being made about the impact of the internet.
