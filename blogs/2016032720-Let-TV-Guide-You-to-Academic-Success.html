<p>College downtime has become synonymous with binge watching Netflix. Constant access to tablets in cozy dorm rooms and smartphones in chatty cafeterias make the thought of walking to class seem like pure drudgery, especially on a blustery winter night. Is there a way to combine the convenience of home video with academic study? In simple terms, why not study the prime parts of the Amazon while watching it on Amazon Prime? </p>

<p>You might want to drop the remote control, put your winter coat back on, and shuffle off to class—at least for now. A recent study of two large undergraduate biology classes provided with daily video podcasts found that classroom attendance remained high even though a majority of students viewed available videos outside of class. It also found that less than 3% of the variance in exam performance correlated with the number of podcasts students viewed. As a result, this study suggests that providing podcast lectures does not necessarily increase learning gains, even for heavy viewers. </p>
 
<p>Similar results for different demographic groups. For female and Asian students, identified as high use groups, less than 6% of exam performance variance correlated with listening to podcasts. </p>
 
<p>Interesting side issues emerge from the study. There was a tremendous variance in podcast views per day. The highest totals occurred during exam periods, and viewership peaked within 48 hours of a scheduled test—binge watching isn’t just for Breaking Bad anymore but also extends to cramming for exams with video lectures. Podcasts are effective in clarifying specific questions that arise during recorded lectures. Students with disabilities welcome podcasts and international students may benefit from close captioned content as they wrestle with new academic terms in English. Professors have the potential to improve instruction by reviewing videos of their teaching. Finally, early delivery of short videos prior to lectures allows students to screen them before class and flip the classroom—this practice has shown promise in improving student achievement. </p>
 
<p>Further studies should continue researching the impact of podcasts on achievement to guide future programs and possibly point out other benefits. Perhaps one day we can figure out how to deliver video more effectively to improve student academic performance.</p>
