<p><a href="https://perusall.com/">Perusall</a> is a platform that allows students to asynchronously annotate texts they are reading for class, helping them to engage more directly with the course materials and their classmates. A free resource for both teachers and students, Perusall optimally groups students to help facilitate social interactions and offers personalized guidance and motivation.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Using the platform from the instructor perspective, I found Perusall to be straightforward and intuitive.   You can easily add web links, PDFs, or other documents from your computer or Google Drive, as well as textbooks assigned for the course. Adding assignments and comments is also quite easy, and I appreciate the fact that instructors can ask discussion or content-specific questions by directly commenting on the text, alerting the reader to a particular passage as they read. Also, Perusall’s provision of student activity and statistics is helpful when keeping tabs on student participation, interest, and points of confusion.</p>

<p>As a student, I like the idea of being able to see my classmates’ reactions as I read the same document as them. It’s a more collaborative process, and it allows students to engage more naturally with one another while reading, instead of operating under the assumption that students will arrive in class and immediately have things to contribute to discussion. The platform also allows students to ask the instructor questions and link other resources directly to their course readings.</p>

<p>One thing I found very helpful, regardless of whether I was using the platform as a student or as an instructor, was the hashtag function. There are preset hashtags, such as "#grades" and "#logistics" that users can include to categorize their comments, and new hashtags can be added by anyone. This seems like a good way to track important information as well as relevant themes that emerge throughout the course.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>One weakness of this platform is that it is not optimized for video. If an instructor would like to include a video, it cannot be commented on in the same way as a text. I found myself thinking that the addition of a feature similar to <a href="https://vialogues.com/">Vialogues</a> might be the next move for Perusall.</p>

<p>Also, it is clear that Perusall is set up primarily for PDFs, photocopied texts, and the official texts provided by the platform, because web pages aren’t as reliable. If you’d like students to read multiple pages from a website, you will need to upload each page as a separate document. Also, if the background color on the website is not white, which is often the case, highlighted phrases indicating comments are not as easy to see, and are sometimes completely invisible.</p>
  
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Perusall is an easy-to-use platform that benefits both teachers and students by making the activity of reading course material less isolating and more engaging.</p>
