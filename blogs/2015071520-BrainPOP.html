<p><a href="https://www.brainpop.com/"> BrainPOP</a> was created in 1999 by Dr. Avraham Kadar as a way to make complex concepts easier for his patients to understand. This suite of subscription-based apps for kindergarten through 12th grade offers Common Core aligned content in various subject areas including math, science, technology, health, arts and music, and social studies.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>BrainPOP (3-12th grades) and BrainPOP Jr. (K-3rd grades) include free movie content that makes learning accessible in a fun and visually engaging way. In these movies, a robot named Moby stars as the student. The teacher and narrator is a school-age boy or girl (age appropriate depending on the version of BrainPOP you are using). These revolving videos are updated frequently and take kids through topics in an uncomplicated and friendly manner. After the movie, a quiz is offered to reinforce comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>In BrainPOP Jr. along with the captioned dialog that appears below the movie screen there is extra text that appears along one side of the movie screen with  questions for users to think about based on the dialog. While the idea behind this text is valid, it seems to add clutter and could potentially confuse the youngest viewers, especially those who are just learning to read. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>BrainPOP offers a wide variety of activities and even non-subscribers can take advantage of the movie features that can enrich in-school activities. It is valuable to note that BrainPOP Español, BrainPOP Français, and BrainPOP ESL are also available. In addition, BrainPOP Educators offers lesson plans and training materials for teachers and content that can be explored using the Academic Standards search function. With this search, teachers can find Common Core Standards by state, subject and grade level matched to corresponding BrainPOP activities.</p>
