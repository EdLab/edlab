With the goal of illuminating our trouble in talking about race, Stanford University professors Hazel Markus and Paula Moya, of the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity,  conducted an engaging talk drawn from their newly published volume <em><a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/t?SEARCH=doing+race&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">Doing Race: 21 Essays for the 21st Century</a></em> (W.W. Norton, Inc., 2010). Their acclaimed, edited work begins with a conceptual overview of race and ethnicity as they fit into our everyday lives— what they are, how they work, why achieving a just society requires us to take account of them. It includes short reader-friendly essays from an interdisciplinary body of experts on race and ethnicity, among them: C. Matthew Snipp, George Frederickson, Marcus Feldman, Barbara Koenig, Aron Rodrigue, Joel Beinin, Norman Naimark, Shanto Iyengar, Albert Camarillo, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/%7Eldh/resume.html">Linda Darling-Hammond</a>, Lawrence Bobo, Victor Thompson, <a href="http://www.provost.columbia.edu/provost">Claude Steele</a>, Monica McDermott, Jennifer Eberhardt, Stephanie Fryberg, Alisha Watts, Marcyliena Morgan, Dawn-Elissa Fischer, and Michelle and Harry J. Elam. Professors Markus and Moya focused on eight common conversations about race and ethnicity and discussed why these popular conversations are flawed or incomplete; they also reflected on the importance of understanding race and ethnicity as intricate systems of human actions and interactions that organize, influence, and govern our human societies.

Writes Henry Louis Gates Jr., of Harvard University:
<blockquote>Hazel Markus and Paula Moya have assembled an all-star roster of scholars to put to rest, once and for all, the fallacy that race doesn’t matter. This volume is absolutely necessary and will fast become a landmark of scholarship on race and ethnicity.</blockquote>
