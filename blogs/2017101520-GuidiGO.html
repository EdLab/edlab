<p><a href="https://www.guidigo.com/">GuidiGO</a> is an app that lets users create or experience customized tours. It is really geared towards two separate audiences: 
<ol>
  <li>Creators, teachers, or museums.</li>
  <li>Travellers, tourists, or even students. </li>
</ol></p> 
<p>For this review, I am considering GuidiGO from perspectives as both a traveller and as a creator. I first used the app to build a short tour around Columbia University. Next, I took a guided tour around Bryant Park, along with a few other simulated tours around the world. </p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Using GuidiGO to create customized tours or programs is very easy. Instead of using the phone app, you will need to log on to <a href="https://www.guidigo.com/">GuidiGO Studios</a> with a computer. This site has all of the publishing tools needed, and you will only have to plug in the necessary information: photos, an overview, information about the stops, mapping, and options for publishing or promoting. It was easy for me to figure out and there was no coding involved.</p> 
 
<p>While most packages for creators are fairly expensive, the Education Program offers a fairly cheap option for $349 per year. This offer is geared toward school or class projects. Others interested in publishing tours can also consider the free Partner Program. Guides and local writers are encouraged to apply in order to boost the quantity and quality of the tours. However, the company does have a quality control process for all of its published tours. </p>

<p>Designed for prospective tourists, the tour though Bryant Park guided by actor Matthew Broderick was fantastic, and I enjoyed testing it. It had background music and sound effects, interesting facts, and some solid jokes. While this tour was not created by GuidiGO, it integrated all of the app’s functions. With the VR geotag feature, it’s almost impossible to get lost.</p> 

<p>l participated in a few other tours virtually and they all had a similar high quality. Every tour I tested was free, but even the ones for purchase come at a fairly low price (around $2–$5). </p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>For creators, GuidiGO’s pricing is a bit steep; the paid plans range from $125 to $325 a month. The free version only allows customized tours to feature two stops. This is enough to see the app’s functions, but not enough to actually operate a full program. While the app does allow you to sell tours to customers or visitors, it might be difficult to recoup the monthly fee. This could still work for museums or locations with big budgets, but might be too much for smaller entities or storytellers. Luckily, as mentioned, there are discount options just for educators or other storytellers.</p>

<p>It’s also worth mentioning that GuidiGO unfortunately has a limited selection of locations. In New York City, there are only two real tours currently available. I was not able to fully utilize the interesting augmented reality features or the advertized gaming functions with the free version, and it seems most of GuidiGO’s tour offerings center around Europe, especially in France, as of this review.</p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>GuidiGO offers quality services with interesting functions for both travellers and creators, with some drawbacks.</p>
<p>As the app grows in popularity and more locations are added, the usability will improve for travelers or tourists. For now, though, there are too few locations to make the app a big hit. If you happen to be backpacking around Europe, it is certainly an app to try.</p>  

<p>For educators, museums, and other guides, this app remains worth checking out. The price point could be an issue, but the company does offer cheaper options and partnerships. For museums, the features of the app could revitalize aging exhibits and appeal to younger patrons. In the hands of a creative teacher, it could likewise invigorate classrooms through a blend of hands-on learning and VR exploration.</p>
