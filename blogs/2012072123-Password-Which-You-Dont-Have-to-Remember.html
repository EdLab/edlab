            Nowadays it seems like hackers are becoming proactive in their attempts to steal precious information from unsuspecting victims. Just around this time last year, tech giant Sony's information database was broken into by hackers and thus compromising the passwords of thousands of Sony users. Furthermore, earlier this year, hackers were able to penetrate into the database of online shoe retailer Zappos and retrieve the personal information of millions of its users. These incidents thus beg the question of what's the most hack proof way to store a password.
 
Technology researchers from Stanford, Northwestern and SRI International recently developed a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/how-to-make-your-password-so-secret-even-you-dont-know-it/260127/">system</a> which stores a password in which you don't have to remember. They achieved this by creating a sort of game which requires a user to precisely press keys according to a various mix of sequences. Once you've mastered a particular set of sequences, the system records the average time in which it took you to complete those sequences. Finally when you are about to log into an account, you are given a mixed samples of sequences in which you've mastered and if you solve it in correlation to your average time, you'll be granted access to your account. If an outside individual tries to solve those same set of sequences, they would naturally take longer to solve them and thus they won't be able to access your particular account. 

What are your opinions on this method of entering a password?
