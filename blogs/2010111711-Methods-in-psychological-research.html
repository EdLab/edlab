Annabel Ness Evans and Bryan J. Rooney provide an applied approach in this thoroughly updated second edition ofÂ Methods of Psychological Research. The authors continue to rely on student feedback from their extensive classroom experience to insure both accessibility and relevance. End-of-chapter FAQs and projects complement the in-text exercises and art to develop a refreshingly realistic methodology.

<strong>Annabel N. Evans</strong> received her Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from the University of Alberta in 1979. She is currently Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychology at Concordia University College of Alberta, where she has taught since 1975. She regularly teaches Research Methods, Statistics, and Principles of Behavior Change at the introductory undergraduate level, as well as directing Field Placement courses for seniors. She has written two previous texts. Her Using Statistics in the Social Sciences (Prentice Hall Canada) is in its third edition, and she is working on a fourth. With Lyle Grant, she published Principles of Behavior Analysis (HarperCollins 1994). She believes that a large part of her job is to provide an instructional environment that supports undergraduate students in their endeavor to acquire the skills and information they need to be successful as students and as citizens. She does outside consulting work of various kinds, including graphic design, statistical analysis, and content editing for private and government agencies.

<strong>Bryan J. Rooney</strong> received his Ph.D. in Physiological Psychology from Carleton University in 1994.

He regularly teaches the introductory Research Methods and Statistics courses as well as courses on Introductory Psychology, Brain &amp; Behavior, Sensation and Perception, and Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. He is an active member of APA Division 2 (Society for the Teaching of Psychology), the Society for Neuroscience, the Canadian Society for Brain, Behavior &amp; Cognitive Science, and the International Brain Research Organization.
