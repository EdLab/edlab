            <h3>Case Study: “An Instructor's Experiences with Transitioning to Elgg from an LMS to Support Graduate Student Learning at Harvard”, by Stacie Cassat Green </h3>


    *  Teach in the Harvard Extension School -- continuing education program. Help individuals think about how to transform their teaching practice through technology. So, this presentation is in effect a way for them to model to students what they have been trying to teach.
    * Goal of class: help students become fluent users of technology in terms of habits of mind.
    * Methodology questions for teaching at the extension school
          o 1) After-work model
          o 2) Long meetings every other week as a workshop to get more done in class.
          o 3) Create an LMS for the extension school.
    * LMS experience
          o Worked well for asking regular questions and having students respond.
          o Wanted to create abilities for organizing e-portfolios for students. Initially, students had to learn many of the underlying technologies (HTML, Unix, etc.) to be able to set up their portfolios.
          o Need to generate community of practice using the body of work collected from current and previous students.
          o Couldn't access previous students' work because it would be removed by LMS after student was no longer registered at extension school.
          o 2006: LMS experience with e-portfolios still required lots of support and students had to manage IT issues themselves. 
    * Goal: create an e-portfolio system and community of practice (with body of work) that required significantly less investment in time and money in IT among students and faculty.
          o Came across Elgg and chose to use it.
          o Platform allowed students to share more with less IT expertise.
    * Findings
          o Many students used it and started to put up a lot of materials, including things from outside courses and non-extension school courses.
          o Portfolios: "reflection undergirds entire process of portfolios"
          o Communities of practice -- again applying theories of Etienne Wenger and how they apply to the online community.
          o Initially had hybrid LMS and Elgg setup (discussion board on LMS), but this was causing problems. Moved completely to Elgg, using blogging for discussion board and adapted other needs to features in Elgg. Created web page to house syllabus and allow people to do typical LMS functions (create courses, manage courses, etc.).
          o LMS: Course Centric; Elgg: User Centric. 
          o Blogging process as a central tool for reflection and learning. 
          o Privacy: need to allow participants to post things that they may not want to share with the rest of the world.
          o Student activities (from Wenger's framework): adapting to new technological environment in ways not expected; preserving artifacts and telling stories; communicating and staying in touch with each other, finding each other and discovering commonalities, exploring connectedness, etc. Evidence for all these behaviors in the way students were using portfolios and blogs and other tools.
