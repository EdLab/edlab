The <a href="http://www.nycmakery.com/">NYC Makery</a> defines itself as a "pop-up Makerspace, a movable venue where youth and adults are encouraged to be curious, to tinker, to experiment, and to make with technology." The Makery was formed not only to help students do well, but also to inspire them to become interested in STEM subjects.  The founders are working on finding a permanent space for people to visit, but for now, they will continue to "pop up" in different communities to influence as many kids as possible. <p>

This video introduces current projects happening in the Makery.  One day, students may create their own video game; another day they may experiment with a 3-D printer. By combining technology and creativity, the students not only learn from their teachers and peers, but also on their own when creating different tools.  Giving them these experiences may inspire them to continue to build and design things on their own, because, believe it or not, learning can be fun.

What do you think about the Makery and its goal to spread STEM education and inspiration throughout different New York communities?  <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/9862">Share your thoughts</a> with the world on Vialogues.

<p><b>@01:08 dani100:</b> This is a great example of combining creativity, innovation, interaction, and technology in learning. </p>

<b>@02:14 rbkim:</b> They give them different reasons for why they should want to learn. <p>

<b>@02:44 dani100:</b> I love how they move around to inspire more students. They say that their hope is to someday have a permanent space for kids to come to, but isn’t it a unique idea to keep it movable? That way they can reach out to kids in communities that don’t already know about the Makery. <p>
