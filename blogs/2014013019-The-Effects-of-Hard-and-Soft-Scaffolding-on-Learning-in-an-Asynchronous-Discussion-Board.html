<p><b>Title:</b> Facilitation Prompts and Rubrics on Higher-Order Thinking Skill Performance Found in Undergraduate Asynchronous Discussion Boards (2013)</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa A. Giacumo, Wilhelmina Savenye, & Nichole Smith</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01355.x/full"> British Journal of Educational Technology</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b>
What are the effects of grading rubrics and instructor facilitation prompts on students’ thinking skills in online asynchronous discussion board and posttest performance?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Asynchronous discussion boards have become a common space for learning. Many instructors use grading rubrics (hard scaffold) and/or response prompts (soft scaffold) to facilitate learning in this online space. How effective are these practices and do they contribute to students' learning of higher-order thinking skills such as analyzing, constructing, predicting, and evaluating? This study investigates this question through a two-by-two factorial, quasi-experimental method. Participants included 216 undergraduate preservice K-12 teachers at a large public university in the southwestern USA. Each student was assigned to one of four versions of the discussion board assignment during a 3-week long blended learning module on the legal and ethical use of intellectual property. Each discussion entry was analyzed based on the criteria outlined in the rubric. A pretest and posttest were administered to measure students’ learning performance.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
Providing a grading rubric that clearly indicated the instructor's expectation resulted in more in-depth discussion posts that employed more advanced thinking skills such as analyzing and evaluating. In addition, response prompts contributed to higher quality student writing on the discussion board. However, both hard and soft scaffolds for the discussion forum assignment made no difference on students' learning performance in the subject.</p>




<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The online discussion forum has become an essential tool for learning not only in blended classrooms but also in emerging MOOC and digital classrooms. Findings from this study suggest that soft and hard scaffolds for online discussion forums contribute to better writing and more thoughtful posts. However, participants in this study only represent a small sample within a specific learning context. More studies in this area are needed and new findings in the field would help instructors develop more effective pedagogies for online discussions.</p>
