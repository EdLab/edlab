<p>Blake Harrison is co-founder of <a href="https://www.flocabulary.com/">Flocabulary</a>, a learning program that uses hip-hop music to engage students and increase achievement across curriculum subjects. Blake co-founded Flocabulary in 2004 and originally wrote many of the Flocabulary songs himself.</p>
 
<p><b>How have your education and professional experiences shaped your work? </b><br>
I don’t have much of a resume since I stumbled into founding Flocabulary two years out of college. During that period I worked as a waiter (which I recommend to everyone), as a tutor (where I was reminded how great and weird kids are), and briefly as a speed-reader for a blind investment banker (where I learned breath control). I would say the most important thing I learned as a tutor is that students don’t like being pandered to. As someone who started a company that makes rap music for kids, that’s a crucial lesson. The moment that we come across as <i>trying to be cool</i> or pretending to be something we’re not, we’re dead.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Flocabulary will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
I hope we’ll bring more joy to classrooms. That’s something that we hear a lot when we talk to teachers. Of course, we need to be an effective learning tool. In that way, we are like every other edtech product. Where we feel we can make a bigger impact is in creating a space for students to react emotionally to our music and videos. In the end, the goal is to bring their perspectives and emotions when they write and perform their own songs. It is hard to measure joy, but that doesn’t make it any less of a goal for us.</p>
 
<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
Here is the future that I hope we’ll see: We’ll get less focused on test scores as the only measure of achievement. This will give teachers more autonomy. With more freedom to make decisions, ideally educators will knock the dust off of old project-based learning lesson plans, incorporating technology into some of them. Great classrooms will hopefully be messy with paper and scissors and cameras and tablets, not students glued to screens. Personalized, adaptive learning via technology will not be the end goal, but will be just a small portion of the varied ways that students learn. Finally, art and music will be an integral part of a student’s education.</p>
 
<p>As long as I’m dreaming, we would also stop funding public schools with property taxes, which only perpetuates inequality. Instead, all schools in a state, or in the nation, would get the same funding per pupil. That is not likely to happen because the system is currently favoring those with the most power and the loudest voice.</p>

<p><b>Apart from Flocabulary, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p> Flocabulary is all the work I do. My job is varied enough that it fulfills my needs and the organization has grown to the point where I can use it to achieve goals that I am passionate about. We are in the process of creating units on social justice topics, for example. We are also developing more social and emotional learning content. In my view, both of these areas are deservedly getting more focus in today’s classrooms.</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I mostly use Twitter to follow teachers and see what their classrooms look like and what interesting projects they are doing with their students. A shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/ToddLaVogue">@ToddLaVogue</a> who has done some project-based learning activities that have blown my mind. <a href="https://twitter.com/lindzmj">@lindzmj</a> has had her first graders Skype with her dentist and Nick Cannon and has done amazing stuff with <a href="https://twitter.com/Flocabulary">@flocabulary</a>.</p>
