            <b>Keynote by David Tosch, co-founder of Elgg</b>

<u>On Web 2.0 / Social Web / Social Tech</u>
. Focus is on people, not technology
. In-house vs. Web Service
. Quick look at Web Service
(+) cost (e.g. why not Gmail for students), familiar, bypass the IT dept, easy set-up, plenty of choices, lower cost considerations
(-) How does a 'free' web service make money? (someone is paying for something somewhere, so check the terms of service), may not work well with your existing systems, advertisement-supported, proprietary APIs
. Open Source
(+) Anyone can see and modify the source code (no lock-in), customization is encouraged, potential for active communities
<b>. Data Ownership</b>
Think: Is it important? If yes, what price do you put on it?
<b>. Interoperability</b>
Think: How do we get data from an institution which 'I' was once part of? (e.g. Moving from high school to college, then college to employment)
. New techniques
Think: Would Facebook have worked as a forum? New techs are required to effectively harness future opportunities. Don't assume because students use Facebook that they are tech savvy.

<b>Social Media and Learning Institutions in the Digital Age: Rolling Your Own Communities for Learning</b> by <a href=http://eduspaces.net/csessums/>Chris Sessums</a>

What is an (online) community to you? Is Facebook a community?
What do we need to do to make innovation happen?
Real innovation comes when we take technology for granted.

<u>CoP Design Principles</u>
Cultivating Communities of Practice, Wenger, McDermott & Snyder (2002)
1. Design for evolution
2. Open dialogue bet inside and outside perspectives
3. Individuals differ in levels of participation
4. Develop both public and private community spaces
5. Focus on value
6. Combine familiarity and excitement
7. Create a rhythm for the community
Energizing participation is the key for creating and driving CoP.

<u>Ten Conditions of 'Group Flow'</u>
Keith Sawyer (2008)
1. A shared goal
2. Close or deep listening to each other
3. Complete concentration
4. Being in control of the group's actions and environment
5. Blending of individual egos
6. Equal participation
7. Member's familiarity with each other
8. Constant communication
9. Elaboration of each other's ideas, and
10. Frequent failure and learning from frequent failure

In what ways might these conditions impact your decisions to use social media in communities for learning? (He's using Frederik Pferdt's image from his blog! Thank goodness for my glasses, I'm able to read the tiny url address at the bottom.)

Re: Organizational design
Rules = Trust
Tactics = Actions
vs. Strategy = Results (<<- I don't get this)

Strategy is more important than which tool you use.
Ask and ask again what roles you want your community members to take.
Reflect and reflect again on what roles they want to take.
