In 1858, yellow fever, cholera, smallpox, and typhus swept through Staten Island. In response to the outbreaks of disease, infected persons, nearly 1,500 of them, were confined to a Quarantine composed of 20 walled buildings. Living in such close proximity to the facility, locals were worried for their health and one night, John Thompson and Ray Tompkins burned the Quarantine to the ground. The two men were brought to court. And then everyone turned into zombies. </p>

<p>At least that's how one group of 7th graders from Lavell Prep saw it. Last semester students visited <a href="http://www.historicrichmondtown.org/">  Historic Richmond Town</a>, an authentic historic village that dates back to the 1600's where they were introduced to the Staten Island Quarantine and the infamous court case surrounding its incineration. Since then, students across various disciplines, including history, ELA, and drama courses, have been engaging with primary source documents, conducting research, and getting into character. Based on their findings and interpretations of the event, each class writes a historically based screenplay and then returns to the scene of the crime to film it. Students bring their piece of historical semi-fiction to life (or in this case, death) while wearing period clothing and utilizing Historic Richmond Town’s courtroom, tavern, general store, and other buildings of yesteryear. Their finished films are then screened on campus to share the entertaining side of our nation’s past with the entire student body.</p>
