<p><i>"2Revolutions is an education lab that designs and launches Future of Learning models and catalyzes the conditions within which they can thrive."</i> (<a href="http://www.2revolutions.net/index.html">2Revolutions</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Beyond Consulting</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.2revolutions.net/">2Revolutions</a> promotes itself as "more sandbox than consulting firm," and with its name originating from the "revolutions" of social change and the labor market, the company focuses on helping other organizations create, design, or organize their education-related initiatives. As an educational design lab, 2Revolutions works with others on what they call "Future of Learning" models, attempting to create solutions in the field of educational research and development. It offers services such as access to its online knowledge base, which contains research and reports on integrating innovation and education; advisory programs that involve collaborations with 2Revolutions team members; "Deep Design" to create Future of Learning models; and new ventures.</p>

<p><b>Models and Conditions</b></p>
 
<p>The concept behind 2Revolutions’ Future of Learning models is rooted in six main student learning parameters: personalized, learner-driven, applied, competency-based, cost-effective, and tech-enabled. These parameters serve as values that the organization tries to adhere to when aiding others in the development of educational models that focus on six parts of learning: the what (curriculum and content), the where (learning environment), the when (role of time), the who (human capital), the how (learning modalities), and the how much (evidence of learning).</p>
 
<p>2Revolutions’ past work includes projects such as <a href="http://www.davidson.edu/davidsonnext">Davidson NEXT</a>, which was developed by Davidson College, the College Board, edX, and 2Revolutions to create online modules to supplement instruction in AP classes. 2Revolutions has also worked with East Carolina University to develop a MOOC in the university’s education department for recruiting principals. It also conducts research for organizations like The Community Group to develop recommendations for implementing models with broader reach.</p>
