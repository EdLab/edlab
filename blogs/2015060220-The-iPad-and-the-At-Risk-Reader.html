<p>A recent study examined the effects of using a sight word reading application on six first graders deemed medium to high risk for reading failure. Participants met with researchers over a period of five months during which they were required to read aloud, write, and transcribe words that appeared on the iPad application. All six students improved their sight reading fluency during the experiment period, however five of the six students were still performing below their grade level in reading fluency at the end of the experiment.</p>

<p>In order to measure the efficacy of learning through a digital medium, students were divided into two groups, comprising three participants each, and were required to use the iPad application, <i>The Sight Words: Kids Learn</i>. The first experiment endeavored to uncover the effects of teacher-directed iPad instruction on sight word fluency and oral reading fluency for first-graders and ELLs at risk for reading failure.</p>

<p>Each student was given a pre-test prior to using the iPad application, establishing a baseline for comparison. Students were then introduced to the iPad application and participated in teacher-directed instruction sessions over a period of 13 weeks. The results of the first experiment suggested that students benefitted from the iPad exercise and all reported they would like to continue using the iPad for learning in the future. Although increases in sight reading fluency were minimal, the teacher believed that the iPad intervention had a positive effect, worked well in the classroom, and taught important concepts.</p>

<p>The second experiment repeated the same steps except students participated in self-instructed sessions instead of teacher-instructed sessions. Similar results were reported, with minimal increases in performance for two out of three children. The third student exceeded the end-of-the-year benchmark, reporting that he felt better equipped to learn words on the iPad and that it was more fun.</p>

<p>This study examines the use of intuitive technologies across content areas during a time when educators are still hesitant to incorporate digital platforms into classroom instruction. The results support the iPad's integration in traditional lessons, both through feedback from students and teachers and through reading score improvements. As technology continues to infiltrate education, evaluating the efficacy of education-based applications will become increasingly important.</p>
