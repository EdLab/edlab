<p><a href="https://kinvolved.com/">Kinvolved</a> is on a mission to raise awareness of the attendance problem, a critical issue that is having a tremendous impact on the American education system. A recent study by Johns Hopkins University has shown that approximately 22% of U.S. high school students drop out every year. Some researchers believe the likelihood of dropout can be identified in some students as early as the 6th grade, based on their attendance record. Kinvolved has developed a new software program that allows teachers and school administrators to track student attendance and lateness, sending parents an alert every single time their child misses a class.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>The immediate benefit of Kinvolved is that it allows real-time notifications to be sent to parents, either via text message or email. Teachers are able to track student attendance and lateness more easily and accurately; a typical class can be recorded in under 30 seconds. School administrators will have a clearer set of data for their entire student body. Kinvolved provides graphical data analysis to identify alarming trends early on, so that schools and parents can intervene before it becomes too late for a student.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>The attendance problem is especially rampant in low-income communities, with students six times more likely to drop out of school. Parents in these areas may also lack access to the technological resources that would allow them to benefit most from using the Kinvolved software, namely mobile phones and computers. At the community-level, there simply may not be enough engagement to spark action to address this problem. While Kinvolved provides the tools and the data to track student attendance, there must also be commitment from parents and school leaders.</p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>

<p>The founders of Kinvolved believe that attendance is directly tied to academic achievement and ultimately high school graduation rates. By raising awareness of this chronic issue, they are hoping to increase communication and engagement among teachers, school administrators, and parents, and in turn, between parents and their children.<p>  

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>Kinvolved is harnessing the power of technology to build more engaged school communities.</p>
