            <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17632.pdf?new_window=1">Dobbie, W. & Fryer, R.G. (2011). Getting Beneath the Veil of Effective Schools: Evidence from New York City. National Bureau of Economic Research, 1-46.</a>

Remember when Mayor Bloomberg said last month: 

<i>"...cut the number of teachers in half, but you would double the compensation of them, and you would weed out all the bad ones and just have good teachers. And double the class size with a better teacher is a good deal for the students."</i>

Well this recent research study shows that maybe his idea wasn't completely ludicrous (still not a sustainable solution). In this study, two Harvard researchers looked at factors that actually improve student achievement and those that don't. They analyzed 35 charter schools and found that traditionally emphasized factors like class size, per pupil expenditure, and percentage of teachers with advanced degrees did not correlate with school effectiveness. Instead, schools with frequent after-tutoring, data-driven instruction, informal and formal teacher feedback, and longer instructional time had higher annual math and ELA gains. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The data-driven instruction seems to be the most interesting aspect of this study as well as the most challenging for teachers to practice in the classroom. With pages of student performance data from quizzes, homework, and classroom discussions, is there an efficient way for teachers to digest and interpret that data for effective instruction?  When I worked as a research assistant for a hospital tobacco intervention research study, we piloted a multi-modal computerized assessment that consisted of response-adaptive assessment and tailored patient reports. Similarly, what if there was a data analysis system for teachers to input all their data and receive tailored student reports? It would save the teacher some time manually analyzing the data and focus more on improving the quality of learning in the classroom.
