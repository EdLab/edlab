This morning I had the privilege of participating in an edtech-focused breakfast hosted by the <a href="http://www.nycedc.com/">NY Economic Development Corporation</a>. Hosted in the group's offices located in the financial district, the meeting convened 40 people with the goal of helping to advance the conversation around the NYC edtech sector. Of the 40 participants, many included friends of EdLab such as: 

<a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/399">Knewton</a> 
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/6019">TeachBoost</a> 
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/4199">Torsh</a> 
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/15769">Voxy (in absentia)</a> 
Kinvolved (scheduling upcoming seminar) 
Kara C. from iZone 
Among about 30 others! 

The breakfast was formatted as an informal (OFF THE RECORD!) discussion with facilitation by the president of the EDC, Eric Gertler. The conversation was started by Gertler asking 5 pre-selected people to share their thoughts on the current need states in the NYC edtech field. The discussion was then opened-up to the whole group. 

<b>Some of the key ideas shared included:</b>
-1 in 4 NY'ers is a student of some sort
-Uncertain economic times are driving many formal and informal learning decisions
-Slow, unclear purchasing process (RFP's involved over 25K, necessity of partnering w/ existing vendors) 
-Idea of an edtech clearinghouse that would match educators and administrators by need w/ edtech companies
-Need more knowledgeable people on the DOE purchasing side
-NYC's current districting is too big to innovate  
-NYC govt. should sponsor a big edtech conference
-Edtech is still very "young" 
-Important distinction between edtech and tech ed (edtech products and technical training) 
-Need more dedicated edtech working spaces 
-<b>My idea:</b> entrepreneurs in residence at NYC schools 
-Teachers are overburdened and overwhelmed with very little time to pilot new tech
-The edtech opportunity is currently at $1.5B in overall investment (very little of that is series "D")
