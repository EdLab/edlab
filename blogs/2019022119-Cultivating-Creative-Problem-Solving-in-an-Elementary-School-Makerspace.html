<p>While makerspaces are environments that can serve a wide variety of populations effectively, children in particular benefit from the skills gained in a makerspace. Experiential learning and creative design allow children to experiment independently and collaboratively, which can positively affect their classroom experience as well as their success later in life.<p>

<p>One school hoping to harness the power of makerspaces is Van Ness Elementary School. The Washington, D.C. school is working to foster problem-solving, self-regulation skills, autonomy, and growth mindsets in their students by incorporating a makerspace into their classrooms. Students independently come up with projects they’d like to create, receive approval on their plan, and build their creations in the makerspace. Teachers hope that this type of project-based learning will help their students to develop many important life skills.</p>

<p>What other benefits to learning do makerspaces have? What can a makerspace do that a traditional classroom can’t? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/47877">on Vialogues</a>. </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:56 Sara Hardman: </b>A space like the one in the video invites freedom to play and experiment, which is something not all educational spaces encourage. Kids don't often get to take full responsibility for their environments, but makerspaces make that possible, and they can really learn a lot because of it.</p>

<p><b>@02:14 Rebecca Sullivan: </b>The pedagogical value of experiencing mistakes as a part of learning is articulated by Robert Halpern in his book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Means-Grow-Reinventing-Apprenticeship-Developmental/dp/0415960320#customerReviews%E2%80%9D">The Means to Grow Up</a>. Halpern describes apprenticeships as a hands-on way for adolescents to learn that mistakes are part of the learning process. The opposite message is often sent through school grading systems: good students don't make mistakes.</p>
