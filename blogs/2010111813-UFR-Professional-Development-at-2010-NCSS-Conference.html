          <p>
            Last weekend, Yana and I had this great opportunity to work with <a href="http://understandingfiscalresponsibility.org/">Understanding Fiscal Responsibility</a> (UFR) curriculum authors at the 2010 <a href="http://www.socialstudies.org/conferences" target="_blank">National Council for Social Studies Annual Conference</a> in Denver to video document the UFR curriculum workshops for social studies educators. The workshops went very well and the UFR project received great support and feedback from social studies educators. The first workshop started at 8:00 am on Saturday morning and the room, with capacity for around 50 people, was packed and some late comers sat on the floor to participate in order to participate in this session (I admire these workshop participants!). UFR project leader Maureen Grolnick and professor Crocco gave a great overview of the UFR project and two featured UFR U.S. history lessons–<a href="http://understandingfiscalresponsibility.org/pressible/the-history-of-social-security">social security</a> and <a href="http://understandingfiscalresponsibility.org/pressible/medicare-and-lbj%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgreat-society%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">medicare</a> –that illustrated how to teach U.S. fiscal challenges in regular U.S. history class. Some audience members also suggested the possibility of teaching UFR in other historical periods in U.S. history (e.g. Alexander Hamilton). The UFR team is on the right track and are now developing U.S. history lessons for different historical periods.

Professor Gaudelli engaged workshop participants in a lively dialogue around the controversial campaign ad, Chinese Professor when teaching UFR through World History. Participants mentioned that the video triggered feelings such as anger, anxiety, fear, and the like, which turned viewers away from rational thinking that is much needed in addressing US fiscal challenges. Professor Gaudelli continued the conversation about what such campaign ad meant and the goals of the UFR curriculum to help educators and students discuss these difficult topics. UFR curriculum authors Aviv Cohen and Scott Wylie presented two other UFR world history lessons--<a href="http://understandingfiscalresponsibility.org/pressible/philosophical-foundations-of-citizenship-and-fiscal-policy" target="_blank">philosophical foundations of citizenship and fiscal policy</a> and <a href="http://understandingfiscalresponsibility.org/pressible/views-of-borrowing-and-lending-in-world-religions">views of borrowing and lending in world religions</a>, which, according to several participants, inspired them to teach World History and UFR in an engaging way that they didn't think of before.

See a <a href="http://understandingfiscalresponsibility.org/scottwylie/controversial-political-ad-about-the-national-debt" target="_blank">great analysis</a> of this controversial ad from curriculum author Wylie.

UFR principal investigator Professor Marri offered the last workshop of UFR through Civics along with Wylie. Professor Marri explained the goals and scope of this project, and addressed one important concern from the audience: how do you bring this somewhat controversial topic into the classroom? Drawing on the successful model and experiences of <a href="http://www.teachingthelevees.org/" target="_blank">Teaching the Levees</a> curriculum project, Professor Marri explained how UFR curriculum was designed in a nonpartisan manner that poses questions, instead of giving answers, to students to facilitate them to think about how this crucial topic will impact the future of the United States.
