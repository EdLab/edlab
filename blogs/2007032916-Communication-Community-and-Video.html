          <p>
            Being a doctoral student in the Communication and Education program for the last few years here at TC, I've been exposed to a number of ways of thinking about communication (from historical and philosophical considerations to cognitive and sociological).  I thought I would share my take on the TC Channel giving my thinking in this area:

When I think about the prospect of creating a video, I immediately go back to the issue of communication and the highly related notion of community.  I think that before you can think about the prospect of a video, you must consider, what is it that you are looking to communicate?  

I cannot help but think about video communication as an extension of earlier forms of communication, starting with manuscripts, progressing to the earlier printing press, and followed by electronic communication, most importantly the telegraph, telephone, television and now the Internet.   I also think you cannot think of the issue of communication until you think about the issue of community.  Which community are you looking to receive your communicated content?  In the television world, they called this audience, but with the rise of the Internet it seems like we are going back to their earlier notion of community.  So, with video (including web video), I must ask the question: what are you looking to communicate?  After you have decided what you wish to communicate, then you can begin to choose formats (print, video, online/offline, etc.).  Video offers several affordances that text does not and can appeal to people in a way that text will never achieve (I am here thinking about the fact that  verbal communication is more innate to our physical makeups than text by virtue of how the species have evolved).  After you have decided on a format, then you can begin thinking about specifics (other texts to include, actors, scripts, setting, scenery, puppets, animation, CGI, machinima, titles, etc., etc.)

Is the idea of thinking about what is being communicated and who the community is too simplistic?  Perhaps.  Back in the 1960s, Marshall McLuhan complicated the notion of communication with his book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media:_The_Extensions_of_Man">Understanding Media</a>.  He challenged the message transference model, where some entity (group, organization, individual) looked to communicate some specific set of messages to some community.  He brought to our  attention the ways new communication media itself overwhelmed the simple information transmission model that I mention above.  

Despite McLuhan's useful observations, which people seem to think have held up considerably well overtime, I cannot help but think he may have been somewhat wrong and that communication is more straight-forward than McLuhan implies.  When I watch current television shows, I cannot help but think that the creators understand the messages they are sending as well as the communities that are receiving their messages.  For example, I cannot watch Jon Stewart or Colbert without thinking that their shows are elaborate performances to communicate a set of messages to a community.  I see this same logic in sitcoms, dramas, and plays.  Although you are perfectly entertained, you nonetheless take-in their messages.  With the channel, I come back to, what are you trying to communicate?
