">West, D. (2012). How Blogs, Social Media, and Video Games Improve Education. Brookings Institution.</a>

The Brookings Institution has a report out detailing the advantages of incorporating new social technologies into the classroom.  As this fits in well with the ideas we've been discussing at Edlab, I thought it might be worth a look.

Summary:
The report investigates a variety of novel educational platforms, including blogs, wikis, social media, mobile devices, and videos games.  There is a wealth of the anecdotes and brief summaries of the relevant research literature.  The report is useful as a starting point for deeper investigation, but what immediately jumps out at the read is the ambivalent nature of these new tools.  

The report is careful to emphasize that that blogs and social media networks are, as we all know, taking up an increasing amount of the students' life, and therefore if they are not used for education, they will be used for something else. Therefore it is incumbent on educators to get ahead of the game, and find ways to take advantage of these blossoming opportunities.

One research finding highlighted by the report is how social networks act as “trust filters,” meaning students use the activity connections in tools like Facebook or google+ to pre-select the information they consume.  This can be an important avenue for student learning if teachers can find a way to insert relevant educational resources into these networks. The evidence on the benefits of educational gaming is mixed, but, again, the demand seems so large that if we don't have effective educational games at the moment, we better start developing soon.

Edlab Relevance:

This is an exciting time for educational technology, but like many other fields caught up in the maelstrom of technological change, it is as yet uncertain whether we will sink or swim (adjusting for poetic license - sinking: further lost ground in educational attainment, swimming: gaining in ground in educational attainment).  The report is, unfortunately, a little vague on specifics, but it offers a few promising leads for further inquiry.
