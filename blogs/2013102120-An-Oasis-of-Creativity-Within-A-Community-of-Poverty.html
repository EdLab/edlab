To counter the elimination of the arts from the California curriculum, <a href="http://www.inner-cityarts.org">Inner-City Arts</a> provides art education to inner-city Los Angeles students. Elementary and middle school students attend classes during the school day at Inner-City Arts’ creativity-inducing space, participating in music, visual arts, and drama lessons by professional artists. Developing creativity in and providing a wide range of creative experiences for students is of paramount importance to the organization. Demonstrating the importance of participation in the arts for academic achievement, long-term research shows that students participating in this program increase standardized test scores:<a href="http://www.inner-cityarts.org/why-were-here-results.php"> 25% in math, 18% in reading, and 8% in English proficiency </a>. Additionally, as stated in the video, 96% of Inner-City Arts’ students go on to college while 75% of their non-attending peers do not graduate from high school.<p>

Do you think the arts belong in a school’s curriculum? Should arts programs be hosted by schools or outsourced to a non-profit organization like Inner-City Arts? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10760"> Join the ongoing discussion</a> on Vialogues.<p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:22 yiu.mable: </b> I agree, arts are just as important as sciences to learn creativity. What do you think about schools cutting out arts programs at schools, in order to make room for more STEM courses. What's the right balance in providing both the arts and sciences?<p>

<b>@ 2:35 LizaB</b> 96% of students go on to college while 75% of the students' peers who don't attend don't graduate from high school. With such striking findings, what is keeping school districts from investing in art curricula? Are there studies that demonstrate a correlation between academic success and participation in in-school arts classes?<p>
