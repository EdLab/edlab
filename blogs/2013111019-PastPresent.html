<p><a href="http://pastpresent.muzzylane.com/">Past/Present</a> is a 3D single player immersive game that aims to teach students American history through navigating a fictional New England mill town in 1906. Learners can choose to be either an immigrant mill worker or a native-born mill manager when they play. Players have the opportunity to learn critical thinking and decision making skills, read primary documents, and address financial pressures and issues of labor strikes from the perspectives of two contrasting roles.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Past/Present presents a vivid scene of early 20th-century America and provides a situated learning experience of history at that time. It creates an immersive space for students to learn decision making and critical thinking skills. By reading newspapers from the gameâ€™s fictional town and speaking to non-player characters, students encounter conflicting opinions and facts surrounding labor issues. They must critically examine these pieces of evidence and make their own decisions about the future, and their decisions result in different epilogues at the end of gameplay.</p>
<p>Beyond its engaging gaming experience, Past/Present provides supports to both educators and learners. In the teacher resource section, teachers can find day-by-day lesson plans and can choose to use the game for three or five class periods. All handouts and worksheets are also provided. Specific instructions for large group installations of this game are clearly stated on the support page. The pause-point sign in gameplay gives educators an easy way to communicate with their students about when and where to stop playing, to facilitate the transition to class discussions and supporting in-class activities.</p>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>There are a few bugs in the game, for instance when the avatar runs into corners, it takes some time or even a reload of the game to get the avatar back into place. For educators who are not familiar with 3D navigation games, it might take them some time to get used to the game system and navigation mode and to find what to do next in each scene.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Video games are a great pedagogical tool to provide situated learning experiences for students. Virtual experiences in Past/Present can serve as a springboard for student learning in U.S. history and the exploration of social issues such as working conditions for laborers and immigrants at the beginning of the industrial era. Traditional teaching methods in U.S. history classrooms emphasize the memorization of dates, people, and events, but a great video game lets players experience and play with history from a real historical reference point and pick up key information along their course of play. Higher quality game productions in this genre could transform history teaching and make learning history fun, engaging, and much more effective in the future.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Past/Present lets students experience U.S. history and learn critical thinking skills through gaming.</p>
