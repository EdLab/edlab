<p>Teaching robots human language is hard as it is, but it becomes even more of a challenge when addressing the fact that our language is constantly changing and evolving. While we do invent new words, more frequently we take words that already exist and repurpose them to have new or additional meanings. One group of researchers set out to determine why this trend, known as polysemy, is a dominant strategy in lexical evolution and how words develop new meanings over time, with the hope of developing better natural language processing programs for machines.</p>
 
<p>In order to determine how polysemy occurs, a team composed of a cognitive scientist, a computational linguist, and a psychologist tested different computational algorithms to predict the historical order in which different word meanings have emerged. They then tested these predictions against records of the English language over the past millennium. Half a dozen algorithms were used, including a random algorithm (which assumes the evolution of a word’s meaning is random), a prototype algorithm (which assumes word meaning evolution is relative to time), a progenitor algorithm (which assumes new meanings always evolve from the first, original meaning), a local algorithm (which assumes word meaning is most closely related to the next most recent meaning, but not the original meaning), and a nearest-neighbor chaining algorithm (which assumes new meaning can evolve from any previous meaning that exists).</p>
 
<p>The findings revealed that word meanings typically emerge in predictable ways, with the nearest-neighbor chaining algorithm most closely fitting the process. Instead of making up a new word, it is more common that humans find a word that is already related to the idea they’d like to express, and imbue that word with new meaning. This, the researchers point out, is cognitively efficient, and can also make machine processing more efficient if this algorithm is applied.</p>

<p>Through reverse engineering how language has developed, this study shows not only that the human brain typically works in a systematic way when interpreting and creating language, but also makes inroads into better natural language processing. With this knowledge, the methods behind lexical evolution can be more easily replicated by AI, and make the lives of programmers easier.</p>
