<p>Would you be more motivated to study if it involved watching Meryl Streep in <i>The Iron Lady</i> or the first meeting between Daenerys and Tyrion on <i>Game Of Thrones</i>? Of course, we all would. <a href="https://english-attack.com/">English Attack!</a>, a French-based English study platform that emphasizes pop culture and other culturally relevant resources, makes this a reality. Access costs $7 to $10 per month, depending on monthly or yearly plan selections. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Like most language learning platforms, English Attack! offers an ability assessment to help identify your English level. However, the advantage of this platform is its flexibility. You can jump around to different activities, topics, or games for customizable study sessions.  </p> 

<p>The app’s most attractive feature is its use of videos in its curriculum. It utilizes a variety of one- to five-minute clips from movies, TV shows, music videos, and news reports to build lessons. Each lesson contains a YouTube-hosted clip, full transcript, vocabulary, and a few short games or activities. The company consistently updates their selections, with its most recent clips from new releases like <i>Black Panther</i>. </p>

<p>Aside from entertaining videos, English Attack! also offers serious grammar notes and spelling activities. For instance, the Verb Dash game is a fast-paced quiz to build understanding of verb tense. I was even tripped up by a few of these! </p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Students might find some of the activities too difficult. I was working through the advanced system and I had issues with a few of the questions. In some activities, the directions were not fully clear, causing some confusion. </p>  

<p>In the vocabulary-building phase, the audio examples are not the best quality. Instead of using a human to record each of the vocabulary words, English Attack! has used digital voicing that is somewhat unclear. It’s also in a British accent, which could confuse students more accustomed to an American accent. </p> 

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> Overall, English Attack! is a nice tool for ESL. The video lessons are entertaining and culturally relevant, while the flexibility will keep students engaged with the service. I would love to see these features expanded to other language learning platforms. </p>
