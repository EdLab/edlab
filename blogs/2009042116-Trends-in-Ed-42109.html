            <b>Words to add to your Web 2.0 lexicon</b>

Now that most of us have a grasp on our lolspeak, let's build our vocab as we imagineer a world that focuses on online spaces as means of communication.  Below is a graph (from the <a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2009/01/22/eventedness/">TALL blog</a>) that shows relations between certain internet experiences and their perceived effect on users.  More specifically, theses effects are operationalized as “eventedness” and “co-presence.” 

 

<img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/eventedness.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

 

“Eventedness” is the perceived action of working towards a shared goal with others.  “Co-presence” is the feeling that you are not alone in an online space. This occurs with services that offer the opportunity for status updates (i.e. Facebook and Twitter) as members can make frequent exchanges and reference each other, all within a few seconds.  “MUVE” stands for Multi-user Virtual Environment. 

 

The graph itself is slightly confusing to me but I think I get the point the creator was trying to make.  He chose to use quadrilaterals to show the potential that each space has for either of the experiences.  So, for example, if I'm looking at text chat, then I can say that it seems like it begins as a process that is neither all communal nor all individual… it's somewhere in the middle.  What's more is that a person involved in text chatting can begin to feel a sense of belonging as s/he becomes aware of the presence of others. 

 

This graph highlights a sense of connectedness of which social networking sites are capable. Much like the forecast that I blogged about earlier, this post serves as even further evidence that a trend, at least in online services, is moving towards an environment in which people feel connected.  I believe that this social aspect will be used more frequently in online and eLearning platforms (even more than it currently is) but with a focus on that relationship between feeling as though you are working towards the same goal with others and the degree to which you feel a part of a community.
