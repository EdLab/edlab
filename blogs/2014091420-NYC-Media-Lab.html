<b>Creating a Conduit of Innovation from University to Industry</b><br>
Founded by a consortium of institutions and organizations including New York City Economic Development Corporation, New York University, and Columbia University, <a href="http://www.nycmedialab.org/">NYC Media Lab</a> is dedicated to helping New York-based universities and private corporations develop and share research, foster innovation, and transfer knowledge. Established in 2010, NYC Media Lab brokers relationships between university researchers and corporations. It is this unique mission and commitment to helping to grow the digital media and communications fields in New York City that has attracted corporate members ranging from AT&T and News Corp to ESPN. 
<p>
Partnerships often take the form of annual projects ranging from prototype development to original research. As Julia Evanchuk, Marketing Manager at NYC Media lab describes these collaborations to New Learning Times, "...we facilitate collaborations called <a href="http://www.nycmedialab.org/projects/">open seed projects</a> between technologists in media companies and faculty and students...We believe there's a real value in fostering these connections."
For example, a recent seed partnership involved MFA students at Parsons the New School and Hearst Corporation working to create "prototype mobile apps"â€”check out an example <a href="http://glossy.io/">here</a>. These partnerships provide innovative new solutions for corporate partners, and most importantly, an opportunity for universities to engage in novel research. Evanchuk explains this benefit, "Often companies have access to interesting problems, data sets, or systems that university partners find compelling to work with." Beyond being a gateway to exciting new research, the NYC Media Lab hopes to help create possible job opportunities for recent grads of partner universities at partner companies who are often eager to hire qualified researchers and engineers.
<p>
<b>Bridging the Public/Private Research Divide</b><br>
With a variety of opportunities designed to engage the public in partner organization and university work, NYC Media Lab is helping to foster a conversation that has the potential to benefit not only direct collaborators, but also the general public. For example, the group recently held a panel discussion, <a href="http://www.nycmedialab.org/perspectives-from-the-value-in-the-vault/">Value in the Vault</a>, at the Shutterstock headquarters in NYC. The panel discussion brought together big players in digital media, including the <i>New York Times</i> and stakeholders from academic institutions such as New York University. Future panel events will cover topics ranging from machine learning and the future of human-computer interaction to the "Internet of Things." Additionally, NYC Media Lab will host their annual <a href="http://www.nycmedialab.org/annual-summit/">Summit</a> on September 19th at The New School, with the aim of fostering innovation across the NYC digital media and communications sector. Evanchuck explains the focus of the event, "Through keynote speakers and dozens of university demonstrations, the Summit will present a snapshot of the next wave of technologies and applications related to digital media and communications, encompassing data, video, mobile, interfaces, and interactive design." Participants will include university faculty, students, corporate partners, and local digital media companies. The summit will also feature a lineup of keynote speakers including, the CEO of Shutterstock, Jon Oringer and Vice President and Intel Fellow, Intel Labs, Dr. Genevieve Bell. Through public and private partnerships, paired with public, future-focused events, NYC Media Lab is truly helping to open up a dialogue around digital communication that just might lead to groundbreaking innovation. <p>
