          <p>
            During high school, I spent many hours playing Civilization, a simulation of how people set up societies and expand and grow them while competing with others. I recently came across a new version of this game that reminded me of the possible uses of such a game for independent or classroom learning. 

Here are some things that I think are very useful about civilization that from the perspective of understanding history and social sciences:

- It makes an effort to simulate real forces that shape historical patterns (natural resources, demographics, strategic locations, etc). The latest version seems to try to incorporate ideas like culture and religion and their role in shaping the path of civilizations. 

- It isn't just about militarism - newer versions especially emphasize different ways of "winning" that aren't just the simplistic "conquer your enemies" approach. 

- Just the discussion online and in the manuals about how the simulation works and is set up gets you thinking about what social factors really drive world events. You likely won't agree with all the decisions that developers of the game make for the simulation, but just thinking about these issues raises your awareness of the multiple factors that shape human events. 

Granted, the game might make a lot of simplifications and may even be quite wrong in some of its assumptions about human behavior and social outcomes. But, looking back at high school social studies, we also made many simplifications about how the world works, so the game might be an engaging step up for younger students. I think we could learn a lot about making good learning simulations and structuring possible curricula using games like Civilization. Info on the latest version can be found at http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm.
