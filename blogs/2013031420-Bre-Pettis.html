Bre Pettis is an arts educator, inventor, producer, DIY provocateur and is known worldwide as an, "evangelist for personal manufacturing."  He spreads the DIY "maker" gospel through the company he co-founded, <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">MakerBot</a>.  Pettis is also responsible for co-creating the company’s latest desktop 3-D Printer, the <a href="https://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html">Maker Replicator 2</a>.   3-D printers enter schools through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab">"fabrication labs"</a> where learners are able to make what was once only renderable in two dimensions, a three-dimensional reality.  Pettis hopes that this technology will help inspire young people to "make" more both in and out of the classroom and ultimately help educators to bring STEM-focused learning to life.

<b> EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW  </b> 

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory affect your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I used to be a teacher. Education is baked into the DNA of MakerBot, so we are all about empowering people to create things, to be creative explorers, and offer infrastructure to help people be successful.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> The most formative influence on my work is not my professional experience. It’s doing projects outside of work and having to organize, scramble, and rally communities to get together to do big projects.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> MakerBot will change the learning landscape because it is an "innovation machine."  At its core, MakerBot allows explorers to be creative and iterate, to make something and then see if it works, or see if they like it, and then change it again and again and again until it is an "excellent" thing.  That experience of failing over and over until you’re successful can be the most powerful experience that young people and creative people can have. 




<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> One broad trend that will affect the educational landscape in the years ahead is the internet.  While the internet has been here for a while, it is only now that the infrastructure has reached the point where everyone can have access to it.  In addition, I think you are going to see more and more people sharing, which adds so much more richness to the idea of learning.  If you want to learn something, there are other people who have learned something like that before or maybe they have learned the exact same thing before and can share their experience with you.  That kind of personal sharing has the biggest impact on the ability to learn.<p>

<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I’m currently working on growing MakerBot.  We started with just a few people.  Now MakerBot has grown from a start-up to a small company. As we grow, there are all sorts of infrastructure that needs to be built so that we can become a successful large company.  <p>

<b>Question: What is the MakerBot vision?</b><br> 
<b>Answer:</b>In the future, we envision a MakerBot 3D printer in every company, in every school and university, and in every home.  We are positioning ourselves to be the global leader in desktop 3D printing.  At this point, we would compare the MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer to the Apple II.
<p>
<b> Question:</b> How will 3D printing change the manufacturing industry?<br> <b>Answer:</b> 3D printing, also known as Additive Manufacturing, is a tool that streamlines and expedites the product development process. Companies of all sizes, from large to home-based businesses have come to rely on 3D printers to reduce time to market, reduce costs, improve product quality, and more rapidly prototype and develop products.
3D printing also enables companies and entrepreneurs to make customized products for themselves or for customers in limited run productions. In this way, MakerBot is doing its part to create more jobs for people all over the world.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What do you think 3D printers will be able to do 10 or 20 years from now?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> In Star Trek, Captains Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard would tell the Enterprise Replicator to make everything from tea to spare parts.  We’re not sure about the tea, but we’re confident that in 10-20 years, MakerBot 3D printers will be able to make spare parts virtually on demand.
