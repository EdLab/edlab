<p>Citizen scientists and engineers raced to complete a NASA challenge over the course of the last two years. The competition was open to high schools, universities, and nonprofit organizations and required teams to design, build, and deliver a small satellite that can communicate with earth from deep space. These satellites, called cubesats, are barely larger than a loaf of bread, yet must be designed to travel around the moon and beyond, all while collecting data and transmitting it back to scientists.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/cubequest/about.html">The Cube Quest Challenge</a> features four stages and will distribute $5 million among its winners. This past summer, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/three-diy-cubesats-score-rides-on-nasa-s-first-flight-of-orion-space-launch-system">three finalists</a> were named, two of which were university teams. These finalists will compete in one final round: sending their cubesats into deep space. All three mini satellites will travel aboard the Orion spacecraft in 2019, from which theyâ€™ll be launched into space. Final awards will be given for orbiting the moon, communicating the fastest and farthest, and surviving the longest. This competition provides an opportunity for citizen inventors and students to contribute to NASA, as well as the ongoing quest for space exploration.</p>

<p>What is citizen science and engineering, and how does it help diversify the tech field? What is the benefit of holding a competition like this that is open to the general public? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/39944">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:09 RuthS:</b> Small satellites, like the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-voyager-spacecraft-still-reaching-for-the-stars-after-40-years/">Voyager expeditions</a>, can travel through space until they're destroyed, and we only need a small amount of energy (about the amount to run a toaster) to communicate with them.</p>

<p><b>@01:51 GeorgeNantwi:</b> I  am curious in learning more about how teams are recruited, the makeup of each team (e.g., educational background, socioeconomic status). With all the talk about increasing diversity in STEM, it would be interesting to learn what role NASA is playing in fostering diversity.</p>
