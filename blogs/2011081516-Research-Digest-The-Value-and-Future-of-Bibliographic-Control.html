Bibliographic control is one of the most deeply traditional roles in librarianship, but its usefulness for individual libraries has been in question since the Library of Congress began mass-producing catalog cards in 1901. In 2009 the American Library Association established a group to consider the costs and benefits of bibliographic control and original cataloging in an increasingly digital world. This paper represents the results of their analysis. 

<b>Description:</b>
Bibliographic standards were developed to give libraries a base for collaboration and communication between catalogs. In the days before full-text search and user-generated tags, catalog records were indispensable to the profession and cataloging skill had a direct and palpable impact on the usability of library resources. These benefits are still very strongly felt by most libraries today, but as our collections begin to tip away from physical holdings, good metadata may cease to be the foundation of a searchable collection. 

Shrinking budgets and the increasing availability of satisfactory records produced by other libraries has turned the focus from cataloging in libraries and library education. The task force identified 7 areas of importance for bibliographic control such as discovery, use, and display understanding in library catalogs and contrasted those benefits with the fiscal and organizational costs of maintaining staff for record creation. Some of the costs included salary and continuing education for catalogers and subscription to cataloging assistance services. It seems that the goals collaboration and communication worked perhaps too well; all but a handful of libraries today rely on copy cataloging and do not staff original catalogers.

<b>Edlab Relevance:</b>
The task force meant to present a realistic set of costs and benefits for the modern library rather than make a proclamation about the future of cataloging, but I'm going to go ahead and do it for them: we're in no man's land. The reviewed literature was almost strictly pro-cataloging and the current organizational standards, imperfect as they may be, could not have been generated without the work and careful thought of dedicated catalogers. 

At present, an authority-free future seems attainable, but our ideas about how to accomplish this in an ILS are still firmly rooted in cataloging tradition. New methods of finding data mean this might be a good time to rethink our ideas of searchable information and areas of importance in the kinds of documents we work with today. We'll undoubtedly need some catalogers to chart these ideas for libraries, but the information is too variable and vast to be captured by our past and current standards.
