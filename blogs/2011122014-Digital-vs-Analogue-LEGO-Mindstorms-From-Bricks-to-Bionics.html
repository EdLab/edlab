As Janet points-out in <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/6974">this post</a>, <a href="http://aboutus.lego.com/en-US/group/default.aspx">LEGO</a> is constantly trying to access new markets & demographics.  With a 50+ year history (check-out <a href="http://www.dipity.com/Tara123/History-of-Legos_1/">this Dipity timeline</a> I created) LEGO is one of the biggest & longest-running toy manufacturers in the world.  What takes LEGOS fully out of the analogue-only realm and into the digital?  (In this case, the argument is not digital vs analogue, but instead for a harmonious uniting of old-school "bricks" and "new-school" programming.)  In 1989 LEGO began a partnership with M.I.T., which continues to this day and spawned the development in the early 90's of <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-US/default.aspx?icmp=COFranchiseUSMINDSTORMS">the LEGO MindStorms/NXT</a> family of programmable bricks and robotics kits.  This led to the company's <a href="http://education.lego.com/en-gb/preschool-and-school/secondary-11-18/11plus-lego-mindstorms-education/">LEGO Education initiative</a>.

MindStorms made a splash on the edtech scene after the bricks allowed developers to use LEGOsheets, a programming language developed by the University of Colorado and based on <a href="http://www.agentsheets.com/support/movies/index.html">AgentSheets</a> to develop programs for their LEGO robots.  The name MindStorms came from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas by Seymour Papert</a>.  The LEGO Education site points-out the following benefits of this uniting of traditional "bricks" and technology, "(MindStorms) Provides fantastic cross curricular opportunities in science, design & technology, maths and literacy. Students are able to explore the world of engineering by building simple to advanced control system and to work in teams to solve real-world problems."  It was through these early, enthusiastic tinkerers that LEGO has this extensive new market.  

<b>The Million Dollar EdLab Question...</b>
This ability to bridge fields ranging from science to technology and design speaks volumes to the value of an open-ended system that can be layered on top of and customized by "power users."  There is an anecdote in Patricia Seybold's classic on the value of bottom-up development, <a href="http://www.psgroup.com/books_oi.aspx">Outside Innovation</a> the main crux of which is laid-out by Ms. Seybold <a href="http://outsideinnovation.blogs.com/pseybold/2006/03/the_story_of_le.html">here in her blog.</a>  She summarizes this process of leveraging the work of your loyal users as follows, "Lego leveraged work that had been done by Seymour Papert and his leading grad students at MIT to design a “do it yourself” programmable robot for the retail market. Lego commercialized inventions that had been pioneered by these “lead users” (and tested in the classroom with kids and teachers)."  How can we harness the power of lead users?  I would argue that keeping EdLab tools and platforms as open to outside innovation as possible through rewarding/incentivizing feedback, hosting hack-a-thons for existent tools and identifying need states to develop around.  Imagine what's possible in the education space if a simple plastic "brick" can lead to future careers in robotics and inspire a team of researchers at M.I.T. to invest research dollars and time to develop new avenues of use... follow the yellow brick road takes on a totally new meaning.
