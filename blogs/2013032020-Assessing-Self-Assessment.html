<p><b>Title:</b> Self-Assessment of Knowledge: A Cognitive Learning or Affective Measure? (2010)<p>
<b>Authors:</b>Traci Sitzmann, Katherine Ely, Kenneth G. Brown, & Kristina N. Bauer</p>


<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Many studies examine the role of self-assessment in learning, though few connections have been made among these studies. The authors of <a href="http://journals.aomonline.org/amle/images/Sitzmann2010.pdf">Self-Assessment of Knowledge: A Cognitive Learning or Affective Measure?</a> sought to examine the impact of self evaluation on cognitive learning, motivation, and student self knowledge with a meta-analysis that considered data from over 40,000 learners. Each study in the meta analysis was coded for examples of external feedback on performance, course delivery method, inherent self reflection in the course content, methods used for self-assessment and the accuracy of those assessments.</p>

<p>Data in all studies was collected from nondisabled adults enrolled in courses that facilitated potentially job relevant knowledge or skills. The studies themselves were coded for publication date, research discipline, use and interpretation of self-assessments of knowledge, and conclusion reached regarding the accuracy of self-assessments. The coding process for the meta analysis was also evaluated by three independent raters for accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The results of the analysis showed that self-assessment was strongly correlated with motivation and satisfaction. The authors found that the relationship between self-assessment and cognitive learning was only moderate, but was strongest when learners received external feedback and also practiced and received feedback on the accuracy of their self-assessments. The most favorable conditions for cognitive learning were onsite or in a blended learning environment with a curriculum based on interpersonal skills.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
Self-assessment is an important component of the learning process, and it should be understood in terms of how it influences learnersâ€™ time and energy. Self-assessment does have the potential to be a good indicator of students' affective state, for example, as an indicator related to motivation. This meta analysis found that educators should take into account the characteristics of the learning environment before making claims about the usefulness of a self-assessment measure as an indicator of cognitive learning. </p>
