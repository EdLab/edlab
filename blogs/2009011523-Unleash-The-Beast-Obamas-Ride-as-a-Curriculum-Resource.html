          <p>
            Recently, a few of us at the research team engaged in a brief conversation about President-elect Obama's new ride, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7829475.stm">the Beast</a>, which will be his official car when he assumes office.

The Beast is the latest news in anticipation of Obama's inauguration. Officials have not disclosed the particulars of the latest presidential limo citing security reasons but sources claim it is equipped with the latest gadgets and safety measures. The Beast will make its debut on Tuesday as part of the inaugural parade, a tradition that dates back to the presidency of William Harding. The presidential limo is manufactured by Cadillac, which has been the sole manufacturer of presidential limos since 1993.

The history behind presidential cars is a pretty interesting one. Theodore Roosevelt, a fan of horse carriages even during his tenure in the White House, was the first president to take an auto ride and also the first to ride in a U.S. government auto. William H. Taft cleared space in the White House to build a garage and was the first to ride in an official White House car.

William Harding continued the trend when he became the first president to ride a car during the inaugural parade and was the first president who knew how to drive. FDR was renowned for his car, where he delivered the bulk of his speeches and met voters as polio limited his mobility.

The assassination of President Kennedy in an open car in Dallas in 1963 marked the end of presidents riding in open top cars, which was originally intended for the public to receive a closer look at the president. Presidential cars have also being at the heart of the action when it comes to presidential assassinations. The aforementioned Kennedy assassination along with unsuccessful attempts on Ford, Reagan and the two Roosevelts all occurred within inches of their cars.

EdLab's Development & Research team is currently brainstorming ideas on an Obama resource for teachers and students and as such I am wondering how news such as the presidential limo and other pre-inaugural events can be incorporated into the resource.
