<p>As universities offer more online courses, even on-campus students are increasingly adding them to complement their largely in-person class schedules. This is particularly true for lower level science and math courses, where classes are largely lecture based. Yet given this, it’s important to know how students taking online courses differ in academic performance and withdrawal rate compared to students taking equivalent in-person classes.</p>
 
<p>A recently published study examined 10 years of data from over 3,000 students to determine not only differences in performance, but also possible reasons that there is a disparity between the two types of courses. The study focused on one professor teaching an undergrad physics course. The professor had taught using the same lectures for over a decade. For the first eight years, students had to take both the lecture and lab portions of the class in person. For the last two years, however, students had the option of watching the lectures online rather than in class. Although the video lectures were pre-recorded, they were exactly the same in-person and online.</p>
 
<p>The researchers found that despite the fact that the educational content was exactly the same, the groups performed differently. Students who watched the lectures online were 11% less likely to receive a high grade in the class. In addition, these students were also 14% more likely to withdraw from the course. The researchers think this relates to the amount of engagement students felt with the material. Students in the online courses were in general less engaged than those attending the in-person class in that they turned in far fewer assignments.</p>
 
<p>Interestingly, the researchers also found that students repeating the course were more likely to opt for the online lectures <i>and</i> were less likely to successfully complete them. This suggests that they might have been more likely to disengage from the course early on.</p>
 
<p>In light of these findings, the researchers emphasize the importance of students’ initial experiences in an online course. If they are not engaged early with the material, they are much more likely to perform worse academically or withdraw. This is particularly true for repeating students, suggesting that professors might need to support these students more than others initially. The question is how can instructors ensure engagement with online lectures? As more schools offer video lectures, this challenge will be one worth solving.</p>
