The news today that Google Books and the AAP had <a href=”http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/PWxyz/2012/10/05/aap-call-me-maybe/”>settled</a> their 7-year-old lawsuit was long-expected. Negotiations have been evolving over the past several months and last year's decision to fracture the militant Authors Guild into separate litigations was the marker of growing peace between mainstream publishing and Google. The results of the case were also unsurprising. It seems like a modest victory on both sides and the agents of this victory might just be the slow evolution of opinions around digital publishing and the developing retail segment of Google. Publishers have accepted that they can embargo Google digitized titles by opting out of the database, but will also be able to opt-in to Google monetization of backlist digitized content. 

Google released a <a href=”http://www.publishers.org/press/85/”>statement of relief</a> at the resolution of the suit, claiming that now “we can stay focused on our core mission and work to increase the number of books available to educate, excite and entertain our users via Google Play.” The agreement for sale of digitized content on Google allows for full search and 20% free browsing. <a href=”http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/10/05/publishers-and-google-end-seven-year-lawsuit-mysterious-agreement”>Inside Higher Education</a> suggests that if this access sparks sales it may help bridge the chasm between publishers and libraries. 

The case was brand new when I began library school and through the years it's been an informative barometer of opinions and market change around digital publishing. Though Google is still engaging with the Authors Guild, this settlement seems like the acceptance that will nullify publisher objections around backlist digitization projects. Hopefully this is the first of many collaborations towards greater information accessibility.
