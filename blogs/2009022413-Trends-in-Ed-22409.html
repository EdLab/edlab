            <b>Obama's Stimulus Plan & Ed Tech</b>
The new $787 billion federal economic-stimulus package includes something that many of my Trends in Ed sources are excited about: funding set aside specifically for ed tech.  <a href="http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/25/22stimtech.h28.html&destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/25/22stimtech.h28.html&levelId=2100">This booster shot will give $650 million (of the $115 billion sliced for ed) to Enhancing Education Through Technology (EETT) program</a> which is authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act Title II, Part D.  While proponents of EETT are disappointed that it fails to meet the proposed $1 billion, $650 million is still more than double the $267 million budget in 2008.  Of course, there is <a href="http://www.iste-community.org/profiles/blogs/more-good-news-for-ed-tech">a chain of process</a> that each school must go through in order to receive the formula and/or competitive grants dispersed to the state-level department of education.  But I'm more interested in what programs are launched, with which private/public partner organizations if any, and how teachers and students gain ‘learning returns' from the nation-wide investment.  Count me in for doing a long-term follow ups on this, woohoo.          

<b>E-Book Duopoly?</b>
Most of us are aware of what Amazon's Kindle is and perhaps some of you know that <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2341579,00.asp">Amazon began shipping its new Kindle 2</a> to their customers yesterday.  Reportedly, the first-generation Kindle's problem was that "demand far surpassed supply," prompting the CEO Jeff Bezos to apologize back in March of last year, and Amazon currently dominates the downloadable e-book market.  Google Book Search also is closely chasing after Amazon but with a different business model, said Richard Sarnoff, chairman of the Association of American Publishers.  He added his speculation that Google and Amazon will create <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/02/publisher-speculates-about-amazongoogle-e-book-duopoly.ars">a duopoly</a> in the e-book publishing market, mainly due to the sweeping legal settlement which covers a wide range of topics from advertising, copyrights, to library subscriptions.          

<b>iPhone-App-a-Day</b>
Google mobile app is not new, but so far it has been be the most convenient app and I plan to keep using.  Taking a shortcut to my personal user review, here are some bullet points.  FYI, I've had my iPhone for only three weeks. 
<i>Apps that I Dumped and Reasons Why:</i>
1. Blanks — Vocab quiz/game that spit out same question after a few rounds of playing it.
2. <a href=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_iPhone.aspx>Seafood Watch</a> — Seadfood info app that made me take too much time analyzing my choice of menu; my friend erased it by force. 
<i>Apps that I Plan to Keep and Reasons Why:</i>
1. Google mobile — I don't have to type and it recognizes my words pretty well! 
2. HopStop — I'm still a fledgling New Yorker and need directions, especially in downtown.  
3. Check Please — Tip calculator at best, it splits the bill for multiple people at my finger tip.
