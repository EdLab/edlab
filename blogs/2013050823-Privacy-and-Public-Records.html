            The issue of privacy, especially online, is one of the hottest debates around these days. But what sort of privacy should public servants, especially politicians and political appointments, expect when their online behavior is part of their work?

According to this New York Times <a href=" http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/nyregion/city-fought-30-months-to-keep-e-mail-about-cathleen-black-secret.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0
">article</a>, Mayor Bloomberg's office was holding confidential access to former NYC schools chancellor Cathie Black's email account as it contained "shameful" emails regarding her short appointment. There was a lot of controversy on the absence of public research on Ms. Black's selection as chancellor. A young and aspiring reporter sued the city for access to emails during the selection process arguing that it was a matter of public record. After three years of legal wrangling, the city has finally released the records. 

This article relates to a current project we working on: the John Fischer Collection. Even though Teachers College is one the most prestigious schools of education in the world, it is making available the public letters and correspondences between past presidents and deans such as President Fischer, during the duration of their tenures. They might have been confidential at the time, but are now available to the TC community and beyond. 

Why was Mayor Bloomberg's office holding Mrs. Black's email access to the public? Should emails of public and elected officials be released as a matter of public record?
