            A <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/schooled_in_sports/2013/02/lawmaker_seeks_ban_on_tackle_football_for_children_under_11.html">report</a> issued by a New York State lawmaker last week seeks to prevent children below the age of 11 from playing tackle football. This legislation would apply to school and mini leagues across the state. According to the bill, any adult who allows children ten or under to engage in tackle football will face civil penalties. Assemblyman Michael Benedetto, who passed the legislation, argues the bill is to protect children from coming out in a bad condition after playing the game they loved. Moreover, he states that any kind football, barring tackle, is permissible and safe for children without any age regulations.

Dr. Robert Cantu, author of "Concussions and Our Kids, supports Benedetto's bill. He claims that children below the age of 14 should not play tackle football because they are like dolls who have big heads and weak necks, which make them prone to injures. In addition, these children can also have future brain problems even after having no signs of symptoms. However, those involved in football find the bill to be disturbing. John Butler, executive director of Pop Warner Football said the bill has not been heard of and many of injuries occur in practices, not during games. As an alternative, Butler suggests that rather than eliminating tackle football, he hopes for rules and procedures to avoid concussions in tackle football.
