            Incoming <a href="http://www.thedaonline.com/news/alcohol-education-class-mandatory-for-freshmen-transfer-students-1.1537481">students and transfer students under the age of 21 at West Virginia University are now required to AlcoholEdu</a>, an online course aimed at teaching and informing underage students about the dangers of alcohol abuse. â€œWe wanted to be proactive and give students a way to understand how to make better decisions, better choices and become more responsible," said alcohol education coordinator Missy Pforr. She also noted the course is a science based course offered at many other institutions across the country. 

The course teaches students the appropriate serving sizes of various alcoholic beverages and must be completed by September 25 or a $50 charge will be leveled towards the student's account. Students must also pass the course with a 70 or higher in order to receive credit though it will not show on their transcript nor affect their overall GPAs.  

The course seems very interesting and timely as many students' head back to school in the coming weeks. I am curious to know what other institutions are also making it a mandatory course for incoming freshmen students and transfers under the age of 21. I also think it will be a great to initiate the course during the summer since it will give students a better picture of the dangers of alcohol before they set foot on campus and are placed in a situation where they may not know the sometimes fatal consequences of consuming too much alcohol in a short period of time. During the first week of my freshman year in college, one of my classmates succumbed to alcohol poisoning after a night out with friends. He, and many other college students who have died as a result of alcohol (including another student I tutored during my sophomore year), could have benefited greatly from such a course.
