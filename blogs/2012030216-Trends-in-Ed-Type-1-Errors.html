            The subject of the extraordinarily high number of higher education students enrolled in remedial classes has <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/5372">come up before on the blog</a>, but <a href="http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/">some research</a> out of Teachers College's Community College Research Center puts the whole thing in a new light.
<!--break-->
As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/education/colleges-misassign-many-to-remedial-classes-studies-find.html?ref=education">the New York Times reports</a>,  a large proportion of the students currently placed in remedial classes are capable of doing regular college work, and have been ill-served by an overreliance on shoddy placement tests.  It turns out this has larger effects than just wasting a semester or so of students' time:

“The studies address one of the most intractable problems of higher education: the dead end of remedial education. At most community colleges, a majority of entering students who recently graduated from high school are placed in remedial classes, where they pay tuition but earn no college credit. Over all, less than a quarter of those who start in remedial classes go on to earn two-year degrees or transfer to four-year colleges.” 

Researchers emphasize that combining placement tests with a student's high school grades will give schools a much better idea of how the student will perform in college, and how much remediation they may or may not need.  The total number of students who have been wrongly re-assigned may go as high 25%, and comes as a minor push-back against the “too many kids are unprepared for college” meme.
