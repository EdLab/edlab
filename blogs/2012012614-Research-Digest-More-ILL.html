<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15367967.2012.629925">Dethloff, N. (2012). Replacing recalls with interlibrary loan: The University of Houston's QuickLoan service. <i>Journal of Access Services, 9</i>(1), 18-27.</a> 

As part of an institution-wide drive towards better customer service, The University of Houston chose to eliminate material recalls in favor of instant interlibrary loans. The system they created was dubbed “Quickloan” and was branded through the ILLiad login page to prevent confusion when users were directed out of the OPAC. The library conducted two small usability studies, which revealed that most users of the system were still confused by Quickloan's function and its relation to recall. Despite confusion and some animosity, usage is steadily increasing.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The genius of the Houston plan was that it adapted the power of the catalog to produce instant requests that did not require brokering by library staff. The iii WebBridge link they created populated the ILLiad form by way of the bibliographic record, even more genius is the fact that the link's appearance relies on the catalog status of “checked out” and the lack of other available copies in the system. 

The big question going forward is whether this plan will save any money beyond staff time. It will be important for the analysis group to keep a close watch on the number of requests for particular items as ILL fees will quickly exceed the cost of the item. A better response to their recall problem may have been to change their acquisitions strategy and acquire more copies of popular titles. That said, the ingenuity of their solution is commendable. Filling out forms is the bane of the document delivery world and auto-populating between sources could save a lot of time for patrons and staff. A document delivery service that harnesses the power of citation management technologies like Endnote, RefWorks, or Zotero, seems like it could be very marketable to the library community.
