<p>If you as a photographer can’t get footage of a penguin colony without causing the Arctic birds to scatter, what do you do? One filmmaker, John Downer, had a creative solution that almost seems impossibly obvious, but is really quite genius: disguise cameras as animals. These spy creatures, as they’re called, are incredibly realistic; the only way I’d be able to spot one in the wild is by the camera lens masking as an eye.</p>

<p>The animals, mistaking the robot for one of their own, interact with the cameras in ways that no human photographer is privy to. Since Downer’s first pursuit with penguins, he and his team have created many spy creatures, including tortoises, wolf cubs, and birds in flight. The footage from each is used in <a href="http://jdp.co.uk">John Downer Productions</a> wildlife films. The endeavor demonstrates how technology can help us deeply understand animals in ways we haven’t been able to previously. Downer says that regardless of how successful each spy creature is in infiltrating a clan, the footage is bound to be remarkable.</p>

<p>How has technology changed our relationship with animals in general? Does this particular innovation have potential to alter the way we understand animals? Join the discussion

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:31 dinosossi2:</b> I wonder if animal perception and psychology allows them to differentiate between regular animals and robots. If so, would their interactions shift or change?</p>

<p><b>@01:31 Nantwi:</b> [Spy Creatures] has allowed us to learn and see more about animals than before. We are able to learn certain characteristics about animals that we didn't previously see or know. Understanding animals continues to be a fascinating topic and robots, drones, and other technologies will further this understanding by providing access that we had not previously seen.</p>
