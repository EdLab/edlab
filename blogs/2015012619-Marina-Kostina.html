<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
I learned that nothing happens by chance. Trajectory is a perfect word to describe my professional experience. Its definition is, "the path followed by a projectile flying or an object moving under the action of given forces." I have been both "flying" and "moving under the forces" throughout my professional career. I found myself "by chance" drawn to educational technology in the last year of my PhD program, and suddenly got glued to the computer, learning how to create engaging software. Then as if "by chance", I got hired by a university that was one of the first in the field of distance learning as we know it today. I remember that we had no idea on how to manage this new experience and I often fell asleep with my computer, as we believed that students’ emails needed to be answered as soon as we got them. So I would be replying at 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning!  Then "by chance" the last position that I had got eliminated and I chose to start my own company—a decision that I have never regretted!
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I help increase connection, engagement, enjoyment and profitability online.
I develop engaging online programs that attract attention of the students, increase their completion and performance, and inspire them to share these courses with others. I believe that in our industry we still have many examples of online courses that do not work simply because they are pure transfer of traditional content online. However, research and practice demonstrate, that online environment is very unique, and requires new strategies and approaches. Everything I do is backed up by psychological research and distance learning practice.
<p> 
I also believe that because of the economic demands and development of technology, more and more academics enter information and consulting businesses as a full time or part time options. All academics need to enhance their presentation skills and online visibility to succeed in their professional endeavors.  In order to stand out in the crowded industry, academics must position themselves as a known authority in their field. While being subject-matter experts, they often lack marketing skills and may dislike self-promotion.  Together with my business partner Anastasia Pryanikova, I help develop ready-to-use multimedia learning modules to help academics become known authorities in their field. 
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
Social learning, gamification and especially adaptive learning, when the systems are so smart that they can adapt to the individual learning path of each student. That would be a dream come true for any professor, and I know of companies who already started developing these systems.
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
My business partner Anastasia Pryanikova, JD, MA and I  are currently working on <a href="http://bit.ly/10vyUWi">Bookphoria</a>- a learning platform that converts expert content or books into multi-media, engaging, and highly interactive online courses. This is our passion and we hope to keep expanding Bookphoria in the years to come, making it one of the leading learning platforms!
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I have very strong online presence—I got to be able to "walk the talk"!  I follow many interesting people from various walks of life. <a href="http://bit.ly/12UmIzm">Oprah</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1ww1cLc">Richard Branson</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1xwZNmH">Wayne Dyer</a>. By the way, they follow me back and even reply to some of the posts.
