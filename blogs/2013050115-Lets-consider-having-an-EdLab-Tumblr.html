          <p>
            Check out the <a href="http://edlabculture.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">unofficial EdLab tumblr account</a>... What do you think?

<img src="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/files/Screen shot 2013-05-01 at 3.15.04 PM.png" width="300px"/>

This was created in response to the following:

<b>a) We're all taking candid photos at EdLab.</b> Birthdays, meetings, "What Do I Do"s... I use Instagram AND Twitter... but it's hard to keep track of. 

I offered a <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/9248" target="_blank">SnapWidget solution last month</a>, but widgets need a home... and tumblr can be that home. Kate had mentioned long ago about how the <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/8539" target="_blank">Washington Post created a dedicated tumblr</a> for their graphics. I somehow missed that blog post... but reading it now only served to affirm my decision to start the EdLab tumblr. It all started when, today, I "tumbled" upon the <a href="http://natgeofound.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">National Geographic's curated tumblr called "Found"</a>. Both the Post and NatGeo are not the same application as the EdLab tumblr... but they inspired me nonetheless.

<b>b) We describe ourselves as the "do-tank"... what does that mean?</b> Kate and Megha are going to present about the EdLab at Socratic Labs and they needed photos of EdLab and our culture/ "Day In The Life"... I have so many... and perhaps I could email them out, but why not keep them in one place for future reference as well

Furthermore, I thought of some additional benefits to such a tumblr:

<b>c) EdLab is actively recruiting future interns and employees.</b> A "culture fit" is important, so why not show the world a little bit about what it's like to work here. 

<b>d) Its sort of a silent team-building exercise... </b>Anyone from our lab can and should be encouraged to post onto this blog <a href="http://edlabculture.tumblr.com/submit" target="_blank">via desktop here</a>, or via mobile by following <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/email_publishing" target="_blank">special email instructions</a> to this email address: awfzvph9pgvyx@tumblr.com. (If I notice spam, we can reset this email and redistribute it)

<b>e) Meme potential for the EdLab...</b> Could we bring memes about EdLab culture into this stream?? 

<b>f) And let's face it.</b> It's really nice to be recognized as a valued team member, for whatever reason, and pictures can sometimes be that gratifying reminder.

I created this tumblr page on my personal account. It is a "secondary blog", so it can be moved to another email address account in the future, by following <a href="http://slashentrepreneur.com/website/how-to-move-a-tumblr-blog-to-a-new-owner/" target="_blank">these instructions.</a>

Note: I didn't use Pressible because it doesn't support or showcase images as predominantly as I wanted it to. It would certainly be ideal if there was a way to upload these images onto the EdLab Image Server and THEN be linked to the final site... and all through my mobile device. Tumblr's app lets me use their app, or even email the pics to a designated email address that will immediately update the tumblr blog. Whew that saves me a ton of time...

Anyways, this is a test. Let's see how it goes... Any feedback would be appreciated.
