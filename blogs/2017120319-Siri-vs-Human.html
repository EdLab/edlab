<p>Whether from our cell phones, navigation systems, or spam robocalls, we are all familiar with artificial voices. But how much information do we actually retain when we listen to an artificial voice?</p>
 
<p>A recent study tested how artificial voices differed from human voices when it came to understanding and enjoying a narrative story, which was originally used for advertising purposes. The researchers examined how these different voices affected listeners’ attention, concentration, recall, and perception of the story’s effectiveness. The researchers were particularly interested in the effect of prosody (voice, including intonation, pitch, and rhythm) on these factors.</p>
 
<p>A total of 200 participants were included in this study. Each listened to a narrative story told by three different voices: an artificial voice, a human voice manipulated to sound artificial, and a regular human voice spoken by a professional voiceover actor. Only the human voice had natural prosody. For the artificial voices, the participants heard either Siri or Loquendo, a Spanish-speaking artificial voice. After, the participants were given surveys testing how well they had taken in the story as well as their perceptions of it.</p>
 
<p>Overall, the study found that the participants processed the narrative more effectively when listening to the human voice than either the artificial voice or the human manipulated voice. Not only was the narrative more effective with a human voice, but the participants also had better levels of attention, concentration, and recall when listening to it. In addition, the narrative demanded several tasks of the participants, and the more important and complex the task was, the more the participants preferred listening to the human voice.</p>
 
<p>As artificial voices are used more and more, this study could have an impact on many different tech systems, including instructional platforms and devices. The researchers concluded that artificial voices are best used when they give short, informative messages as opposed to full narratives. People simply retain information better when they hear it from a human voice, and the researchers believe this is largely because of prosody. Because of this, future artificial voice designers might want to take note of prosody.</p>
