          <p>
            Just thought I would be fair, and state the other side of things continuing from last week's blog entry. Here are the categories that females usually fall into.
<P>
<b>The Girl Next Door-</b>
Ever watched <a href=http://www.dawsonscreek.com/> Dawson's Creek</a>? Well the perfect way to describe the girl next door is the character of Joey Potter. She's sweet, slightly mischievous, and humorous. Not the prettiest girl on the block but definitely the classiest. Although most of the time this type of girl gets out shined in certain departments she's the all-around girl most guys look past. Looking for a type of girl with a great personality? This is your girl!
<P>
<b>The Princess-</b>
These are usually the girls I hate (yeah so what I'm biased). They only care about the superficial things in life. Sure every girl has their superficial moments, who doesn't? However, these girls carry this idea to an extreme. The “this world owes me everything” syndrome really needs to be swatted out of their heads. Still, they are the ones that get the most attention and let's face it - although they would look hideous without make up and the blow dryers, hair straighteners, etc. they still seem to win the majority vote in a popularity contest. 
<P>
<b>The (insert five letter adjective)-</b>
Don't you dare spit an evil word about this lady. She'll make you cry and knows your weaknesses. Although she seems invincible and is kind of on the scary side, she is probably one of the most sensitive people you will ever meet (even if she doesn't show you). She's also probably the rugged, handsome looking female who knows she can fend for herself. And you probably consider her a witch because you don't understand her psycho-woman babble. Make sure if you come across one, you stay on her good side.
<P>
<b>Ms. Mary Sunshine- (goody-two-shoes)</b>
Straight A's, debate team, and class president; she makes everything look natural and easy. Unless she is pretty, you probably wouldn't have a clue she was a genius. She's an optimist and as far as you know the sun shines out of her butt. She seems perfect, almost unreachable, and you wonder <i>do I have a chance with her?</i> Not to shoot down your ego or anything, but if she's so amazing, she probably has high standards herself. Unless she's one of those <i>I want to be the superior one in the relationship</i> kind of chick. Just remember, although she might be Ms. Mary Sunshine now, sooner or later she might sell her soul to the corporate devil, and will be a tyrannical know-it-all (also known as your future boss).
<P>
<b>The Psycho-</b>
Helga Pataki from they kid's cartoon <a href=http://fan.valvigirl.net/heyarnold/>Hey Arnold!</a> is the epitome of your psycho-girl.You've told her once and you WOULD tell her again if she'd only listen. She's probably head over heels for you and you can't seem to shake her. So what if you blow her off? She's crazy right? I mean, who the heck would want to date her? She probably has a shrine of you in the corner of her locker. Hmm… but it is a little flattering, even if it scares you at times. And you begin to wonder why it's always the weirdos that seem to like you? (You have the worst luck huh?)
<P>
<b>Ms. Promiscuous-</b>
Cherry lips, short mini-skirts, and a flirtatious nature, she always seems to make the boys go crazy. You even think of her in times you shouldn't be (i.e.: daydreaming of her while you should be listening to your girlfriend). Ha! But you couldn't tame her even if you tried. She's the “I get what I want type” and no one's going to stand in her way. Some may mistake her booty shorts and micro mini tops for nothing short of sexy, but I guess all I can say to that is: “to each their own.”
<P>
<b>The ugly chick-</b>
Buck teeth, coke-can glasses, braces, a headset, and frizzy hair. She looks like a walking disaster, sometimes it hurts to look. You pass her by on days you are nice, while other days you snicker a hurtful comment. But try to keep in mind what comes around goes around. You'll probably be kissing her butt come 10-year reunion, and the ugly duckling has transformed into a swan. ClichÃ© of me yes, I know, but it's happened many times before. Oh, and try not to kick yourself in the rear too hard when you try to get a second glimpse of her afterwards cause she'll probably never get over the years of torment you put her through. Beware if she <i>does</i> indeed heed your approaches, for they may have ill intentions.
Just remember the old saying… “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!”
