          <p>
            Some dots are harder to connect than others but that doesn't mean it can't be tried.  I've been struggling to wrap my head around the interesting paradigms discussed in Gary's post on <b><a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3103>Freemium</a></b> and the <b><a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3133>social technology</a></b> conference.  So I'm putting a stop to the introspection and sharing my naked thoughts and questions that address what we do @ EdLab.  

Let's say education is a product that can be bought (or can also cost $0) and take the perspective of the <b><a href=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20061026/102329.shtml>economics of abundance</a></b>.  If you want to offer educational product/service/experience in the online market where competing contents are also available for free, then your content has to be not only good but you must also <b><a href=http://www.techdirt.com/rtb.php>engage/connect</a></b> with your potential buyers. 

What does this mean to the future of publishing? As <b><a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3103>Chris Anderson</a></b> mentions, price discrimination or tiered service coupled with good incentive is one option.  Another is to offer the exclusive stuff for free.  To some extent, we are already doing it: the Teachers College Record offers subscriptions to those who are willing to pay upfront since they trust the quality which is also related to their preference for the perceived brand/reputation = thought leadership.  (Of course, some others may have different reasons.)   

Then how about a case where there isn't one single entity owning the copyright of the contents being published and thus they are free, at least for the consumers/users?  Open-source software and its ever-continuing development process is an example as long as the original creator/host does not go under.  That's why even the ‘open source things' must have — and don't they have — some sort of a business model.  Be it having corporate sponsors, VC firms investing in them, or just a lot of fans/users contributing to the further development in order to make profit or reach the break-even point, the bottom line is sustainability.  (Well, even if the original creator goes under, couldn't the source be still publicly used? anyway, moving on...) 

Now, how are these ideas <b><a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/413>relevant to what we do at EdLab</a></b>?  What happens when we apply one of our driving philosophies, “add value by sharing,” to not just our internal process but to <u>the outside population</u> as well?  In addition to the weekly seminar which is available offline, what would happen if we applied the open source/collaborative approach to our knowledge projects that are continuously in development online? 
  
Take our own <b><a href=http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/2860>Teaching & Learning Network</a></b> project for an example.  Our goal (please correct me if I misunderstood) is to provide an online space where TC students of diverse levels and backgrounds offer a mini-course in the area of  their expertise or dedicated interest to an undefined amount of audience both inside and outside TC.  If we define our responsibility to providing the space and content, then we can be happy with choosing and/or developing a platform and upload good packages/bundles of TC assets.  But if we want to expand and share the responsibility of maintaining high quality and ‘trust' in its ‘brand,' then we need to do more than offering free courses or tiered services if there will be a small cost at all. (I think placing a price tag is a whole another debate.) 

Having said all this, the <b><a href=https://www.insightcommunity.com/main.php>Insight Community</a></b> model is what I wanted to share with you. There are a lot of business buzz words like corporate advertising and marketing strategy, but try not to get too sucked into it.  What's important, I think, is to try seeing it as:

Individual Conversations/Cases in Insight Community could = to each TC Assets Topic/Educational Issues. 

Why should we consider this model and improve it for our own sake?  Because the expected results suggest that it could promote as well as protect the TC assets: 
<blockquote>
. Awareness Increased
. Web Traffic Increased
. Leads Generated
. Thought Leadership Established 
</blockquote>

There is even a monetary <b><a href=https://www.insightcommunity.com/cases.php>prize</a></b> attached to sharing the ‘best' insight which is voted by the community members.

Really hope that making these connections was worthwhile and could help us in some capacity...
