In the ongoing battle between traditional publishing and e-book distribution, the E.U. has provided a stumbling-block for the latter and is now investigating whether or not Apple was in "collusion" with e-book publishers, including Penguin (UK) and Simon & Schuster (US).  What are the issues at hand?  The European antitrust authority is concerned that Apple was facilitating “anti-competitive practices affecting the sale of e-books.”  This matter is being given high priority in the E.U. after the commission conducted "surprise inspections" of publishing offices in March.  Learn more about this possible "e-book cartel" here <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/technology/eu-investigates-possible-cartel-in-e-book-market.html?nl=technology&emc=techupdateema21">this NYT's article</a>.

This constant tension and now potential legal issue, between old-school publishing and avenues of distribution, from libraries to online retailers to new wireless e-book dissemination is at a watershed moment.  As e-books stretch and try-out their legs, how will traditional publishing adapt and respond?  The answers have yet to be discovered, but initial signs in the textbook market may hold some potential clues.  For the past year, new platforms that allow educators and students to customize both content and delivery of information have continued to grow and gain popularity.  From <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">FlatWorldKnowledge</a> to <a href="http://www.inkling.com/ ">inkling</a>, the trend is moving towards, flexible, open and free.

How could these trends affect the e-book industry?  Consumers of modern media tend to believe that anything digital is open to them to modify, should be relatively cheap, and new versions should be available to them immediately.  How can this be reconciled with an old-school publishing model that is closed to modification, set-up to maximize profits and reliant on traditional publishing schedules and distribution models?  How can the warring parties of past models and new technology call a truce and find a middle ground?  The answer is yet to be discovered, but perhaps there is a way that instead of creating a potential "cartel" environment where one distributor (Apple) controls the market, additional competitors and avenues of distribution will grow and flourish.  Could underground e-book platforms be developed?  Napster for Kindle?  It happened to the music industry, why not publishing?  Through competition, perhaps we can create pressure on the industry to more closely align with consumer expectations.
