From the publisher:</strong>
The ultimate guide to handling problem behavior "in the heat of the moment"!

When disruptive behavior occurs, your first response can determine the outcome of the situation and how quickly it is resolved. This practical resource offers teachers approaches for immediately defusing disruptive situations, avoiding escalation, and correcting behaviors.

An expert in behavior management, Geoff Colvin introduces seven key behavioral principles and offers specific, research-based strategies for handling disruptions. This resource features:
<ul>
	<li>Strategies that target      specific behaviors, including off-task behavior, rule violations,      disrespect, agitation, noncompliance, and threats and intimidation</li>
	<li>Common classroom scenarios      and solutions for K–12 general and special education teachers</li>
	<li>Checklists and action plans      for applying the strategies while maintaining the flow of instruction</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Defusing Disruptive Behavior in the Classroom </strong></em>helps teachers respond in a way that immediately corrects the misbehavior and smoothly returns the class to learning.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>On the web:</strong>

"Colvin establishes the importance of empowering teachers with a range of specific, practical, research-based strategies to prevent problem behaviors from occurring and to respond effectively when problems do occur. Each strategy is grounded not only in applied behavior analytic techniques, but also respectful approaches to fostering more positive student-teacher interactions. Each chapter provides step-by-step instruction and clearly articulated illustrations. The strategies increase in intensity to support increasingly challenging behaviors. Colvin does an excellent job of teaching the reader the importance of the first response when undesirable behaviors occur."

Kathleen Lane, Associate Professor of Special Education<strong>, </strong>Vanderbilt Peabody College

"This is exactly what every teacher needs when dealing with problem behavior! I tried Colvin's strategies in my classroom and they worked! The students who had problems have done a total turnaround with the tactics that Colvin said would work! I was shocked to see how easy they were to use and implement. It has totally changed my classroom!"
