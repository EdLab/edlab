What kind of fun and engaging interactions would encourage exploration AND also highlight the nature of each NLT stream at our NLT launch party? Here are some of my brainstorming ideas... please feel free to add new ideas or build on these :)

<b>NL Sector</b>
<i>An interactive map (digital? printed?)</i> of places/sectors that EdLab has been to. We could ask people to pin new ideas to the map if they know someone or something happening in NL-relevant sectors... *Crowdsourcing!*

<b>Research Digest</b> 
<i>An interactive “game” (Flash? HTML5?)</i> where you select a study or some literature, with number of pages indicated. An animation (specifics tbd) shows those pages transforming into an EdLab Review; perhaps a QR code to that article is generated and users can scan it to access the EdLab Review version of that study. Just a fun way to visualize the synthesis process that happens at EdLab... It could be as simple as a page-flip animation or an explosion animation to something more meaningful (but would take a little more manpower to generate a visual metaphor...)

<b>Seen in New York, Vialogues</b> 
<i>Listening Booths</i> with big headphones, hooked up to a big TV monitor, and keyboard so that we can encourage people to leave a comment. After that, an automated tweet could be generated with that comment and URL to the NLT Vialogue...
<img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4111/5047630315_cd1d5f7f2b.jpg" width="300px"/>

<b>VisualizED</b> 
<i>“What's your take on new learning?” photobooth</i> with special edition NLT cartoons that peoples' faces can be on. Users select the cartoon (one of 3?), and a speech bubble (one of 3 pre-determined, or type-your-own). Users can then tweet out or print the personalized postcard on the spot.

<b>High Five</b> 
<i>Another interactive interface (on iPad?)</i> with the picture of an open hand. User must give that ipad a “high five” in order to activate the TV screen with 5 random high fives from the week... and then they can touch/click one of them to read the article... Or scan QR code with their phone so they can read it on their own device? A cheesy play on words... but you'll never forget that stream title...

<b>Profiles</b> 
Should this be another <i>crowdsourcing opportunity</i> to get ideas for who to interview next? Maybe users could read someone's Profile, then be prompted to fill out a Survey Sidekick to nominate who they think the next Profile should be about? Or, we could use this as a community-building opportunity, where we ask visitors to open up about their view on education and learning... not sure...
 
<b>EdLab Review</b> 
Create a collage of logos of all products reviewed so far. Click and get access to the review... this is something we might want to think about for the NLT website too... how do we best visualize this section so that people can find and sort through the reviews...

<b>Other Ideas to consider</b>
<ul><li>Should we offer a mobile device-charging station?... since we will be asking our guests to use their mobile devices so heavily at the event?</li>
<li>Should we give special design attention to how to best utilize the big screen? Perhaps incorporate some sort of dashboard or ticker tape along the top of screen with special stats i.e. number of people at the event today? number of people who have visited the Seen In New York listening booth... etc... </li>
<li>The rest of the big screen can visualize tweets, or the latest Vialogues comments, and the occasional photobooth picture?</li>
</ul>
