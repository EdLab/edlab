          <p>
            The peaceful uprising that started sweeping much of the Middle East and North Africa at the beginning of the year have taken a turn for the worse in almost all instances. Authorities in Syria, Libya, Algeria, Bahrain, and Yemen have met the demands of their citizens with blatant force, much to the chagrin of the international community. 

Prior to the start of the revolutions, most of the dictatorships (Yemen, Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, Ben Ali in Tunisia, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13247375">Bashir Al Assad in Syria</a>, Moummar Ghadafi in Libya, etc.) in North Africa and the Middle East ruled under a ‘state of emergency' or emergency law, a point of contention which was almost never talked about until recently as protesters have made its removal one of their primary grievances. 

Emergency law essentially means all constitutional protections, especially freedom of speech and press, is suspended. It grants all prominent political and military power to the prime minister or de facto leader, essentially legalizing their dictatorship.  The de facto leader can restrict his subjects' movements, residence, and travel, can arrest anyone “suspected” of endangering national security and order, and can investigate people and places, among others. For Syria and many of its neighbors, the law was initially justified as a result of a ‘state of war' with Israel though in recent years, authorities have justified it by claiming threats posed by militant groups necessitated emergency rule.
