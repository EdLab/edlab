<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

Addressing clients' questions and concerns about the role of genetics in mental illness.

As we learn more about how our biology  and genes can play into the development of a mental health disorder,  patients and their families are increasingly seeking answers to tough  questions about common risk factors, the likelihood of recurrence, the  need for genetic testing, and implications for future generations.

A  practical, go-to resource for all mental health clinicians, this guide  explains just how to address these questions and concerns in a way  that's comprehensible and compassionate. Filled with case studies,  sample dialogues, and question-and-answer examples, it is an essential  roadmap for practitioners, helping them to demystify a complex issue for  their clients and equip them with the accurate, reassuring information  they need.
