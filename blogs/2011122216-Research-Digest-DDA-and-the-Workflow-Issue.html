<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1941126X.2011.627043">De Fino, M. & Lo, M. L. (2011). New roads for patron-driven ebooks: Collection development and technical services implications of a patron-driven acquisitions pilot at rutgers. <i>Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship, 23</i>(4), 327-338.</a>

Rutgers University recently implemented a demand driven acquisitions program for electronic resources, this article describes changes to their workflow and concerns surrounding the future of collections development at their institution. Rutgers, moving from a librarian managed collection to a largely automated collection, had a strong barrier to entry and required large-scale reorganization. One of the major moves for Rutgers was a change from individual to batch catalog processing, their local bibliographic standards were not always upheld and they resolved to individually edit problematic records post-upload to maintain the catalog. 

Interestingly, Rutgers chose to pursue a DDA program despite their reservations because of their computer science program. The volumes acquired by the library were not circulating and the books students in the department actually wanted were not being purchased. The library felt that students would better selectors of this material, but the program wasn't publicized. Students in computer science and mathematics were encouraged to make use of the e-book collections, but were not informed that their use would determine collection purchasing. Still, purchases with the program spiked in the high-activity times of September/October and January/February. 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>
Mo catalogers, mo problems. DDA is meant to automate collection development processes, but accepting its limits involves relinquishing control over once important library functions.

<i>It may come as a surprise to some librarians that stafï¬ng and workï¬‚ow are challenges to overcome when executing a patron-driven program but, in reality, patron-driven projects do not lead to less work for the librarians involved. Quite the opposite is true, particularly in regard to technical services.</i>

Rutgers, you're doing it wrong. One of the largest cataloging stumbling blocks that they encountered in their DDA setup was the way volumes in a series were represented in the catalog. Vendors catalog these separately because some libraries don't buy the whole series and they're not bound to uphold cataloging traditions that are largely obsolete for googlers. It's a tough thing, we used to be the cowboy and now we're the guy who opens the gate, but relinquishing these little territories is the way to move on to something better.
