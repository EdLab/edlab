            <img class="alignleft" src="http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/music/2010/galleries/iconic-rock-shots-from-emtrust-photographs-of-jim-marshallem/bob-dylan-new-york-city-1963-84296/002_bob_dylan_marshall.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="319" />There are at least five reasons I’m pumped the rapture was a spoof. In all honestly, one of them is not so I can continue to listen to Bob Dylan but hey, it’s his birthday and he deserves all of the <a href="http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/celebrate_bob_dylans_70th_starting.php#photo-1">recognition </a>he's getting.

For those of you new to the country (or planet) Dylan is an America icon. Objectively, Dylan (born <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan">Robert Allen Zimmerman</a>) is a native Minnesotan, who moved to NYC in 1960 and quickly rose to fame as a bohemian singer-songwriter.

Subjectively, he has been a counter-culture hero for two generations. He is perhaps best known for his unparalleled ability to craft astute, socially-conscious story-songs, and sing them while strumming his guitar and playing harmonica. He is not known for his <a href="http://www.northwestcollege.edu/news/detail.dot?inode=180726">almighty voice</a>, his technical proficiency or his ability to annunciate, but <a href="http://poundforpound.blogspot.com/2005/10/dylans-voice.html">his fans don’t care.</a> Bob Dylan is one of the most important contributors to American music; his messages permeate our culture in too many ways to mention.<img class="alignright" src="http://www.bobdylan.com/sites/www.bobdylan.com/files/imagecache/cover_300/blondeonblonde.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="196" />

Okay, I’ll mention one way-- his influence is so great, that in 2008 his lyrics were cited (by John Roberts Jr. no less) in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/world/americas/29iht-dylan.3.14072288.html">supreme court case</a>.

<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bob-dylan-p4147">allmusic</a> says “Bob Dylan's influence on popular music is incalculable.”

<a href="http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=11474676">Bruce Springsteen</a> has called him “the father of [his] country.” <img class="alignright" src="http://gothamist.com/upload/2011/05/2dylanmorrisonhotel0511.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="198" />

Bono said <a href="http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=11474676">“In short, all my life, Bob Dylan has been there for me.”</a>

I don’t know that Bono and I have much in common but I,  undoubtedly as millions of others, feel similarly. Dylan's written songs that range from observations on the more  <a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/desolation-row">quotidian</a> aspects of life to documenting grave social and legal <a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/hurricane-bob-dylan-and-jacques-levy">injustices</a>. For me, there's a Dylan song about most things that happen, or have happened. And he says it better than most ever could. Here are some of my tops, in no particular order.
