<b>Event details...</b>
Last-night I attended the panel discussion:<a href="http://futureofeducation2.eventbrite.com/"> "The Future of Innovation in K-12 Education"</a> hosted by <a href="http://nyc.socialinnovation.org/about/faq">Be Social Change</a> @ <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-01/elite-manhattan-school-defies-old-prep-cartel-commentary-by-amity-shlaes.html">Avenues, the world school</a>.  

The event featured panelists from The Future Project, DOE's iZone, The new Academy for Computer Science HS (check-out <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/3264">this Vialogue</a> on the school) and a representative from the Avenues school.  

<b>Panelist takeaways...</b>
Overall their responses to the moderator's discussion questions seemed a bit self-aggrandizing and pre-recorded.  However, the panelist that stood-out the most for me was the educator from The Academy for Computer Science.  She stole the show and garnered spontaneous applause.  

This educators insights into why she advocated for keeping her school "unscreened" were really interesting.  Her belief in the power of collaborative, blended, personalized learning approach was inspiring and her call to revisit the original intent behind state standards (guiding practices, but by no means rigid or meant to be used to "teach to the test") was refreshing and often left-out of the standards debate.  

Also, it is interesting to note that when a parent and student in the audience asked questions of the panel, almost no-one could really answer them.  This speaks volumes to the issue that parents and learners are often left-out of the edreform and innovation debate and decision-making (parents especially).  The parent silently shook his head when the DOE rep tried to explain their focus on "open" innovation.

Overall, the panel was a disappointment and after schlepping over an hour... in and out of extremely unfortunate weather, I was unhappy to find-out that all food and drink had been consumed before the event started.  This is an important note for those of us helping to make <b>EdLab's Demo Night 2</b> a reality!  Perhaps we should bring the food out RIGHT BEFORE the networking portion of the evening?  Just a thought!   

<b>A-HA's of the night!</b>
The real stand-out A-HA "comment moment" for me was again from the aforementioned rockstar CS educator as she quoted a stat from a recent IBM ad, <b>"90% of the world's data has only been collected in the last 2 YEARS!!!!!!"</b>  She then went on to explain how this affects learner personalization and how harnessing big data to inform education is still in its infancy.  

Also, when the DOE outlined the issue that any innovation they attempt must be "disciplined" as the risks are extremely HIGH and tolerance for failure extremely LOW. Sad truth. 

<b>Avenues school... High on design - low on the "human factor"?</b>
Here are my stealth pics on the way to the bathroom... overall, the ultra exclusive Avenues school was a study in modern design, reflective surfaces and VERY HIGH SECURITY.  The ground floor space seemed more like a boutique hotel or gallery and not a place for often messy and hopefully creative young people.  Gone from the walls were the usual children's artwork or even any sign of life... cold, uninviting, but very "cool."  A world away from the Texas and Pittsburgh public schools I grew-up attending.
