<p><a href="https://eigames.com/index.html">EI Games</a> was created with the philosophy that emotional intelligence is a skill critical to becoming a successful businessperson. Made for both schools and businesses, the learning platform turns entrepreneurial soft skill development into a game in order to make the content more salient and true to life than a training manual, PowerPoint, or text-based curriculum.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The game is split into three categories: Sales and Presentation, Organizational Assessment, and Leadership and Management. In each category, the goal is to gain the confidence of board members in time for the final task, a presentation in front of the board. This is done by answering various questions that test your emotional intelligence, entrepreneurship, and leadership skills. For example, one moment you might have to decide what action to take with a dominating employee; the next, you might have to figure out what is most likely to reveal a prospect’s greatest emotional motivator.</p>
 
<p>The questions in the game are set up through videos featuring animated characters. Throughout its entirety, you maintain a relationship with the fictional company’s chairman; after each question you watch a short clip where the chairman explains the correct answer. This not only helps the player understand the content better, but it also helps create clear learning objectives. The entire game is incredibly well scaffolded, which makes the goals more attainable and the play more enjoyable.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Like much online training that aims to develop social skills, EI Games will only get users part of the way in honing their emotional intelligence skills. It’s impractical to expect an online simulation to fully prepare people for a task where they will interact with others, but it should be noted that EI Games would work best as a supplement to in-person practice. Also, while the characters were generally diverse and interesting, I found some of the voices off-putting. This is particularly true of female characters, who, for some reason, were voiced by male actors. This was not an error that made me want to turn off the game, but I did find it quite distracting.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>EI Games may be a valuable addition to both business classes and workplace training sessions. It highlights the fact that to be successful in business, you have to know how to work with people. While animated characters and quizzes may only be the start of practicing emotional intelligence skills, El Games could provide the solid base of information aspiring business people need.</p>
