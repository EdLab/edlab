          <p>
            The latest Pew Internet Report <em><a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Online-News.aspx">Understanding the Participatory News Consumer</a></em> released interesting findings about the "participatory culture" of internet news consumers today. The study is based on survey data from telephone interviews conducted by Princeton Survey Research International between December 28, 2009 and January 19, 2010, among a sample of 2,259 adults, 18 and older. The title of the report first reminded me of a white paper led by Henry Jenkins for the MacArthur Foundation in 2006. He defines the "participatory culture" in an web 2.0 age featured with "<strong>a social ethos</strong> based on knowledge-sharing" (p. 50) as:
<blockquote>... a culture with relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one's creations, and some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed along to novices. A participatory culture is also one in which members believe their contributions matter, and feel some degree of social connection with one another (at the least they care what other people think about what they have created). (p. 3)</blockquote>
The report highlights that 37% of internet users today actively contribute to the recreation and dissemination of news on various social media:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Portable:</strong> 33% of cell phone owners now access news on their cell phones.</li>
	<li><strong>Personalized: </strong> 28% of internet users have customized their home page to include news from sources and on topics that particularly interest them.</li>
	<li><strong>Participatory: </strong> 37% of internet users have contributed to the creation of news, commented about it, or disseminated it via postings on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter.</li>
	<li>Among those who get news online, 75% get news forwarded through email or posts on social networking sites and 52% share links to news with others via those means.</li>
</ul>
It seems that today's internet news users really have their voices heard in a "civil society" online, and they are not just passive consumers, but active participants. How about K-12 students? How can teachers better teach students to view internet content critically while being aware of cyber-bullying? How can teachers better use various web tools to create an online space of "participatory culture" for their classrooms? </p>
