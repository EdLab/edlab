<p><b>Title:</b> EGameFlow: A Scale to Measure Learners’ Enjoyment of E-Learning Games (2009)<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Fong-Ling Fu, Rong-Chang Su, & Sheng-Chin Yu</p>

<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131508001024"> Computers and Education </a> </p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b>
Games have become common learning tools in and out of the classroom. Measurement studies of learning games have historically focused on the same heuristics employed by game designers and usability professionals but in the current tech landscape, educational games are often developed in low-budget startups. These lean companies require a more feasible and economical evaluation strategy. The authors of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131508001024">EGameFlow: A Scale to Measure Learners’ Enjoyment of E-Learning Games</a> investigated the use of surveys to gauge learner experiences with e-learning games to test whether this low-cost evaluation strategy is effective for determining the worth of a game.</p>
 
<p>The authors developed a scale called EGameFlow based on <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1077253">GameFlow</a>, a scale of player skill improvement and Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. The EGameFlow scale measures concentration, goal clarity, feedback, challenge, autonomy, player immersion, social interaction, and knowledge improvement. To test the scale, four learning games were examined in the context of a college-level online learning course. The games included a motherboard-assembly game, a testing game describing computer parts, a hands-on OS game, and a game that introduced a variety of computer software products. The study was conducted in an online introductory software applications course. Participants were required to play at least one game and could only evaluate one of the four games in the survey.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b>
The sample included individuals with low participation in regular online gaming activity, with over 60% of respondents stating that they played games fewer than four times per month. Factor analysis and a series of validity tests were applied to assess content validity, such as criterion-related validity, divergent validity etc. The results showed that students with more experience playing online games reported higher overall enjoyment. The reliability test revealed that EGameFlow had high internal consistency and reliability. This demonstrated that the EGameFlow framework is valid and reliable for assessing player enjoyment in online gaming.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b>
The boom in edtech app development means that there is a need for researchers to develop and test sustainable rubrics for education games. A study like this could be even more valuable if the measures were accessible enough so that parents or learners could identify and measure the worthiness of apps themselves. Assessing the quality of educational games is an important step towards the acceptance of gaming as an educational tool. Balancing enjoyment, motivation, and learning in online games should be a significant goal in development, and this lean framework may help streamline the evaluation process.</p>
