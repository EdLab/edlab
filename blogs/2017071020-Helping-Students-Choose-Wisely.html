<p>Since the days of Dewey, reflection has been recognized as an important skill for students to improve their learning. Effective use of metacognitive self-regulation involves directing attention toward strategies of how best to achieve a goal. This mental process has been linked to improved learning, motivation, and academic performance. Based on this past research a new study aimed to explore if metacognitive self-regulation can be applied to help students select the best resources to support their learning. </p>
 
<p>In this study, two cohorts of college students in an introductory statistics class were randomly assigned to the intervention treatment or a control group. All students took online surveys before and after their two course exams. Students in the treatment group received an additional <i>Strategic Resource Use</i> exercise after completing the preliminary survey questions. The exercise prompted them to consider the upcoming exam’s format, which class resources would be most useful to them (e.g., lecture notes, practice questions, readings, and visiting office hours), and how they planned to use each resource to study for the exam. Finally, students in the treatment condition answered open-ended reflection questions on why they thought the resources they chose would support their studying and what their plan for studying was.</p>
 
<p>Across both cohorts, students in the treatment group achieved, on average, one third a letter grade better than students in the control group. In addition to performing better, students in the treatment group also reported on post-exam surveys that they felt less nervous about exams and more in control of their performance. The results from this study show that even a brief intervention has a significant impact on improving students’ grades. Though new study solutions are being offered to students all the time, this study indicated that what is more impactful than the latest app is knowing how it will help you and for what learning goals.</p>
