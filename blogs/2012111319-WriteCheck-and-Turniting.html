<p><a href="https://www.writecheck.com/static/home.html">WriteCheck</a> and <a href="http://turnitin.com/">Turnitin</a> attack plagiarism from both sides. Produced by the same company, both products draw from an enormous database of web content, published material, and student papers to reveal plagiarism and incorrect citations. Turnitin is the more traditional of the pair, aimed at teachers’ evaluations of student papers. WriteCheck breaks the mold and allows students to check their own work for potential plagiarism. Both tools provide a small and targeted set of features for their intended audience and harness the information flood for practical use.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b><br>
Both WriteCheck and Turnitin focus on plagiarism prevention, but also offer tools selected to improve the grading experience for teachers and students. Though the concept does not require this, WriteCheck endeavors to be a learning tool rather than a one-shot crutch for plagiarism checks. The self-grading interface offers students citation tips and clear feedback on the percentage of duplicated text in any sentence. Turnitin is also aimed at student improvement; built-in common feedback allows teachers to spend more time on students’ individual strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b><br>
Because WriteCheck and Turnitin operate on the same database, it seems plausible that students could use the former to hack the latter. The concept of the tool also calls into question our changing ideas about plagiarism. Attribution is more important than ever, but in a digital world with an overwhelming and constant stream of information, content curation and assemblage are increasingly vital. These skills may eventually become even more important to the information ecosystem than creating unique content.</p>

<p><b>Future Possibilities:</b><br>
Whatever the future may bring, there is a place for tools like WriteCheck and Turnitin in the present online educational scene. In the wake of reports of <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Dozens-of-Plagiarism-Incidents/133697/">rampant plagiarism</a> by students in Coursera’s free and no-credit courses, the provider has stated that it’s considering anti-plagiarism technology. EdX has also sought a <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/09/07/site-based-testing-deals-strengthen-case-granting-credit-mooc-students">partnership</a> with Pearson’s testing centers to prevent cheating in system tests. A solution to this issue will be an important component in credentialing this type of learning and automatic tools that make use of the huge and ever-growing database of the web will be put to good use for the online learning cause.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
WriteCheck and Turnitin offer a relevant service to the needs of today’s teachers and learners. </p>
