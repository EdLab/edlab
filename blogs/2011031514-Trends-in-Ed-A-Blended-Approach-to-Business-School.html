          <p>
            As I was about to begin my hunt for content for my first TiE post, my daily email from the Financial Times (FT) arrived with a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/53a0a23e-4b71-11e0-89d8-00144feab49a,dwp_uuid=3315d002-4b76-11e0-89d8-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=traffic/email/content/BizEd/March/memmkt#axzz1GgpjRa8b">special</a> on how technology was changing the nature of business school education. 

Disregarding my personal opinions of what a business school 'education' typically offers, there appears to be a noticeable shift in the types of universities that are taking advantage of distance learning technologies. For a long time now, for-profit universities  have been known to use distance learning solutions to accommodate the needs of their students and to lower costs. However, as the FT article indicates, more 'prestigious' schools have recently been taking a blended approach that utilizes both online and face-to-face learning. This means more video lectures and podcasts as well as more one-on-one time with tutors and professors. Perhaps unsurprisingly though, this has not led to a reduction in the cost of attending such prestigious schools. While there is evidence that these technologies are being used by most students, what remains to be seen is whether they will lead to improved academic results.
