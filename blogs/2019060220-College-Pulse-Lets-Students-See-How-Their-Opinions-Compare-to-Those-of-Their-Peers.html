<p><i>"Uncovering the truth about what people think." </i> (<a href="https://www.collegepulse.com/about-us">The College Pulse Story</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Finding Where Individual Voices Fit Within a Larger Community</b></p>

<p>When trying to gauge public opinion on divisive issues, many turn to social media for answers. However, these platforms can lead to warped perceptions based on the communities individuals interact with. On a severely divided campus in 2016, two Dartmouth students wanted to create a reliable source young people could turn to when they wanted to determine whether or not their opinions aligned with a larger community. The resulting platform, College Pulse, now collects student opinions from university students in all 50 states.</p>

<p>On College Pulse, students sign up and download a free app to complete surveys on a wide range of topics, including admissions, religion, gun control, divorce, internships, and the #metoo movement. After completing a survey, users can see how their responses compare to those of thousands of other students whose responses have been compiled by the app. To encourage students to utilize the platform and contribute to data collection, College Pulse awards points after each survey completed that can then be utilized to enter raffles for the chance to win cash prizes.</p>

<p><b>Providing Data to Students and Those Hoping to Better Understand Them</b></p>

 <p>College Pulse has partnered with the U.S. Senate, universities, and marketing companies to provide data on student opinions to businesses and nonprofits that want to better understand and connect with different student demographics. Services they provide include brand-tracking over time, research reports, and a variety of custom projects.</p>

<p>Additionally, their website features a blog called The Pulse with regularly published articles analyzing and comparing data sets collected from their surveys. From reports on a massive 35,000 student game of "Never Have I Ever" to tracking student opinions shifting throughout the Kavanaugh hearing, these articles aim to provide interesting insights for both students and those who hope to best serve them.</p>
