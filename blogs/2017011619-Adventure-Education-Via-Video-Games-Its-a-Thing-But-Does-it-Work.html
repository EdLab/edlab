<p>Sure, digital platforms can easily replace traditional classroom education, but a new study makes the case that they can also replace adventure education. This is interesting because adventure education, by definition, consists of learning through adventure outdoor activities, such as rock climbing, rafting, and ropes courses. Of course, many of these activities are either too dangerous or too inaccessible for many kids, but how could a digital environment possibly act as an adequate substitute?</p>
 
<p>Researchers developed two digital adventure education activities using Xbox Kinect and the Unity 3D game development platform. Each activity included a multiplayer motion sensing game where participants could become immersed in collaborative adventure education activities that were unattainable to them in real life. One game instructed the college-aged participants to find their way out of a virtual maze together, and the other tasked them with balancing and lifting a digital board as a team.</p>
 
<p>The researchers gave pre- and post-test questionnaires to the participants in the digital adventure education activities and compared the results with those for students who engaged in traditional, physical adventure education activities of a similar nature. In both groups, they found improvement in leadership, cooperation, and activeness, as well as in creative thinking and confidence. Interestingly, while the digital group saw overall lower communication levels than the physical group, they also saw overall higher levels of trust, empathy, and willingness to change.</p>
 
<p>In light of these results, the researchers believe that multiplayer digital games can effectively be used in adventure education. They hypothesize that the motion sensing, collaborative games work so well because they are embedded with metaphorical teachings and constitute a fully immersive digital environment. Digital adventure education activities will never be able to replace the feeling of rock beneath your hand as you scale a cliff or the exhilaration of careening over rapids with a raft full of soaking wet peers. But where these activities are inaccessible, this study shows that digital games can foster at least some of the same teamwork and leadership adventurers learn on those mountains and rivers.</p>
