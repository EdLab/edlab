            <blockquote>Building opportunities for youth in fragile and conflict-affected states — places where armed fighting has just ended or conflicts continue to simmer — has its own challenges. Many young men and women who have been pressed into fighting never had a chance to develop productive skills that can help them in times of peace. They return home to regions that have been devastated by years of conflict, with fragile economies, broken education systems and few opportunities for work.</blockquote>

All around the globe and throughout history, many countries have suffered from wars. The war revolutionized the country or resulted in a setback. Generally, when two nations engage in conflict, both countries are responsible for the reconstruction of their respective nation, which is a fair game. However, what happens when there is a conflict within a nation, when two ethnic groups or tribes fight against one another? A conflict within a nation destroys everything. For instance, the economy, educational system, foreign affairs, and so many great things that defines the existence of that country. I believe that the impact that internal strife is massive than that of conflict between two countries. Recent examples of civil wars include the genocide in Rwanda, Liberia, Syria and the Balkans, among others.
<p>
All these wars have devastated each one of those countries in the sense that everything and everyone is affected. In the end, when peace reigns, the country has to start from the bottom with its bad economy, among other problems. As a result, everyone is affected: adults are jobless due to lack of employment opportunities, and children roam the streets (can lead to human trafficking). War is sometimes inevitable, but one thing that <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org//voices/finding-work-conflict-affected-states-what-can-liberia-teach-us">governments and civil society</a> can do is to find some ways and means to create programs that will boost the economy and improve opportunities for all. I believe it is the first step to a reform. By creating jobs, the economy will improve, and some of the money can be used to invest in education and other public sectors.
