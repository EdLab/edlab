<p><a href="https://pianu.com">Pianu</a> is an online platform and app that transforms computers and tablets into keyboards in order to teach users how to play the piano. While the platform encourages you to use a musical keyboard to get the most out of Pianu, you can also use a touchscreen or regular computer keyboard to learn to read and play sheet music.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Pianu offers a wide range of piano-learning activities, from basic lessons and practice sessions to difficult sheet music you can practice again and again. Pianu is probably best for piano beginners, as you begin with the fundamentals of reading sheet music. The lessons begin with teaching users the names of the keys and progress across 20 lessons to more complicated techniques, such as combining and inverting chords. These interactive exercises were not only well scaffolded, but also much more fun than the pencil-and-paper worksheets of my bygone piano lesson days.</p>
 
<p>This piano learning digital platform also has an aesthetic user interface. On your dashboard, you can see the progression of each lesson, as well as statistics on your personal progress. These include badges marking specific skills learned. At any point, you can practice playing songs from Pianu’s wide selection of sheet music, which includes songs ranging from Beethoven’s "Fur Elise" to Dear Evan Hansen’s "Waving Through a Window."</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>If you don’t have a musical keyboard you can attach to your computer, you probably won’t learn how to actually play a real piano, despite Pianu’s best attempts. The fact that you can play your computer keyboard as though it were a piano is innovative and could at least help with rhythm, but the setup is so drastically different that these skills will likely not translate to a real keyboard, especially since the hand placement on a computer keyboard feels much more awkward than on a real piano. This could make the price difficult to support. Pianu gives users four free lessons in sheet music basics, but after that, you’ll have to pay $8 per month or $60 for the year.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Pianu could be a fantastic way to learn the piano via an app, but I’d only recommend it if you have a musical keyboard you can hook up to your computer. If you don’t, Pianu could still be a fun app to explore, but I wouldn’t expect the skills practiced to translate well from computer keyboard to a real piano keyboard.</p>
