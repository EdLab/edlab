<i>Traditional learning has provided superficial learning through text books. Games are best at teaching a deeper level of learning</i>

<b>Making the Leap from Science to Education while holding on to Technology</b>
<p>
Eric Klopfer is currently an Associate Professor, the Director of the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program, and the Director of <a href="http://www.educationarcade.org/">The Education Arcade</a>. His research is focused on educational gaming technology and simulations. Klopfer’s work involves creating and then integrating learning games or simulations into the classroom. Through the Teacher Education Program, Klopfer guides 40 prospective teachers every year in using games and simulations to teach middle and high school math and science. Even though schools are focused increasingly on passing standardized tests, Klopfer continues to encourage new teachers to explore the deeper learning potential of games and simulations. Before becoming fully involved in educational technology, Eric Klopfer was deeply involved in the sciences, having received a bachelors and masters in biology and zoology, respectively. The child of educators, Klopfer always had an interest in education. The complete transition from science to education occurred when Klopfer’s simulations of biological phenomena were adopted by biology professors for use in their lectures. This helped Klopfer realize how the simulations created in his research in biology were of value in facilitating learning. 
<p>
<b>The Learning Power of Games!</b>
<p>
Klopfer directs two websites devoted to researching and developing learning games that are available on both desktops and mobile devices, <a href="http://www.educationarcade.org/">The Education Arcade</a> and <a href="http://www.learninggamesnetwork.org/">Learning Games Network</a>. These sites highlight new or updated learning games created by Klopfer and his colleagues. With support from the Gates Foundation, he and his team are developing a massively multiplayer online game (MOOG) to help high school students learn math and biology. On his quest to make learning games a more acceptable tool for classroom use, Klopfer has a very large obstacle to overcome, standardized testing. He believes the solution to this problem is to form a large-scale assessment program for his learning games and simulations. Along with the teachers in his program, Klopfer observes how students who have engaged in game play are able to understand math and science meant for more advanced students in high school. It is this evidence of game play leading to more learning and engagement that encourages Klopfer and his colleagues to continue their work to develop gaming and simulation technologies.
