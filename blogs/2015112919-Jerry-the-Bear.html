<p>At first glance, <a href="https://www.jerrythebear.com/">Jerry the Bear</a> might look like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill teddy bear. What makes him different, however, is the "portal" that comes with him—a small white disk that connects kids with images and visualizations of Jerry’s virtual reality. This disk is what allows Jerry to be a tool for health education, even as a furry stuffed animal.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Jerry can be customized with up to three subject matter areas—or "superpowers"—including health and wellness, Type 1 diabetes, and food allergies, each of which comes with a variety of food cards and animated storybooks. The diabetes option comes with an insulin pen and a simulation for blood glucose level, and the allergies option includes an EpiPen and a simulation for a food allergy. Kids can use the food cards and portal together to simulate feeding Jerry with healthy foods while learning about nutrition and food choices. They can also hold the portal to Jerry’s stomach to take an "x-ray" look into what is happening inside Jerry’s body, which teaches them about the digestive system.</p>

<p>The animated storybooks engage kids by showing Jerry’s adventures and friends, which create emotional connections to these virtual social situations. Through both the health and the socioemotional aspects of Jerry’s features, children can learn a great deal while still connecting with Jerry the way they might connect with a traditional doll or stuffed bear.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Because Jerry is still relatively new and the creators are still working on improving on existing software, the available health options and food cards are somewhat limited. Each bear only comes with seven or fifteen food cards, which does not provide children with a comprehensive set of selections with which to exercise a full range of healthy eating choices. However, the creators do give consumers notice of software updates for the bear. Finally, because Jerry is not only a stuffed animal but also programmed with tech features, he is not exactly the cheapest toy on the market, as prices run somewhere between $99 and $149.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Jerry the Bear is an excellent example of using blended virtual and reality experiences in order to engage students through technology. Though the edtech landscape is filled with apps and devices that cater to math and reading skills, attention to health education is not quite as common, and Jerry is a great option for getting children more acquainted with health and nutrition.</p>
