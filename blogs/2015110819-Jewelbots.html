<p><i>"Jewelbots are programmable friendship bracelets for teens and pre-teens. Right out of the box, girls can easily program the bracelet to light up when their friends are near or send messages to a buddy across the classroom. These are not just pretty jewelry, they are a powerful communication tool."</i> (<a href="http://www.jewelbots.com/">Jewelbots</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Women in Computer Science</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewelbots.com/">Jewelbots</a>, founded by Sarah Chipps and Brooke Moreland, seeks to get more girls interested in computer science by creating a friendship bracelet that is not just an accessory, but also a tool for learning how to code. The company initiated a Kickstarter campaign on July 8 and has since raised over $160,000 to produce and sell the bracelets. According to Moreland, the products should be available next spring.</p>

<p><b>Communication and Coding Accessory</b></p>
 
<p>Promoted as friendship bracelets that teach girls how to code, Jewelbots come in a variety of different colors and feature a charm containing a motor and LED lights that will turn on when detecting nearby friends or receiving messages. This allows Jewelbots wearers to communicate with one another through the bracelets. The braceletâ€™s functionality goes one step further, however, when paired with the accompanying mobile app. Jewelbot users can code the Bluetooth-enabled bracelets to do things like receive weather updates, Instagram notifications, and text messages. The coding is basic and introductory, but it also can be done through Arduino IDE, an open-source coding software that allows users to upload and share projects.</p>
 
<p>Two of the underlying concepts behind Jewelbots are communication and coding, and they work together to provide users with a way to interact and have fun with friends, but also learn and get excited about programming. The company has created "Take Your Daughter to Hack Day" events, which gives parents and kids opportunities to engage in fun programming projects. While the number of girls in computer science fields remains low, initiatives like this one that engage girls at an early age will hopefully foster a more inclusive and diverse environment in the world of programming.</p>
