<p>If you were out and about in New York between June 9 and 19, you may have seen (or rather, heard) someone jamming out on a piano in a public space. This was all thanks to the <a href="http://www.singforhope.org/">Sing for Hope</a> project, a non-profit organization that is dedicated to working with under-resourced schools and community centers throughout the city to foster musicians at every level. The organization put pianos in all five boroughs—from Central Park and Hudson River Park to Astoria Park and Fort Greene Park.</p>

<p>After June 19, the program donated all 50 pianos to New York City public schools, extending its commitment to music education not only among the general public but also to students throughout the city’s schools. Especially during a time when schools are often strapped for resources in the arts, this program is providing a significant and valuable service to the community at large. This reflects one of the organization’s major claims: "Access to the arts is a right, not a privilege."</p>

<p>In what ways is arts education still largely unavailable in schools across the country? How can non-profits and other organizations provide supplemental resources for music education in schools? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/29989/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:11 Brian.Sweeting:</b> This is a fantastic way to build learners' performing confidence, especially if they're self-taught and wouldn't have the opportunity to perform at a recital.</p>

<p><b>@02:33 saraehardman:</b> Not only is this a great way to bring people in the city together, it's also a wonderful way to bring awareness to the arts and music education. Being able to randomly happen upon a painted piano in a park brings a sense of wonder to both the city and music.</p>
