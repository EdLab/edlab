<p>Dr. Reshan Richards is Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Math, Science, and Technology department at Teachers College, Columbia University, and Chief Learning Officer at <a href="http://explaineverything.com">Explain Everything</a>, which he co-founded. Reshan also teaches Startup 101, an entrepreneurship course for graduating seniors at Montclair Kimberley Academy in New Jersey, and is the co-author of <i>Blending Leadership: Six Simple Beliefs for Leading Online and Off</i>. An Apple Distinguished Educator and member of Mensa, Reshan earned an Ed.D. in Instructional Technology and Media from Teachers College, Columbia University, an Ed.M in Learning and Teaching from Harvard University, and a B.A. in Music from Columbia University. </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>I started my teaching career as a fifth grade math teacher and tier-1 tech support person. I replaced a lot of inkjet cartridges and connected many CAT5 network cables. This dual role fostered my interest in the intersection of technology and teaching, and I eventually went back to graduate school to explore this area. While at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, I worked as a research assistant on one of Dr. Chris Dede’s research projects—The River City Multi-User Virtual Environment. I gained a sense of what educational research could look like. I returned to the classroom in the role of Technology Coordinator, continued to be a math teacher, and became interested in screencasting as a way for students to demonstrate understanding. At the time, I also became interested in the iPad and what it might bring to teaching and learning. I returned to Columbia and began my doctoral program at Teachers College. My research interests and school experiences led to the creation of the <a href="http://explaineverything.com">Explain Everything</a> whiteboard and screencasting application, and the eventual company of the same name of which I am a co-founder and Chief Learning Officer. </p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape? </b><br>
<p>I hope that my work brings focus and attention to the ways that technology can support human relationships and practices. Most important to me are conversations around assessment of learning. If you asked someone "How do you measure student learning?" and then asked the same person "How do you know that someone has learned in a meaningful way?" you may get very different answers. Certain new technologies, especially those that let users create things, allow people to share what they are thinking, and demonstrate their ability to do interesting and useful things with what they know. An app like <a href="http://explaineverything.com">Explain Everything</a> by itself cannot change the learning landscape, but the creativity of people who use the tool can influence and shape conversations around what assessment of learning really means. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
<p>I often hear arguments that the emergence, impact, and evolution of the internet and mobile technologies is no different than that of the printing press, radio, or television. However, the internet and mobile technologies are not one-directional technologies. Instead, they are complex, networked webs of people, machines, and information that have created a rate of change and innovation that was not seen with the previously mentioned technologies. </p>
 
<p>Due to these trends, in the years ahead, I believe that content without context will be understood as meaningless. The difference between what has been emphasized as important to <i>learn</i> in schools will be so visibly, and actually, different than the rapidly iterative world that students, their teachers and parents grew up and continue to exist in. We’re starting to see glimpses of this as project-based learning, maker movements, and other interdisciplinary experiences gain traction. </p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
In addition to my teaching duties at Columbia, I am working—with many others—on <a href="http://explaineverything.com">Explain Everything</a>'s latest innovation which is a collaborative screencasting whiteboard. This tool allows people to work together in the same project, on the same stage, from different devices, and to record together all their whiteboarding annotations, animations, and voices in real-time. My co-founders, Bart Gonczarek and Piotr Sliwinski, and I believe it is unlike any other type of collaborative human-driven knowledge sharing and interaction. Also, this summer, a book that I co-authored with Stephen J. Valentine will be published by Jossey-Bass/Wiley. It is called <i>Blending Leadership: Six Simple Beliefs for Leading Online and Off</i>, and explores the intersection of organizational leadership, schools, and networked technologies. </p>

</p></b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
The following people always catch my attention and inspire me to investigate further: 
<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">Audrey Watters</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/garystager">Gary Stager</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/funnymonkey">Bill Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RafranzDavis ">Rafranz Davis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislehmann">Chris Lehmann</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mcleod">Scott McLeod</a>, to name a few. I think you have featured a few of these leaders already but you should tap into their knowledge base again—or for the first time!
