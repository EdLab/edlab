<p>Gerardo Fuentes was expelled from middle school years ago. However, he later found himself rethinking his place in education, and eventually graduated both high school and college. He found an interest in math and now works for Driscoll as a forecast specialist, and has spoken to high school classes about the importance of education and the ways that businesses can partner with students to form mentorships for learning and experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://yfiob.org/">Your Future is Our Business</a> acts as that bridge, providing students with career panels, internships, and job shadowing opportunities so that students can envision a career for themselves and seek out the requisite education to pursue it. It also provides a career roadmap series, which helps students develop time management and communication skills to get them on the path toward their career goals.</p>

<p>How can businesses provide facets of education that a traditional classroom might not be able to do as well? What do these mentorships provide students with that might be useful in future higher education and career endeavors? Add your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/25292/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:53 Nantwi:</b> I am almost certain students (individuals as a whole) tend to be motivated to learn when we are passionate about a topic or subject or if it comes natural to us. I think Gerardo's natural interest and ability in math coupled with the story about those less fortunate propelled him to take school more seriously. </p>

<p><b>@02:11 PG.Williamson:</b> It is unmeasurably empowering to realize that you possess a set of skills and can work for a job that you never even imagined possible. </p>
