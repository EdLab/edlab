Dr. Shree K. Nayar is on a quest to change how we use cameras. Nayar, a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University, heads Columbia Vision Laboratory (CAVE), which develops advanced computer vision systems. His work is motivated by applications in the fields of digital imaging, computer graphics, robotics, and human-computer interfaces. Nayar is the creator of <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/experience">Bigshot</a>, a camera that is assembled by the user. Bigshot has a broader mission. Users are introduced to a range of educational concepts in science, math, and engineering when assembling Bigshot. Nayar presented Bigshot in a <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/16737">TEDx talk</a> at Columbia University’s Engineering School last year. Nayar received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. For his inventions, research contributions and teaching he has received countless honors. For example, his pioneering work on computer vision and computational imaging, resulted in his election to the National Academy of Engineering in 2008 and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011.

<p>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</p>

<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Growing up in India in the 70s and 80s, young boys had basically three career options—to become an engineer, a doctor, or something else which was considered not quite as successful as being an engineer or doctor. In my case, I wasn’t entirely sure what I wanted to do because I was interested in the arts and in sports, in particular cricket. At the same time, I was influenced by my dad, who was what I would call an engineer's engineer, meaning to say that he had this really uncanny understanding of all things inanimate. He could fix pretty much anything that was made in that day and age. A lot of people came by the house and dropped off their radios, TVs, and cars for him to repair. And I was sort of his sidekick, his assistant. I would give him the tools and point the flashlight in the right direction. A lot of the time I didn't really know what he was doing because I was very young, but I think that process of watching him do things must have rubbed off in some way—as I grew older and got over cricket, I began to lean towards engineering.</p>

<p>I got an engineering degree in India and I came to Carnegie Mellon for my PhD. Carnegie Mellon had just started the first Robotics Institute. I had done a small project on robotics in India and I thought what I had done was cutting edge. But when I got to Carnegie Mellon I realized I was 20 years behind. Around that time there was this new field that was beginning to bloom called computer vision, which is about building machines that can see. It is the emulation of human vision in a machine. I understood that without vision, robots could not be all that smart, and I got drawn to it. My PhD thesis was on the physics of computer vision. In 1991, I joined Columbia as faculty in the computer science department.</p>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> After coming to Columbia, I started the Computer Vision lab here. The camera is the eye of a computer vision system. I realized that the cameras we were using for vision were really designed for photography and for television. I thought it would be interesting to design new types of cameras that produce new forms of visual information that would benefit computer vision. That prompted me to start a new theme in my lab called <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/projects/cc.php">computational cameras</a>. We began to develop a variety of new cameras for panoramic imaging, high dynamic range imaging, which is capturing more levels of brightness and color, depth imaging, etc. Most of the cameras we designed were for high-end applications. Then, somewhere around 2006, I started wondering if we could leverage the enormous appeal of cameras to make a broader social impact. That was the genesis of the <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/">Bigshot camera</a> project. The idea was to redesign the camera so as to inspire young kids to learn the underlying technology. So, in terms of my professional journey, my interest in robotics and vision led to my interest in cameras, and that led to Bigshot—which is really a social venture.</p>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?  <br>

<b>Answer:</b> I am a great believer in experiential learning. Bighsot is really my first shot at creating a platform for experiential learning. The goal is to not just to explain how a camera works, but rather to use the camera as a hook to reveal as many science and engineering concepts as possible. Today, kids are very comfortable with software but have no idea about what goes on inside the device that the software sits on. These kids are going to be designing the next generation of hardware. I felt that it would be good to give them a chance to touch and feel what is inside a device that we use on a daily basis. That is why Bigshot is designed as a kit that you assemble.</p>

<p>It also has features that you wouldn't be able to find in other cameras. For example, let's say you are out on a shoot and you run out of charge. Bigshot has a power generator that you can crank up and generate enough power to continue to take pictures. Now is that a necessary feature? Not really. You could simply recharge the battery of the camera. But it gives you an opportunity to communicate how a gearbox works and how electromagnetism works and how these technologies come together to create a power generator, which is a very important concept these days - alternative sources of energy. Another interesting feature is that it takes three types of pictures: regular, panoramic and stereo or 3D. You can shoot whatever you want and then wear red-green glasses and see what you've shot in 3D.</p> 

<p>There are a lot of wonderful kits in the market. But a unique feature of Bigshot is that it comes with a website that has an <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/learn">interactive textbook</a>, which includes nine chapters on different technologies related to Bigshot. As a teacher, you can design your own after-school program or in-class curriculum based on the camera kit and the online content.</p>

<p>Bigshot is a simple technology with an ambitious goal. The idea is to expose the kids to three things. The first is building by learning, which is a STEM experience. Once you are done, you have a fully functioning digital camera with which you walk into the world of photography, storytelling and documentation, and that’s the arts. Finally, when you share pictures with your peers, perhaps in different countries and from different socio-economic backgrounds, you learn about diversity and culture. So, within a single learning experience you get an exposure to the sciences, the arts and the humanities.</p>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
Well, I am excited by two things. One is the maker movement. Educators have studied the benefits of making and found that it not only nurtures creativity but also makes kids happy. In fact the same applies to grownups as well. You want to make throughout your life. It is such a wonderful process, one that keeps you vibrant and curious. The second thing I am excited about is the resurgence of distance learning in the form of online content. The dust hasn't settled on this one as yet—we don't know what impact online education will have. But, we can now say with confidence that it will play a role in the future of education.</p>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b>
We want to redefine the whole idea of what is an image. I think, decades from now, an image is not going to be your flat rectangular photo, but rather a sophisticated medium that allows you to change perspective, depth of field, lighting, etc. All this will be possible after the scene has been shot. In short, I expect photography to become a highly immersive experience. That is why my lab is interested in designing cameras that can capture new forms of visual information.
