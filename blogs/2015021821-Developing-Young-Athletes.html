          <p>
            Many studies have indicated that the development of young athletes depends on support from parents and coaches. However, there are common mistakes that coaches and parents make that affects their development. This <a href="http://time.com/3707641/child-star-athletes-sports-parenting/" target = "blank">article</a> sheds light on how parents tend to force their children to play one particular sport year round. Experts in sports science recommend that parents encourage their children to "experiment" and figure out the best sport that might interest them as upcoming youth athletes. Coaches are highly recommended to clap and urge their young athletes at correcting their mistakes while they are playing. During a program at the University of Florida, a sports scientist addressed this issue and emphasized the need for positive feedback only from coaches. He emphasized that children should be allowed to assess themselves after games and practices. If children ask themselves questions about their performances, it might trigger a thought that will enhance their development as individuals and athletes.
<p>
I believe that the development of an athlete depends mainly on the coach. Parents can be supportive but it is always better for parents to be spectators instead of "assistant coaches." With less interference from parents, young athletes can concentrate and develop through the instructions given to them by their coaches.
