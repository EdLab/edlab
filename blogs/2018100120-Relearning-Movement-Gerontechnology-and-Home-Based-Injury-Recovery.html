<p>For senior citizens, a minor injury can have big consequences. After hospital discharge, elderly patients often lack the motivation and energy to relearn movement, which can result in increased weakness and loss of independence. When patients from older living facilities visit the emergency room to receive care for small problems such as a sprain or fracture, 79% are discharged without specific movement intervention plans to help them regain mobility. Additionally, group physical activities such as classes at the YMCA pose barriers to many seniors who lack the transportation or motivation to attend regularly scheduled classes.</p>
 
<p>In this study, Canadian researchers explored the effectiveness of a home-based rehabilitation software called Jintronix. Jintronix is a video platform that teaches exercise movements through virtual games and uses motion-sensing cameras to give live feedback to users and to send patients’ data to therapists who provide distance support and guidance. Jintronix can be used at home, on the patient’s own schedule. To measure the software’s effectiveness for increasing seniors’ mobility, the researchers compared the functional capacity results of older adults recovering from injuries who used Jintronix to those both of recovering seniors enrolled in a YMCA physical activity class and seniors discharged without an intervention plan.</p>

<p>The participants in this study were 48 adults aged 65 and above who were released from the emergency room after receiving treatment for minor injuries. They were divided into three equal groups: the home-based Jintronix group, the YMCA group, and the non-intervention group. The YMCA class met with a teacher twice per week for 55 minutes per session, and the home-based group was instructed to complete two 55-minute sessions per week on their own schedule. The functional capacity of each senior was measured at the start of the intervention, after two weeks, and upon completion of the 12-week program. </p>

<p>The results of the study showed that both the group exercise and the home-based intervention led to increases in physical capacities such as one-leg balance and walking speed. The improvement of the two groups was about equal, although the home-based treatment group showed a slightly higher session completion rate than the YMCA group who had to travel to class at a set time. The researchers concluded that home-based gerontechnology offers a flexible and effective exercise alternative for seniors who have trouble traveling to a group class session. Technologies like Jirntronix seem promising for enabling older adults to engage in self-directed movement learning.</p>
