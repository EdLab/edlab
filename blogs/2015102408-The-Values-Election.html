            Hi!

We all come from such vastly different places. Several of us who work at EdLab were born outside the U.S., raised by generous caregivers who spoke a foreign language, socialized under wildly differing cultural settings.

However, even if we were all born within the same nation, differences would still remain. Hyper paced New York City certainly isn’t the same as Portland—just ask Fred Armisen. Even within the same municipality, differences abound within this fixed space. Williamsburg is a hipster enclave, uptight Manhattanites donning suits need not apply. Even neighborhoods change. Gabe Kotter and his Sweathogs wouldn’t recognize Brooklyn these days. And, of course, the microcosm of our families is its own small scale sociological system. 

I was born abroad and have lived away from home since 2006—first in England, then the U.S. I believe that some of the people who know the idiosyncrasies of their native land best are often those who have lived abroad. When you live at home, national identity is assumed, an unquestioned fact of daily existence. It’s not until you are immersed in a different country with competing mores do you come to terms with some of the subtler aspects of your own values.

The following piece is a reflection on the purest, most distilled form of democracy—a general election. Given that is over a year from the U.S. national election, and possibly longer depending on your country of origin, hopefully this piece will put those important political events into a wider perspective.

Thanks.

<p><i>How do we perpetuate national values for future generations?</i></p>
My mom Eva passed away last spring from a chronic illness. It was both the most horrible, and most beautiful, thing I have ever seen. Our family watched her slowly, relentlessly, wither away. And as terrible as the circumstances were, mom left us in the most graceful manner possible. Eva had a wonderful life with a devoted husband, attentive children, and beautiful grandchildren who benefitted from her caring. As mom weakened, she left us with a sense of serenity, never giving in to despair. It was an exquisite final gift made only more precious by the knowledge that it would be the last thing she gave to us. Her passing was a poignant coda, befitting a person with such unassuming grace.
 
Over Eva’s final months, I bussed back and forth from the United States, visiting Toronto as often as I could. When my mom weakened, we were blessed with help from a team of health care workers. They cared for Eva in the comfort of her home. Towards the last couple of weeks, when she was at her most vulnerable, specialists would visit around the clock to wash, feed, and turn my mom in her bed—she couldn’t move herself anymore. I will always be thankful for how kind, thoughtful, and gentle they were to my mom.
 
During those few moments when I was able to step away from my grief, I marveled at how lucky we were to have this free medical help. Eva was always so fiercely independent, it is difficult to remember her asking for anything at all. But before she started to finally give way and lose the ability to speak, she said she wanted to die at home. And thankfully, due to a generous health care system, my mom passed away in a state of peace, happy to be granted her final wish.

Canada, like many countries, has had the fortune of being led by honorable people who, through their wisdom and generosity of spirit, created institutions that embody our national values. Conservative Prime Minister Sir John A. MacDonald advocated for a coast-to-coast railroad, uniting the nation. New Democratic Party Leader and Saskatchewan Premier Tommy Douglas championed universal health care. And Liberal Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson won the Nobel Peace Prize for the idea of peacekeeping.
 
These varied initiatives, aggregated over time, intersecting in various ways, helped foster our national values, admittedly a difficult notion to define. And from these selfless initiatives, other institutions expanded the character of our country. We have robust public education from the K-12 to tertiary level. There is a welcoming multicultural society, a cultural mosaic that allows people to continue valuable traditions from their countries of origin to contribute to our collective cultural fabric. We are equally protected under law without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. All of these institutions define the very best of home.
 
I am a proud son of immigrants—people who worked hard, cherished their adopted home, and contributed to a society that gave so much to them. In turn, I have benefitted greatly by being born in a more prosperous land, different from the more dire situations from which they escaped. I was able to earn post-secondary degrees at a low cost and be the embodiment of any parents’ dream—to have a better, safer life than my forebears.
 
During this election, when the debate unfortunately devolves to the rancor associated with smaller issues that appeal to more base interests, please think about these points. Which party will safeguard institutions like equal legal protection, multiculturalism, public education, universal health care, and other vital institutions that make our country so blessed. In essence, which party will foster the most essential, and very best, of our national values? My mom, and by extension the rest of our family, was incredibly lucky to benefit from the selfless spirit of a kind, peaceful land. Please vote to protect these institutions for each member of our diverse, but inclusive, Canadian family.
