Ryan Baker is one of the world’s leading experts in the fields of learning analytics and educational data mining.  Baker’s groundbreaking research covers a wide range of learning analytics subjects ranging from intelligent tutors, learning simulations and multi-user virtual environments to educational games.  Baker is currently an Associate Professor of Cognitive Studies at <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/">Teachers College, Columbia University</a> and was previously the Julius and Rosa Sachs Distinguished Lecturer at Teachers College.   He also served as Assistant Professor of Psychology and the Learning Sciences at <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, and served as the first Technical Director of the <a href="http://www.learnlab.org/technologies/datashop/">Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center DataShop</a>.  The Learning Center DataShop hosts the world’s largest public repository for data on the interaction between learners and educational software and, "leverages cognitive theory and computational modeling to identify the instructional conditions that cause robust student learning."  Additionally, Baker currently serves as the founding President of the <a href="http://www.educationaldatamining.org/">International Educational Data Mining Society</a>, and as Associate Editor of the <a href="http://www.educationaldatamining.org/JEDM/">Journal of Educational Data Mining</a>.   Baker’s research combines, "educational data mining and quantitative field observation methods in order to better understand how students respond to educational software, and how these responses impact their learning."  Baker holds a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I spent years trying to figure out what I wanted to study. I changed my major several times: Computer Science, Philosophy, Cognitive Science, Psychology, back to Computer Science... Finally, I ended up with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with significant coursework in Anthropology. Then I did an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction: Psychology, Computer Science, and Design. Eventually, I realized that the reason I couldn't find what I wanted to do was because it didn't exist. So I joined with some like-minded individuals, and we founded the Educational Data Mining conference, journal, and society. The mixture of learning experiences I've had has helped prepare me for the rest of my career. My background in Computer Science has helped me in building models that infer student affect, engagement, and learning. My background in Anthropology has helped me in collaboratively inventing the BROMP protocol for conducting field observations of students that drive our data mining model building. My background in Design has helped me in designing and engineering complex features from ill-defined data. My background in Psychology has helped me select meaningful questions in learning and emotion within education. It's key to have diverse educational experiences to bring to bear in finding new problems, and finding ways to solve them. The most interesting problems are always at the boundaries and the edges of what well-established fields know how to solve.
<p>


<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I've been extremely lucky to have a great diversity of excellent colleagues to learn from and to work with. Each project I've been involved in has helped me to grow in my mastery of my methods, and has equipped me with analogies that I can make to define and solve new problems. Listing all of the people who have taught me as colleagues and collaborative partners would be out of scope here, but the key theme is that lots of diverse partners and problems has been highly formative to everything I continue to work on. Taking on too many projects has been absolutely crucial to my success.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 

<b>Answer:</b> I hope that my work will help lead to a new generation of learning systems that make inference about a broader range of constructs than before, that explicitly consider the long-term impact of pedagogical decisions, and that are tested and verified to work for a diverse range of learners.
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>

<b>Answer:</b> Data, data, data. The amount of data we're gathering about learners is exploding, and we're only beginning to catch up in terms of figuring out what we can do with this data. I envision systems that understand a range of aspects of the learner, that leverage teacher judgment and expert wisdom as well as simply making predictions on data, that can infer where a learner is headed and make changes to help every kid in the world achieve his or her full potential. Data will make this possible, and every time we link in a new data source, the potentials for improvement to learning will increase. 
<p>
<b>Question:</b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>


<b>Answer:</b> My lab is working on a range of projects, from automatically predicting whether a student will attend a selective college by their pattern of affect in junior high, to better predicting preparation for future learning from patterns of how a student learns over time. And many other exciting projects. 
<p>
In my next big project, we're going to figure out the little ways that educational software bores, frustrates, and otherwise disengages kids. And then we're going to work towards finding small re-designs with big impacts.
