<p>Thorben was a typical kid before cancer struck. Because of his treatments, he was too weak to leave his home. "Your normal life is gone. Everything is finished," his mother said. But, a team from University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf and the Charitable Association Children's Cancer Center partnered together to give Thorben a normal life once again.</p> 

<p>The team installed a state of the art distance learning system in Thorben’s home and school, allowing him to interact with his classmates and teachers just like before his illness. The mission solely focused on improving the young boy’s quality of life, making him feel as if he were actually in the classroom again. Now that he can continue his education, his mother believes that her happy and gregarious son has returned.</p>

<p>Through innovation and community support, normalcy has been restored and dignity brought to this tragic situation. What are some other intersections between health, education, and technology that are changing the world?

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@02:39 Sara Hardman:</b> This is a fantastic example of distance learning where the student can still be very much part of the class. Being able to join his classmates at the same time, on a video monitor where he can participate, demonstrates how effective distance education can be for students with extenuating life circumstances.</p>

<p><b>@03:14 Coach Rick:</b> Wow. Now this is why we have technology! This kid was treated like a real human. Not a product just to make money. Could learn a thing or two over here.</p>
