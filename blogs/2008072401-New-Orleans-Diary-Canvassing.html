          <p>
            Today was a particularly upsetting and uplifting day all in one. Since canvassing door-to-door was expected to start at 2pm and had yet to receive official notice as to whether I was allowed to participate in the canvass, I was anticipating an afternoon nap back in my hotel room. Then a few of the students ask me if I was participating in the canvass and upon hearing my answer, they convinced me to join them, a wish I dutifully obliged.

So at 4pm, I was dropped off in the Upper Ninth Ward with three high school students and a chaperon. The purpose of the canvass was to inform residents about the New Orleans Survivor Council (NOSC), a non-profit organization based primarily in the Lower Ninth Ward aimed at bringing all the residents together to discuss and find solutions to the many problems that affects their community.

The Upper Ninth Ward has more residents and it's less desolate than the Lower Ninth Ward, though there remain an abundant number of abandoned and unoccupied houses. I was paired up with a 17-year-old rising high school senior from Beacon High School, a member of the student-run NY2NO organization, who was as anxious as I was despite her having participated in several canvasses during her frequent trips to New Orleans. We were abruptly met at the door by a 30-something African-American male on the first house we visited. He informed us that he was currently occupied by something and therefore couldn't listen to us. On to the next house where a profanity laced welcome from a middle-aged woman informed us at outright that she had no need for us, a fear she confirmed seconds later when she saw us.

The houses in the Lower Ninth Ward are very close to each other so we went right next door where a few people sitting and laughing on their front porch. The first lady we approached was welcoming and upon asking about her life after Katrina, she answered in a quiet but meaningful voice that life after Katrina has been very difficult as she is currently unemployed and her three teenage children are living in Dallas, Texas. She showed an interest in attending the weekly Saturday meetings that NOSC holds. We asked for contact information so someone from the council can give her a call to hear more about her concerns and problems but she bluntly told us that she didn't have access to a phone.

It was there that the effect of Katrina really hit home. I've come to see a phone as a commodity that everyone owns since they have become so commonplace in almost every society in the world. Three years after Katrina, things keep becoming worse for those residents who, unemployed, have to pay rent or mortgage, worry about putting food on the table while the price of food continues to soar at an alarming rate. 

Next, we met a 47-year-old African mother of two young children named Mia, who welcomed us and applauded our efforts. We engaged in a short but insightful discourse about the current nature of American politics and the impact it is bound to have on her and many residents in the poor and affected areas of New Orleans such as the Upper Ninth Ward. She showed her appreciation for Mayor Ray Nagin, despite the harsh criticisms he received in the days and weeks following Katrina.

During the course of the conversation, a neighbor from the following street came over and started engaging in horseplay with her husband. Mia playfully threatened to stab her with a pair of scissors in her hand if she didn't keep “her hands off her man” and then a big laughter breaks out. She states that it is such moments that give them the power to wake up and keep hope alive.  She lamented the fact that many of her neighbors don't vote because to her, that is where the change they want to see in their neighborhoods commences. We informed her to attend the Saturday meetings so some of her neighbors can hear her ideas and opinions about politics and becoming actively involved so their community can change for the better.

We then turned left and started walking down a long winding street with a few abandoned houses. As we were walking away from the first house since a few minutes had passed since we knocked, we heard a voice and calmly approached the door. Suspicious of our intentions, he decided to speak with us from his closed window and after a few exchanges decided to open the door to properly greet us. He then invited us into his house, which was in fact a rented apartment. It was filled with paintings of Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson (in his Jackson 5 days) and Alicia Keys, showing his passion for music. He then went on a ten minute monologue about his experience prior to and after Katrina.

On the eve of the hurricane, the devout 48-year-old drove eight hours from New Orleans in uncompromising wind and nonstop rain to Baton Rouge where he lived on his truck for a week solely on the food he had bagged in his backseat. In the course of the talk, he revealed that he was the one who actually drew the pinpoint portraits of his musical idols and proceeded to show us a few more portraits of his late mother and four-year-old daughter. Injured on his construction job, he is at home recuperating and taking care of his daughter.

Our next and final visit, we were somewhat shocked when a Caucasian man in his mid 40s opened the door. In what was an obviously heavily populated African American community, the man talked candidly about being not just the only Caucasian in the neighborhood but also the only homosexual; a fact that seemed to initially bother many of his neighbors, who have slowly warmed up to him. In the ensuing conversation, he revealed to us that he bought his house immediately after Katrina and hopes to one day profit from his investment when gentrification hits the neighborhood.

After meeting up with the rest of the NY2NO contingent, we walked directly into what was brewing into a heated confrontation between a few residents in the Upper Ninth Ward. A large crowd had gathered around the two opposing fronts in the argument. We immediately came to a halt and waited for our bus to pick us up but the quick arrival of the military police quickly quelled the argument and the crowed dispersed. It was a stark reminder of the danger many of the residents had warned us about prior to our departure.
