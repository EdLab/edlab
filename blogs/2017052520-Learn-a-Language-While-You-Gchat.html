<p><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/ccai/waitchatter/">WaitChatter</a> is a Google Chrome extension that infuses mini language-learning questions directly into your Gmail chat. While you wait for the other person to respond, WaitChatter lets you flip through some vocab words in either Spanish or French to build your knowledge of another language.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>WaitChatter brings vocab practice to a platform that most people already use, which makes it an almost seamless integration into a person’s day. The extension presents a vocab box at the bottom of your Gchat window. As you flip through words, you mark each as one you already knew or one you didn’t, and WaitChatter quizzes you on the latter as you move through questions.</p>
 
<p>The activities are simple, but great for someone who’s interested in building their foreign language vocab bit by bit throughout the day. In addition, the extension keeps track of your progress. When you click on the extension icon next to the URL box, it provides a list of words you are learning, words you have learned, and words you already knew.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>WaitChatter only works with Gchat, not Google Hangouts. Most Gmail users have already switched to Google Hangouts, so in order for the extension to work, you’d have to revert back to the older chat model. The extension would be much more compelling if it spread to Google Hangouts because for me personally, the benefits of WaitChatter are not enough to convince me to revert back to Gchat permanently.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you are interested in improving your vocabulary in either Spanish or French and regularly use Gchat, I highly recommend installing WaitChatter to your Google Chrome browser. It’s a fun learning app that you can fit into just a few moments each day while you wait for someone reply to your messages. Fingers crossed that WaitChatter’s creators can make it accessible via Google Hangouts soon because the learning potential of this extension would reach a much wider audience if they did so.</p>
