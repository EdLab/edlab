            Well, they've done it.  The board of Trustees of City College <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/nyregion/cuny-board-approves-tuition-increases.html">has announced</a>, in the face of very vocal student resistance (borrowing energy from the OWS movement), a schedule of tuition increases that will eventually bump up the cost to $6,330 by 2015.  The deliberations led to some <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2138">disruptive protests</a>, and a few student arrests, but I don't think those affected by the tuition increase will be able to keep up the energy for any more major actions.

As the New York Times points out, this is an obvious response to declining state funding and growing enrollment.  The City college system averages fairly low graduation rates (Baruch, the best, is currently hovering around 60%, many are much lower), and the remediation/support programs required to prevent worse numbers are probably one of the budget items behind the increase.  Overall, however, the CUNY system seems to be doing a better job (graduating more people, at less cost) than many other community colleges in the new age of ballooning credentialization and majority-minority student bodies.  

Pitirim Sorokin, in his classic work “Social Mobility,” wrote: “Education does not diminish but increases rather the physical and mental differences among individuals.  It is not so much a factor of leveling as that of aristocratizing a society.”  By simultaneously making education more easily available and decreasing the difficulty of graduating, our public administration has thought to use education as a leveling tool, and many attack these tuition increases as an attack on that vision.  But given education's inherent “aristocratizing” power, every step towards equalizing education must be a step away from actual education, so that real learning is at best deferred to some later institution or process that has not yet been equalized.

The inefficiencies of such a system may, in a time of prosperity, be compensated for by the status equalization it provides (more people spending a longer time before being sorted), but it is becoming harder to afford in an era of ballooning public debt and a malingering economy.  To avoid or postpone this reckoning, I strongly suspect the CUNY system will increase price discrimination (already about half of the students pay little to nothing into the system), implement cost-saving reductions in the resources it provides for regular education, and continue or increase its support for marginal students.  I see this as resulting in the system restricting its course offerings to online classes, while providing intensive tutoring and counseling for the aforementioned marginal students.
