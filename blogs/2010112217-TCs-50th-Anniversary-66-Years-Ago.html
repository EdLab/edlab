Sixty-six years ago, Teachers College celebrated it's 50th anniversary — and, in a commemorative issue in Volume 46 (1944) of the <i>Teachers College Record</i>, authors offered recollections of the college's beginning years.  While many of us have seen the black and white pictures of turn-of-the-century TC in the halls on campus or in Pocket Knowledge, <i>TCR</i> contributors like James Earl Russell, and early Teachers College leaders Walter L. Hervey and Nicholas Murray Butler offered unique and interesting perspectives on the origins of our institution.

<b>Russell:</b>
“On November 15, 1894, this part of Manhattan Island was a scene of unusual activity. A great and distinguished body of New Yorkers were making their way out into the country to the section that they called Harlem Heights–or Riverside Heights–to dedicate the new building of a new institution, Teachers College. Carriages were driven out Riverside Drive, alongside the bicycles and horseback riders; the cable cars and horse cars discharged extra loads; and some climbed the hill from Central Park and 110th Street, where they had made the hour-long trip from mid-town New York by steam trains on the elevated. . . . The new building of Teachers College–now called Main Hall–stood alone amid fields and small houses; and across the way to the south was the property for the new site of Columbia University, with a few small red brick buildings.”

<b>Hervey:</b>
“I wish to tell you what I did not tell the Horace Mann children [in an early address to students of the school]–why it is, and why it was, that they didn't have cows in the classroom then, or goats either. They didn't need them. The cows were just across the street–at the corner of 120th Street and Morningside Drive. My little boy and I passed that corner one morning, he bound for the kindergarten, and I for the Dean's Office, and there by the squatter's shanty was a cow being milked. We stopped and looked. The man offered to squirt a stream of the milk into the little boy's mouth. The offer was accepted.”

<b>Butler:</b>
“The moving force in the creation of Teachers College . . . [was] the Annual Reports for the years 1881 and 1882, submitted to the Trustees of Columbia College by President Barnard. . . . With President Barnard's approval, I offered in 1886 lectures on education, given on Saturday mornings in the College buildings on 49th Street, for teachers and those who were preparing to teach. It was predicted that this undertaking would be futile. It was said that no one would wish to attend lectures of that sort. What happened, however, was that the largest room which the College could then provide was crowded with an interested and attentive audience, chiefly public school teachers, and more than two thousand requests for tickets of admission had to be declined.”  

<i>The rest, as they say, is history . . . .</i>
