<p>Digital badges have been widely used by online platforms that leverage game elements to engage users. Like online scout badges, digital badges are electronic stickers that mark a given user’s accomplishments. While digital badges can drive users to click, watch, or check-in, how do these extrinsic rewards benefit learning? More than simple participation ribbons, proponents of digital badging have argued that these reward structures could be used to make learning more self-directed.</p>
 
<p>Maranatha Baptist University in Watertown, Wisconsin used digital badging to develop their school culture by rewarding student engagement in co-curricular activities. Badges were collected by students for getting involved in arts groups, community service challenges, and student body leadership. The badges were then displayed on a virtual transcript called the Maranatha passport.</p>
 
<p>Research prior to the full rollout of the passport was conducted to understand how students would react to the digital badging system. The researchers believed that students likely needed a reason as well as a reward for participating in this digital badging incentive program. Focus groups of 30 total students provided feedback on their motivation to participate in the digital badging initiative.</p>
 
<p>While students who participated in the focus group conversations and questionnaires were hooked by extrinsic rewards, they described their ongoing participation as more closely tied to intrinsically meaningful activities. Though some students liked the idea of being rewarded for their participation in co-curricular activities, others thought of digital badging as childish. The mixed reactions to digital badging show that stickers alone won’t drive participation in a given program; true student engagement needs to arise authentically in order for it to be motivating.</p>
