<a href=" http://linkd.in/1yD8wHA">Stephen Kosslyn</a> is the Founding Dean of the <a href=" http://bit.ly/1CuAtCY">Minerva Schools</a> at the Keck Graduate Institute. He served as Director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and was previously chair of the Department of Psychology, Dean of Social Science, and Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. Kosslyn's research has focused on the nature of visual cognition, visual communication, and individual differences; he has authored or coauthored 14 books and over 300 papers on these topics. Kosslyn has received numerous honors, including the National Academy of Sciences Initiatives in Research Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, three honorary Doctorates (University of Caen, University of Paris Descartes, Bern University), and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Kosslyn received a B.A. from UCLA and a Ph.D. from Stanford University, both in psychology.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b> 
I was on the Harvard faculty for more than 30 years. As time went on, I became increasingly involved in administration (first heading the graduate program in my department, then the undergraduate program, then I became chair of the department, and then dean of social science). At the same time, my research became increasingly applied. I wrote books on visual display design and on how to use psychological principles to create clear and compelling PowerPoint presentations. Eventually, this tug toward "translational" research drew me to consider the science of learningâ€”which directly affected what I am doing today at Minerva.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
At Minerva we've done something unique: we've developed a software platform to deliver real-time, synchronous seminars that take advantage of the science of learning. We used this science when we developed many features of the software (such as the ways that breakout groups can be created, the kinds of polls that can be conducted, and the ease of carrying out and evaluating debates). We plan to assess objectively how effective this pedagogy actually is. If it is in fact as effective as we anticipate, I hope that many other institutions will adopt our techniques. 
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
Several immediately come to mind. First, using seminars to help students learn to think critically and creatively about material, and not using seminars as a forum for information transmission (which can be done effectively prior to class by reading and watching videos). Second, the use of the science of learning in developing new forms of "active learning." Third, the use of technology to deliver interactive, active learning-based teaching. Fourth, a global orientation, where students understand the importance of culture and varying perspectives. <p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
My life is consumed with Minerva. The first-year curriculum is now well on its way toward being fully developed, but we have to build out the rest of the entire curriculum. We expect to be hiring many new faculty, which is a massive project in its own right.
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I have no time to watch television and no time for social media. So, I'm not following anybody at this point.
