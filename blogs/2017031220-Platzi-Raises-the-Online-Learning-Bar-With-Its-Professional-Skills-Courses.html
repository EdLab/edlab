<p><i>"Develop your skills learning from top industry leaders at your own pace. Learn Marketing, Design, Programming and more to help grow your career."</i> (<a href="https://courses.platzi.com">About Platzi</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>On-the-Go Supplemental Learning</b></p>

<p><a href="https://courses.platzi.com">Platzi</a> is a new online learning platform that currently offers 24 courses in marketing, design, programming, and business. The courses are offered in English and Spanish and are designed so that people can use them anytime and from any device. They’re not meant to act as a full-time online educational experience; rather, they’re meant to supplement learning and growth in particular career trajectories or transitions. It would be particularly helpful for anyone interested in entrepreneurship looking to get an edge over their peers. While most of the courses are free, some of the more popular ones, such as in growth marketing, cost $99 each.</p>

<p><b>Tech Experts Leading the Charge</b></p>
 
<p>Each course is taught by a different tech industry leader, including top growth managers at Uber and Waze. Courses include video lectures that can either be livestreamed or watched at a later time. Once a person signs up for a course, they have permanent access to the material, so they can watch lessons again and again. Courses include collaborative opportunities among classmates and real-time feedback with the instructor. In addition, most courses include challenges, hands-on projects, and even free workshops, and when a person finishes a course, they receive a certificate of completion.</p>

<p><b>Good Reputation, Continued Growth</b></p>
 
<p>Founded in Mexico City, Platzi operates in both English and Spanish. Last year, it raised <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-11-platzi-raises-2-1m-seed-round-for-bilingual-professional-skills-courses">$2.1 million in seed funding</a> and serves thousands of people worldwide. Platzi has a good reputation when it comes to online learning course completion rates. In fact, with 70% of students completing Platzi classes, it far surpasses the normal rate of 5-10%. Obviously, they’re doing something right.</p>
