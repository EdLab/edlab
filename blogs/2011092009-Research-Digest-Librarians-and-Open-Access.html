<a href="http://crl.acrl.org/content/72/5/443.full.pdf+html">Mercer, H. (2011). Almost Halfway There: An Analysis of the Open Access Behaviors of Academic Librarians. <i>College & Research Libraries, 72</i>(5), 443-453</a>

This paper examines the personal archiving and open access behaviors of academic librarians. It has been long assumed and surveyed that librarians are almost universally pro-information availability in the form of open access. Will the increasing involvement of librarians in the publishing affairs and production lead to an embrace of alternatives to the traditional academic publishing model? 

<b>Description:</b>
The author argues that librarians, who should by their professed desires for increased information availability, tend to get wrapped up in <i>helping people</i>. 70-90% of publishing librarians fail to add even their own research to institutional repositories and tend not to direct authors towards these resources because of their low barrier to entry and perceived impermanence. Most librarians stated that they would comply with institutional mandates to archive in institutional repositories. The slightly higher rates of librarian participation in open access publishing found by the author may be attributed to the phenomenon of respected journals in library science, like <i>College & Research Libraries</i>, becoming freely available. 

Professional ethical codes for librarians, like that at the University of Minnesota, council to advocate for freely available information, many also stipulate that one should connect the right information to the right patron without regard for personal biases. Until open access publishing becomes the most desirable option for our communities, these obligations are at odds. The author found that librarians who had experiences with open access publishing advocated for it more strongly and were more likely to recommend it to their communities. Perhaps instead of laying a mandate of universal OA acceptance among librarians, we should push it in our own professional community first.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The glacial progression in open access publishing, especially among librarians, has been a little disheartening in my own professional development. From my first OA presentation in library school to my current understanding of the uncontrollable expense of institutional subscriptions, very little has changed in opinion or practice. Librarians, who almost universally advocate for information circulation in the academic community, should take a page out of C&RL's book and insist upon it for ourselves.
