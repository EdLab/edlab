<p><a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">App Inventor</a> is an online app creation platform first developed by Google and maintained by MIT. With an easy to understand drag-and-drop interface and cloud-based technology, it helps learners create mobile apps easily and quickly in any browser and then use their apps on Android-based mobile devices or see them in action through an online emulator. </p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Similar to popular youth programming software <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/868 ">Scratch</a>, App Inventor uses graphical blocks rather than computer language for coding, which is <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1199"> a more effective approach</a> for beginners. In a few simple steps, learners can create and run their first apps on Android devices. This is an exciting feature because it gives learners the opportunity to share their apps with their families and friends on real devices, get feedback on their work, and foster their identity as makers of real world products. More importantly, it helps learners demystify the logic and operation behind everyday mobile apps. Users can learn programming by browsing other people's projects on the <a href="http://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/#">App Invention Community Gallery</a> and download source code for learning. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While the advanced interface, coding blocks and various settings allow learners to design customized and powerful apps, it might be challenging for younger learners to master them without more instruction and guidance than is currently provided on the site. In addition, the apps created by App Inventor only run on Android mobile devices. Students who don't have Android devices can still see their apps in action through the online emulator, but they won't share the same excitement as those who experience their apps on mobile devices. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p> App Inventor makes learning app programming easier for beginners, and learners can quickly create an app that runs on their mobile devices. The comprehensive functionalities of App Inventor and the simplified programming interface also make it a great prototyping tool for anyone interested in testing out ideas and iterating designs before further investment and development.</p>


<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Anyone can be an App Inventor!</p>
