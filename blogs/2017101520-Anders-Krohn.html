Anders Krohn is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://aula.education/">Aula</a>, a communication platform for education providing a modern alternative to learning management systems. Krohn has studied at five universities on three continents. He is also the co-founder of the non-profit <a href="https://projectaccess.co/">Project Access</a>, a startup that fights inequality in higher education admissions. He is a member of the World Economic Forum Global Shapers Community and advisor to Young Global Pioneers.</p> 

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Aula Education?</b><br>
<p>I have been on a bit of a random educational journey. I’m originally from Denmark but I’ve studied in the US, the UK, and briefly in China. These experiences changed my life. To be honest, it was not the technology I remember, it was the people. For me, technology is what it enables people to do.</p>

<p>What fascinates me about educational technology is the complexity of the human element. It is not just about technology, it is about psychology, pedagogy, organizational change, ethnography, and how all that interplays with the technology. Despite the complexity and the diversity of institutions, it is clear to me that there are some shared fundamentals across educational settings. Conversation is one of those fundamentals, and that is exactly what Aula is about. Bringing learners and educators together to create active and engaging learning experiences enhanced by technology and driven forward by conversations.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Aula Education will change college students’ and teachers’ approach to the learning process?</b><br>
<p>Fundamentally, I hope Aula can help make learning experiences more active and engaging. Learning Management Systems (LMS) were built for the digitization of administration and, despite new paint, they suffer from a large degree of path dependency. With Aula, we challenge the fundamental assumption that monolithic learning management systems are needed in modern institutions. We do that by using integrations with third party tools to put conversations front, right, and center, leaving "learning management" in the background. We don’t change the learning process (educators and students do), but we empower educators to create a less static and more active blended learning experience.</p>

<p>In addition, one of our main ambitions with Aula is to build a simple product that appeals not only to early adopters amongst educators, but probably even more to late adopters. I think a lot of educators feel somewhat alienated by the LMS. I  get the most satisfaction when I see a group of initially reluctant educators starting to find joy in technology-enhanced teaching. One of the biggest benefits of conversational UI is that it is intuitive by nature, everyone knows how to communicate.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I think the three broad trends that will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead are (1) improvements in the digital literacy of learners and educators, (2) the move towards technology-enhanced teaching beyond "islands of innovation", and (3) conversational user interfaces as a path towards more human-friendly technology in education.</p>

<p>I think there’s a bit of a tendency to put technology before people when the talk is around enhancing teaching and learning. I doubt that any single technology will have a bigger impact on learning in the years ahead than the wider technological trends affecting the people working in education. The ubiquitousness of social media, smart phones, voice assistants, etc. means that educators and students are becoming increasingly able to leverage technology in all aspects of their everyday life. That is much more important to technology-enhanced learning than any edtech product itself.</p>

<p>There is hardly a university strategy today which does not mention technology-enhanced learning. The potential for technology to improve learning experiences is now well-supported by research and the potential for technology to change the conditions under which people can learn is undeniable. This will, hopefully, immensely improve learning outcomes in the years ahead by empowering students and educators to create more effective learning environments.</p>

<p>In all spheres of our lives, we are moving towards interacting mainly with simple, conversational user interfaces with a wide variety of integrations. We are seeing it with Messenger, Whatsapp and Wechat in the social sphere and with Slack and Microsoft Teams in the corporate sphere. When this happens in education, technology-enhanced learning and teaching is much easier to implement institution-wide, learning will become much more contextualized and collaborative, and teachers will be able to elicit more effective and timely feedback. On top of that comes the obvious advantages conversational user interfaces have for being the "home" for educational chatbots , for example, <a href="https://hubert.ai/">hubert.ai</a> which helps educators collect feedback from students.</p>

<p><b>What else are you working on in addition to Aula Education?</b><br>
<p>I’m an advisor to two non-profits in the education space, Project Access, a mentor network fighting inequality in university admissions, and Young Global Pioneers, a creator of global and diverse talent networks through 3-week learning journeys. If I wasn’t doing this, I would probably work as a chef, so I do get to spend quite a few hours in the kitchen.</p> 

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter? Who are three people you recommend we feature in New Learning Times?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jessifer">Jesse Stommel</a> for interesting insights and critical approaches to pedagogy and technology. In general, I’ve found quite a lot of inspiration from everyone tweeting under #digped. Recently I’ve had some great conversations with <a href="https://twitter.com/ammienoot">Ammie Scott</a> from Edinburgh University.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Lawrie">Lawrie Phipps</a> for his thoughts on next-generation digital learning environments. Practical insights and a good overview of what everyone is up to.</p>
