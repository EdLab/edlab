<p>Sherry Coutu is a serial entrepreneur and angel investor based in the U.K. who chairs <a href="https://www.founders4schools.org.uk/">Founders4Schools</a>, the <a href="http://www.scaleupinstitute.org.uk/">Scaleup Institute</a>, and the Financial Strategy Advisory Group for the University of Cambridge. She is also a non-executive member of Cambridge University Finance Board, Cambridge Assessment, and Cambridge University Press, and a non-executive director of the London Stock Exchange plc, Raspberry Pi, and the Translation Committee of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>Previous non-executive roles in the education sector include teaching at London Business School, serving as a trustee for the National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts (NESTA), and serving as a non-executive director of RM plc.
<p>As an entrepreneur, Sherry has founded a number of businesses and charities.</p>
<p>As a philanthropist, in addition to Founders4Schools, she is a supporter of the Prince’s Trust and the Crick Institute. Sherry has an MBA from Harvard, an MSc (with distinction) from the London School of Economics, and a BA (honors with distinction) from the University of British Columbia, Canada. Sherry was honored with a CBE for "services to entrepreneurship" from HM Queen in 2013, serves as an ambassador for London, and is the author of "The Scale-up Report" on U.K. economic growth, which was commissioned by the U.K. government in 2014.</p>

<p><b>How are Founders4Schools and <a href="https://www.workfinder.com/">Workfinder</a> helping to change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>Our services help young people learn about a variety of work environments for themselves, so they are better prepared for work when they are finished with full-time formal education. Founders4Schools brings local business people into schools to speak to students about their work, and our ground-breaking Workfinder platform enables students to find, shortlist, and apply to great, growing companies offering placements in their local area.</p> 

<p><b>How have your past professional experiences shaped your work at Founders4Schools and Workfinder?</b><br>
<p>My current work as Chair of Workfinder has been shaped by serving on the boards of Cambridge University Press and Cambridge Assessment, by having been an investor in startups, and by having served as an advisor to the government on policies to stimulate economic growth.</p> 
<p>Working at Cambridge University Press and Assessment gives me insight into how the school system works and what the business models are for education in the U.K. and other countries. Both of these organizations are subsidiaries of a university, itself a charity, and both have hundreds of millions in global revenue from operations selling the services of education. Over the decades, I developed a deep appreciation for how charities make ends meet and how similar they are to other businesses.</p>
<p>My work as a startup investor helped me understand the depth of the U.K.’s labor crisis and the fact that the skills being taught in schools are out of line with the needs of most businesses. As an investor, I know that businesses have a choice of where to locate their business and that they have an obligation to be in places where they will be successful. This presents a huge challenge for economies like the U.K.</p> 
<p>Working with the U.K. government as a macro-economist, I realized that this talent shortage would cause all the ambitious companies to locate elsewhere, an outlook consistent with Professor Michael Porter’s <i>The Competitive Advantage of Nations</i>. My work as an advisor to LinkedIn from their very early days also gave me insight into the talent crisis and the accelerating rates at which global labor markets and industries are changing.</p>
<p><b>So how did the idea for Workfinder evolve?</b><br>
<p>From this background, I was clear on the problem (and the future consequences of it). I also determined that if the problem that the U.K. has–a skills shortage–is fixable, then we should fix it. Otherwise we <i>will</i> move to ecosystems where they are more likely to succeed.</p> 
<p>Rather than try to change the whole education system, we decided to create a service that relies on the self-interest of the very businesses who are suffering from the skills shortage. As an investor, I had invested in a number of apps, and as a philanthropist I had created Founders4Schools, which brings local business people into schools to speak to students about their work.</p>
<p>Why not see if the people speaking in schools were willing to host work placements, internships, or summer jobs? That way they could enable further learning while opening up a talent pipeline that could help their own growth.</p>
<p>That’s why we created Workfinder.</p> 
<p><b>What types of students will benefit most from Workfinder?</b><br>
<p>I wish I’d had a program like Workfinder when I was younger. Very few students get work experience in the U.K., and when they do, they often don’t find it meaningful. It’s similar in Canada, where students like me, whose parents didn’t go to university and who have limited networks, just don’t get meaningful work experience.</p>
<p>I was aware that some students at my school with parents who were lawyers, doctors, or in business had access to networks of adults who could get them work experience, which meant they got jobs–even if they weren’t the brightest. Ask any business person–they would rather offer a job to someone with a bit of experience, it’s a lot less risky.</p>
<p>That’s why at Workfinder we focus on the young people in the most disadvantaged areas, who have the most to gain.</p>
<p><b>Workfinder is currently available in the UK. How is it going?</b><br>
<p>It was harder than we imagined when we first started working on it three years ago, but boy does it work. I love it. I love what it does for young people, and I love what it does for small- and medium-sized business owners who run interesting companies–it’s a win-win-win. I can’t wait to roll it out in more countries, because there are small business owners everywhere who need talent and there are young people everywhere who need work experience to get them on a pathway, or to help them get a taste of several pathways before they go for their first proper full-time role.</p>
<p>Having now reached 800,000 Student-Employer Encounters, we are keen to go much further </i>because the insight at our core is correct</i>. When educators reach out in their community, the business community responds. You just need to make it easy for everyone to connect.</p> 
<p>Aspects of the tech platform I designed are very similar to LinkedIn, and our "confirming speakers" is very similar to Amazon’s one-click program. Our recommendations feature offers suggestions for a user’s next work experience placement, much like the recommendations Amazon makes for your next purchase. Except instead of "filling our pockets," we are changing the futures of young people and giving them skill sets that are very much in demand.</p>
<p><b> Who do you recommend we profile next on New Learning Times?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://mastersofscale.com/">Reid Hoffman</a> for his scaleup masterclasses and <a href="http://www.exponentialview.co/about-azeem">Azeem Azhar</a> for his insights into AI.</p>
