            <strong>A Move toward Creativity</strong>

I enjoyed the panel discussion about teacher development and how classroom teaching is moving toward individual creativity. The panel discussion was led by two vice presidents (Mr. Youqun Ren and Mr. Qi Dong) from two of the most renowned colleges of education in China. I was very glad to see this emergent change in K-12 education in China. China was the first country to invent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Great_Inventions_of_ancient_China">printing, compass, paper making, and gunpowder</a>, etc. for the world. However, contemporary China seemed to lack the creativity of its ancestors. The “stereotype” of Chinese students is that they are the most diligent but are a silent and obedient GROUP. They lack INDIVIDUAL voices and often times individual uniqueness is covered and negated by their group.

It is a pity that during the talk I didn't hear specific plans/ideas of change toward bringing out students' creativity in the K-12 school setting in China. While Mr. Ren talked about the technology integration and hands-on teacher training plans via cutting-edge science labs in East China Normal University and Mr. Dong mentioned there was a newly issued state educational policy in creativity, I was not sure and was actually very curious about how creativity will be defined and probably “measured” in future policies and how this policy orientation will be specifically implemented in China, a country with massive textbook use, large class sizes (40-50), limited educational resources (e.g. school finance), and the “daunting” college entrance exam. Mr. Dong answered a similar question from the audience and admitted that it is a hard and complicated move which might involve multiple trials by parties more than the Ministry of Education in China.

Dr. Robert Siegler from Carnegie  Mellon University is an expert in creativity research. He discussed that the move to individual creativity in China is challenging and complicated because of its cultural and social values. Also, this change needs to involve many parties in addition to the Ministry of Education itself. As for teaching strategies, he introduced his research studies (e.g., Siegler &amp; Chen, 2008) and concluded with group learning differences after comparing Chinese students who received direct teaching and students who were frequently asked “why” and “how” the results were made and given enough time to think.

Overall, it is an encouraging move but it needs careful and effective policies in curriculum reform, teacher training (e.g., formative assessment and reconstruction of teacher-student dynamics in classroom), and other important factors such as school finance.

<strong>Future Policy Changes: A Talk by Ms. Xiaya Chen</strong> (Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education in China)</p>

Ms. Xiaya Chen talked about a few educational policies currently under draft in China and discussed how China is currently trying to learn more from the policies and teaching practices of the U.S. educational system (while the U.S. seems interested in learning more about math and science education in China).

I'm interested in the following categories she mentioned:
<ul>
	<li><em>Preschool education.</em> One- to      three-year public preschool programs will be established in China, for all children including those from migrant families without local residential registration (i.e. a previous requirement for children to enter local public schools).</li>
	<li><em>Information technology.</em> Teacher  education will incorporate more information technologies to cater to the “digital generation” and the changing global and social contexts.</li>
	<li><em>Teacher development in rural </em><em>China</em><em>.</em> More teachers and teaching support will be directed to rural China      (Note: over 0.8 billion Chinese are from rural areas and there are huge gaps in economic classes, educational facilities, and infrastructures between city area and rural area).</li>
	<li><em>Teacher certification.</em> Teacher     certification standards will be further raised.</li>
