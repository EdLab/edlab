If you missed <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/11894"target="blank">my post</a> yesterday, I'm in Pittsburgh picking up tips on how to improve our publishing game. </p>

<p>Here are my biggest takeaways from the breakaway sessions; for more detailed info, feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CUmtY5QgOVLINZkxGP_MvOk76lrGaprR-8XkoH-tONo/edit?usp=sharing"target="blank">browse my unabridged notes</a>.</p>

<p><b>Critical Editing: Finding the Red Flags That You Need to Check</b></p>

<p>This was a very helpful session by Gerri Berendzen (<a href="https://twitter.com/gerrrib"target="blank">@gerrrib</a>) on recognizing information that is prone to inaccuracies. Items such as proper nouns, email addresses, phone numbers, and especially URLS should always be spot checked. Copy editors need to train themselves on how to identify other red flags, including: numbers, dates, dollar amounts, surveys and polls, out-of-context examples, biased sources, hearsay, innuendos, distracting visuals, absolutes and superlatives (e.g., always, never, the best, the worst), and unfamiliar or unknown words. </p>

<p>The right attitude to approach any piece is to appreciate that verification begins with asking questions. How do we know this and what is the source of this information? There were some great examples of copy editors missing big mistakes (for example, a journalist interviewing a farmer misheard <i>30 sows and pigs</i> and wrote <i>30,000 pigs</i> in a story about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/09/best-newspaper-correction-ever_n_820783.html?"target="blank">dead livestock floating down a river</a>). We aren't interviewing many farmers at TCR, but our feature articles and commentaries frequently contain statistics, charts, and figures that shouldn't be taken for granted. More items to add to the checklists.</p>

<p><b>Eyetracking Photojournalism</b></p>

<p>Our banner images on NLT take up a lot of visual real estate, so I think it's important that we get the right image for each article (and we've already used every Creative Commons stock photo of students poking around on iPads). Sara Quinn (<a href="https://twitter.com/saraquinn"target="blank">@saraquinn</a>) of Poynter has been using eyetracking to research what people's eyes are drawn to when they look at an image. I think these findings could us to choose more compelling images. She found that:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>People were able to identify professionally taken photos 90% of the time.</li>
<li>People associated professional photographs with quality, context, and storytelling.</li>
<li>People spent 50% longer with professional photos compared to amateur shots,</li>
<li>In lieu of a dominant image, people looked at faces first, followed by bright colors and closely cropped images.</li>
<li>If images and headlines were the same size, people's eyes bounced back and forth; they preferred a visual hierarchy.</li>
<li>People were drawn to images showing relationships between people.</li>
<li>People read captions, even if they were lengthy or garbage; they wanted context; their eyes darted between caption and image.</li>
<li>People remembered photos that captured emotion.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Niggles, Nudges and Uh-Oh Sensors: The Intuitive Art of Catching Errors</b></p>

<p>This session covered the instinctive feelings you have when writing or editing. There's a <i>niggle</i> (for the record, I'm not totally comfortable with this term), that voice that says “are you sure you want to send that email?” and a <i>nudge</i>, the feeling that pushes you to hit send or hit delete. This echoed previous speakers' reminders to be skeptical and inquisitive; if you have a feeling something might be off, there's probably something to that.</p>

<p><b>The Art of the Link: Linking, Ethics and Verification</b></p>

<p>I'm not always sure about linking etiquette, so I'm glad Nick Jungman (<a href="https://twitter.com/nickjungman"target="blank">@nickjungman</a>) put together a thoughtful framework on linking practices.</p>

<p>First of all, links should be there to help your reader by adding background and context to a piece, and to build credibility by showing any research you've done. Don't go overboard by linking every proper noun, because that's unnecessary and annoying for readers. Before you add a link, you should ask yourself if you can imagine that some significant number of readers will follow the link. If you can't, then don't.</p>

<p>When selecting anchor text, you should choose something that's descriptive, uses a whole phrase, isn't a command, is a big enough physical target, and doesn't include terminal commas, periods, or spaces. "For the complete schedule, click <u><font color="blue">here</font></u>" is an example of poor anchor text because it patronizes the reader, breaks the fourth wall, doesn't provide any context, and is a small target if you're reading on a mobile device. Instead, a more appropriate anchor text is, "<u><font color="blue">The complete schedule</font></u> is on the festival website."</p>
