<p>Matthew Ramirez is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://bit.ly/1TIoQ4Y">WriteLab</a>, a Berkeley-based education technology startup whose software provides students with instant and actionable feedback on their writing. During his time as a Ph.D. student of English at the University of California, Berkeley, Ramirez found that he could not provide his students with feedback on their writing quickly enough to keep them engaged with his comments. His patterns-based approach to writing grew into WriteLab, which he co-founded with Donald McQuade, a professor of English and author of several books on composition. WriteLab has received over $2.5 million in funding, and thousands of students across the country use its software. Ramirez graduated from the University of Texas, Austin.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<p>As a Ph.D. candidate and instructor in UC Berkeley’s English department, I found myself repeating the same feedback on my students’ papers. In parallel, I was working on computational linguistics, and I found that I could automatically generate some of the comments I was giving my students. I found that by automating part of the feedback process, I could turn around their papers faster and help them become more self-sufficient writers. My students no longer needed me for lower-level comments, so I was free to work with them on larger issues like structure and argumentation.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>With WriteLab, students can get the writing help they need when they need it. We suggest revisions to students, and we ask them questions to help them make decisions about their writing. We also highlight what students do well. We believe that success motivates learning, and that if students see what they’ve done well, they’re more likely to repeat their success. Our platform helps students learn as they write, coaching them through the writing process and helping them understand and evaluate the decisions they make as writers. For the first time, it’s possible for writers to get substantive feedback on their work—instantly.</p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>We’ve found that students often feel afraid of the judgment they might receive from their peers, tutors, or teachers. Our Comments remove this burden, empowering students to express their ideas without dreading the criticism on which they’re usually focused. WriteLab doesn’t make corrections to writing, and we always leave the decision to the writer. Instead, WriteLab’s comments guide a student along the writing journey, ensuring that writing reflects the author’s style and intentions.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the way people learn and teach? </b><br>
<p>We’re currently building our instructor analytics, which will enable instructors to run writing experiments in their classrooms and measure the efficacy of those experiments.</p>
