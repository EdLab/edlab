<p>Early admissions deadlines are just around the corner, which means this is the last chance for many students to take the SATs, a test that could change their lives. For many, test takers studying for the exam can be overwhelming and costly. However, the app <a href="https://ready4.com/sat/">Ready4 SAT</a> is trying to make the personalized studying process a little bit easier and a whole lot cheaper.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
 
<p>Ready4 SAT creates customized SAT practices for students. The app works like a digital tutor with built-in scaffolding, making navigating through the app simple and intuitive. Students can simply sign-up and begin. The app first takes users through a short diagnostic exam that helps them understand where they are academically and their possible test performance. Then, based on weaknesses, they're able to continue through customized practice questions. The app provides users with theories, test structure information, and tips. In addition, it allows them to input their college preferences and goals, giving them a complete profile, a track to follow, and it even matches them with colleges, loans, and real tutors. For students who donâ€™t know where to begin, this personalized track and detailed questioning give them the confidence they need to do well in the opaque world of college applications.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
 
<p>Ready4 SAT charges for human tutoring, though the rates are reasonable (around $30.00 an hour). There are no specific metrics for the effectiveness of the app, meaning no guarantees of score improvement. There are also a few bugs that could discourage students. For example, there were few questions in the diagnostic exam, so when a question is missed, expected results can end up dropping significantly. This could be discouraging for students seeking to reach particular scores. In addition, the app crashed multiple times during my testing.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
 
<p>Overall, the free version of Ready4 SAT offers a lot to users. For students on a tight budget who need help and direction, this app is a wonderful start. In such a busy time of the year for both seniors and juniors, it is important for them to have the support they need to make their lives a little easier.</p>
