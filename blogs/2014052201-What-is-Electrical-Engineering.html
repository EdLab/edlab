            Can you imagine a day without electricity? I am sure you cannot because electricity is global network that is used in many applications and devices such as light, computers, satellite and any other devices. 
<p>
Electrical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the invention, design, development and commercial applications of electrical and electronic systems, components and devices. Electrical engineers work behind the scenes to make our life better by making things that we normally take for granted in our daily live. As an electrical engineering major or someone interesting in electrical engineering, you must be dedicated and willing to accept the challenges ahead of you. 
<p>
You'll study electricity: how it works, how it's generated, and how it's used to power everything from light bulbs and radios to cell phones and robots. You'll also learn how to design your own electric-powered projects. Additionally, the coursework will include a lot of math and physics courses such as calculus, differentiated equations, linear algebra, and set theory, among others. 
<p>
Electrical engineers also earn one of the highest salaries compared to any other disciplines. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, starting offers for students graduating with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 2013 averaged around $66,000 a year. Those graduating with masters were offered about $80,000 a year to start, and PhD graduates began at around $100,000 a year.
<p>
Here is my advice for high school students thinking about entering an engineering field. Challenge yourself and take high-level courses such as calculus and physics. I am currently an electrical and computer engineering student and having a good background knowledge of math and science has and will continue to help me a lot throughout my engineering journey.
