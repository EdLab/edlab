Title: How Can We Learn from a Reading Tutor that Listens?

Abstract: Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor listens to children read
aloud, and helps them learn to read.  It displays text on a computer
screen, uses automatic speech recognition to help analyze a child's
oral reading, and responds with spoken and graphical assistance
modeled after expert reading teachers but adapted to the limitations
and affordances of the technology.  The Reading Tutor logs its
interactions in detail to a database that we mine in order to assess
students' performance, model their learning, and harvest
within-subject experiments embedded in the Reading Tutor to compare
alternative tutorial actions.  This talk will illustrate a few of the
Reading Tutor's tutorial interactions, student models, and
experiments.

Bio:Jack Mostow is a Research Professor at Carnegie Mellon University
in Robotics, Machine Learning, Language Technologies, and
Human-Computer Interaction, and serves on the Steering Committee for
CMU's doctoral Program in Interdisciplinary Educational Research
(www.cmu.edu/pier).  In 1992 he founded Project LISTEN
(www.cs.cmu.edu/~listen) to develop an automated Reading Tutor that
listens to children read aloud.  Project LISTEN won the Outstanding
Paper Award at the Twelfth National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence in August 1994, a United States patent in 1998, inclusion
in the National Science Foundation's "Nifty Fifty" research projects
in 2000, and the Allen Newell Medal of Research Excellence in 2003.

After earning his A.B. cum laude in Applied Mathematics at Harvard and
his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, Dr. Mostow held
faculty positions at Stanford, University of Southern California's
Information Sciences Institute, and Rutgers.  He has served as an
Editor of Machine Learning Journal and of IEEE Transactions on
Software Engineering, as Program Co-chair of the 1998 National
Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and as Conference Chair of the
2010 International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring System and the
2013 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education.
He has given invited talks at such diverse venues as the Association
for Computational Linguistics, the National Science Foundation
Workshop on Optimal Teaching, and the International Symposium on
Automated Detection of Errors in Pronunciation Training.  He is a
Voting Member of the Society for the Scientific Study of Reading, at
whose annual meetings he regularly presents his research.  In 2010 he
was elected President of the International Artificial Intelligence in
Education Society.
