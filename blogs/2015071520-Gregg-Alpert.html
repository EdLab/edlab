<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
I loved learning in my early years. I craved learning new things and had an intense curiosity. As I moved through the public education system, that curiosity faded. It wasn’t until late in my college education that I rediscovered the passion I once had as a kid. I’ve thought a lot about this path and discussed it with many others and unfortunately it is not a unique story. During grad school I joined Education Pioneers as a fellow and was exposed to a diverse group of smart people each focused on different aspects of education reform. Exposure to this group and taking a deep dive into education reform helped me discover challenges in the space and set me on a path to contribute to the field. Each community faces a set of unique challenges, but one constant that is far too widespread is the opportunity gap globally. The harsh reality is that many students either lack access to quality education or attend low quality schools; and in each scenario the student is not prepared for an evolving economy. My current work at Pearson is focused on discovering high quality education solutions that scale to impact many learners. </p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
My broad mission is to decrease the opportunity gap for learners globally. At this current stage of my career I am focused on working with education entrepreneurs who are pioneering new ways to create quality, scalable, affordable and financially sustainable education models—no easy feat! My hope is that we will continue to find new models to deliver education that reaches under-served markets, increasing outcomes and enabling these learners to grow as individuals to reach their potential. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
In emerging markets there is a significant lack of access to information. New ways of delivering internet and connecting more people will be a game changer. Those previously unconnected populations will gain information access that many of us have had for the past 10 to 15 years in connected communities. There are a number of interesting trends domestically in the US, which I believe will make a significant impact in years to come. Blended learning has the opportunity to change the operational model and cost structure for schools and personalized learning via software implementation can provide a more personal experience at a scale that has not been possible in the past. These trends are increasing the utility of technology in schools. Other trends that will impact education include: contextual learning, micro-schools and the diverse post high school / higher ed boot camps focused on technical skills, design, development and other subject areas that can provide a more targeted, efficient learning outcome that can better serve learners. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
I am focused on building ecosystems of entrepreneurs in several emerging markets on behalf of the <a href="http://bit.ly/1IHv27l">Pearson Affordable Learning Fund</a>. Through that work I am also meeting entrepreneurs who are creating new models to address challenges in their markets. We are running a Summit in Latin America in the coming months with promising young education companies. Through my team’s work, we are continuing to invest in for-profit education companies serving low-income and under-served learners in emerging markets. Our goal is to help these companies grow, scale, and increase their ability to impact learners. Our ultimate goal is to show that scale, quality, and profitability work in low-income settings so we can get more investment dollars to flow into the affordable education sector. Far more investment is required from public and private entities in order to address the overwhelming and under-met demand globally.  </p>
