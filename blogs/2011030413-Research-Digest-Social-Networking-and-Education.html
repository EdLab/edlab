<a href="http://www.ncolr.org/jiol/issues/getfile.cfm?volID=9&IssueID=29&ArticleID=149&OpenInGoogle=1">Brady, K., Holcomb, L., & Smith, B. (2010). The Uses of Alternative Social Networking Sites in Higher Educational settings: A Case Study of the E-Learning Benefits of Ning in Education. <i>Journal of Interactive Online Learning</i>, 9(2), 151-170. </a> 

Educational technology looks poised to wreak great changes in teaching methods and effectiveness.  In the Summer 2010 issue of the <i>Journal of Interactive Online Learning</i> an article was published examining the potential benefits of Social Networking Sites to long-distance education.
<!--break-->
Review:
Three professors of distance education courses at the College of Education in North Carolina State University began using Ning as a discussion tool for students to share ideas.  At the end of the semester, the participants (52 students in three classes) were asked to complete an online survey about their attitudes towards Ning based on their course experiences.

The benefits of using Ning were various.  70% of students agreed that Ning allowed for more frequent collaboration.  82% agreed that it aids communication outside of the classroom.  Only 50% felt that Ning was superior to a conventional face-to-face class. On the subject of drawbacks the authors of the study are terse, but identify the time commitment required to comment and respond on Ning to be a potential problem.  

Edlab Relevance:
The most interesting question discussed, at least bearing in mind the work done here at Edlab, was to me the comparison between Course Management Systems (like Blackboard) and broader SNS like Ning.  The authors of this study believe that the latter are superior, and that by including the “friendliness” aspects of a traditional Social Networking Site, such as tagging, friending, full profile pages, etc., users will forge stronger connections, which will encourage greater collaboration and information exchange.  However, they fail to discuss potential drawbacks to this approach, drawbacks that are implicit in their own study.  If the time investment required by a SNS can become problematic (as we all know anyway from our private lives), then fostering greater social exchange (greater that is, than is proved by a CMS) may turn the networking service into an onerous burden on learning, particularly if this greater time-investment is not characterized by educational conversations, but rather by the more frivolous uses of SNS.  

Perhaps, as with most questions, it's best to conclude that the proper solution is to find the golden mean, where a given educational tool will offer just the right amount of social networking to maximize educational collaboration, while minimizing frivolous time-sinks.
