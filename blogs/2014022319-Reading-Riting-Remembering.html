<b>Title:</b> Individual Differences in the Development of Early Writing Skills: Testing the Unique Contribution of Visuo-Spatial Working Memory
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Lorna Bourke, Simon J. Davies, Emma Sumner, & Carolyn Green
<p>
<b>Source:</b> <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11145-013-9446-3">Reading and Writing</a>
<p>
<b>Research Question:</b> What is the role of visuo-spatial working memory in literacy development?
<p>
<b>Study Design:</b> 
Although the use of visuo-spatial recognition and discrimination skills, by helping children "map symbols to sounds" is integral to literacy development, little work has been done to investigate and quantify this relationship. In addition to investigating this association, the authors of this study wanted to look more in depth at how a student’s ability to mentally examine words held in their short-term memory might mediate the relationship between visuo-spatial working memory and literacy.
<p>
To do so, they put a group of 143 Scottish grade-school children through a battery of tests, examining cognitive ability, reading and spelling ability, writing ability, visuo-spatial working memory, listening recall, and "orthographic coding" (using and manipulating letters to form words).
<p>
<b>Findings:</b>
The major question was whether visuo-spatial working memory bore any relationship to writing ability once the influences of nonverbal cognitive ability, phonological working memory (remembering sounds), and other unrelated but potentially mediating psychological factors had been removed. The results indicated that visuo-spatial working memory does indeed have a unique influence on reading and writing ability, above and beyond the influence of other psychological skills.
<p>
<b>Moving Forward:</b>
The authors claim that "the associated link between with visuo-spatial working memory suggests that children differ in their ability to store, manipulate and focus attention on the processing of long term representations of orthography." For some children, their ability to hold and even manipulate in their heads long strings of letters and words allows them to take on greater reading challenges than their peers. Developmental pedagogy that takes into account differential ability for working memory storage and retrieval may prove useful in early literacy instruction. Learning technologies that can adjust to different learning styles and student abilities can be a promising avenue to implement these methods.<p>
