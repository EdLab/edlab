            The highest accolade that a piece of children's literature can receive is a chorus of voices shouting "Again! Again!" when the story is finished. Measuring what makes a book stick out to children isn't always easy, but awards panels try their best to strike a balance between books that are most likely to be read front and back, over and over, and books that are most likely to make a lasting impression for readers of all ages.

This year, I have been given the honor of presenting the most recognized children's books of 2018. The materials on display come from long lines of winners and honorable mentions before them, many of which have gone on to become classroom staples and timeless classics. They represent awards and book lists that focus on excellence in literature and illustration spanning over genres and reading levels, with the intention of making reading and learning enjoyable for everyone.

There is no greater joy than sharing these stories with you as a librarian and educator.
