          <p>
            <a href="http://www.experiencepoint.com/">ExperiencePoint</a> is a company providing simulations for leadership development and business education. The four simulations offer different business goals and structures and it is up to students or employee participants, often working in collaborative groups, to brainstorm and implement sustainable change and solutions to problems. 

<b>Pros</b>:
The simulations seem unique and applicable to a variety of situations. They center around a township seeking policy changes for sustainability, two tech companies with different business goals and a hospital seeking management solutions. ExperiencePoint is established and has been used in many business schools and companies. They seem to provide a lot of structure and training for their simulations. The modules are able to approximate the multitude of challenges and consequences for a real world company in a way that traditional learning tools may not. 

<b>Cons</b>:
The design of the simulations is basic, but the interface seems clear. There are currently only four modules for use, though they differ in scope and concentration. Though these are online learning simulations, they seem to rely on an in-person classroom structure with a designated and trained leader; this may exclude a portion of potential users. They also use real paper in some of the simulation activities, but suggest that every student has their own laptop.  

<b>Edlab Relevance</b>:
The simulations fit snugly in the online learning game family, but these people have been at it since 1996! I feel like there is a lot to learn here about the process of creating and restructuring online learning. ExperiencePoint has a great and far-reaching <a href="http://blog.experiencepoint.com/">blog</a> which details how they use feedback to improve the simulation experience. 

<b>Our Takeaway</b>:
These simulations seem like a good way to liven up a leadership meeting or business class and students and corporate attendees might benefit from seeing the repercussions of their ideas and policy changes “in the flesh” even if the possibilities are limited by the simulation. It goes beyond traditional situational training exercises and seems like it would be a useful intermediary step between traditional business school curriculum and actually meddling in business structures.
