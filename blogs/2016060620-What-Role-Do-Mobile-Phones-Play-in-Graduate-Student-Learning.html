<p>The vast majority of young adults in modern societies, including graduate students, walk around with a veritable supercomputer in their pockets. A South African university led a qualitative research project to understand the role of mobile technology in graduate student learning. It focused on developing an attribute called "graduatedness," which includes qualities that distinguish someone who has successfully completed university from the general population.  </p>

<p>Three themes for understanding mobile technology resulted from this study. The first theme is critical awareness of learning in the 21st century. Students generally seemed to be savvy in knowing what it means to be a student in our tech-centric world and how technology impacts learning. </p>

<p>The second theme is mobile learning (mLearning) literacies, or learning across social contexts with a mobile device. This involves knowing how to search for information, how to follow online etiquette and safety norms, and how to use the device with ease. </p>

<p>The third theme is expectations regarding mLearning. Students expect a variety of players to be involved, including the higher ed institution, instructors who use mobile devices in class, and other students who engage in appropriate learning practices. </p>

<p>The study also highlights themes on promoting mobile learning literacy and improving graduation rates. One implication of this study is the need for higher education institutions to take a multidimensional approach to developing mobile learning literacies. Specifically, it would be useful to weave mobile learning into curriculum and pedagogy. Finally, teacher trainees could learn to increase their awareness of mobile literacies and leverage student devices in public schools despite limited economic resources. </p>
