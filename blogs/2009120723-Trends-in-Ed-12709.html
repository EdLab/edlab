<b>Online Learning Policy and Practice Survey: 
A Survey of the States</b>

In 2008, the Center for Digital Education, a national research and advisory institute on K-12 and Higher Education technology,  conducted a review of state policy and programs to determine the status of online learning policy and practice across the US. 

The Center interviewed state education officials to evaluate the overall landscape of online learning, and below rankings (truncated for this blog post) reflect the vision, policies, programs and strategies that states have deployed around online learning. According to the report, certain characteristics deemed to have a greater impact on statewide leadership and education (e.g. states with state-led online programs and/or significant policy directives) played a more significant role in the rankings than others. 

1. Florida
2. Michigan
3. Idaho
4. Arkansas
5. Louisiana
6. New Mexico
7. West Virginia
8. North Carolina
9. Minnesota
10. Hawaii

Here are some interesting excerpts from the report:

>> States have different approaches to the types of programs offered. <b>Outside of state-led programs, multi-district online schools are becoming increasingly popular.</b>
 
>> Florida and California have a large number of school districts compared to other states; perhaps it is no surprise that the Florida Virtual School serves nearly 10 times more number of students than any other state-led program.  

>> California provides online options to approximately 33 ,000 students without the presence of a state-led initiative. (CA is ranked no. 49 in this report)

>> Eight States saw an enrollment growth rate of more than 50 percent in the 2007-2008 school year.

>> <b>15 states - including New York - do not have a statewide online school nor plans under way to create one.</b> Two states, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, are in the planning stages.

This report is underwritten by Blackboard and Pearson Education and produced with the advice and consultation of the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the North American Council for Online Learning (NACOL).
