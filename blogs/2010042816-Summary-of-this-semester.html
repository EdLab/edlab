          <p>
                Compared with last semester, I got more training on project development process, including the requirement, use-case diagram, prototype implementation, feedback and improvement, all of which I cannot learn from class.
    Working with Faisal, Ankit and Weiqi has been definitely a great experience for me. They are all very talented and experienced, and have helped me quickly learn a lot of programs such as Python language and Javascript. Through group collaboration, I've learned the importance of communication. There were times when I had some problems on jQuery, which I wanted to use to implement dynamic form. However, the logic I had  was so complicated that I totally lost myself and dragged the group's progress. After I talked with Faisal and Ankit (Weiqi was working independently on NetPosse at that time), I pulled myself out from the messed up logic and found out a good solution with a very clear logic to implement it.

Some of the skills I learned this semester(completely a rookie before):
        css
        jQuery/javascript
        Python with Django Framework

Skill I improved:
        MySQL
        HTML
        SVN/Documentation on trac
    
My next step is to improve my skills on working independently, bring up own ideas, give feedback and upgrade it by self instead of relying on other people's suggestions and communicate frequently and fluently.
    
Finally, I want to say many many thanks to my colleagues at the Edlab. Because of your help, patience and friendliness, I have been happy and learned lots of knowledge here. Best of luck to your work and finals!
