<a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com.eduproxy.tc-library.org:8080/journals.htm?issn=0307-4803&volume=113&issue=1&articleid=17009705&show=html">Dewan, P. (2012). Are books becoming extinct in academic libraries? <i>New Library World, 113</i>, 1/2, 27-37.</a> 

This article analyzes data from publishers, providers, and libraries to draw conclusions about the future of libraries in relation to e-content. E-readers are becoming more prevalent and traditional book-centric reading is no longer the standard for many people. Still, she argues, the library's place is to provide the format that patrons require and there are many reasons to resist digital purchasing especially with the perpetually uneasy relationship between publishers and libraries. 

OCLC's 2010 publication <i>Perceptions of Libraries</i> shows that “books” is the word people most strongly associate with libraries. The marketing of libraries will have to change dramatically for increasingly book-independent institutions. The shift from “book” to something like “knowledge” or “collaboration” will rely on the creation of spaces, resources, and collections that accept new information formats and add value. Our strategies for doing this are well accepted but our worth will have to be defined separately from our role as a content provider. 

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
The author's major claim, that a shrinking percentage of academic library budgets are going to print books, has more to do with the quick and ubiquitous adoption of the e-format by serials publishers than any kind of digital book acquisitions trend. Progress in this area is significantly hampered by availability and the bigger trend is the adoption of e-lending platforms by major content providers, not the purchasing actions of individual institutions. Indeed it is the fervent wish of many academic libraries, ours included, to move towards 100% digital acquisitions but at present this is actually impossible. It's premature at this point to call digital acquisitions a choice.
