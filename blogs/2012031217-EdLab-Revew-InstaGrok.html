<a href="http://www.instagrok.com/">InstaGrok</a> describes their platform as the "next generation search engine for learners" and like <a href="http://www.sweetsearch.com/">SweetSearch</a>, hopes to create a more relevant, highly curated and specialized search experience for students. InstaGrok offers an interactive interface that allows students to search for information by topic and then collect multi-media resources like pictures, images, and site entries that they can "pin" to their "board", annotate, or visualize in dynamic node-based concept maps. Learners are also given the chance to journal and take short quizzes based on each concept, the results of which are saved both in the student dashboard and available for teachers to track.

<b>Pros:</b>
The "dashboard" format seems like a helpful way for students who are engaged around a single concept to track and process what resources they find so that these elements can be easily accessed at any time. Also, the short, embedded quizzes that are generated by each search allow learners to easily test their knowledge and provides immediate feedback (e.g. your answer turns red if it is wrong). The concept visualizer allows you to see and explore related concepts, providing an opportunity to easily explore all aspects of a subject. Finally, the lack of ads and spam provides a more focused educational opportunity, and I imagine this benefit would be magnified for younger more easily distracted learners.

<b>Cons:</b>
While the incremental quizzes are easy to use, I would like a more intuitive navigation that would allow me to track the analytics related to my responses. Also, while you can change the difficulty level of results shown using a simple "slider," I would like to be able to close-down or customize, either initially from a drop-down menu in the search bar or through customizing the dashboard, what types of search result media is shown (images, videos, etc.). This is one aspect of Google's success that is hard to beat... the filter options.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
As we attempt to help users of <a href="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/">PocketKnowledge</a> curate content from their personal/TC Gottesman Libraries archives, it might be helpful to explore the interactive concept map (see screenshot below) model for representing related concepts and encouraging discovery of additional material.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
It's hard to beat Google for simple, granular search. However, the benefits of being able to search ad-free and curate content around a given subject is potentially very powerful for young learners.
