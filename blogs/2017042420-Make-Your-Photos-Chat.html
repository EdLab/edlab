<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yakit-kids/id794546203?mt=8">YAKiT Kids</a> is an app that lets kids record audio over static photos to bring them to life. Voice capturing allows cartoon mouths to move in time with recorded speech so characters appear as if they are talking.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>YAKiT gets kids started making short simple movies on their own. While YAKiT Kids isn’t a strictly educational app, the tool could be an entry into media literacy as children explore viewing and editing images. Users select a photo, add a mouth to make the picture speak, and record audio that syncs with the talking mouth. Photos taken within the app, uploaded from the camera roll, or pulled from the internet can be brought to life with audio and animations. YAKiT provides tips at the end of each recording that could be used as challenges for kids to create different videos or to get ideas for modifying other images. The ability for multiple characters to speak could encourage collaboration among children. Above all, the app is really fun and the silly voice settings could keep young viewers entertained.</p>

<p>The user experience within the app is fun and simple. This makes it easy for young audiences to get started making movies without adult assistance. Web search features have parental locks so that children can be prevented from using this feature if adults don’t want kids rooting around on the web. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The fun, yet limited use, of YAKiT may get in the way of it being used to draw out much learning value. Though the project tips were helpful, the app is fairly one-dimensional and doesn’t teach kids much more about photography or media. Finally, the videos that are created can only be about 15 seconds long, which doesn’t give kids much time to explore video creation in depth.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>YAKiT Kids could be a fun way for children to start creating and manipulating media on their own. The photo challenge tips could work well for some young users but may fail to capture their interest for long. While this app is fun to play with, it lacks depth to keep kids engaged long-term.</p>
