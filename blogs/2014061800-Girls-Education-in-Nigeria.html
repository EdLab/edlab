            "If you think education is expensive, try ignorance." Judith Ann-Smith, the writer of this <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/education-plus-development/posts/2014/05/21-nigeria-education-walker#.U39QmgIYZfA.twitter" target = "blank">article</a> came across this statement when she went to the Bayero University Kano in Nigeria. It's less expensive to educate people because the materials they learn are vital to their survival. Furthermore, they become vigilant of their surroundings and contribute to their society. On the contrary, many people believe that educating girls is more profitable for society because of the role they play as mothers. For this reason, we need to pay more attention when it comes to girls education. In other words, the world needs to do more to stop countries that forbid girls education.
<p>
In Nigeria, it is easier to gain access to education in the South than in the North. As a result, many vulnerable girls and orphans are found mostly in school environments in the South. Unlike the South, girls in northern Nigeria are found hawking in the streets, in traditional Islamic schools, or in over crowded government schools. In the northern Nigeria, many teachers prioritize Islamic schooling over community based secular education. The main reason for this is that most of the teachers are volunteers who are on their own. Though many people would like to see northern girls in Nigeria educated mainly through secular community schools, it can't be done due to ethnic and religious diversity. Nonetheless, Ms. Smith has began a development Research and Projects Center (dRPC) to provide teaching aids for schools in northern Nigeria. The Bernard van Leer Foundation supports this project.
