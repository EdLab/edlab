<p>When sixth grade math teacher Eric Marcos needed to reinvigorate his lessons, he turned to video. But, when he wanted to inspire a new way of learning, he turned to his students. 
<p>
For a while, Mr. Marcos had been creating video lessons to help his class grasp certain math concepts. Eventually, though, some of his students wanted to take a more active approach to learning; they wanted to create video lessons themselves. He willingly obliged their requests.
<p>
He soon saw that when students take the helm, they become exuberant teachers and that their peers are eager to learn from them. As one student-teacher explains, "Kids like learning from other kids because there's a kid language." Coupled with the video delivery method, how could young students resist?
<p>
With the help of technology, Mr. Marcos’s students’ audience isn’t limited to just those in his classes; instead, these videos are able to reach anyone interested in learning the math concepts featured (which, I’m guessing, is a whole lot of sixth graders and their teachers). This vialogue illustrates the outcome of placing students in control of their own learning. There’s a lot that kids can teach us; it’s about time we let them. 
<p>
Have thoughts on the idea of kids-as-teachers? Add them to the 
<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/5097">vialogue</a>! Below, some Vialoguers have already gotten the conversation started.
<p>
<b>@1:29 janicesunjoo:</b> "Kids teaching kids" is a great concept! 
<p>
<b>@2:01 Carla:</b> I think this is a GREAT idea but I'd like to know more about how/when these videos are accessed. For e.g., do students watch these in class or at home? Add to that, are these videos required viewing or do students watch on an as-needed basis?
<p>
<b>2:08 Lola:</b> Why do all the girls pick masculine pseudonyms? 
(In response) Katezvdp: To feel more tough & powerful? 
(In response) Lola: I think you're right, and that makes me sad. I wish encompassing female math-loving characters made them feel powerful!
