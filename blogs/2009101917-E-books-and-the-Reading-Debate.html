          <p>
            Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/does-the-brain-like-e-books/" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com');">this great NY Times</a> piece which gives voice to several sides of the debate around reading and the influences of e-books:<blockquote>Right now, networked digital media do a poor job of balancing focal and peripheral attention. We swing between two kinds of bad reading. We suffer tunnel vision, as when reading a single page, paragraph, or even “keyword in context” without an organized sense of the whole. Or we suffer marginal distraction, as when feeds or blogrolls in the margin (”sidebar”) of a blog let the whole blogosphere in. <span style="font-weight: bold;">- Alan Liu, English Professor</span>

Paper retains substantial advantages, though, for types of reading that require flipping back and forth between pages, such as articles with end notes or figures....The reading speed reported in academic studies does not include delays induced by clicking away from the text to see the new email that just arrived or check out what's new on your favorite blog. In one study, workers switched tasks about every three minutes and took over 23 minutes on average to return to a task. - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sandra Aamodt, Editor</span>

For my greatest concern is that the young brain will never have the time (in milliseconds or in hours or in years) to learn to go deeper into the text after the first decoding, but rather will be pulled by the medium to ever more distracting information, sidebars, and now,perhaps, videos (in the new vooks). - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maryanne Wolf, Child Development Professor</span>

I assume that technology will soon start moving in the natural direction: integrating chips into books, not vice versa. I might like to make a book beep when I can't find it, search its text online, download updates and keep an eye on reviews and discussion. This would all be easily handled by electronics worked into the binding. Such upgraded books acquire some of the bad traits of computer text – but at least, if the circuitry breaks or the battery runs out, I've still got a book...The tools (as usual) are neutral. It's up to us to insist that onscreen reading enhance, not replace, traditional book reading. It's up to us to remember that the medium is not the message; that the meaning and music of the words is what matters, not the glitzy vehicle they arrive in. <span style="font-weight: bold;">- David Gelernter, Computer Science Professor</span>
</blockquote><blockquote>I wonder about young people, who do not know of a life before the Internet, and who, growing up “digitized,” might not prefer reading online where they are the pilots of their own information pathways. More and more, studies are showing how adept young people are at multitasking. But the extent to which they can deeply engage with the online material is a question for further research. -<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Gloria Mark, Informatics Professor</span></blockquote>
