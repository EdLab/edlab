<p>In the Summer of 2017, Pew Research Center and Elon University’s Imagining the Internet Center asked 1,116 technologists, scholars, practitioners and strategic thinkers to react to the framing of an issue about the rise of fake news and the proliferation of doctored narratives spread by humans and bots online. In the analysis, respondents were split, 51%-49%, on whether the information environment will improve during the next 10 years. When asked to explain their responses, participant reasoning revealed a wide range of opinion about the nature of threats and the most likely solutions required to resolve them. But the overarching and competing themes were clear.</p>
 
<p>Those who don’t think things will improve (51%) felt that humans use technology advances to their own, not-fully-noble purposes, and that bad actors with bad motives will thwart the best efforts of technology innovators to remedy today’s problems. Interestingly, this group also emphasized that survival instinct and humans’ primal quest for success and power will continue to degrade the online information environment over the next decade, and because human brains are not wired to contend with the pace of technological changes, such tendencies will be magnified.</p>
 
<p>In the cohort of the hopeful (49%) there was strong support for technological fixes to bring out the better angels guiding human nature. Those who expect things to improve argue that with the rising speed, reach, and efficiencies of the Internet, apps and platforms can be harnessed to rein in fake news and misinformation campaigns. They take the view that people have always adapted to change and that this current wave of challenges will also be overcome: misinformation and bad actors have always existed but have eventually been marginalized by smart people and processes. They also believe that better information literacy among citizens will enable people to judge the veracity of material content and eventually raise the tone of discourse.</p>
