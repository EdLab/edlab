Casual videoconference technologies, such as FaceTime or Skype, connect people from across the globe in real-time visually and aurally and have made real-life story sharing much easier. They are also a popular means for educators to invite guest speakers to share expertise with students remotely. Recently, an interesting twist of this video call technology with gaming elements, <a href="https://education.skype.com/mysteryskype"> Mystery Skype </a>, has created exciting geographic learning opportunities for kids around the world. <p>

Mystery Skype is a game involving two classrooms from different areas of the world that Skype each other and try to guess the location of the other classroom through strategic questions and clues. The learning of geography is well integrated in the core of the game mechanics. Before the Skype session starts, teachers and students think about how to present the geographic features of their communities as questions and clues. Then they must be ready with maps and other tools to help them quickly filter out unlikely locations and narrow down possible places where their opponentâ€™s classroom might be located as the game starts. Real people in real-time seems like a magic combination to excite kids to learn geography. 

Take a look at <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/12644"> this vialogue </a> to see a group of 2nd graders play Mystery Skype with another group of students who are thousands of miles away, and share your thoughts with other educators about this educational geography game! <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>


<b>@00:33 jagnitti:</b> This is such a great way for kids to connect with one another and experience other cultures firsthand (without leaving the classroom!). This scenario looks like private school vs. public? <p>

<b>@01:18 Wang: </b>I think kids learn the most when they are deeply motivated to find answers by themselves. This game seems successful in this sense since kids in the video are eager to solve the problems with map software at their hands! <p>
