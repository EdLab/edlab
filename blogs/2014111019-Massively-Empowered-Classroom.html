<p>The <a href="https://www.mecr.org/">Massively Empowered Classroom</a>, an initiative from Microsoft Research India, brings MOOC-style engineering and computer science courses to students at both large research universities and smaller regional colleges across India. The goal of MEC is to enhance technical education in the country to help undergraduate students better prepare for their future careers. It is also one of the first experiments of open online learning in India.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The MEC platform can be used alone, or in conjunction with traditional classroom learning. It is easy for institutions to register as a MEC Community Partner. Once registered, faculty and students have access to all course materials and they can enroll in multiple courses. If faculty members choose to incorporate the MEC platform into their own class, they will be able to track their studentsâ€™ progress and participation levels by administering quizzes and assignments through the portal. Faculty members can also add their own content to enhance and personalize the lessons for their own students.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Currently, MEC only offers four courses: Computer Networks, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Computation Theory. Since these courses are aimed to appeal to a wide audience, more advanced students may find the course content to be too basic. Based on the data that Microsoft Research gathers from this project, MEC could potentially introduce additional courses in upcoming semesters.</p>  

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Using a series of videos and interactive content, MEC courses are designed to be an engaging and social experience for students and instructors. MEC course content can also be taken offline and viewed on Windows desktops and through an app for Android smartphones. Upon completion of a MEC course, students receive a digital certificate to showcase their accomplishments. The data collected from this experiment could shape the future of online education in India, and possibly other countries around the world.</p> 

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Bringing quality online technical education to the masses.</p>
