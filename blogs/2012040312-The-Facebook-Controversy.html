            As more and more Americans continue to use social media in all aspects of their lives: social, personal, academic and professional, researchers from the University of Evansville in Indiana have <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204909104577235474086304212.html?mod=e2tw
">conducted a study about how Facebook profiles</a> can serve as a determinant of one's job performance.
 
In the experiment, three raters, comprising a professor and two other students were presented with the Facebook profiles of 56 students. Six months after the study, researchers compared the results to ratings by job supervisors of each student; and they surprisingly found similarities in terms of conscientiousness, intellectual curiosity, etc. The findings suggest that Facebook could be used as a reliable job-screening tool, especially when candidates fake their personalities in order to get the job they desire. As an active Facebook user, this study has changed how I use the social network as I feel my use of it doesn't necessarily reflect my personality or aspirations.
 
Knowing that it is just a social network and people use it as they please, employers shouldn't take it as a totally reliable predictor of potential employees because people tend to change their personalities according to the area or people they are surrounded by. It could also be defined as an invasion of privacy on the part of the employers.
 
Since I am sure several of us here at the EdLab have Facebook and other social networking accounts, I am interested in knowing your thoughts on this study and whether employers have a right to screen the Facebook accounts of prospective employees as part of the hiring process.
