<p><a href="https://info.flipgrid.com">Flipgrid</a> is a new online educational platform that centers on video discussion. This online tool capitalizes on students’ comfort in front of cameras and on social media by letting them record short videos to answer questions posed by their teachers, and receive feedback from both their teachers and peers in the same way. The basic version of Flipgrid is free for all, but there are also premium versions designed for educators who want to use the platform for their entire class and schools that want to implement it in multiple classrooms.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Flipgrid has fantastic platform organization and ease of use. Educators can create separate sites for individual classes, each of which is organized by different topics. Teachers create a topic and discussion question by recording their own video or uploading one. Students respond by recording short videos (the free version of Flipgrid has a 90 second limit), and can then "like" and video comment on other posts. This platform gives a voice to all students in the class, even ones who are normally quiet, by giving them the space to speak without fighting for the teacher’s attention.</p>

<p>While Flipgrid is a unique and engaging tool for the classroom, the platform also fosters an online community of Flipgrid users worldwide, both students and teachers alike. In particular, the online network has become a habitat for teachers to discuss and connect with other teachers around the world. Anyone with an account can contribute to the discussion topics.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The free version of the Flipgrid only allows 90-second student responses to the prompt, which is not long enough for more complicated explanations or answers. This is particularly true for anyone using Flipgrid for high school or college students. Also, although the video transcription function is powered by IBM Watson, I found that it was more inaccurate than not and also could not recognize foreign languages.</p>
 
<p>In many ways, Flipgrid achieves its mission of giving students an equal voice in school, but teachers must be vigilant to make sure this platform does not just increase the technology gap between students. This is because students must have access to devices at home to use Flipgrid for assignments outside of class. Teachers should familiarize themselves with students’ tech situations before requiring them to use Flipgrid at home.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Flipgrid fosters classroom dialogue for students in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/the-information-age-is-over-welcome-to-the-experience-age/">experience age</a>. It takes the fact that kids are constantly sharing videos of themselves over social media and transforms it into an educational space for video discussion. I would recommend it to all educators who want to create a dynamic blended classroom community in which all students participate.</p>
