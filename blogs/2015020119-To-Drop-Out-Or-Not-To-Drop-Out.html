          <p>
            Should dropping out of high school be illegal in the United States? This question can be debated at great length because due to opposing views. I think it should be illegal because it doesn't set a good example for other students. It doesn't benefit society because dropouts are likely to be unemployed and don't fulfill civic duties. Since high school is free, I believe every student that enrolls should do his or her utmost best to graduate and pursue further education. However, some individuals have a legitimate reason or had no option but to drop out. Even with that, I still find it difficult for a child to have a legitimate reason for dropping out of high school. Unlike some countries, everything is free in high schools across America.
<p>
Portugal, Germany, New Zealand and over two-dozen other countries around the world have <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-jody-heymann/childrens-right-to-educat_b_6101600.html?utm_hp_ref=impact&ir=Impact">laws that require the completion of secondary schools</a>. These countries are setting students up for success as adults. This should be the same in the United States. Providing quality teachers, free textbooks and food is more than enough for every child to have a reason not to drop out of high school. However, there are some children that need that extra push. I think making a law to prevent students from dropping out of high school could benefits such individuals. The convention on the Rights of the Child is a law adopted by member states of the UN General Assembly. This law requires every country to enact legislation that will reduce both social and financial barriers to staying in school. This law is not effective in other countries because they charge tuition for secondary schools. However, this is not the case in the US. After all, what Americans have is a privilege that others wished they had.
