<p><i>The men and women who come together at One Day U understand that learning is a rewarding lifelong process, not a chore that ended on the day they received their diploma. Most return again and again and describe the experience the same way: Enrolling in One Day University is like returning to the college environment of their youth.</i> (from <a href="https://www.onedayu.com/"> One Day University</a> site)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.onedayu.com/">One Day University</a> is an organization that hosts an ongoing series of educational classes designed for those who want to return to the days of constant intellectual stimulation, intelligent conversation, and thought-provoking collegiate lectures, but in a no-pressure, grade-free atmosphere. Classes are offered every month in 12 states and are taught by leading professors in the academic world. Those interested can choose from a variety of lectures covering topics like philosophy, film, science, and more. Each event is presented as either a half-day or full-day experience, giving learners the opportunity to choose a lecture that works best with their availability. Additionally, each scheduled course provides a detailed description and breakdown of the day's events, enabling potential students to choose the best course for their learning needs.</p>

<p><b>A <i>Real</i> Way to Pretend</b><br>
Founded in 2006, this "pretend college" was the brainchild of Steven Schragis, cofounder of the satirical magazine, <i>Spy</i>. Schragis was initially inspired to create One Day University after attending his daughter's college orientation. The academic talks were enough to reawaken his need for intelligent conversation post-college and just a short while later One Day University was born. Over the past eight years, faculty members from the nation's best schools have taught thousands of born-again students on topics ranging from neurobiology, American history, filmmaking, music, creative thinking, and everything in between. These acclaimed professors find the process both challenging and exciting, attempting to present courses that people actually want to take and doing it in a way that both inspires and encourages their educational endeavors in a non-committal way. </p>

<p>Classes are lecture-based and usually held in an auditorium. The majority of students are middle-aged learners looking for new ways to stimulate their cerebral cortex, but One Day University accepts all applicants (as long as they pay the course fee). If you're looking for a way to challenge and inspire your intellectual side, One Day University is for you.</p>
