<p>"Everyone says you never forget how to ride a bike, but some people have never learned," Ken Podziba says emphatically. He and the rest of the <a href="http://www.bike.nyc/">Bike New York</a> team are hoping to change that. Podziba, President and CEO of the organization, emphasizes that learning how to ride a bike is not just about when and how to use the brakes. It’s also about learning the rules of the road—how to interact with cars, pedestrians, and street signs.</p>

<p>And learning how to ride a bike is not just for five-year-olds anymore. Bike New York provides classes for every age group, and even offers courses like ""Street Skills Class" and "Bike Maintenance 101" to teach New Yorkers about some of the nuances of owning and riding a bike in the city. The program also features afterschool and summer programs, as well as assemblies for schools across the city.</p>

<p>What other municipal level educational programs could benefit a city’s citizens? Grab life by the handlebars, as Bike New York says, and join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/27614/">on Vialogues</a>. <p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:32 Nantwi:</b> This is a very important endeavor that could have long last benefits to both the city's environment and economy. It will provide alternative forms of transportation, leaving our roads and subways less crowded.</p>

<p><b>@00:54 Beckieb:</b> I can imagine that there are so many factors that bikers in New York have to take into account that aren't as critical in other cities. Many New York natives have not learned traffic laws since so many rely on public transportation.</p>
