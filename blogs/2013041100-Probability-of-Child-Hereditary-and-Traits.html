          <p>
            I recently attended a seminar at Hunter College that focused on the probability of child hereditary and traits. The probability of a child inheriting specific forms of personality is higher than the child inculcating them from parental guidance or even their environment. A <a href="https://mctfr.psych.umn.edu/research/UM%20research.html">famous study conducted by the University of Minnesota</a> stated that even though most of the traits examined in a wide number of twins who had been separated for awhile proved positive to the fact that most of them shared common behavioral traits.

Even though the majority of personalities was found to be due to heredity, the family still plays an essential role in refining these inherited traits. Moreover, it was found that twins reared separately from diverse environments still share common traits. It makes it an indisputable fact made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Kagan">Jerome Kagan</a> that personality is under massive genetic influence. 

Further, other heredity related traits include imperiousness of people towards stress. It was revealed through the Tellegan test that several people who are defenseless to stress inherited this trait. More so, another discovery was for the  fact that one of the least traits influenced by heredity was found to be a willingness  of an individual to have a strong affection with someone. This trait mostly depends  on how family co-existence and mutuality is ensured. So basically interaction in a  family helps kids grow up and become adults with strong socialization habits.
