          <p>
            As my recent post on Pearson's acquisitions of education technology firms and Frank's recent post on the Bloomberg Businessweek article suggest, there is an apparent wind flowing through the sails of edu-tech. Yet in a time where momentum appears to be gathering, I caution those who are eager to jump out of their seats. I would love to see innovation in the education space be wholly unleashed, as the tech sector was unleashed in the 1990s. Yet most of the tech boom that was not bubblicious was rooted in very obvious productivity gains that were there for the taking if firms were simply willing to invest in superior information technologies. 

On the other hand, I cannot think of many technological solutions that are guaranteed to yield bang for the buck for cash-pressed schools. Do not get me wrong. There are plenty of good products out there and some worthwhile investments that ought to be made, particularly in developing better platforms for educational data mining and sharing. Yet the necessary objective research has not been completed to conclusively claim that investing in technology X will yield improved student performances currently. Compare this with the state of Corporate America in the 80s and 90s, when it was obvious that information technology investments could cut out a lot of the busywork that occurred on a day-to-day basis.

Yet I should also stress that this news should be healthy for education and the economy in the long-run. The money flowing into education technology will increase the likelihood that the next great entrepreneur will come from the education sector
