<p>A school in Pennsylvania is doing something that is both refreshing and brave—they are putting their trust entirely in the kids. They are allowing students to have power over their own education. By granting students at Penn Manor High School the freedom to use their own technology in the classroom, the school encourages students to become successful leaders and collaborators. </p>

<p>The principal, Dr. Philip Gale, is adamant that the students should have laptop technology in order to best prepare them for life after high school. Even though the school is responsible for the laptops, students are allowed to take them apart and then put them back together, learning about the structure and functionality of technology through this hands-on experience. This is a demonstration of the trust that these educators have put in their students by encouraging them to make mistakes and learn from them. Instead of punishing failure, it is celebrated as a necessary step of the learning process.</p>

<p>The school has also put students in charge of the technology help desk, another way this school promotes an equitable learning environment. By placing value on the skills of students, teachers can act as collaborators and guides instead of authority figures.</p>

<p>So what do you think? Is putting trust in students and giving them free reign to learn from their own successes and failures the way to go? Join in on the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23396/">on Vialogues</a>.<p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:36 Beckieb:</b> Yes! I think imparting trust and respect to high school students is important. It completely changes trust, productivity, and the attitudes of the students.</p>

<p><b>@01:38 danahaugh:</b>"Hopefully they will learn in my class, and in others, how to be responsible users of technology." Teachers aim to create the foundation for using technology responsibly so that these students can take it with them once they leave grade school.</p>

<p><b>@02:55 Beckieb:</b> Some of the most tech-savvy individuals I know took computers apart when they were children, and this helped them come to be experts on computer operations throughout their lives!</p>

<p><b>@03:22 danahaugh:</b> Teachers and students feel more connected when you put power in the hands of the students… There's no distinction...</p>
