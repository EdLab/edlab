What is learning? Where, when, and how does learning take place? These are all big questions, and no consensus seems to have been reached among scholars, educators, parents, and learners. However, it is safe to say that most of us agree that learning activities should not be confined to school buildings and limited to lectures and textbooks. But can we be confident that kids who mess around or geek out in online gaming communities or fan fiction sites are conducting serious and meaningful learning activities? Scholars who advocate connected learning think it is well suited to the new media era because todayâ€™s technologies enable learners to more easily tap into distributed expertise across online and offline communities and make social connections that facilitate interest-driven learning. Not only will students' learning be connected to the real world in the connected learning model, but their interests will also be connected to academic learning that would provide them better social and economic opportunities. <p>

How might these ideals translate into practice and what are some challenges facing this learning approach? Watch learning scholars explain what connected learning is and how it works, and share your thoughts <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11433">on Vialogues.</a><p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@1:55 johnlee:</b> This is an interesting observation and I total agree with her argument that as long as we focus on creating great learning experiences, how kids get the content and the learning outcomes should be the easier part. <p>
 
<b>@2:29 Carla:</b> It seems like a tough balance to strike though... on one hand, supporting individual learning experiences is the ideal, but on the other, setting learning objectives seems like a fine way to assess whether kids are on the right path. I do see her point though. Perhaps the path is too rigid... <p>

<b>@4:29 johnlee:</b> "Who contributes and who is ultimately responsible for helping young people survive, thrive and grow up as curious and engaged citizens?" This is a great question. As stated earlier by Dr. Ito, I don't think schools can bear this burden alone since we now live in such a rapid changing world and we need experts in every field to contribute to education and facilitate youth learning.
