          <p>
            I am fascinated by <a href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/"> Minerva Schools</a>. For those of you who don't know what that is (I didn't know until last month), it is an innovate new liberal arts college that's goal is to crumble the white columns and ivy-coated walls of traditional higher education. The school is spearheaded by former Snapfish CEO Ben Nelson in addition to several, prominent former Ivy League professors.

At Minerva, all classes take place on an innovate online platform. Professor and student can see every member of the class in their own small box on the screen. There are no lectures in class; instead, students utilize MOOCs and other online resources and readings on their own time. Class time is spent taking short quizzes, responding to the professor's questions, and being placed in small groups for more intense discussions. Every moment of class time is spent in conversation or response. The leaders of Minerva want each minute in class to be efficient. If the students are learning in an active way, time is wasted.

In addition, there is no college campus at Minerva. Students live together in the same apartment building, but professors and administrators can live anywhere in the world—as long as they have internet connection. There is no cafeteria, no sports teams, no commons area or auditoriums. There is just the students, living in close proximity. First-years begin in San Francisco, but spend each subsequent term in a different country. Because there is no campus, students and expected to take part in community activities. They are encouraged to dive into each new culture to experience life there. In addition, although the majority of students now are American, they hope to tip the scales in the near future so that students from other countries will eventually make up 80% of each class.

Perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects to me is the fact that the leaders of Minerva think it will replace college as we know it. They think the lecture is outdated and dying—or rather, they want to kill it off. Could this be true? Is college education in the US ready for such a massive leap?

There are aspects about Minerva that I find incredible. But there are also some that I'm not so sure about. For one, I have serious reservations that an online platform can provide the type of social and intellectual growth that should happen in a college class. I haven't used this particular platform, though, and it does seem much more interactive than online classes generally are. But still, is there a problem with taking away literally all in-person interactions between professor and students in class?

For more information on the school, check out <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/09/the-future-of-college/375071/">this article</a> written a couple years ago about it by The Atlantic.

And <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/3041/ben-nelson">this Profile</a> on Ben Nelson that we published 5 months ago.

I'm curious to hear other thoughts on this. If you have any, comment or come find me in person. I'd love to talk about it more.
