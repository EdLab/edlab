          <p>
            From METR)-L:

Biomedical and Life Sciences Division, Special Libraries Association (SLA) Web Site Redesign

The Biomedical and Life Sciences Division (DBIO) requests proposals for the revision and redesign of their existing website located at http://units.sla.org/division/dbio/.  

Our goals for the new web site redesign are to promote the Division's image and services; increase membership; facilitate two way communication; encourage initial and return visits through improved usability and appeal; and capture the interest of our members and potential members by its format, ease of use, attractiveness, color, and identifiable logos. It is expected that the redesign will create an infrastructure that makes the site easier to maintain, to add new content and to make future improvements. The DBIO website is hosted by SLA, our parent organization.

With this website we wish to communicate that DBIO is part of SLA, the leading global organization for innovative information professionals and their strategic partners.  DBIO supports information professionals who are working or interested in the life sciences and related disciplines, through education, advocacy and networking. The Medical Section of DBIO serves as a forum for Division members who are engaged or interested in health care.

Under the guidance of the DBIO Web site committee, the successful candidate will perform the following in the redesign of the website: 

Logos. Design two interconnected logos: the Biomedical and Life Sciences Division (DBIO) logo and the Medical Section logo with a relatively minimalist design, to indicate that the Medical Section is part of the DBIO.  These logos need to look professional, unique and appealing in conveying the slightly different subject focus, such as life sciences and medicine respectively of DBIO and the Medical Section. Also these logos need to be compatible with the SLA visual identity logo (see Unit Visual Identity Guidance at http://www.sla.org/content/SLA/pressroom/unitVIguide.cfm 

Visual Design.  

-	Layout. Enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of the existing content by creating a layout that will communicate our brand and purpose. The layout and overall design of the page should help the user to spot the various elements of the page intuitively.  
-	Web interface aspects. Design a website that is not graphics-intensive that contains quick-loading, easily accessible pages, and is consistent throughout in font colors, terminology, layout, navigation and appearance.
-	Navigation. Web site navigation should be apparent through each page by the use of a clear and intuitive menu system. Improve information architecture, categorization and labeling to achieve shorter, simpler tasks and greater cross-site consistency.
-	Links. Use text for hyperlinks, organize links into clusters. 
-	Interactivity.  Each web page should display a permanent menu that contains the following subject headings: DBIO Home, Medical Section Home, SLA Home, Contact Us, Join, and Feedback. Feedback is a form/ pop up menu which users can use to respond to a poll (How would you rate this page? or anything else we might need to know). This permanent menu also should include a full-text search feature with relevancy sorting, and a site map with auto-change indexing/ updating.
-	Color. Use high-contrast text color combinations and high contrast panel color combinations to enhance readability and appeal. Use color and significant white space hoping to convey a professional and prestigious look.
-	Standards and Guidelines. All web pages will comply with SLA guidelines and standards.  Refer to the SLA Web Site Style Guide (http://www.sla.org/content/community/units/chdivsites/web-index/index.cfm) intended to promote uniformity throughout the Special Library Association Web site. All web pages will comply also to web accessibility standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), with exceptions where it would be cost â€”prohibitive. You will be assigned password-protected space on the network.
-	HTML Web programming.  Design templates, interactive forms, and CGI files as needed, using the web-authoring tool Dreamweaver.  Make it dramatically easier for us to update/ modify information and test/ validate the pages in the future.  
-	Testing and Validation.   Develop and test prototypes with multiple graphical browsers, and on different platforms (Mac, PC, and UNIX).  Ensure accurate HTML code. 

Required Qualifications:

-	Knowledge in site design, architecture, good navigation methodologies, and
          understanding of search engine optimization and maintenance.
-	Demonstrated initiative and creativity in planning and facilitating projects
-	Excellent communication and interpersonal skills.

Send proposals, including: a cover letter addressing the required qualifications as well as what the applicant can do to enhance the DBIO Web site; a resume/ portfolio demonstrating the applicant's Web publishing abilities; a list of references from most recent projects, and a bid for services to be provided. 

Via e-mail (attachments are acceptable) with the Subject line: DBIO WEB SITE REDESIGN APPLICATION to Claudia Lascar at clascar@ccny.cuny.edu, no later than November 15, 2006.

A decision will be made by December 15, 2006. Project set forth in the proposal must be completed and approved by DBIO Board no later than April 30, 2007.

PLEASE NOTE: Dependent on caliber of design offered, budgetary constraints of the organization restrict the DBIO Web site redesign bid range to $1,000 to $5,000 U.S. dollars for the one-time 2007 redesign.
