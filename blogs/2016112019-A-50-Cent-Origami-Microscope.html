<p>Manu Prakash is a physical biologist who won a MacArthur Genius Grant for his work on <i>frugal science</i> inventions. These inventions are remarkable because of their simplicity. His most notable creation to date is the <a href=" http://www.foldscope.com">foldscope</a>, an origami microscope made of paper, copper tape, and batteries. These microscopes are incredibly inexpensive to create, making them easily accessible to people around the world.</p>

<p>Prakash hopes that foldscopes will be as ubiquitous as pencils in classrooms and available to all children. In the next year, he plans to make 1 million foldscopes, each of which will cost only 50 cents. The foldscope is printed on thick paper, which children can then fold origami-style to create their microscopes. In areas around the country and world where regular microscopes are too expensive to have in classrooms, itâ€™s clear that the foldscope could have a tremendous impact on science education.</p>

<p>What are the benefits of making traditional scientific tools accessible to all? How might <i>frugal science</i> inventions change education around the world? Are there any other frugal science inventions you know of or would like to see created? Join the discussion

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@00:41 RuthS:</b> Scientific tools are expensive, and a lot of schools in the country and around the world simply can't afford them. With more frugal science inventions, more children will be able to experiment with science; their education will expand.</p>

<p><b>@01:03 Victoria57251:</b> I have done a lot of reading on new technology entering the classroom, but they are all profit-based and inaccessible to students in low-income areas. It is great to finally see some affordable class innovations that can take science education to a new level on a global scale. Education technology should democratize learning not exasperate the haves from the have-nots.</p>
