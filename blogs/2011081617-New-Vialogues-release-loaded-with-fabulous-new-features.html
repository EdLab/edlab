            What event occurs multiple times a year, commanding your immediate attention and triumphant cheers? <a href=”http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/197869/20110815/horsemaning-horsemanning-beheading-planking-owling-cone-ing-two-people-photograph-headless-horseman.htm”>No, it's not the birth of a new meme.</a> <b>It's Vialogues Day!</b>

Since our last release, we've been very busy responding to feedback and make no bones about it: We heard you loud and clear! We also made some surprise enhancements that we think you will enjoy. 

So here's some of what we've been up to: 

<ul>
	<li>On the Manage page...
<ul>
	<li>Close a vialogue
<ul>
	<li>You  can now disable commenting on your vialogues by “closing” a vialogue.   You can reopen a vialogue at any time. (Note: This does not change the  permission setting of a vialogue, meaning that if it was a public  vialogue at the time you close it, it will remain public until you  change its permission settings.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Delete a vialogue
<ul>
	<li>You  asked for it and you got it! This is a permanent decision on your part,  though, so make sure you want to go through with it. The Vialogues team  can not recover any deleted vialogues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>On the Play page...
<ul>
	<li>Comment density timeline
<ul>
	<li>See when the most comments were made in a vialogue by looking at this visual timeline.  The higher the bar, the more comments!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Real time notifications
<ul>
	<li>Now  you can keep up with the newest comments in a vialogue with our comment  notification system.  If you are in a vialogue when someone else adds a  comment, you will see a message telling you that there are [however  many] new comments.  Clicking on this message will reveal the new  comments in the order of their time code.  New comments are marked with  the indicator “New,”making them hard to miss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Feedback when submitting comments
<ul>
	<li>Now  right after you submit a comment you will see a little processing  indicator pop up, giving you feedback that your comment is in the  process of being submitted. This cuts down on confusion and the number  of double postings.  It's a small victory, but significant nonetheless!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Connect your Vialogues profile to your Ednode profile picture
<ul>
	<li>If you have an Ednode account, your Vialogues account will automatically be synced to it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Advanced search
<ul>
	<li>You can now fine tune your search results by performing advanced searches</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Tagging
<ul>
	<li>You  can add a hashtag (#) to your comments to make certain words  searchable.  In context, hashtags are great for making your point stand  out.  Out of context, they are a great way to see how many people are  talking about whatever you searched for!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Created Jquery plug-in "VialoguesPlayer"
<ul>
	<li>This  plug-in makes videos look consistent across browsers--- all video  players look the same now. This wasn't always the case, especially for  videos embedded from YouTube.</li>
	<li>Vialogues  now plays on iPad and iPhone! Before, only embedded vialogues were able  to play in these devices but now you can play vialogues from the actual  Vialogues site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Fixes
<ul>
	<li>Embedded vialogues
<ul>
	<li>We  fixed the problem of the broken words. In the previous version, words  would get cut off and continue on the the next line, making for an  awkward reading experience.  Words now wrap to the next line.</li>
	<li>You can scroll through the discussion using your laptop's trackpad now, instead of solely relying on the scroll bar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Basic search
<ul>
	<li>Basic search results are returned much quicker than before and are more accurate now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
