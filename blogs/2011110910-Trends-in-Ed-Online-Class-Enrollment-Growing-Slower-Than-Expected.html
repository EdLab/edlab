          <p>
            According to a recent survey report, <a href ="http://www.onlinelearningsurvey.com/reports/goingthedistance.pdf"> "Going the Distance: Online Education in the United States, 2011"</a>, after eight years of enrollments growing faster than overall higher education enrollments, online enrollments have finally showed signs of slower growth. Over 6.1 million students were taking at least one online course during Fall 2010, which is an increase of 560,000 students from the previous year. This is a ten percent growth rate that is the second lowest since 2002, but it is still higher than the less than one percent growth rate from overall higher education enrollment.

The report goes on to give more statistics like how one out of three educators still believe that online is inferior to face to face education, or that 31.3% of students are now learning online. The interesting thing is that for now it seems that online enrollment is beginning to plateau. Is it because people are beginning to realize that online degrees are too expensive and have less value than degrees from brick and mortar schools? We can't really be sure of the exact reason that growth is slowing down but this could be the beginning of a plateau, or just a minor set back for online learning schools.
