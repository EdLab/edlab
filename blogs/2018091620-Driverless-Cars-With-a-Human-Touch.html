<p>Would you really trust a driverless car? A <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2018/05/aaa-american-trust-autonomous-vehicles-slips/"> recent study by AAA</a> shows that almost 75% of Americans would be too afraid to ride in an autonomous vehicle, even though the majority of car accidents are due to human error. The founders of <a href="https://phantom.auto/">Phantom Auto</a> think they have a solution that can help bridge the gap between human-operated and autonomous vehicles, and thus build consumer trust.</p>

<p>Phantom Auto still places a human behind the wheel, but not physically in the car. Instead, the driver controls the car remotely, relying on a multi-screen display and remote wheel and brakes to maneuver the vehicle. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has high functional capacity, the developers of Phantom Auto think that humans are still the best judges of how to respond to tricky situations such as bad weather and sudden obstacles. Using a combination of human drivers and AI can help advance future AI development, and in the meantime, riders can rest assured that there is a human being looking out for them. Phantom Auto’s driving system can be used on any car, and the developers foresee it being implemented by rideshare companies.  </p>

<p>Do you think Phantom Auto’s service can help increase trust in autonomous vehicles? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/44384">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:57 RuthS:</b> I don't understand the point of having a remote driver for a self-driving car. At that point, why wouldn't you just have a real driver in the car? This doesn't seem to decrease human effort at all. It just makes driving more complicated.</p>

<p><b>@01:02 Betsy Harrington: </b>Maybe I'm just a nervous person, but I really don't mind driving myself. I mean, I have to be in the car anyway if I want to go somewhere, so why not sit behind the wheel? Would this technology increase my trust? Maybe if I knew the person behind the computer. But I'd rather have that person sitting next to me than controlling the car remotely. At least then we could have a conversation.</p>
