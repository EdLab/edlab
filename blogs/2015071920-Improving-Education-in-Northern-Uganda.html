For children in developing countries, education represents probably their only way out of poverty. However, far too many children are denied a shot at education. This problem is more severe for children living in conflict zones. Take the case of Northern Uganda. For nearly two decades, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by the enigmatic <a href="http://bit.ly/1S9Fxkz">Joseph Kony</a>, ripped apart all semblance of life in that corner of the landlocked east African country. Children felt the full brunt of the LRA’s force. An estimated 30,000 children were kidnapped and used as soldiers, porters and sex slaves.</p>

<p>The chaos that became a way of life has slowly receded and Northern Uganda today remains largely free from the LRA’s reign of terror; however, enormous problems, especially in education, remain. Though primary and secondary education is free in Uganda, there exist enormous hurdles (e.g., transportation, schools supplies and opportunity costs to families) and challenges (e.g., quality schools and resources, lack of teachers) for students and their families. In steps NGOs such as DevEd. In a world that is rapidly changing, DevEd is hoping to equip Northern Uganda’s children with the educational platform to engage in democratic life, become future entrepreneurs and push themselves out of the seemingly endless cycle of poverty.</p>

<p>What are some of the challenges facing DevEd and other NGOs in Northern Uganda? What role should NGOs play in rebuilding postwar societies? <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/22570/">Join the discussion on Vialogues.</a> </p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

 <p><b>@00:45 yaotse:</b>A healthy classroom environment starts off with motivated teachers who have the ability to encourage student in many different ways. Teachers must make class activities more engaging and creative to help students develop skills.</p>

<p><b>@02:41 kwaku5:</b>This is a plan of an educational revolution that is needed in not just a war-torn Northern Uganda. I hope to see this expand through Africa and other third world nations.</p>
