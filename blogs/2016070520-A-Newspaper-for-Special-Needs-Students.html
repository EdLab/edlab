<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/news-2-you/id602677864?mt=8">News-2-You</a> is a weekly newspaper specially designed for children with special needs and for those just beginning to read. Each issue delivers news through symbol-supported articles, activities, games, jokes, and guided practice opportunities, making the content both interactive and interesting. Although the newspaper issues are not free (each is $1.99 and a year’s subscription is $54.99), the app could be a valuable resource for any special needs teachers looking for ways to educate their students about contemporary events and issues.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Available as a website or an app for tablets, News-2-You creates newspapers around current-day topics that will peak children’s interest. Some recent issues include "The Dory Movie," "Walking with Dinosaurs," and "Black History Month." Each issue is available in four different reading levels, from simple to advanced. This is ideal for teachers who work with students of varying abilities, as the newspaper can adapt to each child’s needs.</p>
 
<p>News-2-You was created by a speech language pathologist who had a lot of experience working with children with special needs, and this shows in the newspaper’s thoughtful execution. Each issue has a read-aloud option; as they are read, the words are highlighted and underlined, making it easy for children to follow along. In addition, each newspaper contains plenty of pictures, but the easiest two levels accompany every word with a small picture or symbol. Kids who have difficulty reading can use the pictures as a guide to help them understand the meaning of the text.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although the newspaper comes in four different reading levels, the easiest and most difficult levels have fewer articles, games, and activities than the medium levels. This might be a problem for children of varying abilities reading the newspaper at the same time; not everyone will have the same number of fun activities included in their issue. In addition, the read-aloud voice has only one speed, and it may prove too fast for many beginning readers. Also, the voice reads by the page or sentence, meaning that users can’t target individual words to practice.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>News-2-You is a great tool to bring contemporary curriculum into a special needs classroom. Overall, it’s adaptable and interesting, and the read-aloud and symbol-supported text gives students the support they need. This app is ideal for special needs students, as well as for their parents, teachers, and speech pathologists.</p>
