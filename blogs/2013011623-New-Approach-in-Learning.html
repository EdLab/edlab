            Social media has become a mainstay in most areas and education is the latest space where its influence has reached. Educators are using social media to find new avenues for students to feel comfortable learning. Educators allow students to use several resources such as researching on their mobiles in order to participate and make connections to the materials they are learning in the classroom. Henry Jenkins is a big supporter of this type of learning, and his work is based on grassroots level of creativity and how it can be connected online by relating to students' social learning. Moreover, Jenkins has made an effort to push American schools to change into a system of learning in a networked world through a strategy called  <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/01/how-can-teachers-prepare-kids-for-a-connected-world/">"PLAY"</a>. 

PLAY allows for modes of experimentation and many different interactive avenues to help the students' learning and understanding. However, with educators under constant pressure based on students' test scores, this new system will be hard to improvise. Jenkins sees a new way of learning through Edtech, which help students engage during class work and other school related activities. PLAY allows for students to connect their school life with outside life through the process of making education into an ecosystem whereby school, community and home all interact in one environment. This system essentially allow teacher and student to move away from traditional methods and away from a culture where grades and test scores are valued more than actual learning.
