<p><i>"New Classrooms was born from the belief that today’s model for delivering education—one teacher and 28 or so students in a classroom—does not sufficiently account for each student’s needs and assumes that each student arrives on the first day of school with the same academic foundation and way of learning. For a teacher, this presents the nearly impossible challenge of teaching grade-level curriculum while also meeting the needs of each student."</i> (<a href="http://www.newclassrooms.org/believe.html">Who We Are</a>)</p>

<p><b>Teaching for a School of One </b> </p>

<p>New Classrooms grew out of a New York City pilot program called <i>School of One</i>, an educational experiment designed to provide personalized, effective, and dynamic classroom instruction. New Classrooms’ <i>Teach to One</i> program targets individual students’ learning needs via comprehensive surveys and daily check-ins that generate a student profile and inform a "learning algorithm." The algorithm considers not only the areas where a student most needs to focus, but also variables such as available physical space, noise levels, optimal class size, and technological requirements for different kinds of content. From this, it generates a unique daily schedule for each student and teacher—suggestions like which students should sit together for the day, what problems each student should work on, and what lessons the teacher should cover next. This blended learning model leverages technology to mechanize some of the routine aspects of teaching (e.g., grading), without stifling the human side. Teach to One doesn’t necessarily make helping students learn any easier, but it can free people to become better teachers overall.</p> 

<p><b>Partners in Education</b> </p>

<p>New Classrooms partners with a variety of schools—charters, independent schools, and traditional districts—to manage the databases and systems, and provide logistical support and professional development for the Teach to One schools. For the 2014-15 school year, the Teach to One math program has been introduced in 16 schools across six states. Though it might be easy to implement the Teach to One model as an off-the-shelf product, the goal of New Classrooms is to deliver a truly personalized instructional program—one that is as customized to the particular culture and needs of the partner school as it is customized for the individual student. </p>
