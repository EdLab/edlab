<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sat-up-current-new-sat-exam/id582725370?mt=8r">SAT Up</a> is a Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) study aid application. Gaining admission to college is tough these days. Being accepted by your first choice college is more difficult than ever before. SAT Up offers another tool to help you succeed on this important exam. </p>
 
<p>SAT Up includes a library of practice questions written by expert tutors for all three SAT sections—math, critical reading, and writing. Detailed solutions help eager students review incorrect answers to improve performance. </p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>One of the most welcome aspects of SAT Up is its portability, similar to some of the seemingly endless SAT apps available. No more dragging around heavy SAT prep books—you can study anytime, anywhere. This ease of mobility can be especially helpful for students who have long commutes and already schlep around mini-mountains of textbooks for class. Also, SAT Up can be useful for those who like to review between classes, or on-the-go. Given the diversity of subject matter covered on the SAT, from the finite detail of math to more open-ended critical reading and writing sections, the app’s adaptive feedback is useful to those who need more guided assistance. SAT Up provides an introductory diagnostic exam to pinpoint student strengths and weaknesses. Daily "workouts" (e.g., SAT practice questions) based on this diagnostic exam should help test takers improve their performance by focusing on problem areas. Also, for those who need more encouragement to study, SAT Up offers a parent share feature so they can monitor progress.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although there are many practice questions, heavy SAT studiers may rapidly deplete the question bank. The adaptive feedback is useful, but it could be more responsive by providing more detailed information to identify individual errors as well as common patterns of response. Further, although you can access expert help, that is part of the premium account. Finally, there is little multimedia provided in SAT Up, especially when compared to today’s generation of apps that are more tricked out. The SAT Up interface is basically page-after-dizzying-page of text. However, given the nature of this test, a more text-centered user experience is to be expected.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>SAT Up is a great portable app that could play a complementary role in anyone’s SAT prep regime. However, every app has its limitations. Unlike more established SAT programs such as Kaplan or Princeton Review, SAT Up does not have an established record of successful graduates, nor the benefit of a lengthy user feedback period to tweak the content and its delivery. If you learn best online or using mobile devices, SAT Up could offer valuable exam preparation assistance. However, if you are more of a pencil-and-paper learner, you may want to invest in old fashioned prep books, classes, or a personal tutor. The SAT is the mother of high-stakes tests and you may not want to rely exclusively on one study method. Prepare accordingly.</p>
