<a href= "http://bit.ly/1yihDxR">Ainissa Ramirez, Ph.D.</a> is a science evangelist who is passionate about getting the general public excited about science.  She is the co-author of <i>Newton’s Football</i> and the author of <i>Save Our Science</i>. Dr. Ramirez was previously a mechanical engineering professor at Yale University for ten years, where <i>MIT’s Technology Review</i> named her as one of the world’s 100 Top Young Innovators. At Yale, she was the director of the award-winning science lecture series for children called <i>Science Saturdays</i>, and was the host for two science video series called <i><a href=" http://bit.ly/1D1F8uW">Material Marvels</a></i> and <i><a href=" http://bit.ly/112a40e">Science Xplained</a></i>. She has served as a science advisor to the American Film Institute, WGBH/NOVA, AAAS, and has written for <i>Time</i> magazine. She currently serves as the CEO of Science Underground, a science education-consulting firm, which helps schools, cities, and countries prepare students for the 21st century. She received her doctorate from Stanford University and her bachelor’s from Brown University, both in materials science and engineering.</p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>  
I am an African American woman who is trained as a scientist (Ph.D., Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University). So, along with the literature, it is my life’s trajectory that informs me about the leaks in the STEM pipeline and the importance of inspiring and encouraging young people to love STEM from an early age.  I was a research scientist at Bell Laboratories for four years and then a mechanical engineering professor at Yale University for a decade, and had a great career in research.  But it dawned on me after years of hosting a children’s science program that I could make more impact by inspiring children of all ages by making science fun. So, I took the leap into my current work to do just that. This is why I call myself a science evangelist.
<p>
<b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
I believe in the importance of seeing one’s reflection in one’s pursuit.  When I was younger, I got the idea of becoming a scientist from a television program on PBS, which showed a little black girl doing science.  I saw my reflection and it changed my life.  So now in my current work, I try to be a beacon for others by showing them that you don’t have to be pale or male to be a scientist. And, I use my personal story to show that the only admission you need for STEM is a love for it and an ability to work hard. That’s it.
<p>
Also, I have taken on the challenge of translating everyday activities into science. My last foray is the book I co-wrote called <i><a href="http://bit.ly/1D1Ff9O">Newton’s Football</a></i> which looks at the science behind America’s game. With a sports writer, I took on this challenge after learning more people watch the Super Bowl than vote. My mission is to bring science to where people already are.
<p>
<b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
Overall, I sense schools are going to have to embrace some of the new tools out there, such as gamification and others to make STEM fun. (Even though personally, I feel mixed about them.)  But, I also think the school leadership must recognize they play a much more important role in our technological future, particularly in the nurturing of human skills.  In an age of Google where information is readily available, we need to encourage learners to be creative problem-solvers, which requires imagination, empathy, and creativity.  There is no app for that and schools can corner the market on providing that for children.
<p>
As for the way that we teach STEM in schools, I think that change is going to happen from the outside in. Science museums, Maker movements, and scouts make STEM irresistible and will make children and parents crave fun STEM in schools. My hope is that this will help to change what schools currently offer. (I spell this out in my short e-book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Save-Our-Science-Generation-Scientists-ebook/dp/B00B7B0G32">Save Our Science: How to Inspire the Next Generation of Scientist</a></i>, which I wrote for TED Books. By the way, I think everyone has an inner scientist, and we must nurture it.)
<p>
<b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> <b>Answer:</b> 
Right now, I go around the globe and speak to audiences and try to inspire them with the importance of knowing STEM.  When I am home, I am writing a book that shows how chemistry and materials played a role in changing society.  
<p> 
My long term goal is to follow in the footsteps of Bill Nye and Neil Tyson, so I’ve got a few projects in the works in that arena too, which include science kits for underserved communities, a science radio program for everyday folks, as well as using songs/rap to teach science.  As you can see, I am trying to lather audiences with fun STEM from every angle.  If people want to join in, they should give me a ring <a href="http://bit.ly/1q9uvya">@ainissaramirez</a>.
<p>
<b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter (if you have a Twitter account)?</b><br>
<b>Answer:</b>
Brain Pickings (<a href="http://bit.ly/1tiC3p3">@Brainpickings</a>), Edutopia (<a href="http://bit.ly/1yiiqyO">@edutopia</a>), and Joanna Manaster (<a href=" http://bit.ly/1xzyTeD">@Sciencegoddess</a>).
