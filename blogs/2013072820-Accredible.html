<p>
<a href="https://www.accredible.com/">Accredible</a> is a platform for creating an online curriculum vitae to broadcast achievements including completing MOOC courses. Similar to online portfolio sites like <a href="https://pathbrite.com/">Pathbrite</a>, Accredible lets users display all of their accomplishments on a single web page. Accredible differs in that it emphasizes MOOC course learning artifacts such as online discussions, papers, and tests. The platform attempts to unify credentialing across different MOOC courses. Users can create different CVs for each subject to show off their learning artifacts from any MOOC courses they have completed. Users can also include information about their social networks and traditional college experience on their CVs.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Accredible has several ways to verify a user’s identity through Facebook, Twitter, or government identification. The learning artifacts that can be added to a user’s profile include quizzes, discussions, badges, certificates of completion, or anything else learners receive from MOOCs. Users can upload any type of file as evidence of what they have learned through MOOCs or traditional schooling. The certifications are aesthetically pleasing and nicely organized, making it easier to conceptualize an overview of all learning artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Learning artifacts can be selected and previewed in the certification, but users must download the artifact to view the entire document. It could be beneficial to have immediate access to documents. If a potential employer is viewing the certification, they may not have the patience to download all the learning artifacts that interest them.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Accredible is a certification platform that emphasizes displaying the learning achievements of MOOC students. As more learning moves online, digital certification is more important as it would be very difficult to display online learning artifacts in paper form. Accredible is one of the many emerging online platforms, including <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/643">Pathbrite</a>, that enable users to display their achievements. It is also similar to <a href="http://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/196">Degreed</a> as the platform attempts to certify learning that takes place outside of traditional schools. Accredible is unique in that it allows users to verify their identity with government issued photo identification. Government identified credentialing may make the online certification more legitimate and acceptable to potential employers.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>Accredible shows off your MOOC achievements.</p>
