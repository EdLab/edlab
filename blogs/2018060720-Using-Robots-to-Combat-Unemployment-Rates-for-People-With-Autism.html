<p>In both the US and UK, <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/news/cutting-edge-robot-could-reduce-autistic.htm">over 80% of adults with autism</a> are unemployed. This statistic isn’t necessarily based on lack of skill, but rather on the difficulty many adults with autism have reading emotions in others. People on the autism spectrum often struggle to read facial expressions and are more likely to misread even the most basic emotions, such as happiness or anger. This can cause difficulties in interactions with coworkers and understanding the requests of supervisors.</p>

<p>To combat this problem, researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland created the socially competent robot, Alyx. Alyx teaches simplified social cues to adults with autism to help them learn which expressive signals matter and which don’t. During a training session with Alyx, an adult learner completes a basic clerical task, then watches as Alyx responds with either approval or disapproval. The participant will learn how to recognize basic facial expressions associated with each feeling, and the research team has confidence that this will translate to real-life circumstances.</p>

<p>Why do you think emotions expressed by a robot are easier for people with autism to read than those expressed by humans? Do you think people will be able to translate Alyx’s emotions to real life application? Join the conversation <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/43855">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:45 Ryan Allen:</b> I would be worried about the efficacy of this robot. I could see it causing more confusion because the robot is so overt while humans are infinitely more subtle, as mentioned in the video. Are they weaning people to the subtleties?</p>

<p><b>@01:58 Dallas Milanovich:</b> While I understand that the simplistic robot face might be less intimidating, making it easier to zero in on certain facial changes and movement, I think this could only exist successfully as a starting point. As mentioned by Ryan above, some people are very expressive, but others are much more subtle in their emotional responses. I worry this wouldn't be very effective for all cases.</p>
