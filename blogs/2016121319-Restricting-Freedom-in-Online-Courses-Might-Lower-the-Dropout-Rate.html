<p>One of the biggest problems facing online learning is the high dropout rate. This is particularly true for free online courses, where 90% of students drop out before completing the course. The researchers in the current study argue that this is the case because of the infinite freedom provided by e-learning: students have access to a tremendous number of course videos and can watch each one an unlimited number of times. Because of this, there is less pressure to concentrate while watching an online course video or to feel motivated to finish the course on a certain timeline.</p>
 
<p>The researchers propose two things to increase concentration and decrease dropout rates in e-learning: restrict accessibility and limit repeatability of online courses. To test their hypothesis, they designed an online course model that created a sense of scarcity and a lack of control. The 103 students taking the faux course were able to choose which videos they wanted to watch, but they could only watch each video one time. In addition, they were unable to pause the video, fast forward, or change the speed.</p>
 
<p>After completing the online courses, most of the students participating in the study felt that the sense of scarcity and lack of control led to increased concentration while watching the videos and greater intention to complete the course compared to past online learning experiences. When the possibility of watching a video again or replaying parts of it was taken away, the students felt pressure to pay attention throughout the entire lecture. The researchers believe that with increased concentration, students will be more likely to learn and less likely to drop a course.</p>
 
<p>The interviews also showed that although concentration increased, students felt frustrated not being able to control the video while watching. The feature they missed the most was being able to pause the video, as this restriction made note taking particularly difficult. In light of this, the researchers propose that while limiting accessibility and control overall benefits an online course, it’s also important for students to have some control (such as pausing a video lecture) to enjoy the learning experience.</p>
 
<p>This study has implications for online video courses and universities that offer online courses. Part of what makes these courses so valuable is their openness and accessibility, but those attributes lose value if students never finish a course. The dropout rate for online courses is huge, and this study proposes a novel solution: restrict accessibility and repeatability, and therefore increase perceived value of the learning experience.</p>
