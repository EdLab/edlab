<br />Participants:
Naomi Clark (NC)—NYU Tisch School of the Arts
Mary Flanagan (MF)—Dartmouth, www.TiltFactor.org 
Joey Lee (JL)—Teachers College Columbia University, Games Research Lab
Sara Cornish (SC)—Games For Change (G4C0
Moderated by: Austin Walker (AW)—games journalist 

What is the relationship between games and diversity/marginalization?
Mary Flanagan (MF): 
-Games provide a different point of view. They model systems and provide opportunities for agency and choice.
-Games can help put someone into a system of identity struggle.
-Games have an interesting power—they are not cold, unemotional systems.
-When we play, we enact the realities of games. Games become worlds. Since 6,000 BC there has been evidence of board games.

Austin Walker (AW): 
-Games are always about learning—you can communicate without being explicit.

MF: 
-Games are about spirituality and fate. 
-It is an ancient part of games that they bring players through spiritual and systemic worlds.

Joey Lee (JL): 
-Games can help you see things from a new perspective.
-Games can help persuade you to consider social issues.
-Ian Bogost came up with the idea of “Procedural Rhetoric” (or simulation rhetoric). It explains that people learn by authoring processes and rules. It also argues that games can make claims about the way the world works in a number of ways (e.g., words, visuals, processes, and models).
-Game life is experienced as a different type of life than real life.
-There are “identity supported games” where players can take on different stereotypes. Depending on how they are made, they can lead to subtle, even damaging, consequences. For example, students can choose to change their appearance to explore things like racial microaggression.

AW: 
-What are students’ reactions to these games dealing with identity/stereotypes?

JL:
-Games can help promote student reflection. For example, Asian American students explore stereotypes through gaming and open up regarding the past (e.g., experiencing a high degree of parental pressure). Some students have opened up regarding suicidal thoughts and other difficult personal issues.

Naomi Clark (NC): 
-Games are powerful tools of expression. Players can use them to articulate their identity.
-As an analogy, think of testing different types of water. Water initially seems the same. However, if you take a vial from two different rivers and compare them, you see different characteristics of water, like color. Similarly, games are good at drawing out elements of a situation, and of the self.

AW: 
-What is the knowledge level of the player when they play these identity games? 
-On a similar note, how comfortable do players feel when they are playing these identity games?
-Also, is it difficult engaging people in Games for Change (G4C)?

Sara Cornish (SC): 
-Games are a way for players to “try on” identities.
-Players just don’t explore race. They also explore issues related to gender, mental illness, homelessness, poverty, etc.
-G4C helps expose people to games. People can play games, listen to creators, empathize with people who experienced game situations, explore narratives, etc.
-The G4C conference involves corporate executives, academics, game players, game makers, students, etc. As such, it is pretty diverse.

JL: 
-Compared to other media, games help you make discoveries about the self in a less preachy way (e.g., explore racist, sexist beliefs in games—MF’s Tilt Factor games do not feel preachy v. other games)

MF: 
-For example, the “Buffalo” game helps explore biases in interesting ways. You draw 2 criteria cards (e.g., male + wizard—people guess “Harry Potter”). Other criteria may be harder to connect, hence demonstrating biases.

AW: 
-Are you always able to separate yourself from your biases?

NC: 
-Biases enter into your games if you become a little lazy. Sometimes you need to bring in some stereotypical elements into your game to make it work. Unfortunately these stereotypes can be used in a shop worn manner. Collaborators are useful to help you if you mistakenly miss your biases. As such, it is useful to have collaborators and friends. And always remember, it is okay to make mistakes

AW: 
-Is there a tension between: (1) popular game mechanics that work v. (2) accessibility in games?
-There is stress between (1) and (2).

NC: 
-There is lots of “stuff” floating in the atmosphere.
-You can filter these things in. Players can invest games with their own meanings and desires.
-That can be useful to achieve one thing (e.g., the “princess” trope—you can subvert it)

SC: 
-In terms of their context, games should be political tools.
-There is a difference between not being racist v. actively working against racism.
-There is a status quo in gaming that we can work against. For example, consumers currently speak $82 billion/year on games so we have an opening.

<p></p>


AW: 
-Should games just exist in the popular space?

SC: 
-We all should take a stand to change the games industry.

JL: 
-There are absent voices in game industry (e.g., in games, women were traditionally the damsel in distress, you normally see more robots than women in games).
-Other stereotypes abound. For example, there is the problematic portrayal of races in games like GTA and Madden.

AW: 
-Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that diversity is the driver of innovation at the Davos conference.
-However, although gaming companies may espouse diversity in their themes, they are much less diverse in terms of their new talent and corporate culture.

MF: 
-Gaming companies often, unfortunately, do not represent diversity in their work force.

AW: 
-Marvel Comics has positive and negative aspects of diversity. For example, Captain America is now black. However, on the creative side, it is still “mostly white dudes.”

MF: 
-As a counter example, USC has the #1 game design program in the company. Over 50% of the students in the MA program are females.

AW: 
-How have tools changed with respect to game making?

MF: 
-There are many ways to make games.
-You can create game cards regarding social issues and human values.
-In Europe, they have widened their game making tool sets. Now you can use prototyping tools and mockups to create games.
-There are also board games and alternate reality games (ARGs).
-Games continue to expand.

JL: 
-Most games are very “caveman” like (e.g. focus on individualism, collecting things, capitalism).
-Instead, hopefully we can focus on other values like sharing, generosity, and peace. They can open up new possibilities.

SC: 
-G4C focuses on the youth education movement and building on the momentum of coding movements.
-G4C focuses on middle school and high school students.
-G4C has focused on civil engagement including partnerships with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), New York Times, Animal Welfare, the NYC Mayor’s Office, etc.
-G4C also focuses on important narratives and apply coding skills through learning.

AW: 
-Could you give examples of games that focus on mental health benefits?

SC: 
-We (G4C) have a Games for Health festival in June.
-It includes neurogaming and other games for health. It also includes games for helping people with diseases and developing empathy.
-Depression Quest allows players to feel the symptoms of depression.
-Forget Me Not allows players to experience Alzheimer’s disease.
-FDA has some of these games in clinical trials.
-Cognito is a company that has built a series of games that allow players to role play and have evidence-based conversations
(e.g., for people suffering from PTSD, spouse speaks to someone with Alzheimer’s, etc.).


MF: 
-There are also games that allow players to manage their health, attitudes, and behaviors.
-I now focus more on evidence collection after working with doctors. They often ask questions like “How does this game work?” “Has this game made opinions change?”
-In the Layoff game, you experience life in an unemployment line. It is called “Charlie Chaplin of the Digital Age.”
-Lumosity, the brain game company, should have conducted studies before making their claims. They were recently fined for not having evidence regarding the type of mental improvement that they claim.
-At G4C, they are asking what’s changing when playing games? How do we know that?
-We conduct randomized experimental studies. For example, we study empathy but we are just at the tip of the iceberg.

MF: 
-We live in an exciting but terrifying time concerning gaming—there are failed games that we thought would be good.
-For example, we created a spatial reasoning game. It included blocks with images. We made 3D shapes that were intended to teach spatial reasoning. Unfortunately the game aggravated spatial reasoning problems and didn’t improve them.
-Also, there was a game titled Spent produced with a church from the southern U.S. It was designed to illustrate that players are struggling with poverty, a lost job, part-time work, compromises, etc. However, when people played the game, it appeared that it caused them to have decreased levels of empathy. For example, they would claim that the impoverished within the game “made wrong choices.”

AW: 
-Who are you making games for—Marginalized groups or the mass market?

MF: 
-I think the only way we can really make impactful games is to think of them for all markets, not just for marginalized groups.
-Making mass market commercial games is an interesting space. Academia is also interesting. 
-The big question is how do we make real social impact?

AW: 
-Can we see games as being “good” although they still have problems within them?

MF: 
-I think so. The spatial reasoning block game, although well intentioned, still does damage in terms of lowering spatial reasoning ability. I think it could be improved cheaply.

NC: 
-I believe MF may be one of the few who cares that their game is damaging v. the other 99% of game makers.

MF: 
-It seems we generally use money to justify the use of a game.

AW: 
-Should we make games expressly for a marginalized population?

JL: 
-One good example is the game titled Gone Home. It is a good game that helps people examine issues but is not explicitly a LGBT game.
-When I create games and they are marketed, I don’t write “Educational Game” on the packaging. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad educational games.

MF: 
-For example, I believe Teachers College professor Charles Kinzer conducted a study regarding the perception of educational video games. In it, there two still frames pulled from a game. One is titled “Educational Game” the other is titled “Entertaining Game.” Although the image was the same, participants perceived the “Educational Game” to be worse.

JL: 
-Also in terms of marginal games, people dismiss niche games.

AW: 
-Is there a problem when making games for marginalized group?
-Is there a tension when not making games for the mass market?

MF: 
-A good game designer is in touch with her audience.
-For example, I was approached regarding a hand washing game at a party (e.g., presumably the game was intended to incentivize hygienic behavior). We later made an interesting prototype. However, you need to know your audience, you have to know who your players are to ensure the games you make are effective and impactful.

NC: 
-I do not think that are underserved markets so much as there are excluded markets.
-Specifically, there are huge swaths of possible gamers who are removed from receiving access to games that would appeal to them. (e.g., games are localized for gamers in Central Africa, etc. instead of being intended for the entire world). Another issue is how to put games, game theories, etc. into the academic space—there is a huge gulf. For example, both the U.S. and Japan cater to specific demographics and, arguably, over-target or over-saturate, these markets.

AW: 
-It seems almost instrumental to expand to underserved markets—they will give you money by making games for them. For example, there is a phenomenon called the Queer Games Scene—this term suggests something more unified, and less diverse than it probably is.
-Many of our panelists seem on the vanguard with respect to development of game design. 
-Do you think that you contribute to the field of games more generally? Do you receive remuneration through games as a medium? Is that important? Or not?

NC: 
-What does a successful game have to have?
-Perhaps we should look to mainstream games and trace back from those ideas.
-For example, in the game Spent (an online game about surviving poverty and homelessness), there is a focus on player agency. Playing this game feeds a need to be the most important person in world. Is there a business model where you can scale up these types of games?

MF: 
-In the tradition of art, you can/should have a voice regardless of market share.
-Instead of market share or profit, you could ask how did an individual/group contribute to art?

AW: 
-(for JL) When you make games regarding racial stereotypes or environmental issues, is the pedagogy different? 
Is there a difference in the way that you create games that explore culture/identity v. those that explore climate science?

JL: 
-For example, the game Eco Chains helps people build resilient food webs. Another game, Greenify (later known as Eco Coin) incentivize players to earn coins.
-When I joined a project on climate change, at the time, I was not living an ecofriendly lifestyle. As such, how do I reach someone like me? Are there gaming strategies to shift your identity so that you care about issues like sustainability (e.g., within the game we bake in values like stewardship or not killing other people’s animals; if we die, we all die together, etc.)

AW: 
-(to SC) How do you evaluate G4C? How do you integrate games into G4C?

SC: 
-G4C brings together a broad and diverse community. For example, game creators represent other people’s identities to reach the broadest possible audience.
-We attempt to make an impact as broadly defined. We try to reach new audiences and give voice to those who we normally don’t think about in more popular settings. 
-We try to engage in conversations that challenge mainstream developers.
-We include an arcade that features games as well as smaller events and panels to include a broad diversity of voices.
-Games aren’t just for kids. There are many ways to create, change, and challenge beliefs.

AW: 
- How do you integrate games into teaching space? This is a big question that I struggle with.

MF: 
-I read and write more and more research papers. I find them fascinating.
-There are currently many approaches available (e.g., teach with World of Warcraft). This game may not be good for empathy, but that doesn’t mean it is not good for other roles (e.g., promoting turn taking, spatial reasoning, etc.). As such, we can use games in a variety of different ways. Unfortunately, some studies are not done so well…

JL: 
-I’m not sure that with respect to progressive games that there is a capital “G” game—a game that is a magic bullet (e.g., Minecraft). Some games have outcomes that are much more nuanced (e.g., see the work of Kurt Squire). 
-Also, if you have problems with one specific game, you can repurpose/mod games. In short, it’s not just about finding an appropriate educational game. Perhaps you can find games that are not explicitly educational.

NC: 
-I believe that all games teach/learn. However, they may not teach/learn what we want players to be taught or learn. 
-However, there is still hope. For example, perhaps users could play another game before (or after) Spent to improve empathy or promote other positive outcomes.
-As a piece of advice, I would tell teacher to make sure you actually play the game you use in class although I acknowledge that this takes time.
-In short, there are no easy answers…
