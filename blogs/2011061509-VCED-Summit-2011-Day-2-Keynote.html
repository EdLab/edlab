          <p>
            I have no idea who the speakers are but here is the advice they imparted (I think one of them was Fred Wilson):

- Don't hedge too much.

- Don't go too disruptive before you get some traction.

- International vs. US: There are more opportunities outside the US. 

<a href="http://www.edmodo.com/">Edmodo</a> is a good model. 

Homeschooling is another market opportunity.

Question: What kinds of start-ups are VCs looking for?

There is no one type. There is a lot of good stuff out there. We just have not seen them packaged up well. 

And these places need to think about ways to support rapid adoption.

We also need some evidence to see that it is working

--

Schools need good technology for technology-based solutions and they want no cost. 

Advertising - Everyone thinks this means banner ads but there are other ways too (e.g., sponsorship). 

Since most of the audience members are VCs it seems like the questions are more about how do you find the next hot investment. 

What type of company do you want to be? Mad Magazine or a textbook?

We want each investment we make to be very large and highly used. 33-50 percent of our investments fail. 

Questions: Profit potential vs social good. Are you willing to aceept a smaller return in exchange for social good? NO! we look for the same return characteristics for all investments. Some of our best companies have a social component. And they become media darlings and highly promoted (e.g.,kickstarter, etsy) because these companies make people's lives better. But at the end of the day we invest in them because we think it will make money. 

We like to invest in large networks of engaged users (e.g., peer to peer networks). They believe this model will work in education. 

Investors: It is better to not ask for money. just ask for time: 30 minutes to explain simply what you want, then then ask to meet again in 6 months to show you what I got. 

"If you ask for advice you will get money. If you ask for money you will get advice"
