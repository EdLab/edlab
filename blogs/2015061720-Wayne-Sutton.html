<b>How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?</b><br>
Every step of my professional journey has played a role in preparing me for what I do now. I started off as a graphic designer years ago and that was really the foundation of saying that I like creating, building, and designing things. From there, I got into IT and at that time, it was self-taught. Before my higher education, there was just a desire that I had for entrepreneurship, for creativity, for building and being curious and looking at problems and realizing that I can build, create or design something and solve that problem.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
My company is called BuildUp and we focus on education, access to network, capital, and mentorship to underrepresented groups. With BuildUp, we provide technical training and are launching an online education platform. We also have an offline accelerator for entrepreneurs. We see this as part of the hybrid model of education for entrepreneurs. It’s not just online, it’s online and offline, it’s curriculum-focused and then you get to mentors, teachers, and advisors to help you become successful. We look at how education has changed and America as a whole is using technology. A lot of people are using tablets and iPhones and MOOCs and I think it is this hybrid model that is going to be successful. </p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
It’s interesting that you say the years ahead. Everybody has a smartphone, and access to high speed Internet in America, but not around the world. Billions of people still don’t have Internet access. So think about global trends and innovation and what is going to really impact education. It is going to be more of a penetration of smartphones, broader and faster Internet access. We are already seeing universities offer free online education and there are a handful of great education platforms from Khan Academy to Coursera. We are also already seeing online applications becoming accredited institutions so that in itself, the more widespread adoption of smartphones and tablets, faster Internet access, more online education from credible resources, is going to have a huge impact on the entire system. </p>

<p>Starting from K-12, people are going to be learning faster and learning more at an early age because they have access to more information. They don’t have to wait to go to school to get an education and as they get to the teenage years, they don’t have to wait to go to college or pay to go in debt to go to college. So that is going to dramatically change the entire education system from a backwards perspective. It is not going to change it from a policy, legal, and government perspective. The change will be more of a generational one, as students will be learning at a faster rate than the demand. </p>

<p><b>What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br> 
BuildUp.vc is currently in the process of launching technical workshops and an accelerator in September in San Francisco. This is also the next big project. We are in the impact business because our goal is to help create successful tech entrepreneurs who happen to be from an underrepresented group. We can help other companies be successful. They can hire individuals, create culture, change their lives and help them be successful. They can impact the economy and create jobs. So that is our goal with BuildUp. </p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
I've been on Twitter since 2006 and I don’t use it as much as before. I push more than I actually consume. I follow mostly tech news.
