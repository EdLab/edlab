            <img class="size-full wp-image-135 alignleft" title="TCSGReview_concepticon" src="http://openmadang.wordpress.com/files/2009/10/tcsgreview_concepticon.jpg" alt="TCSGReview_concepticon" width="195" height="185" />CNET and Wired review tech products.  Zagat, Michelin Guide, MQRE, Rotten Tomatoes, the New York Times, Amazon, and Yelp review restaurants, movies, books, and many more through their group's own  or individual participant's lens.

Can we at EdLab review stuff also? Yes, why not.

There isn't any major media outlet that specializes on reviewing educational tech products and web-based solutions.  One that comes close is  <a href="http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewCompositeReview.htm?id=387164">MEROLT</a> (Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching)'s peer review.  But still, it doesn't seem to make the kind of preliminary evaluations that students, parents, educators and school administrators would find helpful if they were contemplating on which tool to use.

So I tried to design a review criteria based on observing popular review sites mentioned above and call it, for the time being, <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The CSG Review</strong></span>.  The entire rubric is open for feedback.  I'm particularly curious about what you think of focusing on<span style="color: #000000;"> <strong>design</strong></span> (i.e. factual rundown on design features) and <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>pedagogy</strong> </span>which provides comparatively a more subjective assessment on how the design decisions reflect on different instructional methods.  Another concern: did I benchmark on CNET too heavily by naming my summary points as Plus, Minus, and Equals?  Please also entertain the idea that if this rapid review-edit-publish system takes off in full force, all of us can be reviewers and editors for essentially any product or solution that deems useful in teaching and/or learning.

The first one on table just so happens to be Voice Thread.  I realize that it was indeed ambitious of me since it is already well-known and bloggers I follow have highly praised it before.  However, my review begs to differ.

<strong>VOICETHREAD (www.voicethread.com)</strong>
Tags: video, annotation, discussion, multimedia presentation

<strong>Design score</strong>: 3 out of 5
<strong>Pedagogy score</strong>: 1.25 out of 5

<strong>Plus</strong>: Who says everyone has to give feedback by typing? Users can comment via a phone, webcam, microphone and they can even sync doodling on the original medium with voice. The entire voicethread can also be easily shared with those outside the private community by plugging it into Moodle and Wordpress platforms.

<strong>Minus: </strong>Feedback in various media types are great, but where's the "INTER-" in interaction if threaded discussions are not supported? There's also little analytic to evaluate user participation.

<strong>Equals: </strong>A great tool for sharing multimedia presentations and collecting feedback in a secure private setting. Be prepared to do some organic assessment of the actual comments and participant interactions on your own, if you're in it for more than just hearing what everyone thinks.
