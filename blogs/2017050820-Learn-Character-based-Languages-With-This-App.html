<p><a href="https://www.mondlylanguages.com">Mondly</a> is an app for learning languages that experiments with incorporating character-based languages and innovative platforms to its model. Although Mondly has <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2017/02/15/mondlys-vr-language-learning-app-is-the-closest-thing-to-actual-immersion/#.tnw_YSDoLpxc">a new VR app</a> that aims to give users a truly immersive language experience, this review focuses on its regular app that you can download on any device.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The aspect that makes Mondly stand out from other linguistic learning apps is its inclusion of languages that don’t rely on the Latin alphabet. These include languages such as Arabic, Hindi, Thai, and Russian (I tested the app with Arabic). Altogether, the app has learning platforms for 32 languages. It features an adaptive learning platform, meaning that it identifies which skills you have mastered and which remain problematic, then continues to reinforce the latter as you progress through the various levels.</p>
 
<p>Like most language learning apps, Mondly is full of different activities to ensure variety in a user’s linguistic diet. Mondly seems to focus primarily on building vocabulary skills, so users can choose among different categories, such as family and public transportation, that are most relevant to them. It also includes personal statistics mapping out your progress in the app and a leaderboard highlighting the most active users, whom you can connect with on the platform.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Despite the fact that Mondly has multi-tier levels of difficulty, I still felt overwhelmed in the beginner’s level of Arabic, a language I was completely unfamiliar with. The app would better accommodate learners if it first introduced them to individual letters and sounds in languages that use non-Latin alphabets.</p>
 
<p>In addition, the user interface of Mondly is not as aesthetically pleasing as other language learning apps. Often, there were so many options available on the screen that I wasn’t sure how to progress. For instance, there didn’t seem to be a scaffolded system to learn grammar, as the platform seemed to focus mostly on vocabulary growth.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning a language that uses a non-Latin alphabet, Mondly provides a reliable platform to get started. Note, however, that the app is not free; a one-year subscription to the basic level costs $9.99, and there are also additional lessons you can purchase. Mondly could be a particularly good tool for traveling, supplementing a class, or replacing mindless phone games. Bonne chance!</p>
