          <p>
            A French schoolteacher has officially been banned from the Internet, or at least, from having his own internet connection. Why you ask? Because he didn't know how to secure his Wifi.

Several nations, including France, have a three strikes policy regarding illegal downloading and now this 54 year old teacher received his final strike for downloading Iron Man 2. What makes <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/news/94406/school-teacher-could-take-hadopi-to-court-over-false-disconnection/">this story</a> particularly absurd is that the man in question doesn't even know how to download video from the internet. It seems someone hacked into his wireless internet connection and the schoolteacher, who seems fairly un-techsavvy, was unable to lock down his connection after his first and second warnings.

Now there's definitely a case to be made about using technology one doesn't understand and can't control, but in this case, who's really to blame? Should the schoolteacher have known better? What about his neighbor, who actually did the illegal downloading, or maybe the ISP for providing service to someone who didn't know how to use it properly? Is this the French government's fault for being overly harsh? Should we blame Paramount for making a movie so irresistible that people just can't help but download it? What about his town's zoning committee for placing houses close enough together to allow wifi hacking? Obviously none of these people are really at fault (and I admit I've crossed over into absurdum a little), but the French schoolteacher just seems to be the last link before the chain is broken so he's left with the burden. 

Is this fair? Is this just? And really, who should have the authority to decide?
