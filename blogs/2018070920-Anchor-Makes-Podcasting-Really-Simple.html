<p>Though we are in the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19376529.2015.1083363?journalCode=hjrs20">Golden Age</a> of podcasting, starting your own show can be quite difficult. You must know how to record, edit, and upload the audio to popular platforms. <a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor</a> is an app geared towards simplifying this process. This free tool promises to let anyone become a host, creator, or storyteller, without requiring the complicated technical know-how. </p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Anchor really does simplify the process of creating a podcast. All you need to do to create your own show is to download the app and sign up for free. Through the app or website, you can easily record audio from your phone or computer microphone. Recording segments is very simple.</p> 

<p>The service is not just a glorified voice recorder, as it offers a range of other useful features to improve show quality. You can add messages from listeners and record with guest hosts from across the world. Anchor includes transitions that can be placed between segments, along with free intro and closing music. The app also connects with your personal iTunes and Spotify accounts so you can add custom music or sounds.</p> 

<p>For me, Anchorâ€™s ability to share podcasts is its best feature. I already have editing skills, but I still find uploading content to Apple Podcasts or the Google Play Store to be challenging. Anchor easily syncs your channel to these popular podcast platforms, so that anyone can listen to your show.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The editing and show creation functions are much easier through a computer than through the phone app. The design of the phone app is not as intuitive and has some annoying quirks. For instance, when building a show on the phone, the recording function is in one tab, while the rearrange function is in another. Show-building becomes cumbersome as you hop back and forth between the functions.</p> 

<p>Additionally, on the phone, the app constantly has a popup asking you if you want to publish your episode. This popup even occurs after simply adding a three-second intro. Anchor should have the ability to recognize what is publishable. With the frequency of publishing requests, it seems like the service has an incentive to push quantity over quality. </p> 

<p>Related to issues in quality, Anchor offers little to no editing. They have <a href="https://medium.com/anchor/rethinking-audio-editing-on-mobile-684d754c6460">defended this choice</a>, and added some minor editing functionality; however, I believe this is a recipe for bad podcasting. They should include more editing functions to remove dead air or other sound blips.</p> 
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Anchor truly democratizes the podcasting process. With this tool, anyone can record and upload a show. However, there are some simple tweaks that the company should make in order to improve the quality of shows produced through the service.</p>
