            <I>Design Team- Includes any members of the group that helped produce Pearson's Mastering tools and was present at the seminar</I>.


Was Physics not your strong point in college?  Did thoughts of photonuclear reactions keep you up at night?  If only you had had the Pearson series of interactive online learning tools (MasteringPhysics, MasteringBiology, MasteringAstronomy, and MasteringAstronomy), maybe test days wouldn't have haunted your dreams. The goal of the tools is to increase students' comprehension levels and test scores as they progress through the programs.  Unlike professors, the programs are available 24/7 and will never lose patience with you (no matter how many times you forget that wacky acceleration formula).   Jess and I blogged about the details of yesterday's Pearson design team presentation.  All in all, it was an informative meeting that definitely left people asking, “What's the next step?”–a question that will keep many of us busy long after the tasty yogurt parfaits have been eaten (see pic). And yes, this is a very lengthy post.

Presentation by David Kokorowski, member of Pearson interactive online tools design team

<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=pointscreen.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/pointscreen.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>
 
He discusses his educational background in science (atomic physics).  He noticed 3 things: 1) At the lab next to his, a professor was working on stuff that would win him the Nobel Prize (in atomic physics) 2) His colleagues were deeply involved in teaching and 3) There were people in the office that weren't teaching… they were a education research group. 

 

He told us the story that was to become the background of the Pearson Mastering series.  His colleague, David Pritchard  was struggling with certain students- those who needed to take his courses but didn't want to and/or those who didn't have the background necessary to learn it.  He found normal lectures didn't cut it so most of these students ended up coming to his office hours which turned into one on one tutoring–not a very time efficient alternative. He needed something better… something involving technology. He wanted to mix one on one tutoring and homework in order to increase comprehension.  He came up with “an intelligent tutor” that utilizes the knowledge of expert teachers instead of artificial intelligence. The program is based on Socratic methods using hints.  The 3 types of hints used: outline of steps, declarative hints, Socratic hints. Students who don't need hints do not have to go through them, allowing them to move at a quicker pace. This is an advantage of the program.

<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=Pritchard.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/Pritchard.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Recap of core of philosophy: aim of project is to emulate one on one tutoring in an online environment–this tutor is available 24/7. Goal= get every student to the mastery level

 
Key features of program

-hints are available and feedback is given to students if they get a wrong answer. 

-Instructor benefits= automatic grading, diagnostics at-a glance, students and class-level learning audit, time and difficulty calibrated content, two-way learning (as much as student is learning from content and interaction, instructors can learn about students from the interaction data; i.e. “what's the most difficult concept for my  students this week?')

 

He goes over the product timeline. 
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=timeline.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/timeline.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

 

People have asked him, “How can you be sure that this method will work outside of physics (based on evidence that it has been effective in physics)?”

-A lot more homework is assigned in physics than in chemistry and biology (according to Kokorowski, who bases his statement on a sample group of biology teachers who said that all of their students need to spend more time outside of class on bio work).

-The homework on Classweb and BlackBoard doesn't <I>teach</I>students, it acts more of a check off list

-Pearson solution- Add more flexible training as to how teachers will incorporate more homework. 

 
<B>10:46</B>

President Fuhrman points out that early research was funded by NSF

 
Kokorowski gives a demo of the product, MateringPhysics
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=pendulum.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/pendulum.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

-Example problem- ballistic pendulum

-He purposefully types in a wrong answer. Feedback box pops up- indicates what's wrong with their answer but doesn't tell him what to do next so he looks at the hints. 

-There is a discussion on the rationale behind the hints.  One person argues that some students will look at all of the hints, even after they get the right answer to reinforce learning but it seems as though the program assumes that students will stop reading hints as soon as they figure out the answer. 

 

Example from MasteringBiology- BioFlix
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=glob.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/glob.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>
<I>You might not be able to tell, but this is a picture of one of the video examples.  It is an animal's cell</I>

- Goal of activities= don't let students be passive learners, make them more active. For example, instead of simply showing a short clip, they quiz students on aspects of the clip and the larger concepts surrounding it. 

-It is possible for students to go back and review their work

-Pearson is committed to testing with live users (usability testing), whether informal or formal. 

-The grade book allows teachers to learn a lot about students and their interaction with the program. The lower the score, the deeper the red (my grades would be crimson)

 

<B>11:45</B>

Another clip of David Pritchard

-His original criterion was that of mastery learning (90% of students through to right answer).

Main Presenter David Kokorowski continues to talk about the research that has been done on the Masteringphysics product (most research has been done on this product because it was the first and oldest thus has collected the most data for)
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=screen.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/screen.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

In his discussion a question was raised by Professor Ann Rivet about the nature of content and how they define it. 
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=nosepick.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/nosepick.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

The Design Team responded by saying that they used a combination of textbooks within the field along with the expertise of physicists.
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=lady.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/lady.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>
"One of our aims was to correlate our materials with tests but there is sort of a disconnect because there isn't one science standard;they are different across the country. Biology especially, it is so interesting because it is so big, meaning there are so many branches that someone could be an 'expert' in for example earth science, molecular bio, genetics etc"
The team went further to discuss the idea that "People like to build content of their own and to be able to share content and that is the future of where people want to go. Our goal is not to have a prescribed limited product but one that enables those involved to create and share questions as well." The team said this type of technology does currently exist in some form (to create/share) but it is not as easy as they would like it. Thus this is a direction to work toward developing for the future.

<I>Jess says: This statement that the designers made about making this tool more flexible and innovative by allowing instructors to create and share work is a step in the right direction to making it a more powerful tool than it already is.</I>

<B>1:00</B>

The discussion generated about the creation of the content presented in the tool opened another door dealing with revision, basically how changes are made within the system as a way to update and improve. The system is very informative in it's ability to compile the stats generated by a particular class and display them in graphical form as well as compare them to their National Database (from the Masteringphysics product Pearson has compiled the worlds largest student performance in physics data set in the world.This data set includes all students who have used this tool for a class taken for credit). It also has built in tools for comments by both the instructors and students which they can choose to send to the designers if they feel something needs to be changed.
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=table.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/table.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

One instance that was discussed was the students option to rate every question after they complete it. There are also survey style questions such as "How does this question teach you?". One of the results of this type of assessment showed that many students equate the more difficult questions to be the most helpful.

These comments provide one platform of change but there is also the data that is generated that can provoke change. One specific area the designers study closely is time. The time it took students to take certain questions can allow the developers to identify problem areas with the types of questions or content if enough students are struggling with the same question. They can also adjust the predicted time it should take.


<I> Jess says: Again the ability to provoke change where needed in order to improve and keep updated with the needs of the population you are serving sounds  powerful and like a winning combination. But it also can create a daunting situation as the amount of information generated by the system is in mass amount the man power to make use of the data and the comments is a large job but an important one all the same!</I>

 

<B>1:10</B>

Dave leads the conversation toward using this tool to assess learning behavior. Specific larger research questions he brought up included "How is this an educational research tool?, What new formative assessments can we do with a tool like this?, What does the future look like from this platform? and can we connect our database with larger questions in education for example psychometric models? Can we validate or test them?

<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=screensaver.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/screensaver.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Such questions served as the introduction toward studies that have been conducted. Key areas that have been evaluated so far include Time and Student Learning Behavior assessing the use of hints and the type of problem. A significant conclusion from the study on learning behavior was that the hints are useful to the students. During the studies of time three categories of students emerged; students as Quick Responders, Realtime Solvers (students that worked all the way through the problem) and Delayed Solvers.

 

<B>1:17</B>

Kokorowski gave an overview of one of their studies design. The study was evaluating the use of tutorials.

A population of 400 was separated into 2 groups of equal demographics. Group 1 was given problem A (unprepared-no prior content provided),
then given problem B. Group 2  was given problem B (prepared-provided with prior content experience) then problem A.

When the results were compared there was a 15% higher chance of getting the problem correct in the prepared (experience with prior content on the subject to of the question) vs. the unprepared group.
Paper was referenced online (author Rasil Warnakulasooriya et al. )

<B>Q&A</B>

President Fuhrman asks, “Can a professor find out what hints were useful for their students?”

Answer- Yes. 

 
“Can students monitor their own progress, i.e. modify level of difficulty”

Answer- Not at this time. Math program allows students to create their study plan

 

“Are there items that represent a sort of benchmark? If a student gets one particular answer right it means they understand a concept?” 

Answer- Pearson hasn't looked at that yet. 

 
Question regarding correlation with teaching styles and approaches of instructor.

Answer- no conclusive data as of yet. Teachers are asking, “This technology is the way I want to teach, what textbook comes with it?” instead of other way around

 
Question regarding the possibility of pre-building agendas for teachers so that they wouldn't have to keep recreating them.

Answer- Pearson allows teachers to maintain their own agendas


<B>1:23</B>

Dave finished the presentation slides and turned the floor over the Mary-Ann who suggested to move foward by looking toward next steps to be taken (directed at President Susan Fuhrman)
<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=podium.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/podium.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

President Fuhrman responded by saying she sees a lot of research potentials and is interested specifically in the partnerships with members of the Teacher's College Community.
This suggestion is received well by the design team. They want to know what specific interests exist so future project collaborations can be organized and set up based on fields of interests and putting the correct people in contact.
Fuhrman voices a specific concern to quickly come up with high school science teacher preparation materials as a need and would like to know the ways this tool can be related. She turns to Professor Rivet of the Science Education Department who proposes if there is a way to use this tool as a way to aid high school teachers in teaching then it would be useful, what that looks like would have be worked out because of the pedagogical aspect that is missing from the tool and there needs to be a balance. She also expanded the conversation to include applications abroad for uses of this tool when teachers are expected to teach content that is out of their expertise this could be a tool to help teachers. As well as in situations when there isn't access to a live teacher.
Fuhrman then suggests adaptive instructive techniques as another idea and brings to the table creating software and extends these thoughts toward the Edlab. There are comments about Web 2.0 integrations and opportunities to use the data that is produced by their system. This sparks one of the design team members to present ideas where by using technology like cellphones to outsource this tool when teachers are not available as one example of new software needed.

 
This idea, of no teacher present, provokes some comments about this tool, "this is meant to be a supplement to a physics class, right?" one of the faculty in attendance states. The design team concurs but does promote the idea as an interesting approach to learning and admits the technology and tool itself is not at that capacity today but maybe in the future it could be.


<I> Jess says: This is a very relevant issue in the discussion of what education looks like in the future, is it a place that holds true to the classic model of every classroom with an expert teacher guiding the class?</I>

 

<B>1:38</B>

For the last twenty minutes of the presentation Mary-Ann navigates us through her Mymathlab page and shows how it is a useful tool to use. The goal of the program is by making the technology as easy as possible so one can just focus on doing the math.

<a href="http://s441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/?action=view&current=widershot.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq138/EdLabPics/widershot.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Key features include-

    * An example tab in the tool bar for people to obtain help by looking at similar problems

    * A video linked in of the teaching of the problem in case it is easier to learn in an audio/visual way

    * Ask your instructor questions by sending them email 

Comments from students that have used it include "It's not intimidating it gives you the feedback and is private for everyone so I can look at things over and over and not feel pressure".

Parents seem to respond well because it is like a tutor.


One important comment she made dealt with the resistance with teaching using technology and the hope to get over this fear/under use is to create a forum for the success stories. She showed us a page that those who have had success go onto and share their stories for others to adopt,learn from and adapt for their own classrooms.


<I> Jess says: This is another pressing issue that faces teachers today in their choice of pedagogical style. How can technology fit into my classroom? What are the right tools to be using? Are common questions teachers today are faced with.

I couldn't help but think of this tool presented today as an example of an influential technology tool but it is how we convert this positive idea into action that is imperative. How can we encourage the use of these types of products and give the support to teachers who could benefit from using them? That is the question at large and should be the next step in the plan of action to continue to encourage a synchronous relationship between technology and teaching in classrooms.</I>


<B>1:53</B>

Mary-Ann Finishes her presentation, she reviews follow up and wants to set up times and contacts to talk about research.

Everyone is thanked and the session ends at 1:57pm.

Some members stay and continue to discuss questions with the design team individually.



<I>You made it through! Thanks for your attention!
