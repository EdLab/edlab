<p><a href="https://www.touchdevelop.com/">TouchDevelop</a> is a mobile app creation platform developed by Microsoft. It features a web editor that allows users to write and edit their code conveniently on most mobile devices. Positioned between popular educational programming environments such as <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/868">Scratch</a> that use blocks and a graphical editor to represent and edit code, and professional programming languages that rely on script writing, TouchDevelop has a semi-structured editor that takes care of the syntax for the learners but represents their code in text. The simplified programming process makes it easier for novice programmers to tap into  the powerful functions and affordances of mobile devices such as accelerometers and GPS. Learners can share their apps with others online via designated web links and publish them in the Windows Store.</p> 

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The code editor automatically suggests the most popular actions and commands that learners might want to use after any of their inputs; instead of writing complete code from scratch, learners first choose what they want to do by clicking the online command keypad. This design makes it easier to write programs on touch screens. Learners who enjoy creating games or apps through popular educational programs such as Scratch or <a href=" https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1199">App Inventor</a>, but are frustrated by mobile limitations, might be excited to see that all apps and games built through TouchDevelop can be shared easily with friends and family on tablets and smart phones. When users have syntax errors in their code, suggested corrections will be automatically shown one line below the error code to help learners fix the errors.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>TouchDevelop’s semi-structured, automatically suggested code writing interface might be more efficient for experienced programmers, but the system might be difficult for beginning programmers to understand. The automatic suggestions may not help learners understand syntax and the platform layout is a little confusing. Similar limitations can be found in the step-by-step tutorials for beginners. The tutorials walk learners through each line of code with an explanation of the code’s action and assign hands-on assignments to write programs, but without a systematic overview of basic syntax learners may copy code and produce amazing beginner apps without understanding the way apps are built in the real world. </p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>As people spend more time on mobile devices than desktops and laptops, learning platforms that run on tablets and smart phones will be in high demand. TouchDevelop meets the increasing needs of learning code on mobile devices through its touch-friendly, cloud-connected web editor. Although its current interface is not easy to navigate and learn (see also <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/704"
>this study</a> of the system), TouchDevelop is a pioneer in exploring new paths to learn programing on the go.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>TouchDevelop lets users develop and share mobile apps on touch screens!</p>
