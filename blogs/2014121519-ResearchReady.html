<p><a href="http://www.researchready.com/">ResearchReady</a> is an online learning platform offering courses to K-12 and college students on research methods. Inspired by the success of their citation platform, EasyBib, the team at ResearchReady created a module that offers learners a comprehensive research curriculum intended to help students succeed in their academic research endeavors. These courses are aligned with national standards such as Common Core, ISTE, ACRL, and AASL and cover everything from developing a research topic to teaching students how to avoid plagiarism. Lessons are created by in-house librarians and are designed to help address and refine skills necessary for successful scholarly research and career endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>This is platform is an excellent resource for educators, students, and librarians alike. 
ResearchReady provides a "ready-made" curriculum for all major steps in the research process and also gives educators and librarians an assessment tool to monitor and analyze student progress through each course. Topics are broken down by course and within each course are engaging PowerPoint lessons designed to make the learning process interesting and entertaining. Each lesson also has a closing quiz to review the important steps in the research process. Additionally, educators can create their own courses and lessons right on the platform. ResearchReady is fully customizable, allowing educators to modify lessons and curriculum in order to fit their school’s needs. The platform is accessible on any device with an Internet connection. </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The process for customizing lessons is slightly cumbersome and confusing. Essentially, users have to create a "copy" of the lesson they want to edit and then remember to switch the original course’s display to "off" and the copy’s to "on." Although users can change the slide order within lessons, they cannot change the lesson order within the course, limiting some of the course customization opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>ResearchReady is a great tool for educators in search of a comprehensive, engaging way to teach research techniques. Courses are available for K-12 and college students and include quizzes to test learners on their understanding. Features like the "Website Evaluator" and student assessment board make this tool a unique asset for research training.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p> 
<p>ResearchReady makes better students.</p>
