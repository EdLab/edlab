<p><i>"GIGTANK is the world’s only startup accelerator where entrepreneurs can test and launch high-bandwidth business ideas on a fully-functional 1 Gbps network. With Internet speeds that run 100x faster than the national average, Chattanooga offers entrepreneurs the opportunity to innovate on the broadband platform of the future."</i> (from <a href="http://www.thegigtank.com/gigtank/">GIGTANK website</a>)</p>

<p>Even those unfamiliar with Tennessee will know of Nashville, the "Athens of the South" and home of Taylor Swift, but up-and-coming Chattanooga might give that famous town a run for its money. Once labeled the "<a href="http://livable.org/livability-resources/best-practices/447-the-city-of-chattanooga-tennessee">dirtiest city in America</a>", four billion dollars in outside investment has led Chattanooga to a sustainable, and technologically-advanced, renaissance.</p>

<p><b>The Fiber of Success</b><br>
What is all the excitement about? It has something to do with the label <a href=" http://www.thegigcity.com/">GigCity</a>. Chattanooga offers one-gigabit-per-second fiber internet service to each and every one of its residents. Not only that, it is the first city in the Western Hemisphere to do so. Installed by EPB, the municipal electric and telecommunications board that has grown into a global brand, the network in Chattanooga has the most advanced internet grid in the nation and they are putting it to work to advance technology. One of the ways GigCity is taking advantage of this grid system is with their incubator <a href="http://www.thegigtank.com/gigtank/">GIGTANK</a>.</p>

<p><b>Transforming a Tech Town</b><br>
The tank boasts specially designed tools to help launch entrepreneurs into a "hyper-connected world." GIGTANK is currently preparing for its fourth 12-week accelerator program called GIGTANK2015. The experience offers "seed stage startups […] tools, capital and connections to go to market." Along with the obvious components of an incubator experience, GIGTANK2015 also offers free housing, free work space, and free perks, like gym membership for the duration of the program, for all participants. According to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/11/chattanooga-gigabit-network/">Wired magazine</a>, ten GIGTANK startup teams are being given $15,000 by a collective of investors and businesses. Whoever comes up with the best business idea will get $100,000 and students are able to win up to $50,000.</p>

<p>The Huffington Post listed Chattanooga as one of eight places in its article, "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/11/you-might-be-living-in-th_n_6250674.html">You Might Be Living In The Next Silicon Valley</a>." The technology advantage offered by GIGTANK has the potential to attract startups in every sector, but it might be a particularly great place for an educational revolution. Though many American cities are planning fiber access of their own, Chattanooga's fast, cheap, and ubiquitous internet and the businesses and mentors it attracts could help students across the socioeconomic spectrum get a <a href=" http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/27/chattanooga-touts-transformation-into-gig-city/?page=all">tech jump</a> on their peers in other cities.</p>
