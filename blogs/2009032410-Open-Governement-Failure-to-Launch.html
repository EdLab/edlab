            It looks like things are getting pretty ugly.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/opinion/23krugman.html?_r=1&em">Paul Krugman</a> has little confidence in the Obama rescue plan, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/geithner-unable-to-escape_b_178006.html">Huffinton calls for the dismissal of Geithner</a>.  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/26793903/the_big_takeover/print">A Rolling Stone article</a> finds that by "creating an urgent crisis that can only be solved by those fluent in a language too complex for ordinary people to understand, the Wall Street crowd has turned the vast majority of Americans into non-participants in their own political future."  This trend is truly tragic in the sense that we are in an age of great possibilities for open government through the use of digital communications technology, but we are seeing a greater shift towards an "insider culture" and away from a participatory culture.  When people do actually want to participate these days, you often hear it being dismissed as "populism" (e.g., if you don't have a PhD in economics from MIT or Harvard, please keep to yourself).  The best hope I think is that once things calm down a bit, and the recession isn't such a new thing, that we will see a return to the Obama-the-candidate-style openness (wishful, I know).

On a positive note, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/190391/page/1">TC should do well in this climate</a>.  I have personally taken people from the banking sector to campus and showed them our swank new admissions office on the third floor of Thorndike and connected them with <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/admissions/">Tom Rock</a>.  It seems like TC is really well positioned to help people who are seeking  "meaningful work" (no guarantee there, but probably a better bet than BofA-Merrill-Wacho-Stearns).
