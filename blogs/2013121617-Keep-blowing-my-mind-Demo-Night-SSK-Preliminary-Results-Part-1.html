We (Brian S. & Kate) sent-out three <b>SSK surveys</b> the week after <b>Demo Night</b>, to invitees, attendees and presenters to gauge their experience and gather feedback.  So far (the surveys close 12/30/13) we have received an 11% completion rate for those who attended and a 7% rate for the survey to those who did not attend.  What feedback stands out from the "attended" batch as most relevant to you?

Here is some of the feedback we received from <b>attendees</b> by question (# sample 67, # of respondents 8): 

<b>Q: What was your favorite aspect of the event? What was most valuable to you?</b>

<ul>
<li>I loved that the event was right in your offices.  It really felt like participants had real access to what you're doing and the people that are doing it.</li> 
<li>Talking to other guests</li>
<li>The whole thing!  I loved the crowd and energy!</li>
<li>I really enjoyed both presentations, for different reasons. I was wildly impressed by the thought about child development that has gone into the Tiggly venture. It is right on the money about how young children learn. The LiquidText will be ground breaking when it arrives. I can see something using the same concepts for managing large projects.</li> 
<li>The presentations. It was great that both presenters included a live demo of their product.</li>
<li>Networking. Good crowd, informal atmosphere, nice space, and good food.</li>
<li>Hearing the presenters and the Q & A</li>
<li>Hearing the two speakers</li>

<b>Q: What themes or subject areas would you like us to cover in a future demo night or\panel discussions? (Ex: Social innovation and education, math apps, early literacy etc.)</b>

<ul>
<li>Keep blowing my mind.</li>
<li>I am interested in information management - software to help keep track of lesson plans, schedules, student information, registration information etc.</li>
<li>How to integrate meaningful ed research into your startup?</li> 
<li>I am primarily interested in technology used in education Edtech startups that are targeted at high-needs students.</li>
<li>Ereading, ontologies, and adaptive learning.</li>
<li>math apps for mobile devices, tablets, desktops</li>
<li>Social innovation and what resources are available!</li>
</ul>

<b>Q: Please nominate a company(s) that you would like to see featured at a future event.</b> 

<ul>
<li>Give us a 10 minute demo of what you guys are working on.  Take us through your website, show us something new that you're producing.</li> 
<li>Just heard about a group called Stagelearn.org  I don't know anything about them but they seem to be new in the education arena.</li>
<li>Brainscape!</li>
<li>I am the communications manager for EdTechLens and I would love to see our product demonstrated once it is through the pilot testing phase. We plan a number of products but the first, Rainforest Journey, is the life science component of the K-5 science curriculum. http://www.edtechlens.com</li>
<li>General Assembly, MindSnacks, SmarterCookie, Panorama, BrightBytes</li>
<li>Sorry, none jumps to mind right now.</li> 
<li>I don't have one in mind</li>
<li>More events by LiquidText!</li>
</ul>

<b>Q:What would you change about the demo portion of the event? How can we make it better?</b>

<ul>
<li>nothing to add</li>
<li>More light, more companies!</li>
<li>I liked how it was done</li>
<li>Allow audience members to tweet in questions during the presentation. This would save a bit of time as presenters could dive straight into answering the questions. Hashtags could be created for the Q&A portion of the event (ex. #EdLabDemoQA</li>
<li>More companies and shorter presentations.</li> 
<li>it was fine as it was for me</li>
<li>Longer QandAs!</li>
</ul>

<b>Q: How can we better facilitate networking after the demo portion of the evening? What other models have you experienced and liked?</b>

<li>Make sure to position someone at the door catching people as they leave.</li>  
<li>Either give participants a chance to stand up and very briefly introduce themselves - or at least ask anyone in the group who wants to - people looking for collaborators or possible clients would probably stand and make a statement this works well at one group event I attend regularly.   The other option is to have topics posted in different corners of the room - or at tables - and have a moderator at each location to facilitate conversation - the goal is to give people a way to start talking to each other. Could do 15 minutes blow a whistle and people switch to a new group for another 10 or 15 minutes. The real goal is to get people talking and learning about each other.</li>
<li>Speed \dating\ session?</li>
<li>I must confess I was shy about the networking portion, assuming that others were possibly much more \tech\ oriented. Maybe will have feedback to give about that next time.</li>
<li>More alcohol helps. I think also identifying who the job seekers are versus the people with open positions ahead of time would be helpful so people know who to seek out before the start of the event. Not exactly sure how this could be effectively implemented at the moment, but the identification is important as many people come to events such as these to network for jobs, look for people the could potentially work with, or find people to fill certain positions.</li>
<li>Was good. Not a fan of too much structure in these things.</li>
<li>Tags for people identifying us as e.g. educator, app designer, app developer, coder, marketer, money wo/man, etc.</li>
