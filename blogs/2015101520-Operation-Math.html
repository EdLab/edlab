<p>A super villain runs amok within <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/operation-math/id487387270?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Operation Math’s</a> exciting world of international espionage. The app’s protagonist is a suave, Sean Connery look-a-like, and all the world's a stage in the Mission Impossible-styled interface. To succeed, you only have one weapon—your math skills—to defuse explosive scenarios. Operation Math is a slick app that spices up a task that has been the bane of student existence since the first schoolhouses were built: math drills. This app makes the drills fun by transforming rote repetition into a seemingly endless array of timed spy missions across the world.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>Operation Math incentivizes play by allowing users to earn spy gear and new uniforms. Dr. Odd is also a compelling antagonist who personalizes the user experience. Operation Math even features places like the Great Barrier Reef and Egyptian pyramids to develop geographical awareness. The app offers over 100 timed missions where users can hone their math skills without boredom while practicing important mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Due to its ability to balance curricular needs with an engaging interface, Operation Math could be used at home and even school to supplement traditional math learning.</p>
 
<p>Stylistically, Operation Math is a delight. Missions have clever titles like "Bomb Apetit" (for Paris), "Hickory Dickory Trickery" (London) and "Funny Deep Dish Disaster" (Chicago). Visual elements are blockbuster beautiful and intuitively located so learners can both play and easily monitor their progress. The narrator’s voiceover matches the written text, providing multimodal ways for engaging users. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Operation Math is a fabulous app with few minor missteps. The pleasant female narrator’s British accent may be difficult to understand due to its accent and speed. More specifically, pressure-filled game play may overwhelm those struggling with their math skills, since adding a strict time limit compounded with pumping music may add extra stress. Although successful play earns new uniforms quickly, new gear takes noticeably longer, which could frustrate students accustomed to rapid rewards from other games. Also, users should be able to choose their gender. Lara Croft would not be pleased.</p>

<p>Displaying user progress records is useful; however, showing previous elapsed mission times within this display could motivate repeat game play to improve completion times. Finally, on a wider pedagogical note, studying mathematics through drills can feel antiquated in a Common Core era celebrating 21st century skills such as critical thinking, innovation and creativity. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Operation Math allows students to enjoy math drills. However, ask yourself two questions. Do you believe the potential boredom of math drills can be outweighed by a great app? And do you think rote math repetition is a worthwhile exercise? If you answered yes to both questions and choose to accept this mission, download Operation Math.</p>
