Sharath and I attended a webinar today hosted by Blackboard about their analytics solution and how clients can use Blackboard Learn data.

The take-away for us was really how open a field data-driven analytics is for learning. Granted, Blackboard does not have access to specific learner information and interaction, as they facilitate content rather than provide it, but the sample indicators we saw were iffy at best. While the analytics package is highly customizable, the key metrics they were showing were interactions (page views and other specific actions) or time on site both compared against the class average of these metrics and grade. In the examples shown (all activity vs. grade is some form or another), there was seemingly no correlation between the two. The scatterplot looked like a ball. It's tough to draw conclusions based on the small sample we saw, but either they chose a poor example of useful data or a poor metric. What I would have been really interesting to know is whether they had previously looked for variables that were predictive of grades and if this drove how they picked their measures. 

It definitely looked like a useful reporting tool from the administrative standpoint, but in the short time we were exposed to the tool, it seemed very difficult to do any analysis about learning.
