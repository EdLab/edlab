          <p>
            I was wondering what other folks think about Learning Management Systems. I've been thinking about this issue with respect to teacher training and induction. Would a learning system that is directed for professionals be exactly the same as a student-oriented system like Blackboard or others? Or, are there some specific quirks about the professional learning process (eg. for engineers, teachers, doctors, etc.) that don't necessarily apply to the student-oriented systems?

I can think of a couple of distinctions. For one thing, I would imagine integrating new research would be essential for a good professional learning system. So, any system for teachers would likely need to have a close integration with online research from Teachers College Record and other rigorous sources. Materials for many student-oriented system would probably draw more from texts, "settled" research papers and other older sources of knowledge. 

I also imagine that a professional learning management system would really need to emphasize communication and information sharing at a much higher level as compared to student learning systems. Teachers, for example, need to have an efficient, well-organized, and searchable system for posting comments and ideas to their community regarding curriculum, student discipline, policy and other topics. 

What are other ideas that you have in this regard? Are there professional learning systems that you have come across in your work? What technologies from the Edlab might be must-haves for such a professional learning systems? Is there any research or example system out there in this regard?
