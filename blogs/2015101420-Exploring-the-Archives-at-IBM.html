<p>Have you ever seen the hands on an old clock "jump" from one position to another? It might not have been your imagination. In the old days, an IBM master clock kept other classroom clocks in sync so they all displayed the same time. The jump you witnessed may have been a legacy of old IBM technology. </p>
 
<p>Artifact curator Bill Bucher is older than a lot of the technology he maintains at IBM’s archives. He started working in 1966 and has repaired ancient IBM Selectric typewriters, circular analog clocks, punch card systems, and even tape-based mainframe computers. Together, these items form a veritable museum’s worth of technological artifacts dating all the way back to Big Blue’s inception.  </p>
 
<p>IBM’s archives include quaint items that were considered cutting-edge technology at the time. Now these old treasures have been relegated to a massive collection of technical detritus. Talk about an Island of Old Misfit Tech Toys. That’s where Bill steps in with his magical handiwork.</p>
 
<p>After close to 50 years on the job, you might think Bill feels a little bored oiling clock handles, realigning gears, or polishing weathered displays just to make something work. . . but not Bill—he takes great pride in bringing old toys to a new generation. </p>
 
<p>When you buy new technology, do you throw out the old? If not, how do you archive these once cherished possessions? Do you feel any pangs of nostalgia for an ancient piece of technology that you don’t use any more? Tell us your impressions of the IBM archive in the ongoing discussion <a href="  https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/23801/ ">on Vialogues</a>. <p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:44 abagigah92:</b>Is it important to keep original copies of archives after it [has] been digitized?</p>
 
<p><b>@04:30 Kafou:</b>Are students allowed to visit those archives? that would give them a chance to discover some of the old piece of technology that were used since [modern] technology has changed everything.</p>
 
<p><b>@05:05 Kafou:</b>Are some of these archives for sale? I am sure people love old [pieces] of technology because it [reminds] them of the old age where social media had no meaning and [a] robot was just a toy for kids.</p>
