<p><i>"Babies are born ready to learn. And you have what it takes to help them!" </i> (<a href="https://www.vroom.org/">Vroom</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Brain Building in Everyday Life</b></p>
 
<p>Children’s brains grow fastest from birth to age five, and yet many parents don’t have the time, resources, or know-how to engage in parenting programs or early childhood educational tools. Vroom is an organization that aims to solve this problem by creating science-based services to help parents increase "brain building" in their children through simple, everyday activities. Their free app includes over 1,000 activities and tips for busy, low-income parents to help stimulate their children's learning during existing routines, like mealtime or bathtime. </p>

<p><b>Moving to Conflict Contexts</b></p>

<p>Though Vroom has partnered with many other American organizations, including BabyBox, Goya Foods, Inc., Kindermusic, and the Fred Rogers Company, just this past year it launched its first international partnership with the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The IRC has been working to provide support for displaced Syrians affected by the refugee crisis, and one concern they’ve identified is that many refugee parents struggle to find the time, resources, and emotional energy to devote to early childhood education.</p> 

<p>This is where Vroom comes in. As <a href="https://www.rescue.org/article/irc-partners-vroom-nurture-refugee-children">Katie Murphy</a>, an IRC early childhood development specialist, states, "We were inspired by Vroom’s approach [...] and saw the great potential for reaching large numbers of families living in displacement". Vroom’s platform presents an easy way for parents to nurture their child’s growing mind.</p> 

<p>In order assure the usefulness of Vroom tips, the <a href="https://www.rescue.org/report/parenting-displacement-adapting-vroom-displaced-syrian-families"> IRC</a> first had to pilot the platform, testing different Arabic dialects and adapting the content to new cultural contexts in order to determine how best to motivate and engage parents. Now, it is in use in Jordan and Lebanon, with the hope to soon revise and scale up the program.</p>
