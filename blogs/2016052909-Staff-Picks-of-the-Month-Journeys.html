The second floor reading room of the Gottesman Libraries is home to a lot of things - our Juvenile and Curriculum collections, new modular furniture, big rocks and a bigger bear, and an ever-changing book display put together by members of the services team. My Staff Picks of the Month for May focused on journeys. I made sure to include some of the books that I love most (<em>The Phantom Tollbooth</em> being my favorite book ever), as well as books recommended to me by other members of the Library Services Team. This month is ending soon, so come by and check it out before our next amazing selection is released!

Read more to find out more about the curator, the display, and for a full list of May's Staff Picks.

Rachel is a Library Services Associate at the Gottesman Libraries. She comes from a K-12 education background, and hopes to return to the elementary and secondary education circuit as a fully certified teacher and librarian. In the meantime, Rachel is content to play drums and help people find their way around the stacks and halls of Teachers College. Rachel would like to thank Alex, Kim, and Paul for their assistance with this collection.

This month's collection centers around journeys. With graduation fast approaching and the summertime just behind it, the books on display are a testament to how far we can go and how much we can achieve. From inner reflection to the far reaches of the universe, each text featured here proves that there is nothing as boundless as the human mind. Whether you're taking the summer to explore before returning in the fall or you're ending your time at Teachers College (for now), your journey is just beginning. Where will your words take you?

<em>High Tide in Tuscon</em> by Barbara Kingsolver
PS3561.I496 H54 1996
<blockquote>Every one of us is called upon, perhaps many times, to start a new life. A frightening diagnosis, a marriage, a move, loss of a job...And onward full-tilt we go...Crying out: High tide! Time to move out into the glorious debris. Time to take this life for what it is.</blockquote>
<em>The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</em>
JUV PQ2637.A274 P413 1943
<blockquote>"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again..."</blockquote>
<em>Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly</em> by Anthony Bourdain
TX649.B58 A3 2007
<blockquote>Do we really want to travel in hermetically sealed popemobiles through the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in Hard Rock Cafes and McDonalds? Or do we want to eat without fear, tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria's mystery meat, the sincerely offered gift of a lightly grilled fish head? I know what I want. I want it all. I want to try everything once.</blockquote>
<em>Taipei</em> by Tao Lin
PS3612.I517 T35 2013
<blockquote>He listened to the layered murmur of the wind against leaves, familiarly and gently disorienting as a terrestrial sound track, reminding people of their own lives...</blockquote>
<em>Cosmos</em> by Carl Sagan
QB44.2 .S235 2013
<blockquote>Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.</blockquote>
<em>Set to Sea</em> by Drew Weing
CURR PN6727.W413 S48 2010
<blockquote>The only fate that would be worse is if I hadn't sailed at all.</blockquote>
<em>The Tempest</em> by William Shakespeare
PR2833.A2 C25
<blockquote>O, wonder!/How many goodly creatures are there here!/How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,/That has such people in't!</blockquote>
<em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence</em> by Robert M. Pirsig
CT275.P648 A33 1974
<blockquote>You look at where you're going and where you are and it never makes sense, but then you look back at where you've been and a pattern seems to emerge.</blockquote>
<em>Bud, Not Buddy</em> by Christopher Paul Curtis
JUV PZ7.C94137 Bu 2004
<blockquote>A bud is a flower-to-be. A flower in waiting. Waiting for just the right warmth and care to open up. It's a little fist of love waiting to unfold and be seen by the world. And that's you.</blockquote>
<em>Invisible Man</em> by Ralph Ellison
PS3555.L625 I5 1994
<blockquote>I was pulled this way and that for longer than I can remember. And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone's way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled.</blockquote>
<em>Persepolis</em> by Marjane Satrapi
PN6747.S245 P4713 2007
<blockquote>Listen. I don't like to preach, but here's some advice. You'll meet a lot of jerks in life. If they hurt you, remember it's because they're stupid. Don't react to their cruelty. There's nothing worse than bitterness and revenge. Keep your dignity and be true to yourself.</blockquote>
<em>The Arrival</em> by Shaun Tan
JUV PZ7.7 .T36 Ar 2007
<blockquote>People from around a fictitious world not too unlike our own must leave their homes for a new, strange land in hopes of better lives in this riveting, wordless book.</blockquote>
<em>The True Meaning of Smekday</em> by Rex Adam
JUV PZ7.R32865 Tru 2007
<blockquote>I think there's a part of the brain, probably somewhere in the back, that won't give up believing in magic. It was the part that made cavemen believe that drawing elks on stone would make for a good hunt the next day. And it's still chugging along, making you think you have lucky socks, or that your kids' birthdays will win the lottery.</blockquote>
<em>House of the Scorpion</em> by Nancy Farmer

JUV PZ7.F23814 Ho 2002
<blockquote>When you're small you can choose which way to grow.</blockquote>
<em>Teacher Man</em> by Frank McCourt
LA2317.M36 T4319 2005
<blockquote>There's nothing sillier in the world than a teacher telling you don't do it after you already did it.</blockquote>
<em>The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of the Lord of the Rings</em> by JRR Tolkein
PR6039.O32 L6 2012
<blockquote>All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</blockquote>
Not pictured:

<em>Wild: Lost and Found on the Pacific Trail</em> by Cheryl Strayed
PS3619.T744 Z46 2013
<blockquote>I knew that if I allowed fear to overtake me, my journey was doomed. Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell myself a different story from the one women are told. I decided I was safe. I was strong. I was brave. Nothing could vanquish me.</blockquote>
<em>The Alchemist</em> by Paulo Coelho
PQ9698.13 .O3546 A4513 2006
<blockquote>No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.</blockquote>
<em>The All New Universal Traveler : a Soft-systems Guide to Creativity, Problem-solving, and the Process of Reaching Goals</em> by Don Koberg and Jim Bagnall
BF441.K55 1981
<blockquote>Design is a process of making your dreams come true. Once you decide to improve what you desire, it's almost certain you will find many ways to make it happen.</blockquote>
<em>The Phantom Tollbooth</em> by Norton Juster
JUV PZ7.J98 Ph 1967
<blockquote>There are no wrong roads to anywhere.</blockquote>
<em>The Power of Myth</em> by Joseph Campbell
Oversize BL304 .C36 1988
<blockquote>Follow your bliss and doors will open where there were no doors before.</blockquote>
<em>S. </em>by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst
