<p>Student motivation in learning environments has been and continues to be heavily researched, but the increasing prevalence of online learning has added another element for researchers to consider when dissecting what motivates students to learn. Researchers from a university in Finland have previously shown how gamification—through the use of badges as a reward—can increase students’ motivation when doing coursework. In a recent publication, these authors extended that research by comparing gamification with a new tool—heat map visualizations of student progress that increase students’ self-awareness within the course.</p>
 
<p>The researchers sought to determine if these visualizations had a positive effect on student motivation in their online courses, and if the gamification and visualization methods were more effective with certain types of students. They asked the students to take a survey on goal orientation and sorted them into the following categories: mastery-intrinsic (learn as much as possible), mastery-extrinsic (earn good grades), performance-approach (be perceived as capable), performance-avoidance (avoid being perceived as "stupid"), and avoidance (complete only the mandatory work).</p>
 
<p>The results from this study demonstrated that those who responded positively to the badges tended to fall into the mastery-extrinsic or performance-approach categories, which the authors reasoned was because the badges awarded the completion of additional challenges but did not punish for failure, which catered to those who desired to achieve rewards. The visualizations, on the other hand, had more of an effect with those in the performance-avoidance category, which the authors hypothesized was due to the fact that the heat maps do not reward behavior, but instead predict potentially poor outcomes, which may resonate more with those who fear failure.</p>
 
<p>The authors noted that the visualizations had the strongest effect on those who were already high-performing in the course; that may be because low-performing students have less interest in self-monitoring their progress. They also acknowledged that those who did not complete the initial goal orientation survey may have been "avoidance" students—more likely to skip work that was not required of them—which may have led to less conclusive results in the study. The researchers concluded that even though this research provides insight into how students alter their study behaviors in response to certain tools, it still leaves room for further analysis on low-performing students, who may not have been addressed as thoroughly in this particular study.</p>
