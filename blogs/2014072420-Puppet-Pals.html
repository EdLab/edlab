<p>Digital storytelling has become a popular creative composing experience for children in and out of schools. However, the default movie making software in Mac and Windows systems, iMovie and Windows Movie Maker, may be too complex for younger children. <a href=" https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puppet-pals-hd/id342076546?mt=8
">Puppet Pals</a>, a digital storytelling app for iPad developed by <a href=" http://www.polishedplay.com">Polished Play LLC</a>, offers a succinct platform with which to create digital stories. It provides a rich selection of characters and options for recording voiceovers and creating character animations.</p>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The simple and intuitive interface makes Puppet Pals stand out from other digital storytelling apps. Children can create puppet shows by picking their favorite characters and backgrounds, dragging them to a stage, and recording their voiceovers and real-time character movements on screen. There are a number of themes available within the app, from playing the role of Snow White in a forest, to fighting scary monsters in a dungeon, to acting out a story of historical figures discussing the Gold Rush. These interactions can be creatively used for improving childrenâ€™s social skills, and can also bring digital storytelling to the teaching of literacy and social studies in and beyond the primary grades.</p> 

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Puppet Pals offers two types of access. While the free version sets limitations on customizing personal photos and accessing its complete puppet collections, the full version is offered at a cost of $2.99. The creations in Puppet Pals can be exported in the form of video, but there is no interactive platform provided for online sharing and communication. Users will also have to carefully plan their shows if they want to include multiple characters in one story, because managing the voiceovers and screen movements of multiple characters in one recording can be challenging.</p> 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The puppetization of photos and the intuitive interface are some of the key features that make Puppet Pals a unique teaching and learning tool. Students will enjoy crafting  movie stories with the app, and parents may find it entertaining to watch their little ones hone their storytelling skills. To further advance this app, Polish Play LLC has released Puppet Pals 2, a sequel based on the original design with more character choices and animations.</p> 
<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>This digital storytelling app for teachers and parents helps support creative play and learning.</p>
