In November 2016 we held an EdLab Seminar in The Learning Theater to generate some examples of systemic problems. We used the <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/wicked_problems_problems_worth_solving" target="_blank">concept of wicked problems</a> to orient everyone quickly to the kind of systemic challenges we had in mind. These are the kinds of problems that we believe the advanced practitioners coming to the upCreation Experience will want to address. Each of the six teams at the seminar identified a wicked problem, created a visual representation, and posted a Vialogue on the problem.

&nbsp;

<strong>Gentrification</strong>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-156" src="https://img.tc-library.org/pressible/976/files/2016/12/Gentrification-Image-300x200.jpg" alt="Gentrification Image" width="600" height="400" />

Gentrification is a process in which a wealthier group moves into a lower income area, displacing existing residents. These displacements often occur along racial and ethnic lines. While this can have positive benefits like the revitalization of commerce districts, established residents find themselves marginalized and unable to afford the cost of living. The forces that cause gentrification are complex and contradictory. It is challenging for policymakers to create laws that protect existing residents and ensure affordable housing while at the same time encouraging growth, urban development, and free market activity.

<strong>Garbage</strong>

Garbage - What can we do about our rapidly growing plastic consumption clogging up our oceans? Garbage comes from many sources and nations. Who will clean it before more ecological damage is done?

<strong>Information Chaos</strong>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-158" src="http://upcreation.pressible.org/files/2016/12/Information-Chaos-Image-300x200.jpg" alt="Information Chaos Image" width="600" height="400" />

Information Chaos - This includes two dimensions: 1) the excess of information, much of which is sensationalist or false; and 2) people's inability to think critically about information or to assess what is factual/important. This problem is rooted in both education (and the learning of critical thinking skills) and media (subsisting on clicks/likes rather than factual content).

<strong>Information Privacy</strong>

&nbsp;

There are two main perpetrators when considering the wicked problem of information privacy. The problem of hacking and consumer ignorance play the largest roles. Hacking is the work of malicious bots and individuals with intentions to steal information. Consumer ignorance interacts with the lack of federal legislation for information gathering. Consumers might think products are free and not realize that their information is the price they pay for the use of a particular product.

<strong>Global Literacy</strong>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-162" src="http://upcreation.pressible.org/files/2016/12/Global-Literacy-Image-200x300.jpg" alt="Global Literacy Image" width="600" height="900" />

Global Literacy - In 1970 we saw 40% world illiteracy rates, and in 2015, 15%. World illiteracy is still a wicked problem, despite declining rates over the past decades. The inability to read, write, do arithmetic, or use technology is pervasive throughout the world, from the rural areas of Africa, to the inner cities of America. The concept includes access to knowledge through technology and the ability to assess information. The causes of literacy may be poverty, or difficult living conditions; underachievement at school; lack of books and resources; or family with little schooling; the consequences include limitations in understanding essential information; unemployment or lower paying jobs; lower quality of life; decreased self-esteem and isolation; and an unstable economic and social environment.  A UNESCO report puts it this way: “Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society.”

<strong>Mental Health</strong>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-164" src="http://upcreation.pressible.org/files/2016/12/Mental-Health-Image-300x200.jpg" alt="Mental Health Image" width="600" height="400" />

Mental Health - We have selected mental health as our wicked problem because it is global in scale and it affects millions of individuals of all ages. There are a wide range of problems that can be classified as mental health issues. Mental health issues can be both visibly obvious or hidden. Factors such as environment, genetics, physical health, social status, and income can all trigger mental health issues. In many countries, such as the US, it is now possible to speak openly about mental health concerns; in other countries it is still stigmatized. The proper diagnosis, access to resources and necessary counseling are still major problems that need to be addressed. The first step to combating this global wicked problem is to have open discourse and acceptance of people suffering from mental health issues.
