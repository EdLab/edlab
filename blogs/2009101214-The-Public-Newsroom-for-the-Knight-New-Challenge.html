            Hey all,

Like Jeannie(<a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/3366">her blog post</a>), I am also submitting a Knight New Challenge grant.

It's based around the broadcaster idea, public videobooths, etc., in the context of a local small business.

Some practice video pitches I made:
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=a880cbceb0&photo_id=3996338738"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=a880cbceb0&photo_id=3996338738" height="300" width="400"></embed></object>

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nd9X_tWwe3g&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nd9X_tWwe3g&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

THE DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN PUBLIC NEWSROOM.
Where you are the news!

A pizza shop or bodega type store in downtown Brooklyn near Fulton Mall or similar low income shopping area/transit center or across the street from a nearby housing project like Gowanus Houses.
Front window has a couple screens playing videos. These are all videos that have been recorded on site. (or maybe an extra screen for content from other sites?)

Inside is a series of photobooth and videobooth installations of varying quality, duration, and abstraction(art installations like friendslicer). Plain 30 second videobooth cost $0.50 or $1, you record your video, it gets archived locally and added to loop playing on monitors outside. It also uploads to some social video site where it's tagged as “public domain” so television stations can rebroadcast and others can make mix tapes, etc.
In the store is a jukebox as well where you can pay small fee to select the video you want to see.
You can also get custom dvd mixtapes made in the store.

The store is a public history file for the local community. No more expensive than buying a can of soda or beer.
All financial records are public by default since every transaction is represented by an upload to the public feed.
A shared history for the local community. Truly ground up media. When you say, “I know where you are coming from” you will actually know where this news came from.

Technology developed will be open source and also business planning info will be open source so it's easily duplicable in other communities. A shared history builds trust and accountability. Can a public history file bring the positive powers of online communities like Wikipedia and Linux into our shared physical spaces?

">NEWS CHALLENGE APPLICATION google doc</a>

ROUGH COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES:
<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tUSiXaQxwbQ7Q8Wg313iIyg&output=html">google spreadsheet</a>

Something like the following mashup: an anthropological history of YouTube + storycorps + Twitter + local barber shop.

A public history file for shared physical spaces will promote collaboration and add value?

I'd also like to convey this idea of making the local environment more important. how do many people judge importance? Well, tv and news is one way. So put local people into the news more and they will care more about their local space rather than thinking it's always better somewhere else?

Any feedback appreciated.

Thanks!
