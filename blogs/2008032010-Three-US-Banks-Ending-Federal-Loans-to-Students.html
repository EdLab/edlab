Three U.S. Banks Ending Federal Loans to Students
Dow Jones  |  Thursday, March 20, 2008 

By Robert Tomsho

NEW YORK – Three big banks have dropped out of the federal student-loan program for the coming academic year, adding uncertainty to the financial-aid arena at a time when students are poised to receive admissions notices and begin to line up borrowing.

Believed to be the first large banks to exit the federal program during the current credit crunch, the institutions are HSBC Bank USA, a U.S. unit of London-based HSBC Holdings PLC; M&T Bank Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y.; and TCF Financial Corp., Wayzata, Minn. The three rank among the 50 largest providers of such federal student loans, lending a combined total of more than $560 million of the $119.2 billion made in loans in the 2006 federal fiscal year, the last tally available.

In last year's College Cost Reduction and Access Act, Congress slashed the federal subsidies paid to private lenders by more than $20 billion.

Officials at all three banks said the resulting squeeze on profits was a major reason they decided to stop making new student loans. "We just thought this was too big of a risk for the reward being offered," said Jason Korstange, a TCF spokesman. Kent Wissinger, an M&T spokesman, said turmoil in the securities market was also a factor in his institution's decision.

Their departures from the Federal Family Education Loan, or FFEL, program come as Department of Education officials are trying to reassure families and congressional leaders that students will have ample access to federal loans for the fall.

Hit by cuts in federal subsidies and problems in financing their student lending programs, several non-bank lenders and state loan authorities have also announced they will stop taking part in the FFEL program.

With nearly 2,000 lenders still involved, federal officials have expressed confidence that other lending institutions, particularly large banks, will take the place of those that leave the program.

'Big Leagues'

Philip Day, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, called the departure of the three banks a "major concern" that raises new worries about what may lie ahead for the fall. "These are larger banks, they have more volume, more engagement," he said. "We are starting to get into the big leagues now." Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, a financial aid Web site, said the banks' move could mark "the first sign of a second wave of exits" from FFEL.

U.S. Department of Education officials said the three banks' departure was unlikely to create major problems. In recent weeks, the department has asked financial-aid administrators to report any disruptions involving lenders that provide 50% or more of their colleges' federal loans.

Levels of Lending

Larry Warder, the department's acting chief operating officer for federal student aid, said HSBC provided that level of lending at only four schools, all small, and M&T provided it at none. He said TCF's standing was still being assessed, adding that no school anywhere in the country has yet to report a problem with loan accessibility.
