<p>A humanoid robot is the newest staff member at a hospital in Belgium. The bot, named Pepper, can show patients to their rooms, hold conversations in 19 languages, and offer bedside comfort. In its first week on the job, Pepper was in the maternity ward, and patients had an overall positive reaction to it. "It’s another way of making contact, and maybe it’s reassuring for some people," said one patient. "The baby was reassured."</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason why Pepper is so appealing is that unlike some humanoid robots, Pepper was obviously not built to look <i>too</i> human. In fact, the small bot is genuinely cute and was programmed with patients’ needs in mind. Even slower-moving patients are able to keep up with Pepper’s easy pace, and children seem to find the robot particularly fun to interact with. The hospital is not planning on replacing human caretakers with robots, but maybe bots like Pepper could give patients a new hospital experience, one that will put a smile on their face.</p>

<p>How do you think that patients feel interacting with Pepper? Do you think robots can provide a specific experience to patients that humans cannot provide? What might be the downside to having a humanoid robot in a hospital? Answer these questions and more <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/31479/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:48 dinosossi2:</b> Health concerns can be fraught with extreme emotions. Interacting with a robot may allow emotional patients to express themselves in ways they may not be comfortable with other people.</p>

<p><b>@01:48 RuthS:</b> I agree with you @dinosossi2, but I don't think that robots should replace humans in hospitals, and I worry that they might in the future. Nothing can replace the empathy you feel from a human visiting you in a hospital room, especially not a non-emotional robot.</p>
