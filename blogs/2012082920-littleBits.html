<p><a href="http://littlebits.cc/">littleBits</a>, which has been in beta since 2008, officially launched this September with a robust funding round that’s pushed the snap-together electronic modules into the news and hands of a diverse group of learners. In February the tool won <a href="http://littlebits.cc/littlebits-just-won-best-of-toy-fair-2012">Popular Science’s "Best of Toy Fair"</a> and its enthusiastic founder was profiled this year in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2012/01/10/making-science-fun-with-high-tech-popsicle-sticks-and-pipe-cleaners/">Forbes</a> and on <a href="http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/category/the-next-list/">CNN’s Next List</a>. Ayah Bdeir, littleBits 29-year-old CEO, and is an alum of the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>. Equal parts engineer and artist, Bdeir is dead earnest about her product’s potential to revolutionize education and help everyone, especially those intimidated by science to, "<a href="http://vimeo.com/45276780">make something that does something</a>." 
</p><p>
That mission is being carried out through littleBits’ community outreach efforts and workshops. Since launch, they’ve worked with the <a href="http://www.risd.edu/">Rhode Island School of Design</a>, the summer camp at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2012/">NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program</a>, and maker spaces around the country to product-test and skim ideas and videos for their growing <a href="https://community.littlebits.cc/projects">project database</a>. 
</p><p>
<b>Pros:</b>
The bits are highly intuitive, an unusual attribute for electronics. They have a color-coding scheme that makes it easy to create circuits: blue is power, green is output, and pink and orange are the game-changers that fall in between. The parts are also magnetized, so users always know which end goes where. The result is a product that seems to make a lot of visual and tactile sense to electronics novices. 
</p><p>
The community section of the site is full of user-created project instructions, courses, and videos. Some of the most creative and dynamic projects have come from the K-12 set. The bits are also extremely portable and they do not require an internet connection or electricity hookup. 
</p><p>
<b>Cons:</b>
The portability of littleBits is powerful, but the tools are a bit expensive. Each piece retails for $10-20 and the starter kit is nearly $90, not something one could purchase with allowance or for a class of students. Though they have been sold <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/07/18/littlebits-helps-people-play-with-electricity/">around the world</a>, it is unclear whether the current business model will make them universally accessible in order to realize their mission. Bdeir, a <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ayah-bdeir">2010 Creative Commons fellow</a>, has attempted to make littleBits universally accessible through open source plans for the hardware.
</p><p>
<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
It’s no surprise that the maker movement, which emphasizes creating solutions to common problems using new and traditional skills, has taken a shine to littleBits. The system can be seen as a prelude to more complex kits like <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">Lego Mindstorms</a> and as part of a growing DIY trend, inspired by the heady power of programming. The Community section of the site shows a lot of independent exploration by the younger users, as well as significant cross-instruction between artists and designers on the team and the young devotees of the tool. LittleBits is one component of an expanding array of tools that enables electronic creation and the promotion of independent and innovative STEM learning.
</p><p>
<b> The Bottom Line:</b>
LittleBits is a gateway tool for a plugged-in generation. </p>
