<p><a=href"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monkey-word-school-adventure/id565951597?mt=8">Monkey Word School Adventure</a> is an early reading skills app that teaches phonics and word groups.  The app is composed of six different activities (collecting words, rhyming words, finding words, spelling words, and drawing letters) all guided by an adorable monkey. The game is adaptive and the difficulty level increases automatically based on user performance. Monkey Word School Adventure is available for download through iTunes and Google Play.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<p>The app accommodates multiple players with individual IDs, allowing the users to return to the game where they left off. The games automatically provide hints when the user is taking too long to answer. Prizes (composed of flowers, butterflies, trees, and frogs) are awarded after each around, allowing the users to build personalized digital terrariums. Each activity is short, keeping users interested and attentive. The different types of games require different finger and hand motions, and could contribute to developing motor skills. The biggest advantage of Monkey Word School Adventure is the use of phonics while teaching players to spell and read.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Monkey Word School Adventure costs $1.99 to download. While the app does provide six different activities, they are repetitive and users may become bored after some time.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Monkey Word School Adventure does a great job of using phonics to help kids sound letters and words out during every activity by providing  visualizations and sound clips for both the letters and the words. The app allows parents and teachers to view the child's progress throughout the game and manage the playerâ€™s settings (i.e., turning hints on or off).  Monkey Word School Adventure is a great way for early elementary students to gain skills in spelling and reading while playing a game!</p>
