<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jane-Austen-Education-Novels-Friendship/dp/1594202885">From the Publisher:</a></strong>

In <em>A Jane Austen Education</em>, Austen scholar William Deresiewicz  turns to the author's novels to reveal the remarkable life lessons  hidden within. With humor and candor, Deresiewicz employs his own  experiences to demonstrate the enduring power of Austen's teachings.  Progressing from his days as an immature student to a happily married  man, Deresiewicz's <em>A Jane Austen Education</em> is the story of one man's discovery of the world outside himself.

A self-styled intellectual rebel dedicated to writers such as James  Joyce and Joseph Conrad, Deresiewicz never thought Austen's novels would  have anything to offer him. But when he was assigned to read <em>Emma</em> as a graduate student at Columbia, something extraordinary happened.  Austen's devotion to the everyday, and her belief in the value of  ordinary lives, ignited something in Deresiewicz. He began viewing the  world through Austen's eyes and treating those around him as generously  as Austen treated her characters. Along the way, Deresiewicz was amazed  to discover that the people in his life developed the depth and richness  of literary characters-that his own life had suddenly acquired all the  fascination of a novel. His real education had finally begun.

Weaving his own story-and Austen's-around the ones her novels tell,  Deresiewicz shows how her books are both about education and themselves  an education. Her heroines learn about friendship and feeling, staying  young and being good, and, of course, love. As they grow up, they learn  lessons that are imparted to Austen's reader, who learns and grows by  their sides.

<em>A Jane Austen Education</em> is a testament to  the transformative power of literature, a celebration of Austen's  mastery, and a joy to read. Whether for a newcomer to Austen or a  lifelong devotee, Deresiewicz brings fresh insights to the novelist and  her beloved works. Ultimately, Austen's world becomes indelibly entwined  with our own, showing the relevance of her message and the triumph of  her vision.
