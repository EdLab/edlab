<strong>Title: </strong>Jump start health! : practical ideas to promote wellness in kids of all ages

<strong>Author:</strong><strong> </strong>Francisco  Jiménez

<strong>Publisher:</strong> Albuquerque : University of New Mexico Press, c1997

<strong>Call no.:</strong> <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/tthe+circuit/tcircuit/1%2C19%2C19%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=tcircuit+stories+from+the+life+of+a+migrant+child&amp;1%2C1%2C">PS3560.I55 C57 1997</a>

<strong>From the Publisher: </strong>

After dark in a Mexican border town, a father holds open a hole in a wire fence as his wife and two small boys crawl through.

So begins life in the United States for many people every day.  And so begins this collection of twelve autobiographical stories by  Santa Clara University professor Francisco Jiménez, who at the age of  four illegally crossed the border with his family in 1947.

"The Circuit," the story of young Panchito and his trumpet, is  one of the most widely anthologized stories in Chicano literature. At  long last, Jiménez offers more about the wise, sensitive little boy who  has grown into a role model for subsequent generations of immigrants.

These independent but intertwined stories follow the family  through their circuit, from picking cotton and strawberries to topping  carrots--and back agai--over a number of years. As it moves from one  labor camp to the next, the little family of four grows into ten.  Impermanence and poverty define their lives. But with faith, hope, and  back-breaking work, the family endures.

<strong>About the Author</strong>

<strong></strong>Francisco Jiménez immigrated with his family to California from  Tlaquepaque, Mexico, and as a child he worked in the fields of  California. He is currently the Fay Boyle Professor in the Department of  Modern Languages and Literatures, and director of the Ethnic Studies Program at Santa Clara University.  Having received his B.A. from SCU and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Latin  American literature from Columbia University under a Woodrow Wilson  Fellowship, he has served on various professional boards and  commissions, including the California Council for the Humanities,  Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities (WASC), the  California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Santa Clara University  Board of Trustees and the Far West Lab for Educational Research and  Development. He has published and edited several books on Mexican and  Mexican American literature, and his stories have been published in over  50 textbooks and anthologies of literature.
