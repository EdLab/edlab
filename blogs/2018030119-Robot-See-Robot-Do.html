<p><i>"With cutting edge interaction technologies, we enable everybody to program their robots themselves."</i> (<a href="http://www.wandelbots.com/#teaching">Wandelbots</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>An update long overdue</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wandelbots.com/#teaching">Wandelbots</a> is a German startup that aims to decrease the cost, time, and knowledge required to program a robot by employing a new way of teaching machines how to operate. Co-founder Christian Piechnick pointed out in a recent demonstration for <a href="http://www.wandelbots.com/#teaching">TechCrunch’s Disrupt Berlin</a> that though robotic function and design have increased exponentially in the past couple of decades, "the engineering methods for developing software for those robots has seen almost no innovation in last twenty years." Wandelbots’ founding team of six software engineers has been working for the past two and a half years to address this problem, and officially launched their company in December 2017.</p>

<p><b>Anyone can teach a robot</b></p>
 
<p>Wandelbots’ new software allows users to program their robots through demonstration-based learning without ever writing a line of code. The company employs sensor-equipped wearables to track human movement in real time as an individual demonstrates what they want the robot to do. As a person guides the robot through the process, data is gathered from the sensors in the smart jacket and data gloves worn by the demonstrator. Through a process known as self-adaptive automation, the machine then learns to carry out the given task. The more human demonstrations the robot observes, the more accurate it becomes, and it is often able to complete a task correctly on its own after just one demonstration. Another key feature of Wandelbots’ software is that it operates independent of any robotic hardware, making it compatible with nearly any robot.</p>

 <p><b>A time-saving and cost-effective solution</b></p>

<p>Robotics programming is traditionally complicated, time consuming, and expensive. However, using Wandelbot technology, there’s no need to outsource programming to expensive experts that may take months to develop specific programs for a single company. The Wandelbox, which will be made available to commercial customers in late 2018, will contain wearables and software that the company predicts will make robotics programming up to 20 times faster and 10 times cheaper. Additionally, Wandelbot’s software makes robots capable of learning from each other, further speeding up implementation.</p>

<p>Wandelbot provides interactive programming that is adaptive to both dynamic and static environments at a time when innovation in this field is strongly needed. As robots become more and more common in manufacturing and business, demonstration-based teaching for robots could completely transform the industry.</p>
