<p><a href="https://www.story2.com">Story2</a> might be prospective college students’ new best friend. It’s a website that helps students craft personal essays that will launch them above their test scores and grades to the top of the application pack. Instead of drudging students through the standard five paragraph formula, it prompts them to transform spoken stories into compelling college application essays.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Story2’s step-by-step process breaks down the intimidating essay writing task into manageable pieces. The site is built on the belief that the best essays stem from stories, so it has students practice oral storytelling before putting words on the page. The site prompts students to pick a particular trait they want admissions offices to know (e.g., "I’m curious," "I’m an advocate"). After, it records students speaking about an experience that relates to the trait, and the anecdote can be made public to other users and rated. Finally, students construct essays based on their recordings with help from the site; Story2 guides students through choosing the interesting details and crafting a captivating beginning, turning point, and lasting effect.</p>
 
<p>Story2 also has other tools and exercises to help students hone their writing chops. It provides daily writing prompts and encourages users to practice five minutes each day. In addition, students have access to guides explaining the essay prompts on the common application as well as any additional essays required from specific colleges of interest.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Although parts of the website are free (such as essay prompts and video recordings), the actual writing and feedback component costs $49. Granted, the fee is an investment that could pay off in scholarship money, but the cost could make the full service inaccessible to many students. In addition, Story2 helps students specifically with storytelling and not with crafting arguments, which could limit students’ essay-writing ideas. In the same vein, many educators who have used the product are disappointed that the site is limited to a specific kind of college essay prep instead of a wider range of educational writing.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Crafting a personal essay is one of the most difficult parts of applying to college, and Story2 could be a great resource to help students to get started. Although the $49 version gives students the full instructions, even the free elements can provide direction. Story2 is not the best way to craft an argumentative essay, but it could be perfect for anyone who needs help finding their voice.</p>
