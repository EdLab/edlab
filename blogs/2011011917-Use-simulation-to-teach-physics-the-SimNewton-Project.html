            I met Rajesh Jha in California a few weeks ago at Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, California. It was raining non stop and there were no seats in the restaurant. So we sat outdoors with a tiny shade above our table. My hair got wet and so did my burrito. But I was very impressed by the SimNewton project <a href="http://siminsights.com" target="_blank">Rajesh's company</a> was working on.

SimNewton is a collaborative web application for mechanics simulation designed for use in introductory physics courses at high school and college freshman levels. Teachers can create a challenge by building a mechanical system in the simulation with customized variables and learning scaffolds such as texts, images, videos, and dynamic charts. Then the teacher can export the scenario and share with groups of students. The students in turn will work alone or in the group to solve the problem. Students can also view and comment other groups' work online. Once the problem is solved, the students can export their solutions and share with the teacher for assessment and feedback.

Below is a learning scenario created by a teacher to help students investigate the dynamics of a bouncing ball. The teacher predefined the number and location of particles, the initial speed, the applied force, the existence and amount of gravity and air drag, and other variables in the scenario. The students can change the variables that the teacher allows them to override in order to figure out the challenge proposed by the teacher.

I think SimNewton is great because the customizable and sharable models allow for thousands of learning scenarios to be created. Rajesh and his colleagues are developing a series of such simulations including SimNewton to teach planar particle mechanics, SimOhm to teach electrical circuits, and SimStructure to teach engineering statics, among others.
