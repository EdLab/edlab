In the world of "fandom" Henry Jenkins would be the ultimate "meta fan."  As one of the world’s leading scholars in the realms of participatory culture, fan culture and the educational benefits of computer games, Jenkins is just the expert to help map-out new norms and models for a society and educational landscape that is increasingly connected.  Encompassing many facets of "new media" and spanning a range of fields from education and journalism, to the Humanities and Civics, Jenkins is involved in scholarship and research that will help us to understand the intersection of media and culture for years to come.  To further the impact of this work, Jenkins has developed innovative new resources for teachers who are often at the front-lines of the new media battle as they struggle to prepare learners to engage as both creators and audience members in the new media landscape.  This work includes Jenkin’s white paper, "Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture" and his recently published (via Teachers College Press), <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Participatory-Culture-Moby-Dick-Classroom/dp/0807754013">Reading in a Participatory Culture: Remixing Moby-Dick in the Literature Classroom</a></i> and the accompanying d-book, <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/showcase/flows-of-reading-engaging-with-texts/">Flows of Reading</a>, published by the Annenberg Innovation Lab.  Jenkins has also created an innovative professional development program for educators in the LA-Unified School District, <a href="http://henryjenkins.org/2012/12/play-participatory-learning-and-you.html">PLAY!, Participatory Learning and You!</a>.
<p>
Jenkins is a long-term proponent of and leader in the growing call to educate the world’s youth to be empowered, educated digital citizens.  Through both <a href="http://www.newmedialiteracies.org/">new media literacy-focused</a> initiatives aimed at helping to teach "21st century literacy skills" and his work with the MacArthur Foundation to examine the effects of Participatory Culture on young people while exploring new avenues for digitally-powered learning.  Building on this effort to create active engagement in Participatory Culture, Jenkins has worked as the founder of the <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/">Center for Future Civic Media at MIT</a> and most recently through his involvement with the <a href="http://ypp.dmlcentral.net/">Youth and Participatory Politics Network</a> at USC to help young people to become more engaged participants in the political landscape.  Also, look-out for Jenkin’s soon-to-be published book on the subject (tentatively titled), <i>By Any Media Necessary: Mapping Youth and Participatory Politics</i>.  Jenkins has held esteemed roles at institutions ranging from MIT, where he was the Peter de Florez Professor in the Humanities and directed the Institute’s Comparative Media Studies graduate degree program (from 1993-2009) to USC where he is the Provost’s Professor of Communication, Journalism, Cinematic Arts and Education.  Jenkins received his Masters in Communication Studies from the University of Iowa and his PhD in Communication Arts from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>
 
<b>Answer:</b> I came to my focus on participatory culture and learning as a media scholar who had worked extensively on fan cultures and communities. True, I did once earn a certificate in the State of Georgia to teach high school social sciences, but the key influence on this work was my own experiences as a fan. From an early age, I saw fans functioning as informal learning communities, debating interpretations, speculating beyond the ending, rewriting and remixing media texts, and sharing skills with each other. These experiences, far more than any formal educational background, taught me the value of participatory culture. 
 
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I arrived at MIT as a junior faculty member in the late 1980s, more or less at the dawn of the Networked Era, and I quickly saw the ways my students were using new media to support a broad range of activities and practices. The Web was central to how they learned -- integral to their very thought processes -- and through time, I saw these same kinds of experiences spreading more broadly across the culture. I first became involved with new media and education through the work of the Games to Teach project, now seen as a formative initiative in the space of games-based learning, but my awareness of the pedagogical implications of new media platforms and practices expanded when I became involved in the MacArthur Foundation's Digital Media and Learning initiatives. My work for MacArthur resulted in my white paper, "Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture," and our attempts to put those ideas into practice working with classroom teachers resulted in Reading in a Participatory Culture: Remixing Moby-Dick in the Literature Classroom, recently published by Teacher's College Press, and the accompanying d-book, Flows of Reading, published by the Annenberg Innovation Lab. Also since coming to Los Angeles, we've been running PLAY!, Participatory Learning and You!, a professional development program for teachers in the LA-Unified School District.

<p>

<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> At the heart, I am interested in helping educators confront the challenges and opportunities posed by a world where the general public has greater access to the means of cultural production and circulation than ever before, but the skills, knowledge, resources, and ethical norms required for meaningful participation are unevenly distributed across the population. In many cases, schools are becoming part of the problem rather than part of the solution. We've wired the classroom and hobbled the computer, blocking access to many of the platforms and practices that are core to today's participatory culture. If we are going to prepare all kids, rich and poor alike, for this new media landscape, we need to incorporate it into our curriculum and model ways to use those resources in ethically responsible ways. This goal is at the heart of all of the work I have done in this space. 
 <p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> The broad trends have to do with expanded opportunities to use media as a resource in all aspects of our lives -- as part of how we learn, how we work, how we conduct politics, how we express ourselves creatively, and how we live within families and communities. At the same time, we are seeing companies seek to capture and commodify our efforts to meaningfully participate in this new media landscape, and so we need to develop critical literacy skills which allow us to be aware of when we are being exploited or manipulated by corporate interests. In a world where each of us has enormous power to create and share media with each other, we also have to develop collective ethical norms which allow us to use that power responsibly. Everything suggests that our culture will continue to become more participatory but the key struggles will be over the terms of our participation, including that there is diverse representation in those processes that are fundamental to a democratic society. Schools will be at the center of these struggles.
<p>

<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Since moving to USC, I have also become an active part of the Youth and Participatory Politics Network (also funded by MacArthur) and have been focused much more on civic education. We have been doing case studies of a range of innovative organizations and networks that have been effective at getting young people more involved in political processes. We are finding that such groups often are effective at bridging between forms of cultural participation and institutional forms of politics and that such groups are tapping a broad range of different forms of media, from social networking and video sharing sites to face-to-face meetings and street theater.  My team and I are now working to convert those findings into another book, tentatively called, By Any Media Necessary: Mapping Youth and Participatory Politics. As with the Reading project, we plan to produce a range of curricular materials around this research that educators can bring into classes and after-school programs to help their students develop a deeper understanding of what forms of politics are emerging in the early 21st century.</p>
