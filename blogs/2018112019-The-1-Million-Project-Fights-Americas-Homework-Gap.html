<p><i>"All students are curious, want a brighter future, and are willing to work hard. Each, however, needs equal access to the Internet to achieve their full potential."</i> (<a href="http://www.1millionproject.org">The 1 Million Project</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>The Homework Gap</b></p>

<p>Although 70% of teachers in the U.S. assign homework that students need the internet to complete, many households with school-aged children don’t have access to devices or connectivity. In fact, over five million families with children in school do not have reliable internet connections at home. This leads to <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5225/the-alarming-reality-of-the-homework-gap">the homework gap</a>: the gap between those who have the resources to complete homework at home and those who do not.</p>

<p><b>Hope for a More Connected Future</b></p>
 
<p>To combat this problem, Sprint Corporation CEO Marcelo Claure created an organization called the <a href="http://www.1millionproject.org">1 Million Project</a>. Its mission is to help one million high school students within the next five years by giving them devices and free high-speed internet access. It’s a huge project, so many supporting organizations are involved in donating funds and products, including Sprint, Sprint Foundation, LG, and Motorola.</p>
 
<p>The organization started its pilot program in the 2017–2018 school year, and has since distributed over 112,000 devices to more than 1,400 schools in 31 states. Eligible students at these schools receive a free device, three GB per month of high-speed internet connectivity, and hotspot access. They also receive wireless service, including unlimited texts and phone calls, for up to four years in high school.</p>
 
<p>The 1 Million Project accepts applications from individual schools with student populations in need of internet connectivity. Applications for the third school year of the program, fall 2019–spring 2020, are currently open.</p>
