Is there room in a crowded, STEM-heavy curriculum to focus on an ever-important but oft-overlooked soft skill? Philosopher and author Roman Krznaric believes that never in our lives has empathy been more vital to our ultimate wellbeing. Perhaps that’s reason enough for people to squeeze in a little emotion-recognition time, whether in the classroom or on their own. <p>

As Kzrnaric sees it, empathy can incite revolutionary social change. He points to the Israel/Palestine project, The Parents Circle, and Orwell’s "Down and Out in Paris and London" as examples of such. In both cases, change came about thanks to people <i>experiencing</i> (on some level) the conditions experienced by their fellow human beings and proactively moving to resolve cognitive dissonance. The ability to feel and hear a person’s story is a matter of learning how to listen. These skills can be acquired through various exercises and, as Kzrnaric postulates, empathy museums. As unorthodox as they sound, exhibits designed to instigate perspective taking and understanding (and perhaps even blur the lines of humanity) could be just the thing to bring about more prosocial behavior in the 21st century. <p>

What’s your stand on the subject of empathy? Is it important for students to learn (i.e., should it be built into curricula) and, if so, how best can it be taught? Leave your thoughts in the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/11491">on Vialogues.</a> <p>

<i>Excerpts from the discussion</i><p>

<b>@01:31 Carla:</b> The relation of empathy to creative thinking is one that is not normally discussed, but I like the implication.<p>

<b>@05:05 johnlee:</b> Like this simple project, Hello Peace. Using one simple technology, telephone, this project connects people from Israel and Palestine and helps them understand each other better thus move toward peace in the region.<p>
