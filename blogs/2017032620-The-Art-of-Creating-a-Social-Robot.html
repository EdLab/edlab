<p>The art of creating a social robot is a challenging one. As robots grow more present in our lives, engineers must tackle the challenge of making people feel comfortable around them rather than afraid. This is mainly done by giving machines human or animal characteristics. For example, take <a href="https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo">Cozmo</a>. Cozmoâ€™s creators gave this little bot a distinctly mischievous personality and enabled it to recognize faces and call people by name. These traits are enough to make people feel guilty if they ever unintentionally <i>hurt</i> the bot.</p>

<p>Another social robot featured in this vialogue is the trashcan bot. This trashcan on wheels travels from table to table, stopping in front of each and giving a small shake like a dog might. This small attribute is enough to make people empathize with it, so much, in fact, that they feel bad not throwing trash into it.</p>

<p>These robots are just machines with a social interface, yet even the smallest characteristics can make us care about them more than we do any other clump of metal and wires. Granted, there is a fine line between a robot being friendly and a robot being creepy, but the engineers in this video seem to have cracked the code for the former. Why do you think it is important to give robots distinct personalities? How do you think our relationships with robots will change in the coming years? Join the discussion

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>

<p><b>@01:51 RuthS:</b> It's important to give robots not only distinct personalities, but likeable ones, as well. The robots in this video are likeable because they are not too humanlike. This goes back to the idea of uncanny valley. If bots are too humanlike, they will likely repel us.</p>

<p><b>@03:26 dinosossi2:</b> I wonder if the role of robots in displacing jobs may turn them into objects of dislike or even anger. As such, giving them a likeable personality may become essential in their domestic adoption.</p>
