<p>In some K-12 classrooms, teachers require students to hand in their cell phones before entering the room. Yet in a college lecture hall, similar restrictions are often non-existent, as most students bring laptops, iPads, and smartphones for note taking. Now that mobile technology is more prevalent than ever, educators need to understand mobile multitasking—a natural consequence of using smartphones in school—and how it affects student learning. In a literature review conducted at Baylor University, researchers reviewed the existing studies on how multitasking with smartphones impacts learning experiences.</p>
 
<p>Previous researchers have found that when multitasking, an individual’s brain will prioritize one input over another. In a classroom this means that a student will not effectively absorb class content while reading and responding to a message on the phone. This effect is similar to texting while driving—the phone distracts the driver from visual cues on the road just as texting in class distracts students from lecture content. The reviewers noted that current students are increasingly using mobile learning devices in elementary and high school classrooms, and college professors and administrators should expect these habits to carry into post-secondary schooling.</p>
 
<p>The reviewers also referenced research on students who were less successful blocking out inputs from their smartphones than they originally thought, revealing a discrepancy between students' perceived ability to multitask with their phones and reality. This begs the question of whether or not teachers should outright ban them in classrooms. The reviewers pointed out that teachers can develop ways to make smartphones contribute to, rather than hinder, learning through strategic integration. For example, in a flipped classroom, readings are completed beforehand and class time is reserved for applications through exercises, potentially by using smartphones.</p>
 
<p>Creating best practices for successful smartphone integration in higher education will require more research—particularly on the relationship between multitasking and productivity during different types of activities, such as listening to lectures, completing assignments, or engaging in creative processes. It's also worth examining how often students appear to be using technology for class, even though they are actually using non-educational apps. Administrators and faculty hoping to eliminate those distractions with college-wide smartphone bans should keep in mind that they may also be restricting students from using technology to enhance their learning. Because mobile technology can be both a tool and a distraction, developing an effective policy is not as easy as simply deciding to ban or allow smartphones in the classroom.</p>
