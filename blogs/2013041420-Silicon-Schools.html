<i>The Silicon Schools Fund provides seed funding for new blended learning schools that use innovative education models and technology to personalize learning </i> (<a href="http://www.siliconschools.com/who-we-are/about-us/">Silicon Schools</a>).
<p>
<b>Taking a Cue from "the Valley"</b><br>
Startups have traditionally been known as epicenters of innovation, while schools have typically been known as anything but. California-based <a href="http://www.siliconschools.com">Silicon Schools Fund</a> wants to change this.  The "fund" (actually a 501(c)(3) charitable organization) selects new and existing Bay Area schools for funding based on grant proposals.  The group places no limitation on the type of school, only that they be truly innovative, employ a "blended learning approach" and have a model that can be replicated by other schools across the country.  Silicon Schools explains this selection process on their site, "We approach our investments in grantees with a rigorous diligence process and invest in schools that are operationally and financially sustainable while demonstrating significant potential to serve as proof points for education innovation."  While modeling themselves on a more profit-driven venture fund, Silicon Schools is only borrowing this "portfolio" approach as a process to select programs to support, with "investors" receiving, instead of "returns."
<p>
 <b>Disruptive Investing</b><br>
<a href="http://www.siliconschools.com/team/michael-b-horn/">Michael B. Horn</a>, who is on the leadership team of Silicon Schools, exemplifies this approach through his work with <a href="http://www.innosightinstitute.org/">Innosight Institute</a> and recently, co-authored book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Disrupting-Class-Disruptive-Innovation-Change/dp/0071592067"><i>Disrupting Class</i></a> (Learn more about Michael <a href=" http://nlt.tc.columbia.edu/cms/article/234">here</a>).  Horn and his peers at Innosight believe that the blended learning model encouraged by Silicon Schools is a potential solution to many issues in America’s schools, which he and his colleagues deem in need of disruptive innovations, similar to those that transformed the tech industry in the early 1980’s.  Horn and his team define Blended Learning as, "…a formal education program in which a student learns at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some element of student control over time, place, path, and/or pace and at least in part at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from home."  Despite being introduced more than a few years ago, this model has yet to be embraced fully by many schools.  
<p>
<b>But, Will it Blend?</b><br>
Brian Greenberg, Silicon School’s CEO, himself a former teacher, recently described the excitement around <a href="http://www.blendmylearning.com/2012/05/16/what-weve-got-here-is-failure-of-imagination/"> a blended approach </a>, "It is exciting to think about students learning exactly what they need, exactly when they need it.  It is also exciting to think about teachers gaining back the capacity to lead small group instruction and one-on-one learning."  It is just this model of small group learning and personalization that Silicon Schools hopes to support and "prove" as the ideal vision of education in America.  Embracing elements of traditional learning, while encouraging an equal emphasis on networked, personalized and in-person interactions, Silicon Schools is trying to work within the current education paradigm in order to shift it radically into a more "2.0" direction.  However, is "blended" learning really a major part of the answer?  Instead, should educators focus on either a more personalized online route or perfect their in-person approach and bypass this "blended" middle ground entirely?  "Blending" and refusing to commit to one format or another just might leave some educators and students in learning limbo.  Regardless, Silicon Schools is betting the "fund" on a successful commingling.
