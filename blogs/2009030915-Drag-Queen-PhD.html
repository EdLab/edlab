            It's official: as mulled over in the Chronicle of Higher Education several times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/arts/07grad.html?em">the academic job market this year is in le toilette </a> (maybe to never recover with the glut of adjuncts, instructors, and otherwise low paying academic staff).  It is time for people to re-access their marketable skills in this time of economic downturn.  

To all my fellow PhDs out there: have you ever considered a career as a professional drag queen?  I have been watching <a href="http://www.peppermintonline.com/">Peppermint</a>, who is one of the most famous drag queens in NYC, for several years now, and she is quite successful at what she does (meaning that this is all she does).  I have boiled her factors of success down to the following:

<ul><a href="http://www.peppermintonline.com/"><img src="http://www.peppermintonline.com/images/735_cover.jpg" align="right" vpsace=6 hspace=6></a>
<li><b>Pass around the tip bucket often</b>: You can't keep doing your thang when you aren't getting paid.  Make the people pay first before you give them what they want.
<li><b>Athleticism</b>: It helps to stay in exceptional shape.  This will keep you from losing stamina during a long performance
<li><b>Art of Illusion</b>: Your outfit should emphasize your best traits and hide your worst
<li><b>Multi-talented</b>: It is not enough to just do drag and lip-sync: you have to be multi-talented.  You must sing and dance!
<li><b>Network, Network, Network</b>: Use the Internet and get out there as much as possible.  
<Li><b>Humor</b>: Don't take yourself too seriously- you are after all a guy in women's clothing
<li><b>Compliment your audience</b>: Make your audience feel great about themselves, even if they are the same people who brought down Wall Street.
</ul>

Viacom, in all its corporate brilliance, have used their market research and have detected people's need to learn these marketable skills.  They have hence came up with <a href="http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/rupauls_drag_race/about.jhtml">Raul Paul's Drag Race</a>, that is available on Logo or YouTube.  Like Project Runway and Top Chef, it show-cases how to work your skills to reach the top of your game.


(keep private- I'm still gunning for one of those normal academic jobs that don't exist anymore :-)
