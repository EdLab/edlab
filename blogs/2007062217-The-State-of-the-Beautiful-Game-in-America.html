          <p>
            The mystery concerning soccer's inability to grip the attention of mainstream America has baffled me for some time now. As a die hard fan of the beautiful game, I will love to see my fellow Americans enjoy all the excitement that the game brings. However, I am convinced that soccer is still very far away from becoming a major player on the American sports scene. There are a number of reasons why I feel soccer will struggle to reach the upper echelons of America sports. America is the third most populous nation, which translates to various interests among its citizens. In most FIFA member countries, the population falls under 50 million and soccer remains the only major and organized sport in most of these nations. Americans simply have more options to choose from whereas their counterparts across the world have soccer as the major sport in their nation. Compared to the major American sports, soccer equipment is quite cheap and can be easily made by hand by anyone (just ball up pieces of paper and wrap rubber bands around it and you have a ball). Since most FIFA members are third world countries, soccer is the cheapest sport they can play and therefore lies another reason why it is so popular in those countries.<p>

Soccer's premier competition, the World Cup, brings together 32 different countries across the world for a month long competition to crown the best team in the world. The U.S. Men's National Team (MNT) has qualified for five consecutive World Cups, an impressive record considering many nations have never even qualified for a single tournament.  Their record at the World Cup is mediocre at best: a first round exit in 1990, a second round appearance on home soil in 1994, a last place finish in 1998, a quarter-final run in 2002 and a first round exit last summer in Germany. The MNT has failed to shine when the spotlight is on and thus most Americans will not waste their work time (when most World Cup games are played) to watch a losing team. <p>

Soccer is undoubtedly a global sport and as such, countless companies overseas invest a great deal of money into the game. Most club teams across the world have shirt sponsors in addition to the sports company that makes their uniforms. For instance, Arsenal FC of the English Premier League recently signed an endorsement deal with Arab airline giant Fly Emirates within the excess of $250 million in addition to their contract with Nike and other sponsors. The idea of a company investing itself in front of team uniforms is unthinkable in American sports, but overseas it is a key and vital way to market to a wide audience. There is no team in Major League Soccer (MLS) that has a shirt sponsor and I don't plan on seeing one anytime soon. There lies another problem for American soccer, how can the sport grow without the backing of major investors? Soccer is a 90 minute game divided into two halves of 45 minutes per. During the 45 minutes, there are no timeouts and the clock doesn't stop until the referee signals the end of the half, which means companies are allowed 10 minutes, at best, of commercial time. The lack of commercial time during the game throws off many investors. MLS can use as many investors as possible to promote the game, build soccer specific stadiums like the ones in Los Angeles, Columbus and Dallas, and the one set to open in Harrison, New Jersey later on this year. Without money coming into the game, promoting a game that is not popular becomes an even more daunting task, a task MLS unfortunately has to face everyday.
