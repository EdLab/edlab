            As a city, I think Boston is eh.  I think it's weird that the T stops running so early and I don't understand why no one shovels their sidewalks.  That said, I think the Harvard Book Store may be one of the coolest places ever. (Okay, it's not really Boston it's Cambridge but whatever.)

What struck me as particularly cool about Harvard's store was the quality and organization of their gigantic used book section. I've been shopping at the Strand for years and there is a lot to love about that venue (excellent customer service, they do sell text books -cheap!)-even though they say they don't, they give their part-time employees health insurance) but actually finding anything there requires hours of time, patience and a dose or two of allergy medicine. Harvard's book store treats their used books as glamorously as their new stuff. It's all organized into handsome wooden shelves, labeled with something of the typeset variety, the prices are clearly marked and they even have some employee recommendations. A pristine display of unadulterated gently useds for the frugal reader. This is the stuff dreams are made of.

Another thing I appreciated about the store was their used horror book section. I loved that there was a used horror book section,  I loved what was in it and that it was crowded.
It seems horror books have lost their way in today's world. The Stephanie Meyers have created a seemingly insatiable need for supernatural thrillers centered around a romantic yet Christian theme aimed at a young adult audience. But what about the rest of us?

Some key items: sense of menace, not a happy ending, protaganist always  vulnerable or succeptible, point of view critical since it guides the  readers response. Only get either the protaganist or antagonists point  of view, not both. Heightens the suspense and the surprise or  twist.story teller horror has slow building suspense. peter staub john  saul dean koontz visceral horror is the graphic stuff. usually from the  very beginning. clive barker, brian lumley

Stephanie Maatta's A Few Good Books
"In Danse Macabre, King says horror occurs at two levels. the obvious  scare-grossing out of the reader through vividly described torture and  infliction of bodily harm in unexpected circumstances. The subtler scare  reaches down into the reader's most primitive level and yanks at his or  her darkest secrets. The horror author discusses social taboos, and  brings to the forefront items tha thave been hidden away in the closet  because they are to scary to discuss in the light of day. These phobias  may manifest as monsters and things that go bump in the night." 163
