<p><b>Title:</b> An Implementation of Design-Based Learning Through Creating Educational Computer Games: A Case Study on Mathematics Learning During Design and Computing (2014)</p>

<p><b>Author:</b> Fengfeng Ke</p>

<p><b>Source:</b> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131513003345">Computers & Education</a></p>

<p><b>Research Question:</b> Does game authorship affect student attitudes toward learning math concepts?</p>

<p><b>Study Design:</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget">Jean Piaget</a> might argue that allowing young learners to collaboratively design their own video games facilitates learning by revealing gaps in their understanding and encouraging them to solve problems creatively. A twelve-year-old might argue that it’s more fun than doing worksheets. A new study from Florida State University might agree with both.</p>

<p>Previous research has confirmed that students who author digital games practice critical thinking skills and perform better on achievement tests (see <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/838">The Benefits of Empowering Students Through Digital Game Authorship</a>) and new research goes further in exploring the relationship between design thinking and content-specific reasoning in math games, examining how instructors should connect computational thinking activities (developing problems and solutions for programs) to math content.</p>

<p>Diverse groups of middle school students were asked to identify math concepts they could teach their younger siblings. Over the course of six weeks they designed mini games using both paper prototypes and <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/868">Scratch</a>, a simple program that teaches the building blocks of coding. Not only did students build some cool race car simulations, but observations, interviews, surveys, and artifact analyses revealed they were engaged in abstract and quantitative computational thinking.</p>

<p><b>Findings:</b> In fact, during 41% of the coding activities, students were actively involved in analytical and quantitative reasoning; they were able to explain procedural and object-oriented reasoning processes behind actions. Not only did the activities improve students’ ability to thoughtfully reflect on day-to-day math problems, but they developed more positive attitudes toward learning math, showing increases in self-confidence, value, enjoyment, and motivation. They felt most confident about integer calculation, as many of the games required the multiplication and division of integers. They also enjoyed testing their own games, taking pride in a sense of ownership and an expression of personal identity.</p>

<p><b>Moving Forward:</b> Amidst the positive outcomes of this study, there are a few challenges associated with integrating game authorship into curriculum. In general, students struggled to comprehend abstract mathematical concepts and translate them to game design. And because they so eagerly incorporated personal story telling, the authors recommend more intentional scaffolding to ensure an emphasis on math is not lost. It would also be beneficial to balance the ratio between learners and mentors in order to provide more student assistance.</p>

<p>Findings were descriptive and qualitative and would be strengthened by additional research, especially on activities that measure impacts across multiple disciplines, as this approach to learning is well suited to co-curricular programs. With the advantages of design thinking so clear, and an expanding collection of game creation software so accessible, it only makes sense to engage students via their preferred media.</p>
