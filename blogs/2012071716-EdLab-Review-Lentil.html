<a href="http://lentil.cc">Lentil</a> (still in its Alpha stage) is the first product developed by <a href="http://learnirvana.com/">Learnirvana</a>, a startup in San Francisco. It's designed to be a new approach to learning by memorizing, and currently includes reading Japanese and Korean and geography (US states, and countries and capitals of the world).

<i>The Lentil Interface</i></p>
<!--break-->
<b>Pros:</b>
(Most of my experience has been with the Japanese module (I figured I had enough of a basis to evaluate, but not so much that I couldn't use it as a student), and though I also experimented with the geography modules, most of my remarks relate to the Japanese module:

<li>Automatic language input (no fussing with configuring an IME or Kotoeri)</li>
<li>Multiple fonts/styles of writing are used</li>
<li>When you make a mistake you'll be asked the same question again after viewing the correct answer (positive reinforcement)</li>
<li>Remembers what materials you've learned as you jump from project to project, integrating them into new projects to keep them in memory</li>
<li>Materials are taught and then immediately quizzed and repeated on a regular basis, aiding in memorization and learning</li>
<li>There is the ability to tell Lentil you already know a concept at its first introduction, to skip over reviewing materials you've already mastered elsewhere</li>

<br>
<b>Cons:</b>
<li>Interface is not intuitive; to get variety you need to change projects, but that's not immediately apparent</li>
<li>Exercises sometimes lack context (especially with Romanization work, which reinforces characters but lack a theme)</li>
<li><i>(In Japanese in particular)</i> No furigana means kanji readings look awkward. It's confusing to see æ—¥ã«æœ¬ã»ã‚“ when you need to equate æ—¥æœ¬ with ã«ã»ã‚“ (which means Japan by the way).
<i>For those of you that don't know anything about the Japanese language, furigana are little characters from the syllabic writing systems that inform the reader how to interpret the more complex chinese characters, or kanji</i></li>
<li>The only language components are reading and typing, no listening, speaking, or physical writing (stroke order is important and totally ignored), this is purely for reading the language</li>
<li>While multiple meanings are given for most words, sometimes synonyms don't count towards the right answer, which is a bit frustrating</li>
<br>
<b>EdLab Relevance:</b>
Lentil is another self-directed learning tool, but fills a different niche than something like <a href=”http://duolingo.com”>Duolingo</a> (which I <a href=”http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7913”>reviewed a few weeks ago</a>). The target audience here is anyone who wants to learn a new language (be it Japanese or Korean), looking beyond just traditional classroom students.
<br>
<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
The team behind Lentil has a long way to go, but the seeds are there to grow this product into something truly worthwhile. There's a lot of room for improvement, but it's fun to play with (and you'll learn something too!)
