<p><i>"CourseHorse centralizes learning opportunities, to increase ease and confidence in discovering your path to personal enrichment."</i> (<a href="https://coursehorse.com/about">CourseHorse</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>All the Classes in One Place</b></p>

<p><a href="https://coursehorse.com/nyc">CourseHorse</a> brings together thousands of online and in-person classes in one online platform. Users browse CourseHorse to find classes in fields such as art, cooking, technology, professional skills, performing arts, and language. These listings come from legitimate local schools, studios, and educational institutes. There are so many courses out there, and CourseHorse makes it easier to browse through them so that you can continue learning, take up new hobbies, and connect with others who share interests.</p>

<p><b>Expanding Across the U.S.</b></p>
 
<p>Although it started in New York City, CourseHorse now partners with local schools in 14 cities across the U.S., including LA, Chicago, Nashville, and Denver. It also has a robust collection of online courses accessible from anywhere. Classes aren’t always inexpensive, but the price seems to reflect the quality of the course. There are many notable schools and institutes listed on CourseHorse, including Gotham Writers’ Workshop, New York Studio School, and Joe’s Coffee Company. Some classes are a one-time event, while others extend across weeks or months. It just depends on the school and the topic.</p>
 
<p><b>I Didn’t Even Know That Existed</b></p>

<p>Browsing the classes listed on CourseHorse, you might be surprised at the sheer number of courses and subject areas available. In New York City alone, there are 75,000 classes listed on CourseHorse. You’ll find courses such as French for Beginners, Pasta 101, Succulent Workshops, and Digital Marketing Bootcamps. You might also find courses in programming, presentation skills, and sewing. And if you look closely enough, you might even stumble across a course on Breastfeeding Twins, Tarot 101, Cardio Bollywood, or Wall Running.</p>
 
<p>CourseHorse doesn’t create the courses, but it does bring them together in one platform so that finding them is easier. Class prices tend to be expensive, so it may be more practical for focused searches or occasional forays. And it’s definitely best for people who have a desire for lifelong learning.</p>
