<p>Engaging with new technology can be scary. Using this technology to learn online can be even tougher. Your mind fills with dread when you start your first online course. How do I submit assignments? What kind of exams will I have to take? What if I lose all my work? These common concerns aggravate student anxieties across institutions and levels of study. Research has shown that many students feel intense anxiety, or even fear, concerning online technology. This is a significant problem that has caused attrition in online enrollment (especially for students new to these types of classes) and one that can benefit from early intervention. A recent study examined reducing first-time online student anxiety by evaluating students who were presented with an introductory quiz within a learning management system (LMS). This study focuses on identifying strategies for relieving these anxieties toward virtual coursework.</p>
 
<p>This case study focused almost exclusively on revealing that the best method to reduce student anxiety was implementing a simple "Check-in Quiz." This Quiz orients new students quickly into online courses even if students themselves do not know the purpose of this Quiz. Through the use of a Check-in Quiz, first-time online students take a tour of the class website without the fear and anxiety that typically accompanies high-stakes assignments and exams. This is a simple, low-pressure, and effective way of introducing first-time students to the online class format.</p>
 
<p>From his teaching experience, the author suggests many elements to improve online instruction. He suggests that the Quiz should be a compulsory class component posted early in the semester to the Announcements section. It should be short, simple, and not include course-content but instead focus on presenting the syllabus in a light-hearted or humorous way. Quiz assessment should be consistent with subsequent course assessment—including assignments and exams—as well as follow normal course procedures. Finally, it should include important features that students will experience during exams. </p>
 
<p>Although useful, the study found that the Check-in Quiz does not eliminate all student anxiety. Instructors will still receive a number of concerned messages regarding the course, but this type of Quiz has been shown to reduce this volume by approximately 80%. Although it may not be a panacea, the Check-in Quiz helped online classes in two major ways: it proactively addressed early student anxieties, and helped alleviate problems that invariably occur later. Ideally, a judicious use of the Check-in Quiz at all levels of education can lessen student anxiety for online instruction as well as improve teaching and learning. And for students enrolled in classes without a Quiz, navigating the major sections of the course website immediately upon given access should also make online learning a more enjoyable experience. </p>
