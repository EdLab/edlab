<p><i>"Edventure is a school for community enterprise—run by and for the local community. Our mission is to inspire, train, and support diverse, unemployed young adults (18–35) to create sustainable livelihoods locally and to help build a more resilient, sustainable and fair community."</i> (<a href="http://www.edventurefrome.org/about-edventure/edventure-in-2-minutes/">Edventure in 2 minutes</a>) </p>
 
<p><b>Enterprise Through Education</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.edventurefrome.org/">Edventure</a>, a learning center located in Frome, England, is not a traditional K-12 school, nor is it a typical university. Instead, it is a school run by the community that caters to unemployed 18 to 35 year olds by training them in "community enterprise." The program is structured in two parts: the first being a two-month startup challenge where participants work in teams to come up with an organization or business; the second is a six-month support program where participants are given mentoring and additional help in getting their idea off the ground. The program is free of charge and Edventure helps participants find affordable living options in the area. Edventure emphasizes the importance of peer, self-directed, and project-based learning, and offers mentorship to help enterprises succeed.</p>

<p><b>Projects, Workshops, and Space</b></p>
 
<p>Last spring’s cohort worked on a project called "SHARE: A library of things," which accepted household equipment, toys, and tools for donation and allowed community members to borrow those items. Members are asked to pay a small donation fee to use the SHARE services, which also includes skill sharing sessions, such as learning how to weave. Other projects in the past have included the creation of a community garden and an office workspace called "The Welsh Mill Hub".</p>
 
<p>The Hub was started by a cohort of Edventure participants, but is now offered to the public through memberships to allow individuals and organizations to work in a creative space with appropriate amenities. Edventure also offers workshops on everything from strategic planning to conflict resolution to facilitation training, all of which are open to the public in order to help people learn about the intricacies behind running an enterprise. As a whole, Edventure offers a variety of different services that foster enterprise development and a non-traditional learning opportunity for those seeking to develop a sustainable life for themselves.</p>
