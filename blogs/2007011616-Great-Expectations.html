          <p>
            I mentioned the radio show <a href=http://www.thislife.org/>This American Life</a> a number of times at Lab meetings. Over the long weekend, I heard two episodes that were of particular interest. The first is called <a href=http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/CPRadio_player.php?podcast=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/xmlfeeds/321.xml&proxyloc=http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/customproxy.php>"Sink or Swim"</a> and in Act One, they speak with a student of color named Chauncey Julius who started out his sophomore year in high school a reformed drug dealer with Â½ of a credit and who became the governor of Tennessee's <a href= http://www.legion.org/?section=prog_evt&subsection=evt_bs&content=evt_bs> Boys State</a>. In the second episode <a href= http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/CPRadio_player.php?podcast=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/xmlfeeds/90.xml&proxyloc=http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/customproxy.php>"Telephone"</a> Act One is about a father who suspects that his son is doing drugs, and so decides to tap his phone. <br/>

These stories raise many interesting questions about education and schooling [if I were ever to teach a “Contemporary Issuesâ€? class I would use both of them]. The first seems like a success story and ends as something else. After winning the governorship, everyone decides that he is a success story and that he will go on to do great things. Everyone jumps to the great things and in the process Chauncey fails to graduate high school. Although he is charismatic, this charisma doesn't work on Algebra.<br/>

In the second story, the father finds that the son is doing drugs, but he doesn't punish him for that. Instead, he makes his son listen to all of the tapes that were made of his phone conversations. This experience–as well as learning of the lengths that his father went to–was extremely educative for him. <br/>

The first story–while offering no concrete morals–raises all kinds of questions about race, educational standards, the gap between success in school and success in life, and the role of the family in education. Similarly, the second raises questions–in a way analogous to Rousseau in Emile–about the potential educational value of surveillance and the role of the tutor/parent. If you have about a half hour, they are worth the time.
