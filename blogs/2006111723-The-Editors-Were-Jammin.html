          <p>
            I just wanted to give a quick update for everyone who couldn't make it to Edit Jam. Thanks especially to Joachim, Skye, and the rest of the design group, it was a really good event. Some highlights:
<ul>
<li>About 30-40 visitors came, including a class of 10-12 high school students from one of Skye's digital studio classes in Brooklyn(?)</li>
<li>There was a great moment in the beginning where all the high schoolers were gathered to the side in a lounge area, and then with a few introductions they exploded into the middle of the show.
<li>2 outside videographers (Christian and Jennifer) were a pleasure to work with. We're looking forward to seeing their footage. <i>(Read more...)</i></li>
<!--break-->
<li>It was definitely a fifth floor learning experience. There were technical difficulties (including power outages) and other obstacles to overcome (the sheer logistics of all the media), but about an hour or two into it everyone had found their rhythm.</li>
<li>The space looked really great, and we captured a lot of great photos.</li>
<li>The food lasted... and everyone seemed pretty comfortable in the media-rich environment.</li>
<li>Breeze (the online broadcast) could have been better with more attention. As DJ Breezy, it was everything I could do just to keep content coming in. Things like chats, polls, and file-sharing were not used at all â€” everyone was very physically involved in the experience. Attending to a little window on the computer was woefully unexciting. But I can imagine ways to make the online experience richer for people who are offsite.</li>
</ul>

All in all, there were a lot of things going on tonight: collaboration in the arts, a blend of digital and analog arts, technology education, and hands-on experimentation in new media and production.

With many hours of videography, photography, other recordings (Breeze & the video mixer), artworks, and other media products, I am hoping we can weave this event into something very special... at least some meaty video. (I will be excited to see folks dive into the post production!)

I also wonder what some of the other outcomes could be. I know the thought of a gallery show was being tossed around. What else?
