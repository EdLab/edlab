Inspired by <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-better-alternative-to-the-5-star-rating-system">this</a> recent Quora Q&A-based discussion, I thought I would take the chance to explore 5-star ratings in the context of <a href="http://pundit.tc.columbia.edu/">Pundit</a>, one of the EdLab's newest creations.  It is especially fitting as Pundit's creation was inspired in-part by the Netflix/Amazon model of intelligent recommendations fueled-by a user's purchasing/renting behavior and personal information.  In our case, instead of shopping or movie rental, Pundit is focused on recommending courses based on user profile information, including interests, education and professional background.  Before diving into Pundit and what a rating system might mean to the platform, listed below is my summary of tips (fittingly) from Netflix executive, John Ciancutti, who is the VP of Engineering and was featured in the Quora Q&A listed above:

1) Experiment and test... each rating system should be UNIQUE to your platform. 

2) Allow "taste input" to dictate service.  For example, force a user to engage in rating to gain a more personalized experience as on Pandora.com.

3) Early user engagement in rating often correlates with later user engagement in rating, so be sure to feature rating systems prominently and make them low-barrier to entry.  

4) Speaking of barriers to entry & engagement... be sure to make ratings fun and game-like!  What are examples of this?  Perhaps "sliders," sounds and animations etc.    

5) Respond to feedback and provide instant feedback gratification.  A thank-you pop-up for example... 

6) Try whenever possible to provide the opportunity to rate content as soon as users engage with it and not later.  Ask users to rate content as or immediately after they engage with it.

7) Allow users to see who else in their trusted network or "social graph" rate similar content highly etc.  

8) Invest in "similar algorithms."  Learn more about these algorithms <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3841851/understanding-the-math-behind-pagerank-and-similar-algorithms">here</a>. 

Now for Pundit... how can we make a rating system for a tool that is meant to facilitate discovery and make course selection more intuitive and engaging?  The potential dangers are great, the first of which would be endangering faculty support and engagement in the tool.  Also, trying to compete with existent "underground" rating sites like <a href="http://www.culpa.info/">Culpa</a> seems like a loosing battle with additional potentially political snafus for the university.  What would be the positive benefits for Pundit?  The first of which would be a more granular way to select courses based on user reviews.  Another option would be to only feature ratings proposed by users in your trusted <a href="http://ednode.com/people/">Ednode</a> network?  That way the ratings might have more relevance and weight for you.  Additionally, we could include, in the Amazon way, an "similar users liked these courses."  The latter option could be a good way to further introduce users to new courses they might be interested in, which is after-all one of the goals of the platform... discovery.  

What would this rating system look like?  To reference tips 1 & 4, Pundit would need a unique, fun rating scale that fits with the general look, tone and feeling of the site which is playful, simple and graphically appealing.  Potential rating systems could incorporate design elements from the logo... like a 5-Eye rating or Pundit Points for classes.  Another option would be a simple thumbs-up or down that is approached in a fun, fresh way.  The EdLab is committed to low-barrier to entry solutions to big problems and issues in the education sector.  Perhaps a rating system will help to further this mission by making course selection even more personal, honest and effective for students.  Especially with mounting school-loan debt, it seems that the "consumers" (students!) at the heart of this crisis should have even more resources that mimic an unbiased "consumer reports" for their higher ed course selection experience.
