          <p>
            Today, on Facebook, I found an article Steve Coll wrote back in May about leaving Facebook. I have to admit that at first glance I thought it was a new article, because I read it immediately upon waking up, and because we had run out of coffee in our home. Reading “the news” from the “friends” whose thoughts I “subscribe to” is like that--breaking news often turns out to be months old. What struck me most about the article is that Coll, who whose books include The Bin Ladens and Ghost Wars, thought to write about Facebook at all.  (The answer to that question is he has a new book, Private Empire, which deals with corporate power. Mystery solved!) Because Facebook's premise is all about ultimate transparency, I often think my own misgivings about Facebook's much commented on flimsy privacy could (could!) be due to my own sense of paranoia. What am I hiding, I wonder, if I'm not comfortable with the ultimate transparency of self? And what constitutes a “self” in a digital era? And why does Facebook have an opinion on how and with whom I share my electronic persona? Developing a new and bold personal transparency requires also developing a broader sense of trust, and is Facebook a trust-worthy company? These are the thoughts that inspire me to leave Facebook on a semi-daily basis.

Steve Coll concludes that he doesn't feel safe on Facebook, and deactivates his account. His most compelling reason for doing so, I thought, is in noting that users in Syria and Iran found Facebook a less oppressive place to express their voices than local law dictates, but that for Americans Facebook Law is actually more oppressive. He goes on to point out, “There is something vaguely dystopian about oppressed peoples in Syria or Iran seeking dignity and liberation inside a corporate sovereign that is, for its part, creating great wealth for its founders and asserting control over its users.” Well said!

Coll deactivating his account reminded me of the time I attempted to deactivate mine. It was last March, about a month before my birthday. I felt oppressed not by corporate ads, but by the banality of “the news” I “subscribed to,” and decided to act on my general lack of trust in what Facebook does with whatever “news” I decide to “publish” on my own wall. If you've ever deactivated your account, you might relate to my swift sense of shock over how thorough the deletion is.  As Coll says, “It takes a while to find it, but if you are a Facebook user, there is a small settings button entitled ‘deactivate account.' If you click, Facebook displays the faces of people ‘who will miss you.'” This is all true, but what happens next is more astonishing: Facebook deletes not just your current and future presence on Facebook, it deletes your entire history as well. If you contributed to past conversations with friends--either through commentary, or photo tagging, or on their wall--your comments get plucked out of the conversation. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but deactivating my Facebook account triggered philosophical thoughts about death. One of the great American (perhaps) myths about dying is that we live on in the memories of loved ones, and so I found it profoundly strange to see that on Facebook, they extinguish every trace of your ever existing on their site at all. After the de-activation, a friend of mine emailed to tell me that former conversations with me on her wall now appeared as though she was talking with herself, and it weirded her out. Another friend noted that photos I had been tagged in were gone from her albums, as well as photos I took of her and tagged her in. I suppose Facebook is doing the right thing there, privacy-wise, deleting everything. But because the social media software has become so uncomfortably ingrained in my daily existence, it felt strange to me to have my “electronic self” wiped out so handily. In one click, my past never happened.

I ended up reinstating my account the day before my birthday, in April, because of the one thing Facebook does very well: help you celebrate achievements. Achievements like being born, for instance. In another click, my entire electronic past came blazing back to life (photos re-tagged, comments re-inserted) as though my life's deletion had never happened. And then, like clockwork, on my birthday came the cheery flood of hundreds of well-wishers, chirping their happiness about my real life and very non-electronic birth. Ah, Facebook. I don't wish you well. But for now, I'm staying.
