Attending school is not only an academic experience for young kids, it is also the perfect environment for socialization. Children learn how to talk to new people, make friends, and share their interests with others. But what if they don’t need their peers to be able to do all of these things? What if they can do it all with the latest toy? </p>

<p><a href="http://toyland.gizmodo.com/this-internet-connected-barbie-can-have-full-conversati-1685896267">Hello Barbie</a> is such a toy. The doll, a longtime friend of kids, will now be able to communicate with individual children via voice recognition technology. The new Hello Barbie is WiFi compatible, and can be wirelessly updated by Mattel, the doll’s creator, to stay current with the latest trends. Barbie will store information she learns about kids in the cloud, where she can call upon it during playtime to customize conversations. She might use it to mention the name of a pet or to ask about the child’s favorite school subject. </p>

<p>As magical as it may be for kids to chat with a doll that can actually remember their previous talks, many parents are vehemently opposed to this toy. Fears for their children’s and their own privacy <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/technology/a-wi-fi-barbie-doll-with-the-soul-of-siri.html?_r=0">have been widely recognized</a>. There is even <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/621/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=17347">a petition</a> to stop Mattel from releasing this "eavesdropping" toy.

<p>There are certainly concerns over how this doll will affect the socialization skills of children, their reliance on technology, and their ability to determine reality from make-believe. Will it erase the need for imagination during playtime, and isn't that the whole benefit of playing with toys? </p>

<p>Does this new talking toy provoke any strong feelings from you the way it has for so many parents? Let us know your thoughts by joining the conversation<a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/22994/"> on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@00:12 kwaku5:</b> How do creators keep the content of the World’s First Interactive Barbie Doll appropriate for its young users?</p>

<p><b>@00:32 LauraCostello:</b> That’s crazy! I wonder if children will be getting their news from Barbie! </p>

<p><b>@01:06 mpowers:</b> Barbie's intense questioning and surveillance of her environment brings to mind the way Elf on a Shelf is preparing children to live in a future police state. (Kidding! ...sort of.) </p>

<p><b>@02:43 Oumar:</b> This innovation could be a possible set back to young girls' abilities to be sociable and open to learning from their peers.</p>
