Virtual schools have become increasingly popular in recent years as educators aspire to transform education on a global level.  In an attempt to achieve this ambitious goal, a number of educators have moved their instructional prowess online.  One popular online outlet is the <a href=" http://www.flvs.net/Pages/default.aspx ">Florida Virtual School</a> (FVS). In addition to its vast catalog of courses for students, FVS also offers extended professional development programs that combine both digital and face-to-face approaches.  In attending weekly meetings with other principals, instructors, and administrators, participants learn how to improve their teaching techniques by sharing best practices and working together to solve shared issues.  At these meetings, they make it a point to not follow a specific agenda laid out by the administration, but instead hold open discussions on what they find most important.  <p>

Due to these interactive in-person meetings, in combination with frequent digital messaging, teachers end up more engaged with their jobs, working even on days they are not teaching.  As a result, they build strong relationships with each other as well as their students. <p>

<b>@01:52 dani100:</b> Love that they are so dedicated to working, and are working all the time because it's important to them. They develop great relationships with each other as well as their students. Making students want to learn should be the main priority for teachers. <p>

<b>@02:04 sjohnson:</b> I used to go to a virtual school a couple years ago and it was a great experience for me. I found out that a lot of students actually chose to attend virtual schools over the traditional schools they had in their neighborhood. The teachers are really dedicated, so much that they end up working all the time. <p>
