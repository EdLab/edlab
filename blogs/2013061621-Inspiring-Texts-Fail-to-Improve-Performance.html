          <p>
            I found this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/jun/11/text-messages-us-high-school-students ">article</a> very interesting. Roland Fryer, an economist at Harvard University conducted an experiment in U.S. Schools where students were sent inspiring text messages. The aim for Roland Fryer was to "assess whether students better understood the link between human capital and outcomes". The experiment was done in state schools in Oklahoma City and included 2,000 students. The students were given free mobile phones in return for receiving daily texts that encouraged students to stay in school and study for exams. The experiment was a success except in one aspect: it made no difference on how the students performed in school. 

I believe the main focus of the experiment should have been on whether the students would perform better with inspiring text messages. The article and the experiment of course supported my statement, the inspiring quotes didn't help improve anything on student performance in school. But what Roland Fryer learned from his experiment was that students did indeed put more effort because of the inspiring messages. But the effort was not effective in producing test scores and the students lacked knowledge in "how to translate effort into output".

What are your thoughts on this experiment?
