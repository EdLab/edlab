<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peak-brain-training/id806223188?mt=8">Peak Brain Training</a> is an app developed by neuroscientists and game experts that functions like a personal trainer for mental fitness. Peak features games that aim to strengthen memory, language skills, focus, problem solving abilities, mental agility, and emotional intelligence. The free version of the app offers over a dozen games, while the "pro" version offers 42 games and unlimited replays with a monthly payment of $2.92.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The personal training model works well for Peak. Users are led by a coach who guides the player through a brain workout while providing words of encouragement. Users set goals and aim to complete a certain amount of daily activities so as to improve skills and chart regular progress. The ability to select the days and times I wanted to receive reminders to complete my "brain training" helped me feel like I was able to set aside time to improve my mental facilities the same way I would my physical ones. Additionally, I felt encouraged to be competitive with myself and with other users through stats that showed my performance over time, percentile within my age group and profession, and individual scores for each game played. </p>

<p>The app is designed well. It’s easy to navigate and I appreciate the energizing color-scheme, and pop up tips are not intrusive. In general, the games themselves are fun and varied. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>When using Peak, I sometimes felt the comprehension of the activity was being tested as opposed to the actual skill the game aims to assess. While many Peak games have straightforward rules, there were a few that took me longer to figure out. A frustrating aspect of the game was that after playing it once, you can’t repeat it again the same day. It was discouraging not to be able to have a second chance and apply the lessons learned from the first round. Having a Pro subscription would likely ease some of the frustration I felt, seeing as this gives players access to unlimited practice and replay of all games. </p>
 
<p>Beyond the frustration, I wanted more information on how the activities were designed to strengthen skills. Since this app was designed in part by neuroscientists, I was hoping for some informative science between game playing to understand the real-world applications. Seeing improvement in your scores won’t necessarily translate to seeing mental improvement in your everyday life if you don’t know what you’re looking for. If the app offered explanations of how these games prepared users for daily tasks, I think I’d appreciate it more. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>As far as "brain training" apps go, Peak is designed thoughtfully and offers a variety of informative features that will keep users coming back. However, I’d recommend a pro subscription for anyone intending to use Peak regularly. Users seriously interested in improving their mental faculties might need to spend additional time outside the app learning about what specifically can affect the skills they’d like to improve. </p>
