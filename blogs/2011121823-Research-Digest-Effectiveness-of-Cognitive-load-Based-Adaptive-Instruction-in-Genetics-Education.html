            <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563210001676">Effectiveness of cognitive-load based adaptive instruction in genetics education</a>.

Conflicting results on the effectiveness and efficiency of adaptive and computer-assisted instruction prompted this study, which compares the success of non-adaptive program control, learner control, and adaptive program control in learning genetics. 

The study consisted of 201 students of different knowledge levels (high school, college freshman, and college sophomores). All students were given a pre-test and a basic introduction before a training phase using the three different conditions stated. Immediately after the training, students received a post-test (identical to the pre-test) and far-transfer test, which measures the ability of students to apply the learned procedures to new learning situations. Mental effort was also measured after each solved problem. 

The results of this study partially confirmed, in a semi-convincing way, the hypothesis that adapting training to the students' individual needs leads to more effective learning and higher learning efficiency. The adaptive program control condition achieved higher training performance scores compared to the non-adaptive program control and learner control conditions, and the college students outperformed the high school students, spending more time-on-task with less mental effort.

What I found most interesting about this study was that the higher training effectiveness of the adaptive program condition is not reflected in superior post-test or far-transfer performance. However, participants in the learner control and adaptive program control conditions solved more problems from lower difficulty levels and fewer problems from higher difficulty levels than participants in the non-adaptive condition. So despite the fact that over 60% of the participants in the adaptive program control condition did not reach the highest difficulty level, they didn't do worse in terms of post-training performance than those who did. Since post-test and far-transfer performance are, in my eyes, real measures of success, I am not convinced any further of adaptive learning's virtues. Though, it is difficult to tell whether this is due to issues with experiment design, if more training time would let students solve more difficult problems and improve both post-test and far-transfer performance, or if adaptive learning simply doesn't improve outcomes.  As with any research in a relatively new field, this study has probably provided more questions than answers, so there's still plenty left to investigate.
