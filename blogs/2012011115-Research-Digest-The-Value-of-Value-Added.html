            <a href="http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/value_added.pdf">Chetty, R., Friedman, J., and Rockoff, j. (2011) The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood.  NBER Working Paper 17699</a> 

A new study by a group of economists on measuring the value-added of individual teachers has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/education/big-study-links-good-teachers-to-lasting-gain.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=value%20add&st=cse">getting some press</a>, and so I thought I'd take a closer look for research digest.
<!--break-->
<b>Description</b>: 
Two advantages of the paper are the size of the dataset (2.5 million students) and the length of time over which the students are tracked (with the use of tax-records matched to the student dataset), allowing the authors to identify effects of teachers, as the title indicates, well into students' adulthoods. Another interesting aspect (noted by the times) is that the paper, although already presented at various seminars over the past year, has yet to be published in a journal, which seems to be an increasing trend in the academic world.

Using standard statistical techniques as well as quasi-experimental tests (i.e. looking at the immediate impact of specific teachers entering or leaving a school), they largely confirm the previous understanding: teacher quality has a modest, but significant effect on student grades.  

As with previous efforts, however, they also found that this effect would largely (although not entirely) fade out after a few years.  So in the second, more interesting part of the paper, they try to find other, more long-term effects of teacher quality.  Using the tax record data previously mentioned, they find that higher teacher quality leads to: a better chance of going to college, higher lifetime earnings, a smaller chance of teen pregnancy, etc. 

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
Although value added modeling does not seem anywhere close to being able to reliably discriminate between individual teachers for the purposes of hiring and firing, it is certainly becoming a powerful part of the case being made that we should be more discriminatory and proactive about such personnel decisions.  This paper, for instance, estimates sizable (hundreds of thousands of dollars) monetary benefits for such practices as retaining highly qualified teachers for another year, or replacing a terrible teacher with an average one.
