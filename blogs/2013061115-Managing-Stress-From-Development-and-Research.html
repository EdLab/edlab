            One of the perks of working at EdLab is that the supervisors incorporate activities such as development and research meetings (which are not really meetings) and seminars. They help alleviate the stress and redundancy that comes with doing productive things every day at the workplace. Developers have a higher level of stress compared to other professions, most of which derive from reaching deadlines. I was worried that I would experience burning out from a heavy workload, however that would hardly become a reality. The developers here are taken care of.

Here are some statistics from this <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2012/08/02/stress-at-work-is-bunk-for-business/">article</a>.
<blockquote>
<li>The 2012 Workplace Survey released by the American Psychological Association suggests that many Americans report chronic work-related stress. 41% said they “feel tense or stressed out during the workday,” an uptick from last year's 36% figure.</li>
<li>In its annual wellness report, Employee Assistance Program provider ComPsych found that 38% of employees can't stop thinking about problems like emotional, health, financial and job concerns.</li>
<li>The World Health Organization estimates that stress costs American businesses $300 billion dollars a year.</li>
<li>Stress was the most common cause of long-term sickness absence for both manual and non-manual employees in CIPD's 2011 Absence Management Survey (a global HR development organization.)</li>
</blockquote>

This <a href="http://www.itexico.com/blog/bid/91330/Build-your-firewall-Ensure-productivity-prevent-Developer-Burnout">article</a> explains the definition of "burn-out", how to spot signs of development stress and ways to alleviate it. A successful developer learns how to manage stress early in their career. 

Happy developing!
