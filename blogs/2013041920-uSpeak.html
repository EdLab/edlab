<p><a href="http://www.uspeaklanguages.com/app/">uSpeak</a> is an iPad app that makes learning Spanish fun with gamified functionality and adaptive technology to personalize the learning experience. The app uses principles from applied linguistics, neuroscience, and behavioral psychology to make language learning a more natural experience compared to other apps that are riddled with flashcard drills. When users launch the app they will be presented with two options to begin their language learning: playing games or exploring the word map. Users are able to play the initial game offerings to unlock other games that become increasingly difficult. The word map section allows the user to explore and learn more deeply about the vocabulary words, which are grouped based on different themes and subjects.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>The gaming elements embedded throughout uSpeak will likely encourage users to keep using the app. When users open the app they can view their current level to see how much of the language they’ve mastered. Also displayed is their current point total and the distance to the next level. Users earn points by completing one of the many games in the app. These games become increasingly challenging and provide deeper learning as users unlock new content. The initial three games deal with word association. The games also ask players to associate real life images with Spanish words which could be a boon for visual learners.</p> 

<p>After each game the system presents the option to review the words covered in the game, This strategy could be useful for reflection and further study of trouble words. In the word map users can look up a Spanish word and access its definition, a related image, how the word is used in context, how it is pronounced, and common synonyms and antonyms. Each word includes statistics on the number of times it was seen throughout the games and the level of mastery.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Some of the real life images used in the games may be misleading and could cause users to select the wrong word which may discourage them from continuing to play. Images should be made more straightforward. This may be a small detail, but it could mean the difference between a fully-immersed user and one who is completely disengaged.</p>

<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>uSpeak is fun and provides gamification features to encourage users to keep returning to the app. Leaning is personalized from the first move in the form of a brief diagnostic test to determine the user’s initial level of understanding. After each game is completed, the learning content adjusts based on user performance so the next time a user plays, the game will adapt the difficulty level to keep challenging the user. The adaptivity should make every turn in the game different. Occasionally new games include the same words to learn, though this repetition may be part of the design. Ideally, the adaptive technology will continue to improve to keep users from becoming too frustrated or bored.</p>

<p><b>The Bottom Line:</b></p>
<p>uSpeak provides fun language learning on the go.</p>
