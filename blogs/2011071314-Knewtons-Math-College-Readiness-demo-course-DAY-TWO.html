            <b>10 a.m.</b>
I didn't realize it, but when I stopped to write my blog post yesterday, I had also just finished up the “Show us what you know” section, and onto a “Workshop.” Apparently, Knewton thinks I need work with circles. Diameters, radii, circumferences, all that jazz. Awesome.
<!--break-->
I've watched three videos already, each followed by a handful of problems to work on.  Each problem then has either a text or video explanation with a step-by-step solution.  Sometimes these questions have follow-up questions, but they keep the old problem on the page, which leads to a good deal of scrolling up and down times because the multiple choice answers are at the top while the new question is toward the bottom.  It's not terribly problematic, however -- just mildly confusing until you get the hang of it.

<b>11 a.m.</b>
My concentration isn't great this morning, otherwise I'd probably be moving along more quickly. I think I found an error with one of Knewton's word problems:

What they really wanted to ask was, “What is the difference between the area of the entire circular target and the area of the red inner zone?” I'd tripped up a few times before because I wasn't reading the word problem carefully enough, and now that I'm finally training myself to do so, I catch this mistake!? I should <i>probably</i> work for Knewton.

<b>12 p.m.</b>
Success! I just totally NAILED the ”Circumference and area” unit. Piece of cake. But this is the first time I haven't seen the big honkin' “NEXT” button. Now what? Back to My Dashboard?

Yep. I do like how Knewton guides you from one unit to another - but not before you've mastered the subject at hand. I can see how this makes an excellent study tool... because seriously, how many times, while studying, have you found yourself avoiding the material you need to study the most? How many times have you pulled out all your notes and books, and thought to yourself, <i>Oh God, where do I start?</i>

And on we go.
