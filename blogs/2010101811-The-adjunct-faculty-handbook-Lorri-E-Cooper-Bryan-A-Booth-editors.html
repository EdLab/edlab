            <strong>Title</strong>: The adjunct faculty handbook: Second Edition
<strong> Editors</strong>: Lorri E. Cooper, Bryan A. Booth
<strong> Publisher</strong>: SAGE Publications, Inc
<strong> Check it out.</strong>: <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search/c?SEARCH=LB2331+.A37+2011&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;searchscope=6&amp;submit=Submit">LB2331 .A37 2011</a>
<strong><a href="http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233897"> From the Publisher</a></strong>: The Adjunct Faculty Handbook, Second Edition provides a full range of academic leaders and adjunct faulty with a much-needed, practical resource to manage the work of adjunct faculty teaching. Since the publication of the first edition in 1996, the number of adjunct faculty members in colleges and universities has increased spectacularly, to the point that most colleges and universities could not function efficiently without them. The revised edition has been updated to address the dramatic changes in higher education that result from institutional dependence on adjunct faculty as well as the striking changes in higher education (such as the role of technology in teaching and learning, the increased emphasis on student evaluations and learning outcomes assessment, and changes in classroom dynamics) in which adjunct faculty must be proficient.

<strong><a href="http://www.flipkart.com/adjunct-faculty-handbook-lorri-cooper-book-1412975190">On the Web</a></strong>: Praise for the First Edition:

"The book is very comprehensive. It gives plenty of practical examples and also refers to teaching and learning theory."- Martin Lightfoot in Management &amp; Education
"This Handbook contains advice and approaches for teaching practices that both new and seasoned faculty can employ to revisit and revitalize what goes on in their classrooms." -Margaret E. Holt, University of Georgia
"Since the <a href="http://educat.tc.columbia.edu/search~S6?/tThe+adjunct+faculty+handbook/tadjunct+faculty+handbook/1,1,2,B/frameset&amp;FF=tadjunct+faculty+handbook&amp;1,,2/indexsort=-">First Edition</a> of <em>The Adjunct Faculty Handbook</em> was published in 1996, the number of adjunct faculty members in colleges and universities has increased to the point that most of those institutions could not function efficiently without them. This Second Edition addresses changes in today's higher education environment and their impact on the role of adjunct instructors. At a time when many adjuncts may be given little more than a start date, room number, and brief course description to prepare them for teaching a course, the Handbook provides administrators as well as part- and full-time faculty members with the resources they need to empower adjunct staff. Key Features Provides important tools for adjunct instructors, including handy checklists, sample syllabi, evaluation forms, and case studies Offers a full chapter on the role of technology in teaching and learning, plus another on future trends, including network technologies Covers the increased emphasis on student evaluations and learning outcomes assessment as well as changes in classroom dynamics and what these mean for today's adjunct faculty Addresses both theory and skill, covering topics such as course planning, teaching strategies, theories of learning, cooperative learning, student evaluations, Web 2.0, professional development, and more Includes practical advice for designing policies for adjunct programs and for evaluating adjunct instructors, who comprise more than two-thirds of the college instructors in the United States today."
