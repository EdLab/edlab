Demetri and I are working on the ALT database and we are currently doing market research. Upon brainstorming our database features and searching for various references and statistics in terms of the audience market, we have some thoughts and welcome comments, suggestions, and new enlightenment from all dear EdLabbers.

We found a major market gap existing between the increasing requests for adaptive learning tools and a void of one-stop resource with updated info of currently used applications. The ALT database is to fulfill this gap by collecting as many existing ALT applications as possible and recommend those that best match the needs of individual users.  As Demetri mentioned in his <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/7310">presentation</a> on D&R meeting, the primary audience of ALT database would be divided into educators, students/parents, researchers, entrepreneurs/developers. One of the ideas regarding the database feature is to develop an intelligent search engine. This interface requires users to provide their need-based information (e.g. educator, would like to find Grade 9-12, free, math, iPad applications), and match these info with a list of learning tools from our database. Meanwhile, these demographic information as well as what application(s) they have browsed would also be recorded. These data may have a potential market value for ALT application developers and entrepreneurs.

Some other thoughts are with regard to promotion of ALT database. 
- Target at colleges or professional training centers that provide courses regarding adaptive learning technologies. Try to reach out to the students/instructors through presentations, guest lectures etc.
- Add a “share” function on our webpage so that the database could be shared on major social media sites (e.g. facebook) or specialized social websites for teachers/students/technology fanatics.
- Join meetup groups who are interested in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYEdTech/">education technology</a>, adaptive learning etc. to know more people in the field and develop a promotion/professional network. 
- Outreach to schools, holding presentations, after-school clubs, student workshops, training sessions etc. for adaptive learning technologies and promote our ALT database.

The ALT project is still at the beginning of its development and we are trying to do more research to explore its potential market value. We welcome any constructive ideas. Meanwhile, if you know any fun application/software/platform that contains adaptive learning elements, feel free to share with us!
