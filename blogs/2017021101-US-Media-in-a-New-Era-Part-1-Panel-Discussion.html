<p>Date: Tuesday February 7, 6-8pm, IAB 1512 </p>
<p>420 West 118th Street, 15th floor</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overview:</span></p>
<p>What are the rights and responsibilities of the media in reporting the new presidency? Days after the inauguration, we will assess whether there have been fundamental changes in the relationship between the administration and the media and how the media needs to respond in order to effectively fulfil the missions of watchdog and agenda setter.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Panelists: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Katrina vanden Heuvel (KV)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anya Schiffrin (AS)</span></p>
<p>Professor, Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs </p>
<p>Director, Technology, Media, and Communications Specialization </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Katrina vanden Heuvel (KV):</span><br /></p>
<p>-there is currently an administration governing by lies and fear mongering</p>
<p>-we saw this type of governance back in the 1960s</p>
<p>-the media needs to expose these types of abuses</p>
<p>-we are in a different place today than we were back in the 60s…</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-too polite to say we are feeling disdain with attempts to try to delegitimize the media</p>
<p>-40% of newspapers have gutted their newsrooms</p>
<p>-Why? Many newsrooms did better financially with paid ads than subscriptions</p>
<p>-the phenomena of cable television has led to “media malpractice”</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-news and entertainment have become intertwined as never before</p>
<p>-there is a tendency to sensationalize the news</p>
<p>-for example, the Tindle report that there was 36 minutes in total of issue coverage in the election (!!!)</p>
<p>-this is a combination of the 3 main stations (e.g., ABC, CBS, NBC)</p>
<p>-media mergers and acquistions have led to a conglomeratization</p>
<p>-from this, a hollowing out of the news has developed</p>
<p>-there is a new FCC commissioner</p>
<p>-there is the potential for an end to net neutrality</p>
<p>-as a result, broadband will no longer be considered as a utility</p>
<p>-therefore, from this, we in the media have stunned by speed and cruelty of the administration over the past two weeks…</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., executive orders)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>-but there are some glimmers of hope:</p>
<p>-lawyers are seeing Band case</p>
<p>-lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have contributed to the resistance</p>
<p>-this resistance has not just erupted in the streets, it has also come from: </p>
<p>-journalists who have come together to fight the autocracy</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-foreign service officials who have stood up to the executive orders</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-judges who are adjudicating the orders</p>
<p>-the resistance has come from “the streets to the suites”</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-the opposition is not like it was in the 1950s or 1960s</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-we are seeing the repoliticization of the people</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-people understand what’s at stake in the current political landscape</p>
<p>-journalists are part of society…</p>
<p>-due to the speed of the internet, we are working in “nanosecond type of media coverage”</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., something newsworthy seems to be happening all the time)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anya Schiffrin (AS):</span><br /></p>
<p>-there are some good things that have been happening for the media:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-greater amount of investigative journalism</p>
<p>-I had a personal encounter with the President during a town hall</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/IMG_8850-PHOTOSHOPPED-1MB-2.jpg" alt="IMG_8850-PHOTOSHOPPED-1MB-2.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Karen Attiah (KA):</span><br /></p>
<p>-what is going on now almost feels like an overreaction to the current political situation</p>
<p>-our job as journalists is to challenge the President at every turn, where it is appropriate</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-we went all in this year</p>
<p>-I believe his actions are a fundamental threat to democracy</p>
<p>-investigations need to call out every falsehood, lie, distortion, etc.</p>
<p>-it could be argued that he has been engaging in national gaslighting</p>
<p>-this is my first time in the mainstream media environment</p>
<p>-I spent a lot of previous time in digital media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-my generation increasingly gets its news from social media</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-this is professionally challenging, but also personally disheartening</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-those who need truth exist in silos, </p>
<p>-it will take an extra effort to reach across these personal silos</p>
<p>-we need to engage in media solidarity</p>
<p>-e.g., we need to fight against the erroneous claim that we have not been reporting on terrorist attacks</p>
<p>-we face a common threat that makes us like each other, at least for a little bit of time…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AS:</span></p>
<p>-I recently attended Davos</p>
<p>-we were talking that the journalism school needs to play a leading role in the new news reality</p>
<p>-for example, during his first press conference, we needed to not ask any other questions until he answered the first question leave</p>
<p>-being together is in the interest of the whole industry and whole country</p>
<p>-we also need to see a sharp increase in paid subscriptions to journalism</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KA:</span></p>
<p>-at the Washington Post, we are now getting more and more subscriptions after the start of the new administration</p>
<p>-we are looking to fight</p>
<p>-however, deep investigative journalism requires great resources</p>
<p>-now more than ever, the public needs to take a sense of ownership in its media outlets</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AS:</span></p>
<p>-everyone needs to pay for as many journalism subscriptions as possible</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcus Mrowka (MM)</span><br /></p>
<p>-the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is involved in the current political situation</p>
<p>-for example, we were involved in the Muslim travel ban</p>
<p>-provided information regarding the confirmation process and vote on Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos</p>
<p>-these were both good examples of useful work that we could do…</p>
<p>-we knew we were going to lose the vote on the DeVos confirmation hearing</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-however, we helped educate our AFT members</p>
<p>-we also tapped into the popular feeling of value of public education</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-something was unleashed in the nomination hearing that we want to take advantage of…</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-it was a good model for the resistance: </p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">			</span>-we need to change the educational narrative</p>
<p>-the journalists got it right away and the facts did matter</p>
<p>-we helped feed journalists what mattered</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KV:</span></p>
<p>-a few points that came up from earlier in the conversation:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-Objectivity:</span></p>
<p>-the media is beginning to find values that have been baked into The Nation’s DNA</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-the media is not adversarial for the sake of being adversarial</p>
<p>-instead, it acts this way for the sake of public accountability</p>
<p>-the media has traditionally preached objectivity</p>
<p>-however, that is beginning to shift</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-you could argue that you are more honest if you describe your values</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-this is more in line with European journalism practices</p>
<p>-but even if you describe your values, you also need to fact check…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">-The Importance of Listening:</span></p>
<p>-we live in our own filter bubble</p>
<p>-many of the media members live and work in California, Oregon, and Washington</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., traditional Democratic Party strongholds)</p>
<p>-we recently sent someone to Lordstown, Ohio</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-we are now doing listening tours around the country</p>
<p>-Michael Massing wrote that the New York Times needs to think of new reporting beats</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-perhaps they should pull staff from the Style beat and start new ones:</p>
<p>-Small Business, </p>
<p>-Culture, </p>
<p>-Religion, </p>
<p>-Blue Collar, etc.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A Possible Solution:</span></p>
<p>-perhaps we need to rethink our hyper coverage of the President’s Twitter account:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-he “wins the morning” and drives the news cycle</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-perhaps we need to think hard about that phenomenon…</p>
<p>-perhaps we could leverage various emerging media powers</p>
<p>-the power of social media,</p>
<p>-the power of journalism,</p>
<p>-the power of  satire (e.g., SNL’s parody of Sean Spicer)</p>
<p>-we should try to investigate these things to reach other communities</p>
<p>-however, we need to be careful. Reality may outstrip satire…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><img src="https://mschool-test.s3.amazonaws.com/tWK9DhH8XiXdBt8Cj/images/IMG_8857-PHOTOSHOPPED-1MB-3.jpg" alt="IMG_8857-PHOTOSHOPPED-1MB-3.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KA:</span></p>
<p>-post-election, there has been some sort of media reaction</p>
<p>-e.g., there has been a sense of self-flagellation that we ignored white males</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-perhaps we created profiles that glamorized the alt-right</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-these phenomena have leveled off a bit</p>
<p>-we have begun to editorialize more</p>
<p>-I was at Washington’s Dulles Airport for the Muslim ban</p>
<p>-it is important for journalists (and citizens) to go and see reactions to events</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., lawyers barred from accessing detainees)</p>
<p>(e.g., see how people of all ages and stripes stand up/out)</p>
<p>-by doing this, we arrive at a greater amount of authenticity</p>
<p>-we need to go back to the ground level</p>
<p>-we need to get past irritation with politics</p>
<p>-we need to go forward to abandon the sense that we (e.g., the Washington Post) are the ultimate gate keepers for news and events</p>
<p>-I am looking forward to seeing people care about what is happening in the rest of the world</p>
<p>-we also need to prioritize outside of news regarding the current administration</p>
<p>-we need to make sure we are paying attention to things outside of the country, outside of the administration</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MM:</span></p>
<p>-The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) has 1.6M members across the country</p>
<p>-our best advocacy and political tool is having our members be storytellers</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., they can be the people who speak to parents, community members, etc.)</p>
<p>-we can also provide teachers with the right lesson plans</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., how to filter out fake news)</p>
<p>(e.g., how to interpret news)</p>
<p>(e.g., how to be critical thinkers)</p>
<p>-we hope to have journalists work with us</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., understanding, judging news stories)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KV: </span></p>
<p>-Americans may begin paying attention to the rest of world due to the spread of “Global Trumpism” occurring across the globe</p>
<p>-(e.g., right wing uprisings in Germany, Netherlands, France, etc.)</p>
<p>-we are still trying to figure out all of the competing forces that have contributed to this right wing swing</p>
<p>-for example, we are seeing new autocrats in Hungary, etc.</p>
<p>-The Nation has begun been looking at “leaks” from the administration</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., leaks regarding agencies clashing early)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., leaks regarding the draft executive order to legalize discrimination against LGBTQIA women</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-apparently Ivanka had words with Pence, etc.)</p>
<p>-these types of battles will go on</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., black sites and torture)</p>
<p>-leaks have been important journalistic tools in the past (e.g., Pentagon Papers, etc.)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-we need to continue using them when appropriate</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AS:</span></p>
<p>-1. Perhaps leaks are meant as float trial balloons to shut down leaks or see how public debate will reach</p>
<p>-2. Leaks have become more dominant on the news cycle of New York Times digital</p>
<p>-you can surf there to go see a lot of leaks and anger</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: facts still matter</span></p>
<p>-however, this leaves us with two perspectives on the issue:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-a. is it a supply-side problem?</p>
<p>-there is a greater amount of disinformation being circulated online</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-b. is it a demand-side problem?</p>
<p>-why are people willing to believe disinformation?</p>
<p>-I am especially happy to hear your answers to this because…</p>
<p>-Global Muckraking course launches tomorrow on EdX</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KV:</span></p>
<p>-media literacy is very important</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-if you don’t believe in facts are important, we should pack journalism up…</p>
<p>-can’t run media enterprise that way</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., ignoring or minimizing the fundamental importance of facts…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MM:</span></p>
<p>-perhaps we need to think about facts wrapped in values</p>
<p>-my hometown is Bristol, CT</p>
<p>-the local newspaper was bought by Sheldon Adelson</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>-he subsequently dismissed the city hall reporter</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-from this development, where do people go for facts?</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>(e.g., especially, in this case, about local news)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KV:</span></p>
<p>-there was the recent incident of KellyAnne Conway speaking erroneously about the fictitious Bowling Green Massacre</p>
<p>-you needed to see the impact of city and state bloggers for accountability…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KA:</span></p>
<p>-there is a strange relationship between:</p>
<p>-(a) the facts v. </p>
<p>-(b) what is “the truth” for people</p>
<p>-the Washington Post is beginning to look to become more of a national paper</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-(e.g., there has been talk of the America Beat </p>
<p>-this would help to report on stories they become national)</p>
<p>-there has not been enough talk about the decimation of local news</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-need to read news to help expose stories…</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., Greg Abbott: reported on shutting funding through sanctuary city laws)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KV:</span></p>
<p>-the local media is in such a weakened state that it is threatening to be shut down</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AS:</span></p>
<p>-I used to cover school boards in rural Pennsylvania</p>
<p>-I worked in an old steel town that was pro-union</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-everyone in the town started to turn against the teachers’ union</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-people started denouncing the state’s Secretary of Education because he was a Jew…</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>-the local reporters were embattled within this combative environment</p>
<p>-as bad as it was, the situation has become even worse</p>
<p>-who will be people standing up for the mass media? Local media?</p>
<p>-will it be billionaires or zillionaires?</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., Mike Bloomberg from Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos from Amazon)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">JV:</span></p>
<p>-the new publishing funding models have made us start to consider co-publishing</p>
<p>-I’m not sure I know much about the gazillionaire model of funding…</p>
<p>-perhaps we should investigate partnership models or non-profit models </p>
<p>(e.g., The Nation)</p>
<p>-there have been instances where local news has been involved in international collaboration</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., the Panama Papers, Wikileaks transnational partnerships)</p>
<p>-there are also models around the world of public interest media</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., government public financing)</p>
<p>-perhaps we could sell off part of the broadcasting spectrum to fund national-based public interest journalism</p>
<p>-funding will become a critical issue moving forward…</p>
<p>-e.g., Pierre Omidyar funds The Intercept</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AS:</span></p>
<p>-is the Soros’ Open Foundation a good model for funding journalism?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MM:</span></p>
<p>-I hope that the Soros Foundation is not our model…</p>
<p>(e.g., Bezos has a track record against unions)</p>
<p>(e.g., Bloomberg has a track record against teachers)</p>
<p>-perhaps we should just take what we can get for now…</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KV:</span></p>
<p>-perhaps as a funding model, we should look at the U.K.’s Scot Trust</p>
<p>(e.g., it has supported The Guardian newspaper)</p>
<p>-perhaps we need to have wealthy stakeholders plus independents</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">KA:</span></p>
<p>-at the Washington Post, we are given a runway to experiment</p>
<p>-we can experiment with robustness </p>
<p>(e.g., if want to explore the breadth and depth of a story)</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>(e.g., can we partner with local media organizations?)</p>
