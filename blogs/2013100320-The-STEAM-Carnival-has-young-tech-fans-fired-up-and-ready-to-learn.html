You won’t find the Bearded Lady at these fairgrounds, and it’s just as well. Every bit as awesome as it sounds, the <a href="http://twobitcircus.com/work/steam-carnival/">STEAM Carnival</a> proves that education and entertainment can be one and the same. It replaces typical carnival amusements, like winning sad goldfish in that impossible water gun racehorse game, with "lasers, robots and fire." The goal of the carnival, put together by the <a href="http://twobitcircus.com/">Two Bit Circus</a> (and funded by Kickstarter), is to inspire kids to want to learn more about the STEAM disciplines by showing them just how interesting those subjects can be. <p>

Co-founders Eric Gradman and Brent Bushnell, self-described artisanal engineers, are the ringleaders of the Two Bit Circus. They noticed that when children play high tech games, their curiosities pique and a door opens. So, they seized the opportunity to create fun-filled learning experiences with their traveling circus of high tech delights. Though currently only slated for west coast stops in Los Angeles and San Francisco beginning in the spring of 2014, the team has plans to expand across the country. <p>

The video above gives a sneak peak at 3 of the attractions you may be able to find at the grand opening of the STEAM Carnival, but there are rumored to be 40 in total already thought up. Any guesses as to what those could be? Any suggestions? I vote for a centrifuge-themed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Up_(ride)">Round Up</a> because that’s just asking to be made.  Add <i>your</i> ideas to the ongoing discussion on <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/10347">Vialogues</a>. <p>

<b>@01:26 elisa.brazil:</b> This is a great example of having continuity in lessons/activities so that students can build upon the knowledge that they gained in prior lessons. In this case, the carnival "brings to life" lessons on pendulums through hands on activities.<p>

<b>@01:45 JordaJean:</b> Such a lucky class to have gotten to this sneak preview into the STEAM Carnival! I wonder what the next city they'll visit (after LA and SF) will be. Will it be another tech-friendly location like Seattle or NYC? Or somewhere where students don't readily have access to such awesome tech toys? I'll definitely be following this story.
