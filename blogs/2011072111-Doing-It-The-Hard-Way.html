          <p>
            I've spent quite a lot of time recently working on an improved search capabilities for Vialogues, which turned out to be a much bigger project than I think anyone realized it would be at first. The feature spanned almost every part of Vialogues in one way or another; user authentication, database structure, stylesheets, AJAX queries, JVM's... I'll spare you the really technical details because I know how ugly it all gets (believe me). 

The biggest obstacle to the process, however,  was the search engine itself. It seems the engine we were using, Pylucene, was never really built to be used in the way we wanted. 

Constantly trying to work around its limitations while navigating unsure deadlines and changing specifications made the project especially difficult and I wasn't able to complete the new search functionality in time. 

As excited as I was to celebrate the release of the new version of Vialogues, I couldn't help feeling disappointed that the search feature I had been working on wasn't included.

I could have continued to hack away until I eventually cobbled together something that worked, but sometimes it's better to just wipe the whiteboard clean (no one uses slate these days right?) and start fresh.

The second time around I used a different engine that was built specifically to be used in exactly the kind of environment that Vialogues lives in. What took weeks before now took about half an hour and the new and improved search feature for Vialogues is just about ready. It should be rolling out in a few days so keep an eye out for it.
