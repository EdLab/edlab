<p><a href="http://mir.audiolabs.uni-erlangen.de/jazztube/">JazzTube</a> combines Youtube videos of famous jazz tracks and the Weimer Jazz Database's set of annotations on each track. Improvised solos are transcribed, information about the featured soloists are displayed, and stats are available. All resources on JazzTube are free.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>There is no denying that JazzTube compiles an impressive amount of information; creating it must have been a serious undertaking. While I went in initially just interested in finding transcriptions of solos, I found myself completely immersed in all of the other data accessible on JazzTube, from interactive artist relationship webs to statistics rating songs by "danceability." The exploratory learning encouraged by this site makes it easy to go in with the intention of learning one specific thing and come out with far more knowledge than you anticipated.</p>
 
<p>If you <i>are</i> looking for something specific, JazzTube has a very comprehensive set of search functions. Different tabs organize results by musician, instrument, song, and record, making it easier to search than YouTube when looking for a specific performance.</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>While JazzTube is clearly comprehensive, there are some gaps which feel like they should be addressed. The transcriptions, though they are accurate, don’t always cover all solos in a piece. For example, on the John Coltrane recording of "My Favorite Things," which is nearly 14 minutes long, the transcription doesn’t start until seven minutes in. While the expectation of transcribing the entire song would be unrealistic, clear notification of where a solo starts and ends within a recording would be very helpful.</p>
 
<p>Additionally, navigating resources was sometimes a bit confusing. The initial search function is great, but once you select a particular piece, parsing out data from recording links and transcriptions gets rather convoluted, especially because sometimes you’re taken to another site in the process. Making the platform more user-friendly should be a priority.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Ultimately, JazzTube seems like a great resource for jazz musicians and enthusiasts. Though there is some room for improvement when it comes to clarity, it is an excellent free tool that I really enjoyed using.</p>
