Still in the alpha stage, <a href="http://www.mentormob.com/">MentorMob</a> is a website developed to collect and make easily accessible every pertinent learning resource available on the Internet for any given topic.  This aggregative labor is open to anyone, and all of the resources for a topic are organized into a step-by-step process.  These tend to result in a mix of videos and articles.
<!--break-->
<b>Pros</b>:
The website's catholic take-all-comers approach to both moderators and resources seems appropriate to this moment in the web's history, for reasons I've discussed in previous posts.  The learning categories include plenty of extra-academic subjects, like training your dog or getting a mortgage.   It's very easy to navigate between the resources of a topic, and there are various social networking options (like making recommendations) which should come in handy.

<b>Cons</b>:
There isn't much for a volunteer editor to do besides link to other web-pages and determine the order in which they're read.  This may be in the service of a more streamlined or user-friendly process (for both creator and consumer of content), but it may also limit the potential usefulness of the website.  There were also assorted glitches as one would expect from such a new program.  

<b>EdLab Relevance</b>:
Having built their website to accommodate all comers, and rely on the internet at large for content, I feel that MentorMob may have limited its ability to sell itself as a provider of serious education, although this may not have been a priority of theirs, anyways.   

<b>Our Takeaway</b>:
Another contender the education resource organizer of the future, MentorMob's ease of use might give it an edge, although most likely only for the more casual educational subjects (I'm thinking of something in-between yahoo answers and Wikipedia).
