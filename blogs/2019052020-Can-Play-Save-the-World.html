<p>As a part of a global experiment to bring play to young children, researchers have installed 513 "play labs" in Uganda, Tanzania, and Bangladesh. These spaces are designed by play scholars and architects using the latest research on neuroscience and child development. Play leaders don't tell students what to do; they simply give them space to explore and learn however they prefer. Parents are asked to contribute 30 to 60 cents a month and volunteer in the space to keep costs low while still creating a sense of investment. This model is delivered by BRAC, the world’s largest NGO, and draws from BRAC’s over 40 years of experience developing schools for the poorest members of Bangladeshi society.</p>

<p>Children of wealthy parents typically attend preschools that provide this kind of play experience, but children in poor communities often do not. This project aims to correct this disparity and hopes their investment in children at this critical age will have a long-term impact.  </p>

<p>What do you think about this experiment? Do you agree with the researchers’ hypothesis that play is critical for a child's development? What do you think about how the play lab is set up with different "worlds"? What are the advantages of the play lab over other early childhood learning models? Add your thoughts to the ongoing discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/48319">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:22 Betsy Harrington:</b> So many social and problem-solving skills are developed through free play. What could be a better way for children to learn to work with others and understand their points of view? </p>

<p><b>@03:49 Rebecca Sullivan:</b> It's so important to ask families to invest in their children's education by making toys or by contributing a small monetary amount. Even if it's just a nominal fee, such an investment can help parents grasp the value that the play lab offers.</p>
