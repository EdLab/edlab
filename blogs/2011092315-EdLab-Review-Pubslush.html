<a href="http://www.pubslush.com/">Pubslush</a> has a lot going on. It's gearing up to be the <a href="http://www.toms.com/">TOMS</a> of books, with a buy one/give one policy. It also aims to be a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> of books, with crowdsourced funding and video solicitations. It's wide-ranging and whiffs of some intense funding without a clear business plan, but it's clear they're spelunking into <i>something</i> and it's pretty exciting. 

<b>Pros:</b>
The Interface is snappy and the overlapping dialogue logo is very cute. I am a fan of the concept, though Unbound may be doing it more feasibly. Though there are few entries for consideration right now, they are extremely wide-reaching. This may be the harbinger of an impossibly large pool of proposals, but at the moment it seems fresh and varied. 

<b>Cons:</b>
Unlike <a href="http://unbound.co.uk/">Unbound</a>, Pubslush does not curate their authors, the result is pretty self-publishy and not in an entirely good way. None of the projects stand out from a funding perspective right now, the most popular has 6 supporters of the necessary 2000. The site also ups the ante on the thing I liked least about Unbound, the cost factor. While I balked at the ~$16 charge for a pledge to an established author, Pubslush is asking users to plunk down $25 on an entirely untested one. Perhaps I'm a little more jaded and piratey than your average book purchaser, but I wouldn't spend $25 on a book even if it was guaranteed to be awesome. The site provides a barrier to entry for authors too, in the form of a scanty and murky <a href="http://accrispin.blogspot.com/2011/09/pubslush-press.html">royalties package</a>.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b>
Pubslush is addressing a need for new models in publishing, but it seems like it's reaching too wildly to be successful in its current state.
