The D&R team is happy to announce the first Alpha release of the Teaching and Learning Network (TLN). In simple terms, TLN aims to combine the best of social networking sites (like Facebook) with a focus on course management and instructional delivery (like the Moodle LMS and other LMSs). 

You can try out this new site at:  http://tln.tc-library.org

<strong>Features in the current release. </strong>

In this initial Alpha release, we are including the features below, which constitute many of the social networking capabilities that will eventually be used along with later LMS-oriented features.

- User profiles and personal avatars. 
- The ability to make connections (aka friending) with other users. 
- Permissions controls throughout the site for who can view and collaborate on different resources. 
- Integration of Netposse to support search and recommendation of users on the network. 
- Usage of CAS authentication, so you can register with the CAS account created for Critter and other library apps. 
- There is a rudimentary blogging platform, but that will actually be removed in future releases (it was a feature enabled out of the box in our underlying technology). You can use this for testing, but it will be replaced in the near future with a better microblogging platform (see below). 

<strong>Upcoming features that we are designing and implementing</strong>

Throughout the summer and in to the fall, we hope to make further releases available for everyone to try out, give feedback on, and use to increase your productivity. One potentially powerful feature that we hope to release in a few weeks is the microblogging infrastructure in TLN. This will allow users to communicate with one another through asynchronous messages and it will also be used by apps such as our forthcoming course platform to update users on activity in the app (such as new content posted inside of a course). We hope people can use this to communicate about their Edlab and library projects in a way that's similar to group status updates in Facebook. 

In addition to the microblogging feature, here are the other features we are building out:

- Implementation of a course platform, where users can create and administer courses. 
- Integration of events created in the network (such as course deadlines) with calendaring systems (eg. Google Calendar, iCal, etc). 
- Creation of "Groups" where projects and events can be hosted to support communication and collaboration of team members. 

<strong>Please give us feedback!</strong>

As always, our biggest reason for doing an Alpha release is to get your critical feedback. Feel free to email myself, Ankit or Joann about any suggestions you have for improvement. We are tinkering around a bit right now with the UI and placement of different links, so advice in that area would be really helpful. Here are some other areas of advice that are important to us right now:

- Branding: we want to rename TLN to something more intuitive and come up with tag lines, UI themes and logos to create a coherent brand for the site. 

- Course platform: we have a rough design of the course platform that we are preparing to implement. Advice on what you would like to see (especially things that are connected with the social networking capabilities) would be really helpful. 

- How should we incorporate institutions in to the TLN framework? We want courses and profiles to be user driven, but at the same time we see a strong value in having institutions like TC and Columbia vet content. We are thinking of 'affiliate' relationships where courses and people can be 'affiliated' with a particular institution, presumably giving those courses and individuals greater weight with people who care about which institution approves. 

<strong>Thanks to everyone working on this project.</strong>

Finally, I'd like to thank all the people who have contributed to this project so far. Ankit Ranka has led much of the development work, with support from Ellen, Weiqi, Haomin and Connie. Joann Agnitti is leading up a lot of the branding and product management of this site moving forward. Chingfu and Jessica Blum have helped lead much of the work on functional design for TLN features. Pranav helped in integrating the CAS system with TLN.
