          <p>
            Consider this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/education/09forprofit.html?_r=1&ref=education">the latest</a> in the slew of for-profit college scandals. At the core of this one, involving Education Management, is the incentives to emphasize quantity over quality. EM is being investigated for focusing on enrollment incentives that encourage recruiters to enroll students regardless of the students' abilities. 

This was the most striking aspect to EM that NYT reported on: "According to the 122-page complaint, Education Management got $2.2 billion of federal financial aid in fiscal 2010, making up 89.3 percent of its net revenues." Clearly this is not a sustainable sector of private industry without public subsidization.

It is clear that EM is not unique in its focus on enrolling as many students possible, if allegations are even found to be partially true. Yet the only prevent this kind of abuse of compensation incentives is to actively regulate the for-profit education industry. This is why for-profit higher education brings on a dilemma for honest conservatives. On the one hand, the honest conservative has a leaning towards markets to deliver goods efficiently that are not subject to clear market failure. On the other hand, honest conservatives are also not the biggest fans of subsidization and have little faith in regulation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">which is actually quite understandable</a>). If these scandals continue to come to the fore, given the political tendency to cut spending in Congress, for-profit higher ed might be on the chopping block sooner than we think.
