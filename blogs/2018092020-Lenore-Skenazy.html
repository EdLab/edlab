<p>10 years ago, journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeRangeKids?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Lenore Skenazy</a> let her nine-year-old son take the subway home from a nearby department store. That simple act created a media firestorm around parenting and supervision of children. Skenazy believed that kids should have more independence and that parents often smothered them with constant hovering, a practice that has only increased with social media. She turned her beliefs into a movement known as <a href="http://www.freerangekids.com/">"Free-Range Kids,"</a> which has recently been formalized into the <a href="https://letgrow.org/">"Let Grow,"</a> organization that promotes an open and free form of parenting to the public and to schools.</p> 

<p><b>Can you describe to our readers the concept of "Free-Range Kids?" How did you get inspired to start this movement?</b><br> <p>When our younger son, Izzy, was 9, he started asking my husband and me if we would take him someplace and let him find his own way home on the subway. So one sunny Sunday I took him to Bloomingdales and said, "Today’s the day." When he got to our apartment about an hour later, he was levitating, he was so proud. I wrote a column, <a href="https://www.nysun.com/opinion/why-i-let-my-9-year-old-ride-subway-alone/73976/">"Why I Let My 9-Year-Old Ride the Subway Alone,"</a> and two days later I was on <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkRQE011vNY&t=110s">The Today Show</a></i> MSNBC, Fox News and (for contrast) NPR.</p>

<p>Everyone asked: "But how would you have felt if he never came home?" And that’s when I came to realize: to be a good parent in America today you are supposed to imagine the worst possible fate any time you take your eyes off your child. My crime was believing in my son.</p>
 
<p>So I started my Free-Range Kids blog to explain: I believe in safety! I love helmets, carseats and my boys! I just don’t believe kids need a security detail every time they leave the home. The blog became <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Free-Range-Raise-Self-Reliant-Children-Without/dp/0470574755"><i>a book</i></a> and a movement that says it’s time to stop overestimating danger and underestimating our kids.</p>

<p><b>How has social media factored into the way parents are raising their kids today? Do you have any advice for parents to disconnect?</b><br> <p>Social media is great at spreading fear under the guise of advice. I see so many posts that begin, "I never thought it would happen to me!"</p> 
 
<p>They go on: "I was at Target with my kids. A man was staring at them. We walked two aisles over and there he was again! I am SURE he was going to sex traffic them! But I stared him down." These posts make us feel as if no kid is ever safe if the mom so much as glances down at her phone. My advice is to always <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-ikea-trafficking/">check Snopes</a>. Usually the scariest stories turn out to be urban legends.</p> 

<p><b>Can you tell us more about your work and involvement with the Let Grow organization? Why was it important to formalize the movement? </b><br> <p>It’s been 10 years since Izzy’s subway ride. "Free-Range Kids" is <a href="https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2018/05/11/weekly-word-watch-fail-free-range-parenting-glitter-butt//">in the dictionary now</a>. Utah just passed a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/28/utahs-free-range-parenting-law-said-to-be-first-in-the-nation/?utm_term=.aa01f7924550">Free-Range Parenting bill</a>. Many people WANT their kids to grow up more independent and resilient. But they can’t do it alone. Send your kid outside? There’s no one to play with. Have them walk to a friend’s? The other parent drives them home. So while Free-Range Kids changed a lot of minds, <a href="https://letgrow.org/our-mission/">Let Grow</a>, my new non-profit, is dedicated to changing <i>behavior</i>. And the only way to do that is by defying the culture of fear TOGETHER.</p>
<p>That’s why now we have schools doing the <a href="https://letgrow.org/program/lgproject/">Let Grow Project</a>; teachers tell the kids to go home and do one thing on their own that they feel ready to do, like walk the dog, or run an errand. It changes parents and kids in an afternoon! Afterward, 58% of the parents said they're ready to let their kids do more on their own.</p>
<p>Our other initiative is to keep schools open for <a href="https://letgrow.org/program/after-school-free-play/">before- or after-school free play</a>, so kids learn how to organize a game, solve an argument and deal with frustration… without adult intervention. That’s social-emotional master class right there.</p>
