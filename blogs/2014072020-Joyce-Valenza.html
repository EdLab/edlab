<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory (background) affect your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I’ve been a school librarian for 25 years, and before that a public and special librarian. My school library was a lab—a libratory(?) for discovering what worked—how students might be truly engaged in meaningful inquiry, connected learning and creating authentic products leveraging information and communication technologies and social media.
<p>
My interest in technology led me to writing journal articles and a weekly column in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, blogging and speaking.  I am currently an assistant professor at Rutgers University School of Communication and Information teaching courses in social media and school library management.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What professional experiences have been most formative to your current work?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Three incidents come immediately to mind as formative.
<p>
In my first official professional job at the Franklin Institute, my task was to lead the staff scientists in building the first pre-internet online bibliography on carcinogens for Stanford University. The work was designed to significantly speed access to time-sensitive information for doctors and researchers who previously had to wait for news and research updates through the peer review and publishing process. To search, they then had to wait for the quarterly publications of the scientific and medical citation indexes. I discovered that information access is serious business and that our pilot database could make a life and death difference.
<p>
In 1996, I asked a few students to help me learn a little code and develop a library website.  My daughter created the image map, or schema, that visually translated library services for blended use. That collaborative effort with learners was my first step into the world of curation, embedded practice and using technology to share my instructional voice. We won an international award for that early effort and I continued to work with my students for 16 years on improving digital space.  Through all its iterations, our site was used day and night and convinced me of the value of embedded practice, and flipped/blended instruction involving libraries.
<p>
Back in 2001 I taught my first university course online.  After a break of around 11 years, I returned to pre-service education.  When I returned to the learning management system (LMS) after all those years, I realized that not much had changed, while outside the LMS change had pretty much blown the walls off our libraries and classrooms. I also discovered that many of my students who used social media <i>socially</i>, had never seriously realized its potential for networked learning, social action, professional growth and building social capital. This stark comparison led me to explorations involving social media immersion at the university level and efforts to transform <i>online learning</i> into <i>connected learning</i>.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Equity is a critical issue.  Some students have unfettered access to the tools of their time throughout their K12 experience. They learn how to curate. They learn to engage with authors and experts and collaborate with peers all over the world. They understand the power of being part of a network and how to contribute by ethically remixing, adding value, participating.  Some do not.
<p>
Some students grow up experiencing rich K12 library experiences. They have a rich search toolkit, are introduced to academic literature—databases, journals, ebooks.  They know when Twitter and tools for curation and discovery are the best starting points. They learn how to ask meaningful questions; find, manage, and use information; and use what they’ve learned and to amplify their voices by telling powerful stories and participating across communication platforms. Some do not.
<p>
I believe there has been no better, no more exciting, no more important time to be a school librarian.  Now that I am at the university, I want to prepare librarians with vision—who get what digital literacy looks like and can lead their schools in modeling it while actively engaging learners and involving them in meaningful work.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?
<br>

<b>Answer:</b> I hope that we will creatively address and improve the current approaches many universities take to online learning. There’s a vast difference between online learning and connected learning.  It’s time to break out of the LMS and play and learn in authentic spaces.
<p>
Fabulous open educational resources and current awareness feeds are proliferating at a rate we simply can’t manage, prompting the need for curation in the classroom.  The ability to filter, evaluate and manage information in a tsunami-type landscape is critical.  Curation and personal knowledge management/mastery are newly essential skills.  
<p>
The world outside of our schools is not reading term papers. There are multiple ways to read and write. Our learners must be transliterate or metaliterate. Even at the youngest level, research is not reporting. It ought to be a training ground for real-life problem-solving, decision- and difference-making.  
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>

<b>Answer:</b> Currently I am working on a book for the American Library Association exploring social media curation efforts across the library world. My next project will involve a large-scale investigation of youth information seeking and gathering through a digital citation generator.
