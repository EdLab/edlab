          <p>
            Last week, I <a href="http://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/index.php?q=node/9670">blogged</a> about a Texas teenager who was thrown behind bars to serve eight years for a “sarcastic Facebook comment.” The teenager, Justin Carter, is being charged for “terroristic threats” and third degree felony and has been in prison since March 27.  Justin posted this comment (“I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still, beating hearts…”) on Facebook after being provoked by someone while playing the video game League of Legends.

According to NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/07/11/201202207/anonymous-person-posts-500-000-bond-to-free-texas-teen">news</a>, Justin has been released from prison after an anonymous person paid the $500,000 bill that was required for him to become a free person. This was a huge sum of money that Justin's family and friends were struggling to raise in order to free Justin.  But a stranger has paid that bill and saved their son's life. Justin is now a free man,  “he's glad he's out and feel relieved.” According to Justin's attorney, Don Flanary, the unknown donor called him and said he wanted to help. As of now, Justin is staying with his family in Texas and waiting for his trial on felony terroristic treat charge.
