            Life on the streets, anywhere in the world, can be really dangerous. Children tend to be the most vulnerable among those who end up on the streets and have to make ends meet for while living on the streets. Perhaps a good initiative for most street children is to bring them together at a particular event for them to tell their stories. This <a/ href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/15/street-child-world-cup-brazil">article</a> sheds light on a soccer tournament in Brazil that is designed for only street children from all over the world. The tournament was aimed at bringing street children together in order to make them feel that they were part of society.

Aside the great talents that were showcased during this tournament, there were also stories that the children shared that were very disturbing. Some of the street children emphasized that they are always subject to violence from the police. In most cases, street children are left with no option but to join gangs in the streets in order to avoid being killed by these same gangs. The tournament organizers urged the authorities in the children's local areas to ensure that the children are granted birth certificates and are also treated with respect. For these street children, this was more than just a tournament.
