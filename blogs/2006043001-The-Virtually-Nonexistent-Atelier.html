          <p>
            With my dissertation behind me, I am once again thinking about the future of media/design at EdLab.

Big changes are needed soon. We're in a lull. Maybe the Arthur Levine project will shock us out of it, or maybe something else will land on the fifth floor. Either way, we need to make some serious headway... <!--break-->

Without attending to what we want and need, the "library" is going to overcome the "lab" (and maybe not only the media designers). There are always patrons with minor requests, machines that demand our attention, and administrative holes we need to fill. Enough! We can do it with one hand. We should be talking about the small details of BIG projects, and acting on it.

The school of the future and the publication for educational consumers are solid ideas. I'm afraid, however, that we don't have enough hands-on experience assembling next-generation ideas, media, and objects to get these projects off the ground in a truly innovative way. To get experience, we need to focus on what's in front of us: TC students with personal missions, TC professors with research agendas, and the GL task of serving as an information provider to everyone.

But we have to start thinking like producers–remember why you came here to learn!

The EdLab Design Center doesn't really need to help people make posters. It doesn't really need to help people publish on the web. It certainly doesn't need to take patrons step by step through a design process, and we're not going to be the one's to finally get them to use a computer. We are here to provide an environment for production.

We have an atelier, and we need to use it. We need to be the "masters" on center stage making products that will inject some life into the community! But the atelier doesn't have to be the same old atelier as 200 years ago–the students sure aren't the same. They don't need to see the wizard behind the curtain–they just want to feel like they're a part of the magic. So what is the role of an atelier today? People already have all the information they need to chisel their masterpiece out of marble: they've got a resource for every excuse why they haven't done "it" yet. What they need is a place to work.

The atelier needs to be a vibrant and engaging environment–and vibrant and engaging in the way the community expects and deserves. To achieve this, we need to make great stuff. Period.

If we could achieve this–strike the right balance–we will find ourselves in the school of the future. We'll find ourselves making the publications that matter.

We need to start with what we know, and jump.
