<p>Stephen Smith is president and chief product officer at <a href="https://www.hobsons.com/">Hobsons</a>, a company that enables educators to improve college and career planning, admissions and enrollment management, student success, and advising. He oversees Hobsons’ global product strategy, corporate development, student data privacy, and R&D impacting more than 12 million students and 12,000 schools, colleges, and universities in more than 100 countries. </p>

<p>Smith joined Hobsons in 2007 through the acquisition of <a href="https://www.naviance.com/">Naviance</a>, where he was Co-Founder and Chief Executive. Prior to Naviance, Smith was Vice President of Digital Product Development at Peterson’s, then a division of The Thomson Corporation (now Thomson Reuters), where he helped transform a traditional print publishing business into a leading online provider of education information. Smith has also served as a practitioner faculty member at Johns Hopkins University where he taught graduate level coursework in marketing and technology. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, cum laude, and an MBA from Cornell University.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and professional experience shape your work now at Hobsons?</b><br>
<p>Both of my parents were educators in public schools. My mother taught elementary school, mostly first grade, and my father taught high school English before becoming a high school assistant principal and ultimately a high school principal. I learned a lot from visiting my mom’s classroom and was always moved by the enthusiasm the children in her class brought to school every day. My dad taught me how schools run by volunteering my time each summer to help him build the master schedule for his school. I never intended to study education formally, but while I was working on my undergraduate degree in history, I became really interested in the debate that was taking place at the turn of the twentieth-century about how to design the curriculum for American high schools. I wrote a senior thesis about that debate between advocates of the liberal arts and those promoting vocational study. It’s fascinating that we’re still having the same debate more than 100 years later.</p>

<p>From a very early age, I was passionate about public schools and interested in understanding what we could do to improve the educational experience for all students. I co-founded Naviance in 2001 with two other guys, one of whom, a classmate of mine from Cornell named Shaun Fanning, still works with me every day. We stayed with the business after we sold Naviance to Hobsons in 2007. Today at Hobsons, Shaun serves as head of research and development while I serve as president and chief product officer. We have been incredibly fortunate to work with so many outstanding educators over the past 16 years. We truly appreciate the work we have been able to do at Hobsons to better connect K–12 education and higher education to improve equity, access, and completion.</p>

<p><b>How do you hope your work at Hobsons will change the learning landscape?</b><br>
<p>We want to change the way students make choices about what and where to study. Although we’re not in the business of teaching and learning <i>per se</i>, we are helping millions of students every year to see learning as something exciting and personally beneficial. We’re trying to make it easier for learners of all ages to sort through the options they have in the context of their education and life goals. We believe that we can improve the match between students and institutions, leading to greater levels of engagement, higher achievement, and better outcomes for students and society.</p>

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>I believe the shift in the balance of power from institutions to students, at all levels but especially in higher education, has been profound. It has a huge impact on how we learn. Even though our education system has a reputation for being slow to change, this shift has taken place quickly and offers many new ways for students to <i>go to school</i>. This includes online school and university courses, dual enrollment programs, and competency-based learning. The variety can be confusing to many students and prospective students; however, it allows for far more flexibility to meet every student where they are and help them get to where they want to be.</p>

<p><b>Apart from your role at Hobsons, what are you currently working on & what is your next big project?</b><br>
<p>I’m privileged to be the vice chair of the board at College Possible and a member of the board of the National College Access Network. I also enjoy talking with other founders of education technology companies and sharing what we learned from Naviance about having an impact on education by embracing schools, rather than disrupting them. Shaun and I are also in the process of writing a book that will be published later this year by Wiley about how schools and parents can coach teenagers as they explore who they are and make plans for their education and their life.</p>

<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p>I really should make better use of Twitter, but at the moment I am not following much of interest.</p>
