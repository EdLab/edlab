            Columbia Technology Ventures, the <a href="www.techventures.columbia.edu">technology transfer office</a> of Columbia University, will host an interesting speaker discussion on Wednesday, December 2, 2009 entitled "Protecting Your Scholarship: Copyrights, Publication Agreements, and Open Access."

Guest speakers Dr. Kenneth Crews, Director, Copyright Advisory Office (CAO) and Sarah Holsted, Center for Digital Research & Scholarship, Columbia University, will lead a discussion on copyrightable works. Copyrightable works include the traditional products of academic activity and inquiry, including books, articles, lectures and class notes, as well as software, databases, websites, schematics, drawings, blueprints, renderings, movies, songs, lyrics, sculpture, choreography, landscape designs, and many other products of human creativity. 

Questions addressed during this event include:
<li> Can you use even your own works for teaching and research?</li>
<li> Will someone else profit from them?</li> 
<li> Can you participate in the massive Google book scanning project?</li>

Their conversation will also include an introduction to Academic Commons, the repository system established at Columbia University to help facilitate access to your research.
