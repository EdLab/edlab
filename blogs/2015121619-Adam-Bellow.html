<p>Adam Bellow is one of today’s leading speakers on educational technology. Having worked as an English teacher, a technology integration specialist, and a technology director, Bellow has contributed to the edtech space for the past twelve years. He is the founder of eduTecher, eduClipper, WeLearnedIt, and eduGames—Circuits!. Bellow is currently CEO of <a href="https://educlipper.net/">eduClipper,</a> a free web tool focused on helping students and teachers find, share, and build valid learning experiences in a K-12 safe educational social platform. He is also the co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUNDLE-Dembo-Bellow-Untangling-Interactive/dp/1452274339">
<i>Untangling the Web</i></a> and a contributing author to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Educators-Creating-Connections-Corwin-Connected-ebook/dp/B013IBFLXS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1449677551&sr=1-1&keywords=the+educators+guide+to+creating+connections"><i>The Educator’s Guide to Creating Connections.</i></a> </p>

<p><b>How did your educational trajectory, particularly your background in Film Production and Sociology, and professional experience as Director of Technology for various education organizations, shape your current work?</b><br>
My parents were both career educators and when I graduated from college with a degree in film school and in search of a career, I decided to go into the family business. Film studies influenced my eye for product and presentation design, but my experience in schools and educational organizations is what drives the work I have done and continue to do. Working with educators and students has helped me to understand some of their frustrations and needs as well as what they are looking for as remedies.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work in education and technology broadly, and eduClipper specifically, will change the learning landscape? </b><br>
In 2012 when I started eduClipper, the social networks that were designed around learning claimed to be "safe social platforms" for schools, but they were basically digital walls around a teacher and students. Teachers could collaborate, but students didn't have the same luxuries. eduClipper was built on a premise that we (both educators and students) can learn with, and from, one another and as long as we ensure student safety we could open some of those walls and allow a more valuable learning experience. Sharing content is not novel at this point as there are lots of platforms that allow just that. I think what makes eduClipper unique is that it allows the sharing, collaboration, and student showcasing of their work in digital portfolios, but not defined solely or owned by the adult—the owner is the student and the platform grows with the user instead of the class. I think that I have started to see others in the space take this approach. While it is nice to know we did it first, it is even more rewarding to see the end-game evolving as it gives students the freedom to learn and grow over time. </p>
 
<p><b>You must have mined hundreds of websites and tools for your book <i>Untangling the Web: 20 Tools to Power Up Your Your Teaching</i>. What was that process like? What trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? </b><br>
Working on <i>Untangling the Web</i> with Steve Dembo was a lot of fun. It also took a tremendous amount of thinking about the edtech space. The process started with a list of over 100 tools that we liked and shared at conferences. We then whittled the list down to the ones that we thought were either staples and have been overlooked because they were not "new and sexy" anymore or were responses to a great need in education. The goal was to provide a deep look at the content of the tool and how it can be used in the classroom with real examples and ideas for implementation as well as some helpful tips and endorsements from our colleagues on Twitter.</p>

<p> The overwhelming trend for what comes next is going to be about empowerment of the user. I think the <a href="http://www.edcamp.org/">Edcamp movement</a>, the popularity of the teacher originated <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/edchat?src=hash">#Edchats</a> on Twitter, and up-and-coming ideas like <a href="http://www.breakoutedu.com/">BreakoutEDU</a> will be the future. Educators are taking back the professional aspects of the classroom. There will be more teacher entrepreneurs who are solving problems and sharing those solutions with people in more places.</p>
 
<p><b>What are you currently working on and what is your next big project?</b><br>
I am currently serving as the Founder and CEO of eduClipper. We are releasing quite a bit of new functionality with our new mobile apps before the end of the year, including a teacher resource marketplace. I am also working on a side-project called "Double-click to Edit," which will be a book and video series about the art of presentation. I do some presenting in the education/Edtech space which I am excited about and I also serve as a member of the Board of the Edcamp Foundation. I am always looking to improve the products I have created as well as develop new ideas, and spread new thinking, about how to make the education space even stronger. </p>
 
</p></b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br> 
I have a Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/adambellow">@adambellow</a> and am following tons of dedicated educators and students.</p>

<p>James Sanders <a href="https://twitter.com/jamestsanders">@jamestsanders</a> is doing great things. He is the founder of BreakoutEDU and a former Presidential Innovation Fellows.</p>

<p>Tony Sinanis <a href="https://twitter.com/TonySinanis">@TonySinsanis</a> is a principal in New York who is infectiously awesome and always sharing wonderful moments from his school life.</p>

<p>Katrina Stevens <a href="https://twitter.com/KatrinaStevens1">@KatrinaStevens1</a> is a wonderful former teacher and entrepreneur and now serves at the Department of Education and still straddles the world of innovation and practical educational implementation.</p>
