<p><a href="https://padlet.com">Padlet</a> is a learning management platform that lets you create shareable bulletin-board style pages and join and contribute to other projects. It’s geared toward both classroom and business use with an emphasis on its collaborative capabilities, and is available for desktop, tablet, and smartphone use.</p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Padlet is intuitive, easy to use, and flexible. While it’s simple to add content to a padlet, the platform also lets you customize your project in so many ways, from choosing backgrounds and fonts to color schemes and feedback emojis. When you sign up, you’re prompted to create your own padlet using one of the many pre-made templates or starting from a blank slate. You can add posts to your padlet that include photos, text, web links, videos, and even screen recordings. You can also conduct Google searches directly on the platform, making it incredibly convenient to upload items onto your padlet.</p>
 
<p>One of the features that makes Padlet great for educational settings is that it allows you to join and collaborate on other projects. As such, students can use it to collaborate on a project, or teachers can use it to collect student responses to a particular prompt. Each post can also include comments and different reaction features such as a thumbs up or thumbs down, a heart emoji, or a 5-star rating system. Also, Padlet automatically replaces curse words with emojis, so teachers don’t have to worry about bad language.</p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Padlet seems best suited for short entries rather than long ones. Because there is no "see more" option for posts, all posts are displayed in their entirety on each padlet’s homepage. As such, Padlet could prove more useful for text-heavy writing projects if there were an option to display just a preview of each post on the homepage. This feature could also make it possible to include more than one type of media per post. As it stands, you can only include either a picture, video, or other media file rather than being able to include multiple types in the same post.</p>
 
<p>Also, full access to Padlet requires a fee. Teacher access (which includes all of their student accounts as well) costs $12 per month and $99 annually. Individual plans start at $8.25 monthly. While there is a free version, it limits users to only three projects. Basically, unless you only need Padlet on an extremely temporary basis, you will have to pay for access.</p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>Overall, Padlet is a great tool for collaboration and educational settings. Teachers and students can use it to showcase individual projects, collaborate with others, and offer feedback. That said, some of Padlet’s features make it less relevant for text-heavy projects and purely individual use.</p>
