<p>Adding references to academic papers can be a drag. <a href="https://www.refme.com/i/b/">RefME</a> allows students to create bibliographies, citations, and reference lists in seconds. The app turns your mobile device from a humble means of communication to a junior research assistant in seconds. RefME leverages the bar code scanning ability of your phone or tablet and turns it into your own mini reference librarian!   </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>RefME is a real gem due to its versatility. It includes thousands of reference styles to choose from. This includes not only the majors like APA, Chicago, Harvard, and MLA, but also ones far off the beaten path like Fachhochschule Kiel or Acta Botanica Gallica. If there is an academic institution with a house reference style, chances are RefME knows it. Das ist gut! </p>

<p>RefME’s barcode reading capability is top shelf. After you launch the program, a handy digital square barcode outline is placed on the screen of your device. Fit this outline over your book barcode, the app will sense a match, and automatically snap a picture! RefME even works in low light settings. However, results may vary depending on the quality of your camera, and darkness of your room—library owls, be warned. As advertised, RefME allows you to use barcodes to scan books and instantly convert source material to a reference. However, other media can also be converted such as articles, web pages, videos, newspapers, reports, and book chapters, etc. Literally anything that your device’s camera can sense, consisting of referenced material, will be digitally converted for you to a formal reference.</p>

<p>RefME allows you to locate your scanned reference information in many ways. Log in to the main website <a href="https://www.refme.com">www.RefME.com</a> to see your references or transfer them to Google Docs, Mendeley, or similar services from its web platform. References move from your device, to the main website in a hot second. You can readily automate collecting source material.  </p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>The user experience with RefME is so good, and the workflow is so fast and accurate, there is nothing wrong with this app. As long as you have a decent mobile device with a camera, and a modicum of light, it is hard to imagine what you can do wrong.    </p>

<p>However, for those who worry about having their valuable information exclusively on the cloud, I would recommend downloading your reference information from the website, especially if an urgent paper is due on short notice. Also, RefME’s ease of use may lead to an overabundance of pulling quotes from sourced material. Excellent academic scholarship is premised on the expression of rigorously tested novel ideas. Including a comprehensive literature review is important. However, the willy-nilly incorporation of others’ ideas without your original thought could prove the death of your own personal scholarship. Express yourself, not someone else. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>RefME is an excellent app that lightens some of the dark drudgery of library-based scholarship. It is intuitively designed and simple to use. Just ensure you use the app for key texts that you study in depth. Otherwise, your cursory examination of academic material can unfortunately mimic the way that your camera reads the barcode of a textbook—it’s simply scanning.     </p>
