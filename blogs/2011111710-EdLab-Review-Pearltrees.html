<b>Description:</b> <a href ="http://www.pearltrees.com/">  Pearltrees</a>  is a social bookmarking site that has a unique way of organizing anything you bookmarked on the web. Pearltrees uses a <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(graph_theory)">node system</a> to organize websites you bookmark through their bookmarking Chrome extension. The website refers one type of node as a “pearl”, and each pearl represents a website that the user has bookmarked. You can connect pearls to each other in any way you wish. The other type of node is a “pearltree”, and the pearltree works just like a folder: you name it and add items to it that are all related. <a href ="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/2114"> Here's a Vialogue</a> with their video explaining the pearl features quite well.

<b>Pros:</b> This site has a neat way of visualizing all of your bookmarks. It lets you look at the big picture of all your bookmarks or focus on some specific bookmarks that would be grouped together by the pearltrees. You can also browse through other user's pearltrees and discover new websites, and also join their pearltrees to help them curate more websites. 

When you click on a pearl you will be taken straight to the website, with a Pearltree toolbar on top of the page that gives you several options like commenting, picking the site to be added as a pearl, moving on to the next pearl in the pearltree, or going back to the your Pearltree site. 

The fact that your bookmarks can be accessed just by logging on to the website means that you can access your bookmarks anywhere, and this would appeal to people who use multiple computers like me. 

<b>Cons:</b> Navigating the site was a bit tricky at first, and it took me a while to fully understand all the buttons and features on my homepage. There were some tasks that seemed tricky at first, like checking details on each node. To do this, you need to hover your mouse over a node until a black circle appears in it, then click on the details icon in the lower right hand corner of the screen. This can be a bit frustrating since on your way to the details icon, you might select another node by accident, and you would need to start over. The easier way to find out the details of a node is to right click it and select the details option. It would be great if this was mentioned in one of the help videos. 

Although the site itself is very simplistic, there are some features that aren't needed. For example, the arrows that surround your pearltrees when you hover your mouse over them moves the page in the arrow's direction and too quickly in my opinion. I believe that most people would prefer the drag and drop method of navigation, which you can also do on the site, because it's similar to the way you would navigate on any touch screen device.

<b>EdLab Relevance:</b> It was a big coincidence discovering this site after the last week's EdLab Development & Research meeting we had with Janice Joo about data visualization. The node system in Pearltrees is similar to what Gary, Pranav and I were talking about when we were explaining how to organize our data from <a href ="http://pocketknowledge.tc.columbia.edu/home.php"> Pocket Knowledge</a>. Of course the node system that our group was thinking of would have more information embedded in each node. The pearls in a pearltree just shows the website icon and the name at first glance. You would need to open up a details window to find out more about the pearl. 

For PocketKnowledge, we would include different symbols or colors to represent an item's subject, publish year, and number of hits, etc. in the node itself. This is so that users would see useful information on the item at first glance, which would help users decide more quickly whether the item is what they want to view, or if they need to keep exploring.

<b>Our Takeaway:</b> This is another site that would be useful during research, and the social aspect can really help users discover more websites that relate to what their looking for from the ‘net. One type of research that would really get a boost from this site is the research for the New Learning Times (NLT). You can group the different websites that would be useful for inspiration for the NLT, comment on them, and discover other websites that are similar. Here's a screenshot of my own pearltree that I'm using to do research on math and social media sites (it's small now but it'll grow soon):
