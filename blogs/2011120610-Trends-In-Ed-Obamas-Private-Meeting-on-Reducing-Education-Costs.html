The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/education/obama-meets-with-college-leaders-on-rising-costs.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&ref=education&adxnnlx=1323180091-25eUhNASjC341ccK1x/72g">Obama administration met with college presidents and leaders of education NPOs</a> to discuss what to do about the rising cost of college and improving graduation rates. President Obama led the meeting for an hour with the educators and then the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, took over. Among the topics that were discussed, one was the the importance of fundamental restructuring of the traditional model of higher education, making greater and <b>different</b>, use of technology in order to curb costs. 

The trend that they all agreed on is that additional financing for education would be scarce in the coming years, making it crucial to improve affordability and graduation rates. The trend that they <b>hope</b> to see happen is more blended learning and for technology to not just be an add-on to the current model, but be the change for the model itself.

I've had a lot of professors who choose not to utilize technology in the classroom or even post their syllabi online. I agree that it is vital to challenge our faculty to think differently about teaching and technology. One of the participants did note in the meeting that he personally uncomfortable when people start talking about replacing faculty with technology. Perhaps this is the reason why a lot of the older generation of faculty is a bit (or very) hesitant about allowing technology to take a bigger role in their classroom. Reducing costs and restructuring models is a pretty calculated task involved cold, hard numbers and figures, but the people-aspect of the picture should not be blotted out. If institutions and its administrators really want their policies and visions to come together, they need provide more motivation and teacher support to their faculty along the way.
