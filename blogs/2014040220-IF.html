<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id709306030?mt=8">IF…"</a>, is a free, iPad-based game that hopes to encourage young (ages 6-12) players to develop and strengthen social and emotional life skills. Unlike the proliferation of STEM-focused games centered on gaining mastery in a discrete academic domain, IF… strives to broadly strengthen social and emotional learning (SEL) skills. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_if.htm">Rudyard Kipling poem of the same name</a>, IF… places a unique focus on personal development and encourages children to learn how to process and deal with their emotions, through role playing in an imaginary town called Greenberry.  Players choose between a cat or a dog avatar to represent them in the game.  Players are then expected to interact with one another and deal with the resulting conflict (even tragedy) as the classic conflict between cats and dogs unfolds. Virtual counseling sessions that adapt to game play are incorporated as well to further support SEL development. The game is the brainchild of <a href=" http://www.ifyoucan.org/">If You Can Games</a> and digital gaming legend, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_Hawkins">Trip Hawkins</a>. For more on Hawkins read <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/1478">this NLT Profile piece.</a>
<p>
<b>Pros:</b><br>
It is this unique combination of encouraging the development of social skills paired with massively addictive game dynamics that just might make IF… a truly valuable addition to the learning games field. Join this unique focus on SEL skills with the ability for educators and parents to track how users interact with the game and adapt content accordingly, and you have a recipe for a learning legend. Another exciting element of this game is the fact that the chief learning officer and board of advisors have deep learning and counseling experience and are able to assess player competence against SEL benchmarks and goals established by the group. This skill set is often lacking in many educational application teams. 
<p>
<b>Cons:</b><br>
Despite an impressive roster of talent leading the development of IF…, it remains to be seen if the game will really help children learn to manage their emotions and develop a sense of empathy and persistence while collaborating with others. However, if IF… (ahem) is successful, the potential to develop and explore this field will be immense.  
<p>
<b>Our Takeaway:</b><br>
Beyond navigating the world of Greenberry while dealing with interpersonal conflict, IF players must develop ways to interact that are beneficial to the wider community.  Additionally, through adaptive game play and virtual community-based coaching, Hawkins and his team at If You Can Games hopes players will gain SEL proficiency and, on a broader scale, transform the learning game landscape. Deeply embedded in this experience are If You Can algorithms working behind the scenes to assess player competence against SEL benchmarks and goals established by the group. Additionally, parents can access a dashboard of data outlining how players progress through the game and gain mastery of SEL skills. It is this focus on emotional intelligence, and not just Common Core-based subject areas, that helps set IF… apart from the learning pack. 
<p>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b><br>
Combining the expertise of video game veterans with social and emotional learning experts, IF… has real potential to have a positive impact in the learning games arena and greatly expand our ideas about what games are capable of accomplishing.
