<p><i>"Cameras have enormous social appeal—how can we leverage that appeal to have a broader social impact? That was the genesis of the Bigshot project, where I was thinking we should redesign the camera. Young kids can learn the underlying technology—that is the science part of it. But also after that is done, it can be used to create art. The art of photography is documentation and storytelling—and we want to have an impact on the way people capture and manipulate and interact with visual information."</i> (Dr. Shree Nayar, head of <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/">CAVE Laboratory at Columbia University</a> and <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/experience">Bigshot</a>)</p>

<p><b>Intersection of Design & Technology</b><br>
Creativity, like abstract scientific knowledge, doesn’t foster innovation on its own. But when creative ideas are backed by an understanding of science and math concepts, inventiveness is a real possibility. </p>

<p>This idea—that science, math, and the arts are a connected and necessary part of innovation—is at the heart of <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/">Bigshot</a>. Developed by Columbia University’s <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nayar/">Shree Nayar</a>, Bigshot is both a digital camera and a learning experience. Nayar designed the kit, which includes elements like a hand-crank power generator and electromagnetics, to pack in as many scientific concepts as possible; as a result, Bigshot delivers a broad range of science and engineering concepts. Additionally, the Bigshot website provides a variety of <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/fun/buildables/index">simple science projects</a>, <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/learn">conceptual explanations and interactive demos</a>, and <a href=" http://www.bigshotcamera.com/teach">lessons</a> for teachers and learners alike. </p>

<p>Assembling the Bigshot kit delivers a finished, fully functioning product: a digital camera. Because it is a digital camera, it’s even possible to design a one-day workshop around the kit to allow students to assemble the camera, take photographs, and share in each other’s creations immediately—a process that would take far longer, and present fewer scientific concepts, with something like a pinhole camera. </p>

 <p><b>Learn, Create, Express</b><br>
In one sense, the camera is the lure to draw in users who are then exposed to a variety of science and engineering components. But the camera itself also enables other aspects of learning, such as creation and self-expression. Bigshot-wielders can explore their creative potential as photographers and experiment with panoramic and 3D photography, as well as more traditional elements of lighting and composition. Photography also offers the opportunity to document users’ own lives and communities—promoting cultural diversity is not just a side effect, but in fact a goal of the <a href="http://www.bigshotcamera.com/about/bigshots4good">Bigshots for Good</a> program targeting under-served communities.  To this end, Bigshot is poised to bring <a href="http://stemtosteam.org/">STEAM</a> to a wide range of learners.</p>
