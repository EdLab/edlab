<p>While the advent of online university courses has provided important opportunities to a demographic that lacks access to college campuses, the impersonal aspect of remote learning is something that drives many students away. With online learning comes an expressed concern by students and instructors alike that staring inactively at a screen can lead to a lack of engagement.</p>

<p>However, Michigan State University has recently developed a new way to inject excitement into online learning through the implementation of telepresent robots, or "robot-learning." A twist on the traditional videoconference, these courses allow students to experience a class through the perspective of a robot stand-inâ€“a machine with a mounted video screen that students can position anywhere in the class and adjust to better interact with their instructor. Research reveals that this method increases interaction and engagement with remote students and improves the sense of connection between these students and their instructor.</p>

<p>Do you think online learning will ever replace in-person university learning? Join the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41720">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion: </i></p>

<p><b>@00:28 Buster Wainwright:</b> I think there's a place for this technology in business but not in schools because so much of learning is about group participation which in an of itself teaches tolerance among other things. The problem with these types of technologies is they they create too much distance in an increasingly distant world.</p>

<p><b>@0:35 Dyranda:</b> I like this technology very much, it creates access for distance learners who really suffer from not being able to fully participate in group discussions etc., but I wouldn't want to see it become the norm.</p>

<p><b>@2:05 Ryan Allen:</b> This reminds me of a more sophisticated version of this <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/40528">distance learning program</a> designed for a student who had cancer and could not attend school anymore. More innovations like this are welcome.</p>
