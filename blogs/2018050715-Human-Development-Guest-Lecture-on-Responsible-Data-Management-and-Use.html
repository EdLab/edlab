          <p>
            <p>I attended a guest lecture on responsible data management and use. <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/k.sijtsma/">Dr. Klass Sijtsma</a> is a full professor of methodology and statistics at Tilburg University, Netherlands. He is also a former dean of the school of social and behavioral sciences at the same university. His lecture addressed the main problems - fraudulent and falsified research; and questionable research practices.</p><p><br /></p><p>Several years ago, a series of scientific misconducts were discovered at Tilburg. Diederik Stapel, a social psychologist who was dean of the school of social and behavioral sciences at that time, was found fabricating and falsifying research data for over 15 years. The magnitude and impact of the event was enormous. Dr. Sijtsma was appointed into a committee to investigate this issue. He shared his thoughts on the event. More importantly, he advocates for a more transparent research data policy that would hopefully prevent similar events from happening.</p><p><br /></p><p>He then focused majority of the lecture on questionable research practices (QRPs). Compared to the fraudulent and falsified research, QRPs are more common and arguably have worse impact. Researchers engaged in QRPs are often unaware. Dr. Sijtsma then gave some examples of the QRPs. One of the commonly seen QRP is to continue to collect data until the result is significant. The researchers test their hypothesis. If the result is not significant, they continue to collect data and repeat the process until they find significance.</p><p><br /></p><p>Intuition plays an important role in problem solving. There are two kinds of intuitions - experience based and heuristics based. An expert builds up his intuition from experiences and can often recognize the difficulty of the problem. On the other hand, A novice often base their intuition on heuristics which would often lead to wrong solutions. Dr. Sijtsma gave some examples. One problem is the famous exponential growth problem - how many times do you need to fold a piece of 1 cm thick newspaper to reach the moon? An expert would recognize that this is an exponential growth problem and the answer is probably counter-intuitive. So think carefully. But an novice might think that the moon is really far and the number of folds is probably large.</p><p><br /></p><p>Acquiring expert intuition requires a lot of work. It is unreasonable to expect all researchers to have expertise in statistics nor it is necessary. Building an environment where researchers can collaborate with statisticians and meteorologists is important. </p>
