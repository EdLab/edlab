          <p>
            This year's presidential campaign has been sometimes described as a circus. Donald Trump, who remains the frontrunner for the Republican party, often flaunts his business success during speeches and debates. 

However, he has yet to boast of his educational endeavor, Trump University. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/us/donald-trump-marco-rubio-trump-university.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Feducation&action=click&contentCollection=education&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0">New York Times</a> report indicate that Mr. Trump might have established a "fake school" with the goal of educating students to become successful real estate developers. Students registered for online courses and paid thousands of dollars. The school used a series of seminars to teach students how to become a real estate mogul like Trump.

There are currently a couple of lawsuits against Trump by individuals former students of his for-profit university. New York state has also filed a suit against this non-existing university on the basis that its main objective was to persuade people to enroll in seminars that were run by motivational speakers to get students to register for more seminars. I am sure as Trump's gets closer and eventually seal the Republican nominee, this issue might become a major headache.
