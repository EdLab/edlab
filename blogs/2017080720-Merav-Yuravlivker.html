Merav Yuravlivker is the Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of <a href="https://datasociety.co/">Data Society</a>. She has over 10 years of experience in instructional design, training, and teaching. Yuravlivker has helped bring new insights to businesses that spur them forward through implementing data analytics strategies and training. She manages all product development and instructional design for Data Society and heads all consulting projects related to the education sector. Yuravlivker is passionate about increasing data science knowledge from the executive to the analyst level.</p>

<p><b>How did your education and previous professional experience shape your current work at Data Society?</b><br>
<p>I had an unconventional path into the world of data analytics. My undergraduate degree from McGill University was in psychology and sociology. After graduation, I was accepted into the Teach for America program and taught in high-need areas for a few years while I earned my master's degree in education. After my time in the classroom, I started working at the International Baccalaureate Organization in online training and recruitment. Throughout my career, I've always used data to track student performance and adjust my initiatives and decisions. When I started spending more time in professional settings, I noticed that there was a gap between the amount of data we had and the number of people who knew how to use it.</p>

<p>My co-founder and I started Data Society in 2014 because we saw a need for data science training for the professional education market. Data science was not the buzzword it is today, but data was becoming more ubiquitous and most professionals didn't have time or money to go back to school. So we created the first online learning platform that catered to professionals without a background in math or programming so they could pick up the data skills they needed in a short amount of time. All of my experience in education, both in the classroom and outside of it, prepared me to build an online learning management system that is educationally sound with materials that are designed with the best teaching practices. We blend the best educational techniques with powerful data science methods to bring robust and applicable training to people who need it to accelerate their careers.</p>

<p>Our high quality content underlies our success: we've received numerous awards for our content and platform, and were listed on Forbes as one of the EdTech companies to watch for in 2017. We have students in over 20 countries and consistently deliver corporate training to international organizations, defense contractors, and government agencies.</p>
 
<p><b>How do you hope your work at Data Society will encourage individuals to pursue training in data science?</b><br>
<p>I hope our work at Data Society will help more people understand that data science is a way of using numbers to look at the relationships between all the people and things around us. We work hard to demystify data science; we break down intimidating terms into everyday language with real use cases and concrete examples. Because of the way we teach data science, we've heard from many students who have been able to overcome any trepidation they initially had to go on and build a career in data analytics.</p>

<p>I think of work we do as a catalyst to help individuals move their careers and their industries forward by optimizing operations and finding new insights and patterns they weren't able to see before.</p> 

<p><b>What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead?</b><br>
<p>We've seen an explosion of online learning for professionals in the past few years. I think that as the needs in the workplace evolve, we will see less of an emphasis placed on certifications and degrees and more of an interest in past experience and projects. Many talented data scientists are self-taught, and a lot of employers are now asking for a portfolio of projects or a GitHub account as proof of competence and capability. It will become more important for professionals in the field to be able to demonstrate their knowledge through these types of real world projects.</p>

<p><b>What has been the response from students who have used Data Society?</b><br>
<p>We have received amazing feedback from students who have told us that we've given them the skills and the confidence to pursue a new career or accelerate the work they're doing. Some of our students have used our courses as leverage to go from front desk assistants to professional analysts. We've had students tell us that our courses are more meaningful and relevant to them than their university program, and that we provide the frameworks students need to implement data science.</p>

<p>One of my favorite student encounters was in a corporate sales meeting. We were discussing the types of trainings that would best fit this Fortune 500 company's objectives, and the Director of Communications walked in. She introduced herself and said that our platform and courses were key to her getting the Director position she has now. It's this type of story and validation that keeps our mission front of mind and illustrates the difference that we can make by teaching data science skills. I wish we could bring her to all of our client meetings!</p>
 
<p><b>Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?</b><br>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">Hadley Wickham</a> is one of the most prominent players in the R programming and data visualization space; the amazing visualizations that you can create easily and flexibly are largely due to his work in making it accessible to everyone. I also enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci">Renee Teate's</a> feed as she provides great insights about data science and recommends resources for the community. Last but not least, <a href="https://twitter.com/datadotworld">data.world</a> is a great company out of Austin that is passionate about building a social network for data people. They have an amazing repository of datasets and are working on making it easier to collaborate and find new insights from data.</p>
