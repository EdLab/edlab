<p>Past research reports have described the positive impact of iPads on student enjoyment and motivation. The researchers in this study sought to add the first person perspectives of teachers and students to the discussion of whether and how iPads can help children learn to write.</p>

<p>The researchers worked with six teachers and classes in six different schools in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland. The study involved observation of each teacherâ€™s writing lesson involving iPads, as well as interviews with teachers and small groups of students. The interviews asked teachers and students about their perceptions of whether and how the iPads helped them learn to write.</p>
 
<p>Teachers and students in all schools agreed that the iPads made learning to write more fun, engaging, and creative. Students enjoyed having the ability to add images and sounds to their stories, and teachers appreciated how the iPads engaged even reluctant writers and made writing accessible to students of all levels. Both teachers and students also commented on how the spell check function of the writing apps helped them notice errors and improve their spelling.</p>
 
<p>While the results of this research reflect a positive perception of iPads in the classroom, both teachers and students who participated in the study also mentioned the continued relevance of writing with pencil and paper. While it may not be as fun, they acknowledged the importance of writing on paper for developing handwriting and other skills.</p>

<p>This study suggests that incorporating iPads into early childhood classrooms can help increase student engagement in learning to write. However, the study did not examine whether iPad apps were more effective than pencil and paper for developing writing skills. More research must be done to measure the learning that happens through iPad apps in order to ensure that educators do not unwittingly disregard learning gains for the sake of student enjoyment.</p>
