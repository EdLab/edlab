            When a college student cannot register for a required class, they have immediate concerns about their academic career.  Well, for-profit colleges have heard these concerns, and now they are offering a solution. 
<!--break-->
Today the NY Times printed an interesting article about how a For-Profit college  is helping California Community College students who need certain classes.  Students at community colleges in California who are unable to take a class at their school can take it at Kaplan University, for a much more expensive price.

For-Profit colleges are educational institutions run by private companies or corporations.  They have been in the news recently regarding funding and concerns about student success after graduating.

At first, it may seem a little contradictory for more expensive colleges to grow during a time of economic recession.  But due to current budget restrictions in California, classes and services are being cut.  For-Profit colleges have seen this and have offered an alternative. 

It will be interesting to see how other for-profit college models develop along with Kaplan University and continue to find places to grow.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/education/24profit.html?ref=education">Here is the NYTimes article</a>.

Thoughts on the “For Profit” college venture?  Has this move been a smart one both to generate money and develop online education?  What does it mean to get a degree from a for-profit venture as opposed to a public university?    Do online for profit programs have a better future because of their monetary goals?  Or is there a contradiction between the words "for-profit" and "education?"

Debate away.
