<p><b>Quote From O’Reilly’s Twitter Account:</b></p>
<p><i>O'Reilly Media spreads the knowledge of innovators and expert early adopters to everyday users through books, conferences, news reportage, videos, and classes.</i>
</p>
<p><b>History and Backstory: Viva la OS Revolution</b></p>
<p>
Once radical, now highly relied-on, open-source software has become a part of our daily lives. At the helm of this movement towards a more open and free internet is O’Reilly Media and their annual <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012">Open Source Convention (OSCON)</a>. Now in its 14th year, the conference, which was recently held in Portland, attracts over 3,000 open source developers, businesses, investors and innovators from a wide-range of fields including education. The conference, which boasts over 200 speakers and countless opportunities for sharing knowledge and "freewheeling" impromptu conversations (there is even a "hallway track" dedicated to discussion & debate), was started by <a href=" http://radar.oreilly.com/tim">Tim O’Reilly</a>, the open source pioneer and publishing scion, with a mission to help push-forward a more collaborative, inexpensive and transparent web.</p>
<p>
<b>Current Focus: OS Power to the People</b></p>
<p>
Initially focused on disruption and revolution, the new direction for the conference is to explore and support successful open source partnerships and adoption in the business sector. One need only glimpse at the long list of corporate sponsors (Google, Amazon, HP & many more) to see that businesses increasingly are including open source technologies.  This year’s roster of presenters is representative of this corporate move towards open source, with speakers from Cisco, Oracle and Boeing heading sessions ranging from <a href= "http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23112"> "It’s Not Our Code, But It Is Our Product!"</a> to a session called, "Living with Open Source Software."  </p>
<p>
<b>How is this changing life and learning as we know it?</b></p>
<p>
Not only are Fortune 500’s, joining startups to power their back-ends with OS technologies like HTML5, Python, Django and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby-on-Rails</a>, but the average citizen blogger and educator is relying more and more on free, open-source tools, mobile platforms and cloud storage. If you plan to start a revolution in any sense, chances are good that you will reach out to your constituents through an OS-powered platform. No longer just powering the tools and applications that helped start the early internet revolution, OS is now the mode for creating actual revolution in work, education and daily life.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of any O’Reilly event is to encourage learning by providing free opportunities to gain, share and build upon new knowledge. This is especially true for the technology community but also for other peripheral subject areas, including education. Through workshops, lectures and the now classic <a href=" http://shop.oreilly.com/category/new.do">O’Reilly Guides </a>, attendees and open source acolytes not in attendance, are able to move their own tech skills forward at an accelerated rate and completely bypass traditional, additional schooling. OSCON is the epitome of both a radical decentralization of business-as-usual software development and an innovative, bottom-up approach to knowledge transfer. This model of both providing resources to create innovation and the ideal setting for these ideas to flourish, is a working example for future open collaborative learning environments. Break-out sessions optional. </p>
