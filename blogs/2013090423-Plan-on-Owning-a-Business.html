            There are many pros and cons when it comes to owning a business. Yes, you are financially stable if your business is doing well. That must mean you spend 10+ hours a day working, less vacations and worrying about who to hire, and many other responsibilities. Then again the time you do have off you enjoy it, due to the fact that one can afford a wonderful vacation. So the question that many people in my business class asked themselves was " Do I want to own a business, or would I rather work for someone who does? "  

<blockquote> 
The Cons (or what I would call the Pains of Entrepreneurship):

1. Problems. Fires, floods, suppliers not performing, employee screw-ups, your own screw-ups, machine failures, leaking roofs, car accidents, recessions, great recessions, bad checks, bad receivables, bad people, market shifts, workers  compensation claims, more of your own screw-ups, health insurance increases, new competition, theft, more screw-ups. (I'm getting depressed just thinking about it.)

2. Losses. This could be from business that drops off for some reason, or from new products or services that just don't sell, or from increased costs, law suits, or any number of things. (Now I am depressed)..........

This <a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/do-you-really-want-to-be-a-business-owner/">article</a> shows more cons, as well as pros of owning your own business. 

I'm majoring in criminal justice, but I want to get a feel of what a business class is like. I didn't know what to expect, but I am enjoying this class so far. This question was very hard for me to answer. Yes I do want to make money, but I also want to like what I am doing. 

A business owner has the most responsibilities in the office. With all those responsibilities, would you still want to own a business, or work for someone who does?
