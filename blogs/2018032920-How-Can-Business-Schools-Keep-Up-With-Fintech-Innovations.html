<p>The financial services industry is ripe for innovative breakthroughs that will disrupt the entire sector. New technologies like blockchain, mobile banking, big data, and machine learning are on the cusp of completely altering the way that we do business. These growing innovations in the sector are known as fintech, a portmanteau of <i>finance</i> and <i>technology</i>. Because this industry is going through such a rapid transformation, educators, especially those at business schools and MBA programs, must keep up with the breakneck pace of innovation.</p>  

<p>Some of the best programs in the world are at the forefront of addressing the educational challenges and opportunities brought on by developments in fintech. Glenn Hubbard, Dean of Columbia Universityâ€™s Business School, says that students need to learn flexibility so that they can adapt to the rapidly changing sector. Even people in business who are already successful will need to understand these new insights, which are the focus of the tech-heavy program at Imperial College London. </p> 

<p>Hubbard argues that educators must be the leaders in teaching and preparing for these changes, because businesses are more focused on competition, with little incentive to train would-be rivals. How can our education system prepare students for the future of fintech? Add your voice to the discussion <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/41863">on Vialogues</a>.</p>

<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion:</i></p>

<p><b>@01:01 Dyranda:</b> I wish they'd say how we can use this technology to help 'unbanked' people, whoever they are. I'm not saying that FinTech isn't important but preparing students for the future of FinTech starts at grade school with basic math and at home with pocket money and in early adult life with responsible saving budget balancing practices.</p>

<p><b>@02:45 Dallas Milanovich:</b> Good point about the need to be ahead of the curve. A big problem in education right now is that we're teaching kids technology that will be practically obsolete by the time they're adults, so we have to be focused on preparing them for what lies ahead.</p>
