<p>Rapid technological development is changing the face of education. New learning tools and methods of instruction offer innovation, but do they always contribute to better learning? Educational researcher Rika Swanzen recently crafted a report that considers effective teaching techniques in light of the characteristics of two generations of learners: Generation Y and Generation Z. She posits that considering the cultural influences on and expectations of young students can offer insight into which learning approaches will be effective for them and why.</p>
 
<p>Swanzen draws on both academic research and video sources such as TED Talks to draw out the salient characteristics of Generations Y and Z. Generation Y, commonly known as Millenials, experienced the rise of the internet and novel modes of communication during their formative years in the 1990s and 2000s. As students, they expect teachers to incorporate technology into lessons and to be available for support 24/7, and they value collaboration and relevant curricula. Students belonging to Generation Z, born roughly between 1994 and 2012, display similar learning expectations when it comes to technology. However, the generations do have some differences. Swanzen describes Generation Y as tech savvy, while Generation Z is tech innate. These younger students grew up in an age of digital globalization, which has contributed to their increased appreciation of diversity and connectedness, and has also taught them to be more cautious with technology than their older peers. While Generation Y shows a tendency toward radical transparency and sharing online, members of Generation Z, who have witnessed the rise of cyberbullying, tend to be more cautious about what they share digitally. Both generations value global connectivity and the relation of education to real-life situations.</p>
 
<p>After relating these findings about generational differences, Swanzen suggests educational techniques that respond to the characteristics and expectations of young students. When employing technology in the classroom, she argues, a tool’s novelty or capacity is not enough; teachers must look at the value it offers for meeting students’ learning needs. For example, she considers the incorporation of online experiences through blended learning to be insufficient for successful pedagogy. While drawing on multiple modalities does cater to students’ comfort with digital information, teachers must intentionally cultivate collaboration and self-awareness in order to encourage holistic learning according to this generation’s learning preferences. Swanzen cautions educators to avoid the danger of neglecting nurturing and intentional learning in favor of the mere transfer of information, especially when using technology in the classroom.</p>

<p>The dialogue Swanzen cultivates between generational characteristics and learning techniques highlights the importance of considering whether and how new technologies and pedagogies promote learning for students today.</p>
