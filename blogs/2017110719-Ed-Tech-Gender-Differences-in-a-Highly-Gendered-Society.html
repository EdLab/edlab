<p>Saudi Arabia is one of the most gender segregated societies in the world. The nation’s education system is no different, as the sexes are completely separated for schooling. The scholars in this research wanted to explore the differences between how male and female teachers in this highly gendered environment use information and communication technology (ICT) in the classroom.</p>
 
<p>The research relies on a survey of 710 total teachers (232 male, 478 female) in the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The survey focused on indicators of education and technology, such as ICT hardware in the classroom, daily use of ICT, download and upload habits, personal use of ICT items, email for development of teaching materials, ICT-related coursework, and professional development courses. </p>  

<p>The researchers first employed statistical tests to measure the differences for ICT usage between male and female teachers. In terms of daily usage frequency, the results suggest that female teachers use these technologies more than their male counterparts. It was also revealed that Saudi male teachers were statistically more likely to upload or download materials from the Internet, but female teachers were more likely to do this through direct connections using satellite educational resources.</p> 

<p>In more rigorous testing, the researchers found that less experienced male teachers with more educational technology training had higher daily usages of ICT for classroom purposes. This indicates that as male teachers gain more experience, they gain more confidence to use their own materials rather than ICT resources. For Saudi women, though, teachers with the least amount of technology training were most likely to use ICT on a daily basis. This counterintuitive result suggests that schools are attempting to nudge ICT usage for luddite female teachers. </p>

<p>The team believes that their research shows how technology can sometimes be used to break larger societal barriers. The female teachers in Riyadh navigate and collaborate online in ways that are impossible to do in person. The strict gender restrictions on Saudi female teachers put greater impetus on ICT usage for educational purposes, which are not necessary for their male counterparts.</p>
