Yesterday late afternoon Jo, Mason and I took a trip down to <a href="http://www.sof.edu/">School of the Future</a> in Gramercy.  It was an adventure from start to finish as the District 2 public school was both hosting a parent open house and at our moment of arrival, releasing their High School classes. We were definitely immediately IMMERSED in the NYC school experience from the first moment! 

We then met with 10th grade English teacher, Adam Kinory (who Kate first met at a #SharkTankEDU event) and Jim Chin, the school's tech integration specialist (see images below). After learning more about Jim and Adam's day-to-day experience and LONG history of teaching (combined they have over 70 years experience) we took Jim and Adam through an overview of Vialogues.com. Next, we explored possible ways for Adam to integrate Vialogues into his curriculum and shared relevant examples. Note: YouTube.com is blocked in their school, but, Vimeo is open.  

In the end Adam was both excited to use Vialogues with his classes after the Thanksgiving holiday and open to future collaborations and partnerships with our team. He was most excited to test uploading debate footage that his students record on their smartphones for critique. Also, he was interested in the idea of using Vialogues for self-reflection re: "reactions" to text students shoot and upload. Overall, a very positive and growth producing experience. It was especially helpful to get the inside scoop on NYC public school districts from Jim and to learn of Adam's early experiences in the classroom. 

<b>Finally, a BIG thank-you to Jo and Mason for Co-leading this adventure!!!!</b>
