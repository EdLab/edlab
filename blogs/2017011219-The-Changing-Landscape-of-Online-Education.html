<p>The student landscape of digital learning has undergone some serious changes in the last decade, including the sheer increase in volume of available online courses. Overall, the percentage of students taking at least one online course has increased from 5.9% in 2000 to 32.1% in 2012. Similarly, those enrolled in full-time online degree programs grew from 2.5% in 2000 to 8.5% in 2012.</p>
 
<p>While the numbers have increased, some of the most common characteristics of a student enrolled in online courses have remained the same. For example, students who are most likely to be enrolled in online courses have the highest opportunity costs for enrolling in a traditional 4-year institution, such as being full-time employees, parents, or married. In addition, although the percentage of minority students enrolled in online education has increased over the year, members of historically underrepresented groups are still less likely to be enrolled in online courses. The same is true for low-income students.</p>
 
<p>The percentage of American institutions that offer online education in some form has risen from 71.6% in 2002 to 86.5% in 2012. In addition, more than half of all higher education institutions offer fully online degree programs. Community colleges are at the top of the pack in this regard; by 2007, 97% of community colleges already offered online courses. As students enrolled at community colleges are more likely to be full-time employees, parents, and married than traditional 4-year college students, this statistic coincides with the typical characteristics of an online education student. The authors of this study also claim that public institutions are more likely to use online education to reach a wider range of students, whereas private ones are more likely to use online education to increase their profit.</p>
 
<p>Online education provides a platform for nontraditional students with time and location constraints to take courses and complete degrees. Understanding the changing landscape of online learning will help academic officers, administrators, and students prepare for the future, where online education will continue to grow.</p>
