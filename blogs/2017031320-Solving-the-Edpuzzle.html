<p><a href="https://edpuzzle.com">Edpuzzle</a> is a video platform that allows teachers to customize videos for their classes. The platform has several features that promise to increase student engagement in video viewing. Teachers can pull existing videos or add their own, create questions for students to answer as they watch, and track how much of a video each student viewed. Edpuzzle also allows teachers to edit videos by trimming video length or recording their own audio over videos. </p>
 
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<p>Edpuzzle could allow teachers to more easily shape their lessons around video content. The ability to pull videos from various sources, including YouTube, gives them a way to show video content within a contained platform without ads or other distractions. Teachers are able to set up classes to easily sort videos for their students. As quizzes can be embedded within videos, teachers are able to tie video content directly to assessment. Another advantage of Edpuzzle is that students can watch videos on their own devices. </p>
 
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<p>Given its requirement for each student to setup an account, Edpuzzle seems to be built for students to watch videos individually. This might prevent students from working together to benefit from group discussion around video content. The platform would likely require students to wear headphones in the classroom, imposing an additional barrier to viewing video content. Finally, Edpuzzle doesnâ€™t provide many benefits for students aside from possibly varying the content their teachers use in classroom lessons. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Takeaway:</b></p>
<p>The ability to assess students understanding of video content as they watch could be useful for teachers. While the app provides interesting features to change how students watch videos, it works best when used individually so would be best used for homework rather than classroom activities.  </p>
