<p>They scream, vomit, and even bleed. These are the characteristics of a robot that might repel most people, but at the University of Michigan and 87% of nursing schools in the United States, this is exactly the type of birth-simulating robot they need to improve medical education.</p>
 
<p>With zero room for error in hospitals, clinical simulations have grown more popular. Thanks to high-fidelity mannequins, the experience of nursing school is more realistic than ever before. High-fidelity mannequins are able to emulate human experiences and respond to medical treatment. These life-like human models are computer enhanced, operate via wifi, and can breathe, talk, and panic just like real hospital patients. Something about their appearance might make your skin crawl, but in the end there are real life-saving advantages to use in the curriculum. In addition to nursing schools, several other medical programs have adopted the mannequins.</p>

<p> Research studies show that nursing students who use the mannequins before entering hospitals are more confident. What advantages do you see in implementing this type of experiential learning? Join the conversation <a href="https://vialogues.com/vialogues/play/30910/">on Vialogues</a>.</p>
 
<p><i>Excerpts from the discussion</i></p>
 
<p><b>@00:59 RuthS:</b> This seems like a practical use of technology in a simulation setting. I wonder if there are mannequins that give birth in different ways to prepare nurses for all kinds of situations.</p>
 
<p><b>@01:18 Brad.Fry:</b> I think that using realistic props like this could be a good way to introduce hospital protocol to medical students. However, I don't think anything can replace seeing the real thing. I hope students are still sitting in on real births because the "real thing" is the best preparation.</p>
